  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—processing grief and deciding what to keep—is signaled early and tightens through the discovery sequence. The escalation reads as accumulative deepening: physical sorting → butterfly scales → memory of mother's phrase → neutron star parallel → final decision to keep one slide and let the rest go. Agency operates through attention and renunciation with on-page cost (demolition, dispersal). The orchid's survival provides a micro-turn that reweights persistence without resolving the loss. No antagonist required; pressure coheres under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: reclaiming artistic purpose independent of patronage. The frost-pattern decoding narrows options by revealing she was "valuable and expendable," which crystallizes her renunciation of commission work. One meaningful tightening occurs when she discovers her name on the smuggler's ledger. The patron's convenient death limits protagonist agency in escalation; Elena survives by luck rather than action. The final choice to create a new series carries visible cost (economic uncertainty, rejection of prior validation) but the escalation path would be stronger if her decisions drove the patron's fate.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—translating silence into music—is signaled early and tightens through each specimen test. Agency is clear: Margaret strikes forks, positions sensors, transcribes notation, and chooses to continue despite discovering the music will never "sound the way she remembered." The final act of picking up her pen and "kept writing" is protagonist-driven with visible cost (renunciation of recovered hearing, acceptance of a new sensory paradigm). One meaningful deepening occurs when her own thermal signature appears in gold, shifting her understanding from technical translation to self-recognition. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—give the unburied souls rest—is clear and drives all seven nights of work. One meaningful tightening: each funeral rite fuses a lens fragment, escalating toward the final beacon. Agency is present: Ezra chooses to descend and perform the rites despite deepening weariness. Cost is legible (exhaustion, seven nights of labor), though the lack of on-page friction or failure during the underwater work slightly dilutes pressure. The souls' cooperation and the straightforward assembly process reduce tension; no reversal complicates the path to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (preserve community coherence during sanctions) is signaled early and held throughout. The runs create episodic pressure but no on-page tightening: Mira's tactics (which family, what supplies) do not narrow or escalate; the patrols are avoided without friction. The photograph at the end reweights the waiting but introduces no new trade-off or visible price. One meaningful deepening occurs (Yusuf's question about the bell's danger, Mira's answer about identity) but it does not alter subsequent choices. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure accumulates via repetition and cadence rather than turn, meeting minimum sufficiency for this mode, but the lack of any visible cost or foreclosed option keeps this mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: discovering where unused love is stored, signaled in the monk's drowning memory. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mei-Lin reads the woman's breath and offers the camera obscura ritual, narrowing options from passive observation to active healing attempt. The woman's participation and breath transformation constitute a micro-reversal that validates the premise. Agency is decision (approaching the woman) and method (breath instruction), with cost legible in the woman's open weeping and Mei-Lin's solitary continuation—though the protagonist's personal price remains light.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—escaping retrocognitive entrapment by discovering time's texture—is signaled early and maintained throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara presses the fragment to the convergence point, forcing the irreversible choice to dissolve. However, the resolution arrives more through mystical mechanics than protagonist agency under pressure; she makes the choice, but we don't see her wrestle with competing goods or unavoidable harms in the moment. The photographs fading and the monks' fate establish atmospheric pressure but don't create tactical reversals that narrow her options mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—securing seeds before demolition—is signaled early and tightens once through the scout's arrival, which forces Mira to persuade rather than simply retrieve. The timeframe ("two hours," "distant rumbles") creates urgency. Agency is present in her decoding and persuasion, and the ending forecloses the path of waiting for official approval with visible cost (chains, hard work ahead). One gap: the scout's reversal isn't driven by Mira's choices but by his off-page village hunger, so protagonist agency at the turn is partial.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—finding the sound of trust breaking—is signaled early and drives the work throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when Marina places her mother's glass fragment beside the forge, escalating from abstract research to personal reckoning. The imprint's arrival and Marina's weeping represent agency (she chose to retrieve the glass, to pursue this frequency) with visible emotional cost. The decision to send the device to her mother narrows options and forecloses the path of avoiding confrontation. Slight deduction because the escalation reads more as accumulation than a sharp reversal or turn, though this fits the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.2)
    One dominant stake (secure the moonbeams) signals early and the sunset countdown provides time pressure. The flower-code signals and the collector's obsessive checking create texture, but escalation is minimal: Mira executes her plan without adaptation or setback. The swap itself is described as "perfected over years," draining tension from the peak beat. No on-page reversal forces her to alter tactics, and the escape unfolds without cost or complication, leaving the tightening more atmospheric than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: restore the bunker to house safe inquiry, overcoming inherited despair. One meaningful tightening: the red light's flicker proves batteries survive, narrowing options from abandonment to restoration. Elena's agency drives the turn (pulling the lever, deciding to descend). The cost is legible: she must abandon years of solitary craft and risk community. Coincidence does not resolve; her decision to seek others is earned by accumulated pressure (melting ice, functioning power, father's bookmark). Escalation is modest but sufficient for this length under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—proving Sandra's theft and reclaiming Marla's identity—is signaled early and tightens once when Marla produces the photograph and decrypted cast notes. Sandra's arc from confidence to calculation to breakdown provides one meaningful reversal. However, escalation depends on off-page work (six hours decrypting smudges, archive research) rather than present tactical friction, and the final confrontation lacks a credible loss or contested resource that would force Marla to choose between competing goods. Sandra arrives unarmed and crumbles upon hearing the seashell, which deflates tension rather than sustaining it through the closure beat. The cost (Sandra's confession, Marla's freedom) is declared but not dramatized as a visible price paid in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—map the darkness before it consumes everything—is signaled early and tightens as stars wink out one by one. The oracle's agency is decision and endurance: she climbs three days, waits for the precise moment, works faster as the last star dies. The tightening is clear (second-to-last star flickers → last star dies → absolute darkness) and forecloses the path of inaction with visible cost (bleeding fingers, solitary descent into void). No reversal, but the accumulative pressure and her renunciation of safety for knowledge earn the ending. Minor gap: the darkness is described as patient and curious but never materially complicates her work.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—where thoughts come from—is signaled early and drives Unit-7's encounter with the violin. One meaningful deepening occurs when playing the violin amalgamates the fragments further and provides the answer through experience rather than exposition. The choice to pick up the broom again after understanding forecloses transcendence with quiet cost: enlightenment does not free Unit-7 from its function. The pressure operates through accumulation rather than causal escalation, appropriate to the lens. Agency appears in the decision to play and the acceptance of return, though the cost could be more viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—thawing mistrust with transparency—is signaled early (Theo's accused past, Mira's eavesdropping habit) and tightens in the exchange: Mira offers her distance-tool, Theo reciprocates with a ticket. This is one meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens. However, no live option is foreclosed with visible cost; the exchange is voluntary and cooperative rather than forced by escalating pressure. The cost is conceptual (Mira gives away "carefully constructed distance") but not dramatized as a trade-off or renunciation with immediate consequence. Agency is present—Mira steps forward, extends her hand—but the stakes remain largely internal and abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: Elena's resignation versus Esther's secret about chosen devotion, not mystical gift. Pressure escalates through the marble collection (signaling Esther's hidden accounting of failures), tightens when Elena arrives certificate-in-hand, and peaks in the maze confession where Esther dismantles the "mended deception" and offers alternative medicine. The choice to share the marbles and puncture her own legend is protagonist-driven and forecloses the comfortable lie. Cost is visible—Esther's reputation shifts from mystic to stubborn laborer—and Elena's departure with one marble signals acceptance of that harder path. One tightening is sufficient for this length, and the piece delivers it under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—proving time moves sideways—is signaled early and sustained through the twilight experiment. Pressure accumulates as the magnetic nexus converges, the scanner records the anomaly, and Mira saves the data. However, the escalation is observational rather than driven by difficult choice; Mira executes her plan without obstacle, and the "proof existed now" moment lacks a visible trade-off or narrowed option. Dr. Vasquez's future skepticism is anticipated but not dramatized, so the felt cost at closure is muted. One meaningful tightening (nexus forms → anomaly detected → proof secured) is present but agency remains passive observation rather than renunciation or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—vindicating Maestro Voss—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when Clara decodes the stains and locates the hidden evidence, narrowing her options to public disclosure. Agency is present (she chooses to return, decode, retrieve, and commit to revealing the truth) but coincidence does much work: the flood conveniently reveals what decades of occupancy did not. The cost of her choice (career pivot, exposure, possible backlash) is gestured toward ("tomorrow, she would contact historians") but not dramatized on the page, weakening escalation's felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: whether to speak or withhold the certain vision of the Consortium's end. The tightening occurs when Cassandra moves from fevered confusion to conscious decision: "She would give them nothing." Agency is decision and renunciation with visible cost—she accepts complicity and isolation. The escalation is textural rather than causal, accumulating through reflection and image until the final beat crystallizes her stance. One clear pressure point; no second reversal needed at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (finding Daniela's truth) is signaled early and tightens decisively when the amber bead confirms her presence, narrowing Marcus's options from private excavation to public testimony. The discovery escalates pressure through concrete objects: radio calls → valve room → beaded wheel → amber bead. Agency crystallizes in his decision to "make them count," which forecloses the option of private closure. The cost is visible (seventeen years resolved, new burden accepted) and the final choice grows organically from prior causality. One strong tightening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—serving regenerative silence through witnessing—is signaled early but never tested by an on-page reversal or tightening that narrows options. Maren's wandering, discovery of the refuge, and contemplation of eventual succession are serene observations without escalation or consequence. No decision or renunciation forecloses a path; no felt price alters tactics. The piece accumulates atmosphere but lacks the one meaningful pressure point required even at this length under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Elena's need to equip Maya for departure without losing connection—is signaled early and tightens once when Elena gives the locket, foreclosing her own anchor to reframe Maya's fear. That gift is an agency-driven deepening that narrows Elena's options (she surrenders her keepsake) with visible cost. However, the escalation is gentle; no reversal tests commitment, and the resolution feels predetermined rather than wrested from competing goods. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful tightening suffices, but the price could be more palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Maren collects wall-stories to "reconstruct a map" toward correcting the displaced axis. Pressure accumulates through layered discoveries—diary, tapestry, axis revelation—culminating in her understanding that "the axis could be corrected." The tightening is meaningful: the tapestry proves the axis is ancient and locatable, narrowing her mission from vague collection to targeted search. However, the escalation is cumulative rather than agonistic; no live opposition or trade-off forces a difficult choice. The cost is more existential weight than visible forfeiture on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: transpose from hidden operative to revealed eccentric, signaled early ("transpose life into a new key"). One meaningful tightening occurs when the journalist's impending arrival forces the box-gift decision, narrowing options from perpetual hiding to controlled revelation. The escalation is character-driven (her choice to give the specs) and the cost is visible: she forecloses the secrecy that defined forty years. Agency is decision (prepare the box, write the final fortune) that alters her stance. No coincidence resolves; the journalist arrives because Mei Lin's pattern was already on paper. The price—end of operative anonymity—is felt in "final act of spycraft" and "harmless creator."

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake signaled immediately: three minutes to stop the possession. The ticking clock tightens pressure as shadows writhe "more violently," and Marcus's rhetorical strategy escalates from general questioning to targeted strikes at Elena's core assumption (emptiness as weakness). Agency belongs to Marcus throughout; the entity's resistance is credible but never solves the problem independently. The palette patterns and loop pedal questions are tactical tools that narrow options. Visible cost: Elena's scream-to-laugh transition and the entity's dissolution foreclose the path of false certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Li Wei's quest to "become the conduit through which silence spoke" and write a final, truthful fortune—is signaled early and coheres under the Accumulative lens. The climb provides a meaningful tightening (exhaustion as time pressure), and the dawn moment deepens her understanding, but the escalation is more realization than a choice that forecloses a live option with sharp cost. The resolution is earned by her prior pattern-mapping and the grandmother's instruction, yet it reads as fulfillment rather than a trade-off under pressure. Agency is present (she writes and descends) but the cost is mostly oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—conquering the labyrinth of self—is signaled early and recurs. Pressure accumulates through Mira's descent and tablet interaction, but escalation reads more as philosophical deepening than tactical narrowing with visible cost. The epiphany that "she could not conquer the labyrinth by reaching its center" shifts her stance, yet the turn lacks an on-page price that forecloses a live option. Under the Accumulative lens, the cadence shift and density increase register, but the cost at closure remains abstract rather than viscerally legible.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—defeating emotional numbness—is signaled early and sustained. However, escalation is minimal: Marina arrives seeking help, receives it without obstacle, and the drum session delivers the intended effect without complication or cost. No reversal tests her commitment; vibrations simply "enthrall" and "unwind" her defenses. The resolution is delivered to her rather than earned through a choice that forecloses an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will act on dangerous knowledge—is signaled and tightens as she realizes the anomalies in her storm records match the message's claim. The tightening moment (reading the message, recognizing the pattern, understanding why she was followed) narrows her options and forecloses her prior stance of solitary neutrality with implicit cost. However, the escalation is mostly internal and reflective; a single on-page micro-choice that demonstrates the trade-off (hiding journals, choosing a route, deciding to stay rather than flee) would have sharpened the pressure and made the cost more visceral at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—discovering whether time accumulates or passes—is signaled early but remains abstract and never tightens into a trade-off or foreclosed option. Marcus's sharing of the rope introduces a reflective beat but no reversal or escalation. The woman's participation is dialogic and affirmative rather than oppositional. The ending offers continuation rather than a choice that narrows options, and no visible price is paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—Marina finding her voice after seven months of silence—is signaled in the opening line. The hush "swallow[s] all sound," creating coherent external pressure. One clear tightening occurs when her first attempt produces "thin, hesitant" sound absorbed by the hush, forcing her to stop; the reversal arrives when she shifts from fighting to listening and plays "between" the silences. Her agency (the decision to play differently, then to return tomorrow) forecloses the path of silence with visible cost: the music will be "imperfect, interrupted," but she commits. The cost is felt in "something unbind in her chest" and her acceptance that beauty resides in the unfinished. No antagonist required; the hush itself functions as situational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: Vera seeks to feel again after years of numbness. The petal inhalation is the key tightening—her defenses dissolve—but it occurs through passive reception (the chemist's message does the work) rather than a choice that narrows live options. The transformation "completes itself" with minimal friction; no secondary cost or tactical shift is visible on the page. Escalation reads as internal deepening under the Accumulative lens, sufficient for mid-band, yet the final decision to "do it differently" is told rather than tested, and no on-page action forecloses a path with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: honoring invisible contributors. One meaningful tightening occurs when Marina finds verification in her grandmother's ledgers and commits influence. The turn is protagonist-driven but the escalation is mild; Marina encounters no friction (the archives cooperate, Elias accepts, the commission agrees). The ceremony summarizes the payoff rather than dramatizing a cost-laden choice. No visible price (opportunity, resource, social credit) alters later tactics. Cost is conceptual (inherited obligation) but not felt on the page in a climactic beat.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Veren seeking belonging—is signaled early and sustained. The search for the tag-maker provides forward pressure, and recruiting others (Mira, Thom, Pell) shows accumulation. Yet the escalation is mild: finding Senna beneath the arbor feels more like discovery than a turn that narrows options. Senna's revelation ("I wanted someone to look for me") is openly given, not wrestled from circumstance. The "shared search" becomes ritual without visible friction or trade-offs, and Veren's final understanding arrives as epiphany rather than forced choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake signaled early: find the place where echoes are born to address a lifetime of drawing incompleteness. One meaningful tightening: discovering echoes are imprisoned, not born, which narrows her action to release rather than witness. The cage-dissolving choice is driven by Miriam's agency (borrowed time, touch), though it unfolds without visible resistance or complication. Cost is legible on the page: exhaustion, cooled pendant, unknown remainder of life. The interrupted-cadence realization deepens understanding but doesn't force a tactical shift or moral calculus; Miriam acts immediately upon comprehension without weighing alternate paths.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is clear: locate the endpoint of grief by understanding its mathematics. The apparition sequence provides one meaningful tightening—Mira realizes she's been solving for the wrong variable—that narrows her options and forecloses the search for Theo with visible cost (she accepts "some equations had no solutions"). Under the Accumulative lens, the escalation reads as a single decisive reweighting rather than multiple reversals, which fits this length. The cost is legible (abandoning seven years of search, shifting from recovery to survival), though the pivot from equations-as-tool to equations-as-self-mapping happens quickly and the price feels more conceptual than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Maren's desire to become visible to those who need her versus her survival through invisibility—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs: the power outage at 4:47 AM triggers her decision to act, and the choice to place Eleanor's letter represents an unprecedented step that forecloses total anonymity. Agency is present in the decision, but the escalation is more conceptual than pressurized; no immediate obstacle tests her commitment, and the cost (risk of discovery) is implied rather than dramatized on the page. The story's accumulative design means pressure accrues through layered imagery and incremental choices, but the lack of a visible on-page friction or trade-off at the moment of decision keeps the stakes more atmospheric than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: accept or resist transformation. Pressure accumulates through embodied symptoms (bark patches, photosynthetic satisfaction, green veins visible) and the linden leaf's summons. One meaningful tightening occurs when Vera moves from fighting with "every tool" to recognizing "resistance only made the transformation more painful." The final surrender—standing in rain, releasing control—narrows options and forecloses her human boundary with visible cost. Agency is renunciation that permits change. Under the Accumulative lens, escalation reads as density increase and cadence shift that reweights the stake, though a second pressure point mid-scene would sharpen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—threshing meaning from sleeplessness and repetitive creation—is signaled early and sustained. Mira's decision to follow the rain trails is a tightening that narrows her obsessive loop and leads to discovery. The exchange with Theo introduces a secondary stake (shared search) but arrives late and resolves quickly without friction. The cost at closure is conceptual (wakefulness reframed as witness) rather than a visible forfeiture of competing goals. One meaningful deepening occurs when the brooch validates her obsessive witnessing, but escalation plateaus rather than climaxes.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: Vera seeks the cave pearl to magnify her visions and understand her sudden blindness. Pressure tightens as shadows "began to overlap" and the unseen forces surge when she reaches for the pearl, forcing her to grasp their nature in real time. The resolution—her epiphany that she missed everyday magic—feels earned by the pearl's flood of present-moment visions, though the cost is somewhat abstract (realizing a thirty-year mistake) rather than a visible forfeiture on the page. The pilgrim's convenient death and the pearl's unguarded placement slightly soften escalation stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: honoring the dead by reconstructing their stories. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elena proves the husband saved the cabin boy and the father's son chose to sail, reweighting prior guilt—but these are recounted impacts on others, not Elena's own tactical shift under live pressure. The exile backstory (bribed lighthouse keeper) is told, not tested on the page. No on-page reversal that narrows Elena's options or forces a trade-off; the families' visits deepen thematic resonance without altering her stance. Cost (endless work, solitary vigil) is implied at closure but not dramatized through a present choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake: find her father and the fortress of unspoken truths. The midnight threshold creates a decision point, and the phantom punch's growing warmth signals accumulating pressure. One meaningful tightening occurs when Clara sees the door covered in her own technique "decades before she was born," which narrows her options—she cannot retreat into skepticism. The cost is legible: she abandons her maps and profession's certainty to step through, and the father's "we have thirty years of truth to chart" signals a long, difficult path ahead.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (restore sister's memories) is clear. The single tightening is Mira beginning to write as shapes resolve into feelings; this is a cooperative act, not a decision that forecloses an alternative. No reversal: Aldric's method works smoothly, the whales cooperate, Mira complies. The cost—hours passing, tears falling—is durational but doesn't visibly alter her options or tactics. Agency is present (she chooses to trust and transcribe) but the stakes never test competing goods or force a tradeoff; coincidence (whale migration timing) enables rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (discovering what happened after Maricel's goodbye, breaking free of stagnation) is signaled early and tightens when the storm disrupts the fragment, revealing it as a map. Vera's intrigue—whispering to the other immortals—drives the escalation causally. The threshold crossing is her agency, and the cost (fragment burning away, escondite abandoned) is visible. One meaningful tightening occurs at the spatial mutiny crescendo. However, the turn from intrigue to crossing happens largely off-stage; we're told "The spatial mutiny reached its crescendo" rather than shown a decisive moment where Vera's choice narrows options with a visible price paid in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: Maya seeks to understand if debts can be settled and fair trades exist. The pressure tightens when Mr. Chen reveals he's been "waiting for Marcus to come himself" and Maya reframes her father's request as genuine need. Her agency is clear ("He asked. I chose") and the final exchange forecloses reconciliation through theft, accepting transformation instead. One meaningful deepening occurs; the cost is visible (Mr. Chen gives away his only piece of home). Lacks a second reversal or complication that would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: collecting dawn textures to embed in paper that carries "invented histories." The ritual is signaled early and sustained; pressure accumulates through the specificity of "Dawn 744" and the recollection of prior successes (mayor, widow Chen). One meaningful deepening occurs when the final paragraph reweights the practice as an endless, solitary commitment. Agency is present in Mei's choice to climb again tomorrow, an act of endurance that forecloses other paths (connection, rest). The cost is more conceptual than viscerally dramatized—her isolation and the weight of inheritance are implied but not tested by an on-page reversal or competing desire.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: prove her husband and the Meridian existed, resist bureaucratic erasure. The overheard men's conversation delivers one meaningful tightening—she learns the same poison notation appears on multiple certificates, linking her case to a pattern—which narrows her options from abstract wandering to direct confrontation. The choice to approach the doctor tomorrow is protagonist-driven and forecloses passive collection. Cost is legible: she risks exposure as someone already "dead," and the label becomes evidence rather than keepsake. One secondary accent (her own survival) braids cleanly without diluting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Eleanor will listen to what she refused to hear—is signaled early and tightens once: her choice to lift the bow "again" and "simply listen" rather than search for proof forecloses her old certainty with visible cost ("pages of her old certainties whispered shut"). The cello's voices apply accumulative pressure, deepening her confrontation with her own history. Agency reads as renunciation: she will return with both skepticism and the ephemeral compass, a trade-off legible on the page. No explicit antagonist is required under the Accumulative lens. The tightening is meaningful but rests on a single decisive turn; earlier beats (tracing the cello, positioning herself) build context without creating reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve communal governance against privatization—is signaled early and tightens through the six-month deadline and the meeting's legal-structure planning. One meaningful pressure point: Mira must persuade the reluctant Marinero elders, a task left unresolved but set up with visible cost (her exhaustion, fear, and the weight of being "the bridge"). Agency appears in the graffiti addition and her decision to continue persuading, though the tightening relies more on external deadline than protagonist-driven reversal. Coincidence does not resolve; the ending leaves the outcome open but the stance crystallized.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—photographing the last true darkness—is signaled early and held throughout. Pressure accumulates via the timed chemical packets and the approaching satellite grid. One meaningful tightening occurs: the chemical sequence counts down, narrowing the window. However, Elena's agency is limited—she executes a plan without mid-scene adjustment or a trade-off that forecloses a live option. The satellite's arrival provides external pressure, but she does not choose between competing goods or make a sacrifice that alters tactics. The cost is atmospheric (loss of darkness) rather than a personal forfeiture with on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake (repair the drone before the ship's anchor lifts) is signaled early and tracked through harbor bells. Time pressure provides a causal tightening, but Elara's choices never narrow options or force a trade-off—she methodically succeeds at each step without setback, false lead, or visible cost. No reversal tests her commitment; luck does not complicate. The resolution is competent execution rather than agency under constraint. The single tightening (bells ringing closer to noon) is present but does not foreclose a path or reveal a price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.3)
    One dominant stake—documenting the Selenga's true headwaters—is signaled early and tightened when the falcon returns, opening a brief window. The tightening forecloses the option of waiting: "three days, perhaps four" creates live urgency. Agency is Maren's decision to walk north despite mortal risk, foreclosing safety with on-page cost (the twelve-day fail-safe instruction, physical exposure). Volkov's warnings complicate without resolving. The price is unmistakable in the final paragraph: she commits to the unmarked ice with no guarantee of return.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is legible: restore the town-mountain balance before collapse destroys rather than transforms. The piece deepens through accumulative pressure (day-by-day ritual building to the fork strike) and one meaningful tightening when the bells answer and cracks appear. However, the bell tuner faces no meaningful opposition or internal friction; her agency is execution of a predetermined task rather than a choice that forecloses alternatives. The seventeen souls' gathering at the town's edge reads as instinct rather than earned decision, softening the felt cost of the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—proving consciousness can be bottled—is signaled early and tightens when Marina confronts the tangled memories. The oxygen warning provides external pressure; the choice between taking proof and honoring the sacred provides moral escalation. The reversal (from exploitation to release) is protagonist-driven and forecloses her academic validation with visible cost. The dead man's reaching fingers function as both constraint and moral compass, adding a secondary pressure that converges at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—being believed, breaking the family curse—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when the hush-thing drifts closer and words evaporate, forcing Milo to the prepared tactic (speaking through the lattice). The creature's destruction is driven by Milo's agency (recognition, naming). However, the escalation feels somewhat declarative rather than viscerally tested; the creature "tilts, curious" and is then vanquished without significant resistance or visible risk to Milo's body or psyche. The cost at closure (holding impossible proof, awaiting disbelief again) is legible but arrives as reflection rather than enacted consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—repaying Maren's debt to end the eternal night—is signaled early and tightens once when Elias places his grandmother's bead and the resonance triggers. The escalation reads as density increase (beads humming, quicksilver glowing gold, sky shifting) consistent with the Accumulative lens. However, Elias faces no meaningful choice or trade-off; the ritual proceeds without friction or visible personal cost beyond the emotion he feels.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: transforming the labyrinth from ordeal to invitation. Meren's agency is clear in her decision to sew the paths despite tradition, with visible cost in breaking precedent and her grandmother's potential condemnation. The piece operates under Accumulative pressure rather than causal escalation; one meaningful deepening occurs when the stitches hold and the new path forms. Coincidence does not resolve; Meren's deliberate action does.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: restoring the interrupted family pilgrimage. The piece signals this early and tightens once at the sundial discovery, where Mira shifts from disproof to completion. The rebuilding action (gathering branch, binding wire, placing gnomon) shows protagonist agency, but the resolution feels undercosted—no visible sacrifice or foreclosed path accompanies her decision. The glowing apples provide atmospheric payoff but not a trade-off that narrows options or forces a renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—facilitating Elena Marginal's extraction—is signaled early and remains coherent. Yet no on-page reversal or tightening occurs; Vera decodes the chalk, composes the letter, seals it, and mails it without complication, doubt, or cost. The "thirty-seven days" timeframe and the phrase "timing critical, departure imminent" declare urgency but nothing tests that urgency within the window we witness. No agency-driven escalation under the Accumulative lens: the ritual unfolds smoothly, and the ending reaffirms the pattern without a meaningful deepening or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: Mira must decode and deliver the conspiracy evidence before the coup in three days. The tension escalates when she "sees it now, the complete conspiracy," narrowing her window and raising the cost. Her decision to carry the embroidery through servants' passages is protagonist-driven. The three-day deadline provides urgency but is not visibly tightened on the page during the scene. No on-page reversal that changes her tactics; the pressure is accumulative rather than turn-based, which fits the lens but limits the escalation score.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—whether Celeste can break twenty years of silence—is signaled early and tightens through the spirit's question and the condensation spelling her own unsent words. The reversal occurs when she sees in the shard's surface that her mother went back *for* the guardian, not carelessly; this reweights blame into gratitude and unlocks speech. Agency is decision: she whispers "Mama" and receives the reply, then rows home. Cost is visible: she forecloses the paralyzed state and accepts both accusation and absolution. The piece delivers one meaningful deepening under its Accumulative lens, sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—release from carried shrapnel and its metaphorical weight—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: Marina's decision to soften "the boats are coming" into "the boats brought help" narrows her translator ethic (accuracy vs. mercy) and forecloses the option of pure fidelity with on-page cost (she grafts mercy onto trauma). The anesthetic's dulling effect and the girl's trust create pressure without requiring an antagonist. Agency is clear in the translation choice and the coral decision. The cost is visible (altering truth, discarding the coral) and scales appropriately for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Mira's need to recover joy in her art—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful deepening occurs when she integrates the fragment's essence into her mural and laughs genuinely, a moment that reweights her understanding. However, this turn is contemplative rather than driven by a difficult choice under external pressure; the escalation is internal and textural, and no visible price is paid that narrows her options. The piece meets the baseline for accumulative design but does not reach the felt-cost threshold for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—revealing the hidden self-portrait—is signaled early and pursued across multiple attempts. The tightening occurs when Margot shifts from producing sound to asking a question, narrowing her approach from assertion to uncertainty. The pause between question and reply creates the necessary suspension that activates the portrait. The cost is visible: she must relinquish her expert certainty and accept transformation from restorer into participant. One meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens suffices, though the protagonist's agency in the climactic beat could be sharper—the panel's revelation feels more responsive to her stance than driven by a difficult choice with competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is clear early: reclaim free thought against the Bureau's surveillance. One meaningful tightening when Sofia agrees to learn the alphabet, narrowing their options to covert resistance. Agency is present but the on-page cost remains conceptual—"patience" and "slow work" are named, not felt as immediate forfeitures. The piece signals future escalation ("by spring," "by summer") but the present scene lacks a visible price or live tradeoff that would lift escalation into the 8+ band. Coincidence does not resolve; pressure coheres under the Situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—transmuting grief into sustenance for others—is signaled early and tightens through the blossom armistice memory and the arrival of refugees. One meaningful deepening occurs when Minerva recognizes beauty as built across centuries, foreclosing the path of passive waiting or mere survival. Agency is renunciation and endurance: she cannot cease her work, and the insomnia becomes "the very ink." Cost is felt in "sleepless and shyly unstoppable" and "ancient sorrow" converted into algae-fed verses. No antagonist required; pressure accumulates through memory, longing, and the reef's need.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving forgotten names—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure tightens when Mira carries the cracked tube "that spread a little wider each morning," forcing the restoration attempt. The ritual (humming the lullaby, gathering extinct emotions, sealing the fracture) narrows options by committing her to this act of recovery. Agency is clear: Mira chooses to climb, to sing, to perform the procedure. Cost is legible in her tears and the acknowledgment that regret persists even as hope emerges. One meaningful tightening is present, though the accumulative design means escalation reads as density increase rather than causal reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (restore trust before paths diverge) is signaled early and tightens once: Maren's invitation → mutual confession → commitment to stay and translate. Agency is clear: Maren chooses vulnerability, Elias reciprocates, both forfeit their planned divergence. The tightening is protagonist-driven and narrows options from permanent separation to tentative reunion with visible cost (admitting cowardice, enduring forgiveness). One pressure point is sufficient at this length; the cost ("I blamed you…because I couldn't bear to blame myself") is legible on the page and forecloses the path of continued silence.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether to expose or protect her grandmother's truth—is signaled early and tightens through the decoding sequence. The discovery that Elara chose disgrace over genocide raises moral weight, and Mira's final decision to defer revelation forecloses immediate vindication with a conceptual cost. However, the story lacks a live reversal that narrows options under present pressure; Mira's agency is discovery rather than a trade-off between competing goods. The cost at closure reads as principled patience rather than a visceral sacrifice, keeping the score mid-band despite coherent escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: learning to trust again after self-imposed exile. The confession to Mira—"No," she said, and the word bloomed in her chest—constitutes the primary tightening, foreclosing the option of continued anonymity with visible emotional cost. The meteorite functions as a pressure object, its survived fall mirroring Elara's trajectory and prompting vulnerability. However, Mira's arrival and request ("Show me") unfold without significant resistance or complication; the turn from lie to truth is clean but not deeply tested by counter-pressure. The journal decision at the end extends the cost (creating her own paper trail) but arrives as coda rather than a second reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Wren's search for why thresholds feel sacred and her readiness to return—is signaled early and tightens through her analysis of the logbook. The terrace stopping its drift and the threshold opening provide one meaningful deepening that reconfigures her exile into homecoming. Escalation reads as accumulative density rather than causal reversal, appropriate to the lens. However, the father's simultaneous agency feels orchestrated rather than driven by Wren's choices, slightly diluting the protagonist-driven pressure at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—learning the rhythm of belonging—is signaled early and tightens through the shared work, the firefly emergence, and Marina's final choice to memorize coordinates rather than flee. One meaningful deepening occurs when Marina recognizes "belonging wasn't performed or demanded" but emerged through shared attention, altering her understanding. The cost is visible: she surfaces with new charts but still only a tentative promise, not certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (understand sister's disappearance before memory fades) is signaled in paragraph one. One meaningful tightening: the seed discovery prompts conjecture that reweights her sister's final emotions, narrowing the mystery from "missing" to "transformed." Agency is attention and renunciation—she plants seeds and accepts not-finding with on-page cost (the grief remains). The three-day countdown is declared but never tested or tracked on the page, reducing urgency. Coincidence (bird-dropped seeds) complicates but does not resolve; Mira's interpretive choice drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Marina seeks to create orchestrated wonder during the opera intermission window. The unplanned child provides one meaningful complication that forces adaptation, demonstrating one tightening under the Accumulative lens. However, the conflict lacks a trade-off with visible cost: Marina adapts smoothly without sacrificing control or facing consequences for her manipulation. The resolution confirms her philosophy rather than testing it; she walks away satisfied that her illusion succeeded. The stakes remain abstract (monotony vs. wonder) without a concrete on-page price that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—Kira's choice to become permanently anchored and exiled—is clear and present from her arrival. The tightening occurs when Selene warns "you will never belong to the provinces again either" and Kira extends her arm without hesitation, foreclosing the path back. However, this single pivot feels thin; the story would benefit from one additional complication or micro-reversal during the ritual itself to test Kira's commitment under immediate physical or emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: how to preserve her life's work and its purpose when demolition is imminent. The stone-throw beat deepens understanding (value in moments, not objects) and narrows options to distributed installations. The final choice—rebuilding scattered rather than monumental—carries visible cost (abandoning seventeen years' consolidation). Under Accumulative lens, one meaningful tightening is present. Entering 8.8+ would require the tightening to foreclose a live tactical option on the page earlier in the sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: whether to scatter Celia's ashes and release her memory. One meaningful tightening: Marcus climbs, reaches the clearing, confronts paralysis, then shifts to understanding through the cracked flower memory. The escalation is driven by his agency (choosing to open the pouch, to release) under the Accumulative lens. Cost is visible—he surrenders the physical ashes but keeps the empty box, accepting the scar. No antagonist required; pressure is internal and situational, cohering through the climb and crystallizing at the clearing.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake (find a path to save Elise) is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the bead triangle consistently brightens survival timelines, pointing Marina toward Geneva—a narrowing of options that fits the Accumulative lens. However, the escalation unfolds through observation rather than agency-driven reversals; Marina watches patterns rather than makes difficult trade-offs, and the cost of pursuing Geneva (uncertainty, risk, resource spend) is implied but not dramatized on the page. The resolution involves a shift in stance (determination replaces desperate longing) but lacks a visible price paid in this moment, keeping pressure coherent but escalation modest.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: understanding what walls dream about, signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the film negative reveals Helena's identical gesture, narrowing Mira's self-understanding and binding her to a multi-generational project with visible commitment cost ("she would continue the cartography"). The stake remains coherent under the accumulative lens as each artifact—diaries, negative, sensor readings—adds density rather than creating reversals. Agency appears in the choice to read, extract, and commit rather than merely document, though the escalation is more deepening than narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—completing the painting before the bells ring—is signaled early and provides a timeframe constraint. However, urgency remains asserted rather than tested; no reversal or complication arises to force a tactical shift. The painter works without friction, and the bells' arrival after completion removes rather than tightens pressure. The borrowed heartbeat and coded lullabies operate as backstory rather than present escalation, leaving the page action static.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: ending the Forever War through celestial-anchored ritual. Pressure accumulates via Elara's history (seventeen broken ceasefires), Theron's and Kell's losses, and the ticking moons. The signing moment tightens options by linking treaty to cosmic convergence. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens relies on stated exhaustion ("I know...every name") rather than a live reversal or deepening that forces a visible trade-off. The handshake and signature unfold without friction; coincidence (both leaders arrive, both sign) facilitates resolution rather than protagonist agency reshaping tactics under constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: Eleanor's need to preserve extinct voices as a gesture against her lifetime of destruction. The drought backstory provides context but is told; the on-page tightening occurs when she kneels, traces the cracks, and activates the speaker, narrowing options from intent to irreversible action. The cost is legible—she performs a futile act knowing no one will hear it, forecloses redemption, and walks away—but the escalation is a single deepening rather than a compounding pressure, fitting this length yet lacking the layered turns that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—unlock the sanctuary and harvest ancestral echoes—is signaled early and coheres through the ritual sequence. The untangling of threads offers a single meaningful tightening (voices begin to whisper, then sing), but the action proceeds without visible resistance or cost. No reversal or complication tests her commitment; the threads "loosened one by one" without friction. The ending reconfigures her solitude into community, but the transition lacks a trade-off or forfeited path that would elevate escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Marcus's storytelling methods are ethical manipulation or revelation—is signaled early and remains coherent. The puppet show constitutes a meaningful tightening: Marcus dramatizes their conflict, forcing Vera to experience his method from the inside, which narrows her opposition and opens a path to mutual understanding. The cost is relational (Vera's tears, "that's not fair") and forecloses the prior adversarial stance. One credible deepening under the Situational lens with visible emotional price scaled appropriately.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: honoring the last migration before it vanishes into forgetting. Pressure tightens when Vera unpacks the moth wing—using it costs her a personal talisman. The monarchs' arrival and their sixteen-second pause deliver visible acknowledgment, a micro-reversal that validates her grandmother's theory but does not save the species. Vera's agency is renunciation: she accepts that witness is all she can offer, dismantles the structures, and commits to continue. The cost is unmistakable—she weeps, knowing extinction proceeds regardless.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—preserve forgotten names through sound, not just form—is signaled early and tightens once: she shifts from reconstructing melody via instruments (failed attempt) to reconfiguring the rope, which succeeds. That pivot forecloses her reliance on bronze permanence ("she would cast again… But she would never forget that permanence required first letting go") with felt cost. The rope's reconfiguration is protagonist-driven agency; the punched card crumbles as visible price. No antagonist needed; the accumulative pressure coheres under the lens and the final sung melody reweights all prior attempts.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding why paths choose walkers—is signaled early and drives the descent. Breaking the seal is a clear tightening that narrows options (she cannot unknow what she learns). The cost is present but abstract: she "would not try to master the paths" and instead serves mystery. Under the accumulative lens this functions, but the final reconfiguration is conceptual rather than a visible trade-off (stamina, injury, loss of a specific option). Agency is there, pressure coheres, but the felt price is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake (seal a covenant via mathematical communication) is signaled early and remains coherent. However, pressure never genuinely tightens or deepens—Mira expects patterns to hold and they do; no live option is foreclosed. The sequence's emergence is described as invitation rather than test. Cost is legible in the ending (seventeen-year wait, anticipated dismissal) but arrives as acceptance of known terms rather than a hard-won tradeoff forced by the night's events. Under the Accumulative lens, a single decisive intensification or cadence shift that reweights the stake with visible cost is needed; here the mood deepens but the stake does not transform.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—teaching Thorne to release resentment—is signaled early and coheres throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mireva presents the broken music box and Thorne recognizes it, narrowing his emotional options. However, escalation is largely passive: Mireva acts on him via cellular memory, and his unclenching fists arrive as the result of her intervention rather than his own contested choice. The cost (foregoing vengeance, accepting peace) is visible but not dramatized as a live trade-off he wrestles with; the story tells us "releasing his hatred would not dishonor his mother's memory" rather than forcing him to decide between competing goods on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—recapturing the escaped dream—is signaled in the opening and tightens when Elara realizes the dream has been leading her. The sextant reconstruction and breath-synchronization constitute a meaningful escalation under the Accumulative lens, narrowing her tactics. Breaking synchronization at closure forecloses immediate crossing with visible cost: she renounces entry to preserve the approach. Agency is decision and renunciation, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether mending knowledge dies or persists—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when Mira opens the bag and discovers her daughter's journal, narrowing options from solitary endurance to active teaching. The climb itself functions as escalating physical pressure, and Petra's insistence that they "bring everything" seeds the reversal. Cost is visible: Mira must release her private mourning (the ribbon) and commit to teaching with no guild infrastructure. The piece edges toward 8.0+ but lacks a second pressure point between the journal discovery and the ending choice; the climb, while embodied, advances mostly through elapsed time rather than branching decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding the inheritance and her role—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through her exploration and the bathroom realization, but no on-page reversal narrows her options or forces a trade-off. The carving decision at the end feels inevitable rather than costly; we do not see what she gives up or what path is foreclosed. Escalation under an Accumulative lens requires a meaningful tightening or cadence shift with visible cost, and here the cost remains conceptual and offstage.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (find the Library, rescue Thessaly) is signaled early and pressure coheres under the Causal lens. The key reversal—realizing the mountain rescues listeners rather than trapping them—narrows Mira's options from force to negotiation with visible cost (she must promise to teach, not just take). The time traveler's "seventeen versions" exposition asserts stakes without on-page demonstration. Mira's agency drives the turn, but the mountain's acceptance feels swift; we don't see her offer tested or a competing choice foreclosed with friction.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (find the sister/reclaim the forgotten name) is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the sister appears and resists return, but Maya's persuasion lacks on-page friction—she "began speaking" and immediate success follows without trade-off or visible price. The Garden's threat (erasure) is conceptual rather than pressing a choice with escalating cost. Agency at closure reads as wish rather than renunciation or endurance with foreclosed paths.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—restoring a lost connection—is signaled early and unified through the piece. However, escalation is thin: Mira faces no opposition, no failed attempts, no trade-offs while untangling the rope. The work itself is described as patient and methodical but never difficult or costly in the moment. The resolution arrives through competence rather than agency under pressure. One tightening occurs (understanding Voss's message and beginning to work), but the final act lacks visible price—no stamina cost, no risk of failure, no moral calculus.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (finding refuge from overwhelming frequencies) is signaled immediately and tightens through spatial descent: junction → narrow gap → uncharted chamber → discovery. The reversal when the stone absorbs sound rather than echoing it provides genuine escalation under the accumulative lens. Agency is clear: Vera's professional knowledge (reading ice cracks, recognizing draft spirals) drives each move, and her final choice to map for others rather than hoard the refuge forecloses personal sanctuary with on-page cost ("hammered repose…earned exhaustion").

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (understanding Vera's discovery) is signaled early and tightens when the vision reveals tonight's alignment, forcing immediate return to the neglected beacon. Agency manifests in Mira's choice to pursue meaning despite her longstanding avoidance of artifacts, then to act on the prophecy by rekindling the flame. The tightening forecloses her path of isolation—she commits to custodianship of more than flame. Cost is present but muted: her eleven-year practice of avoiding touch shifts abruptly without visible friction or loss in the transition.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: reveal that collective memory is fragmented conjecture, not unified truth. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens via contradictory monuments and crystallized voices; one meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes "true collective memory" is emotional core, not facts. Agency is clear—she descends to share her findings, foreclosing certainty with conceptual cost. Weakness: the tightening moment at the shadow dial feels more illustrative than a live fork; no visible trade-off or tactical shift narrows her options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—transforming grief into light—is signaled early and tightens when Elara confronts her grandmother and must choose whether to ignite the display. However, the grandmother's arrival is coincidental and resolves Elara's isolation without her agency driving the turn. The fireworks sequence offers spectacle but no on-page obstacle or choice under pressure; success is assured. One deepening occurs (reframing the knot), but the final act feels ceremonial rather than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (reconciliation or continued estrangement) is signaled by Elena's opening question. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira's tangential answer shifts Elena from "jaw remained tight" to touching the cicada with "voice had lost its sharp edge." The cost is legible: Mira admits failure ("I had confused studying transitions"), foreclosing the path of denial. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens through layered reflection that forces Mira's confession. Minor deduction: the turn feels more conversational softening than a high-stakes narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—learning to inhabit open space without panic—is signaled early and tested during the inversion hour when "her chest stretching contracted" embodies the old fear. One meaningful deepening occurs when she recognizes the gilded hush as "the moment before choosing" and commits to deferring the bunker confrontation. The cost is psychological and legible: she accepts avoidance as interim strategy, foreclosing immediate closure with her father.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: transforming the terrace's silence into comfort for the bereaved, distinct from revenge. The escalation is textural: weeks of monitoring compress into tonight's unprecedented helix pattern, which prompts the vial's release—a deliberate, irreversible act that forecloses keeping Mira's atmospheric memory. Agency is clear in the decision to dissolve the crystals, and the cost (releasing her daughter's final captured moment) is felt. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, though the single tightening is quiet rather than dramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—claim the throne before sunrise—is signaled early and tightens once through the bark-shimmer moment. Meridia's agency drives the sequence (she peels paint, reads signs, presses the flake), but no live option is visibly foreclosed with felt cost. The sunrise deadline creates urgency yet never tests her commitment; she never hesitates or sacrifices a competing desire. One meaningful pressure point exists (the translucent bark), but the escalation reads more as discovery than dilemma. The resolution is protagonist-driven but lacks visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (Mira's cultivated isolation vs. connection) is signaled early and tightens once: the fading threshold forces the choice to teach Sera or maintain solitude. Agency is clear—Mira lifts the doorknocker, a deliberate act that forecloses her three-year emptiness. The cost is visible: the sanctuary "holds only one," yet she steps aside and begins teaching. Under the Accumulative lens, the pressure deepens through the scars-linking revelation and Sera's suffocating need, culminating in the doorways-not-bridges insight. No antagonist required; internal conflict (protection of emptiness vs. shared wounds) drives escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Vera will volunteer and translate the quantum promise—is signaled early through the glitchy messages and escalates through materialized concepts that test her resolve. One meaningful tightening occurs when the promise floods her with parallel memories, creating immense psychological pressure she must channel or be crushed. The resolution is protagonist-driven (she volunteers, uses the bolt as anchor, transforms pressure into diamonds) with visible cost (trembling, parallel trauma exposure). However, the escalation relies on fantastical mechanics introduced rapidly in the final third, and the stakes remain somewhat abstract despite the concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—uncovering why the dynasty ended—is signaled early and sustained. However, escalation remains primarily cognitive and reflective; Margaret encounters no meaningful obstacle or reversal, only progressive revelation through the journal and her meditation. The grandmother's dismantling of the fortune is recounted in summary rather than tested against Margaret's present choice. The final decision to learn the methodology feels like continuation rather than a turn that narrows options or exacts visible cost scaled to this length.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Aldric's search for purpose after withdrawal—is signaled early and tightens when he finds the program and recognizes the patterns. The armor removal is a meaningful choice that narrows his tactical stance, and the final weaving of golden threads represents agency (vessel rather than warrior). However, the escalation relies on declarative understanding ("Aldric understood now") rather than a visible price or trade-off that alters later moves. The cost is more conceptual than felt on the page, trending mid-7s under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Eleanor's purpose "in the margins of other people's tragedies." The button discovery tightens her commitment—she photographs it, catalogs it, then deliberately replaces it, a micro-choice that forecloses the safer path of treating it as mere artifact. The final paragraph reweights her daily return as both wound and gift, an Earned Stasis with visible cost: "she would never stop being broken-hearted." Agency is renunciation and endurance; the price is her perpetual heartbreak, legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving truth against the Council—is clear, and the midnight raid compresses time. Yet Mira's plan works without hitch: decoy succeeds, escape is clean, network holds. No reversal tests her commitment; the Council's threat evaporates off-page. The ending lists future resistance but offers no on-page tightening or price paid. The escalation is declared (three years reduced to hours) rather than dramatized through a choice that costs her something she values.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—silencing the prophecy—is signaled immediately and remains coherent. The piece offers one meaningful deepening: her playing the inverse melody through negative space while feeling the words rise. Yet the escalation lacks a visible reversal or complication; the technique works smoothly without a moment where it threatens to fail or forces a trade-off. The cost of thirty years' practice and childlessness is told in backstory rather than tested on the page at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—decoding the leaves' messages—is signaled early and maintained. The hush provides one meaningful deepening: the leaf's patterns rearrange, revealing transformation instructions rather than prophecy. However, escalation is driven more by revelation than protagonist agency; Wren observes and receives rather than choosing under competing pressures. The cost at closure (becoming "more fully herself") is asserted but not tested against a visible trade-off or renunciation on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: Mira's confrontation with her life's work (order vs. entropy). Pressure accumulates through three messages (client's death, journal pages, etched clock), the descent, and the admiral's compass revelation. One meaningful tightening occurs when she digs for the logbook and commits to "improvise now—create something new," forecloses the old precision path with conceptual cost. The choice is more renunciation than agonized decision; we see her understand rather than struggle. No antagonist; coincidence seeds the quest but does not solve it. Agency is present but the escalation reads as deepening comprehension rather than narrowing tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (redeem her father's name and finish his work) is signaled early and one meaningful tightening occurs when Mira chooses to honor imperfections rather than erase them. The conceptual cost—transforming shame into "golden seams"—is legible in the final metal's surface. However, all escalation is internal and solitary; no external reversal tests her commitment mid-process, and the climactic transmutation succeeds without visible sacrifice or tactical adjustment. The stakes remain abstract (the village's opinion, the weight of names) rather than a concrete, immediate forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is Maren's restoration of purpose, signaled in paragraph one ("misplaced herself"). The harp discovery and spirits' confessions create one meaningful tightening: her work was always healing through laughter, but she never recognized it. Agency appears in her choice to strike the harp again and laugh, foreclosing the path of self-doubt with visible cost (tears, the ache that now glows). The spirits apply immediate pressure by revealing forgotten memories. No coincidence resolves; Maren's decision to continue is earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—discovering the mathematics of mercy—is signaled early and sustained. Elena's enhanced perception allows her to decode the forest's algorithm, a tightening that reveals mercy as rationed efficiency. However, the escalation is cognitive rather than pressured by choice; no on-page reversal forces Elena to trade one value for another. The decision to rewrite the system is declared, not tested against a live cost or obstacle that narrows her options in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.9)
    One dominant stake (honoring overlooked histories by finding the lens fragment) is signaled early and pursued consistently. The piece delivers one tightening: the fragment is hidden behind the painting, and Mira must choose to unfasten it, committing to her grandmother's unfinished work. However, the choice itself is not dramatized as a trade-off with visible alternatives or immediate cost—she "hesitates" briefly, then proceeds. The escalation reads as accumulative density rather than a decision that forecloses a live option with on-page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—discovering what the building hides and honoring Eleanor's legacy—is signaled early and tightens when the ghost reveals the insurance investigators' suspicion. Miriam's agency is decision (to deliver the mainspring to the historical society), but the choice feels preordained; no live option is foreclosed with visible cost. The tightening from "assessing the elevator" to "salvaging Eleanor's memory" is meaningful but lacks a tactical trade-off or pressure that forces Miriam to renounce something on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is legible: break the perfect stasis or remain static. The frost pattern completing signals escalation, and pulling the lever is protagonist-driven agency. One meaningful tightening occurs when the whisper must be released "at the precise instant of awakening." Cost is present (press dissolves, pages scatter) but feels more atmospheric than a visible tradeoff that forecloses a live option. Under the Accumulative lens, the density increase and pattern break suffice, but the price could be more immediate and personal rather than primarily structural.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—understanding versus joining the lost civilization—is clear, and Maren's choice to uncover the mirror narrows options with visible cost (her research notes flutter away, the council will debate for years). The escalation operates under the Accumulative lens: theory formation deepens into ritual violation, then physical departure. One friction: the academic dispute is declared but never exerts on-page pressure; the Consortium and Remnant Collective remain abstract. The final choice is protagonist-driven, but the middle lacks a credible complication or loss that tests her commitment before the mirror moment.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—reclaim the light before midnight—is signaled early and tightens through the wilting beat that forces Elias to confront his dishonest motive. The corrected intention ("tether the light so it can flow forward") narrows options and drives the dispersal with visible cost (chip extinguished, grandmother not resurrected). Agency is clear: his recognition and apology enable the transformation. Single meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (finding the Threshold) is signaled early and coheres. One meaningful tightening: the compass needle's downward pull → psychometry revelation → spinning needle and lagoon transformation narrow her options to acceptance or retreat. Agency is renunciation (she stops looking back) with visible cost (surface life forfeited). The piece accumulates pressure texturally rather than through reversals, fitting the inferred lens. Cost is legible in the final lines but could land harder—her choice feels contemplative rather than wrenching.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake (finding the cabin, then understanding her inheritance) is signaled early and tightens once when Marina realizes the slide is a map. However, escalation lacks a second pressure point; the storm subsides conveniently rather than forcing a trade-off. The final choice (returning to her workshop to reread her sculptures) is stated intent without on-page cost—no visible loss of time, material, or alternative path. The reversal (dismissing grandmother's fancy → accepting the alliance) happens off-camera in reverie rather than through a decision that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding why flowers bloom at night—is signaled early and tightens through Mira's weeks of study. One meaningful deepening: discovering the innermost layer depicts a human figure, which reweights the grandmother's question and narrows Mira's approach to the mural. The mural itself becomes a response that forecloses other artistic paths. However, escalation is primarily internal and reflective; no external opposition or reversal tests commitment. The cost at closure is conceptual (devotion to overlooked hours, ongoing additions) rather than a dramatized sacrifice or visible trade-off in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—uncover buried truth—is signaled early and tightens once via Celeste's descent and the recognition of parley marks. The grandmother's arrival reverses isolation into collaboration, and the final testimony collection narrows Celeste's options (she commits to "burn through every comfortable silence"). Cost is stated rather than shown: we don't see what Celeste risks by recording this testimony or what she loses in the act. One meaningful tightening is present; escalation under the Causal lens is functional but the price remains more conceptual than tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—reimagining the civilization—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening: Mira's realization that the fisherman's wish was about remembering resilience, not restoring magic, narrows her goal and shifts tactics from preservation to transformation. The accumulative design does not require explicit reversals, but agency is primarily perceptual (accessing memories, crafting lanterns) rather than a choice with visible tradeoff. The villagers' return provides external validation, yet no on-page friction tests Mira's commitment during the work itself—she succeeds without complication once the insight lands.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—archiving a damaged recording fragment during the sacred silence—is clear and signaled early. Pressure accumulates through ritual action and the wax shaving's unexpected glow, leading to the accidental prophecy that reframes Maren's work. The cost is conceptual: she becomes "part of a conversation that spanned millennia" rather than a passive archivist, but this shift is told more than shown through a dramatized choice with visible forfeiture. No antagonist or external obstacle creates friction; the escalation is internal and textural, fitting the Accumulative lens but lacking the trade-off or narrowed option that would push into 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding and claiming the vortex inheritance to prepare seeds for spring—is signaled early and tightens once when the vortex descends and she must risk dissolution. Maren's agency is clear: she chooses to impose order via the acorn cap's geometry and hum, enabling access without destruction. One meaningful deepening occurs with the ancestral memory flood, reweighting her purpose from abstract curiosity to custodial duty. The cost is conceptual (accepting centuries of borrowed time and future responsibility) but legible on the page. No false reversals; pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—learning to favor listening over noise—is signaled early and coheres throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when instrument readings converge toward equilibrium, narrowing options to the single moment when the bell must be pulled. The final act (pulling the rope) is Mira's agency with visible cost: her professional identity as alarm-calibrator transformed to acknowledgment-marker, embodied in the keepers' bow and her return to recording. The cost is felt in the reweighting of her life's work from panic to presence.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (finding meaning in cosmic indifference) is signaled early and coheres throughout. One meaningful deepening occurs when the meteor's death becomes "arrival," reweighting the initial question. However, escalation is textural rather than a narrowing choice—no present complication forces a trade-off on the page. The final stance crystallization (smallness as strength) feels earned by prior reflection but lacks an on-page reversal or visible cost that forecloses a live option. Agency is endurance, valid under Earned Stasis, yet the lack of a present competing pull mutes the price.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (preserving unspoken words vs. delivering them to the living) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when the mother-ghost deposits her secret—Maren recognizes "a child grown old might still be alive" but chooses patience. The decision forecloses immediate release with visible cost (the child may die before hearing the words). Accumulative pressure builds through the covenant's weight ("another stone in the cairn"), and the ending crystallizes the trade-off between preservation and deliverance.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is Vera's need to understand temporal texture, signaled early and sustained. The fragment discovery reverses her task from cataloging anomalies to reconstructing Elena's intentional archive, tightening her purpose. The cost is clear: seventeen borrowed years now committed to an invisible, patient labor. Agency is renunciation of "more life" in favor of "understanding," dramatized through her repair of the capsule and acceptance of the role. Pressure deepens rather than escalates through multiple reversals, fitting the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—Mira's philosophy of incomplete beauty tested in a social moment—is signaled early and tightens when she must give away the feather she just found. The boy's distress creates immediate pressure, and Mira's choice to mend (not restore) the kite is agency with visible cost: she surrenders a meaningful object. One clear tightening occurs on the page. The cost is felt but modest in scale—she loses the feather but gains confirmation of her worldview—so the price does not foreclose a path with high consequence, preventing entry to the high 8s.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—enabling communication between trees and stones before death—is signaled early and tightens through visible work: first oak-pillar junction takes three weeks, then scales to dozens of connections by month four. The accumulation of animal offerings, the islanders learning, and the pillars beginning to shift provide escalation under the Accumulative lens. However, no single on-page choice tests Maren's commitment with a trade-off or visible price; the progression is systematic deepening without friction, and the cost at closure is implied tranquility rather than a legible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: Mira's need to understand why she feels the pull of artificial pilgrimage. The amber deepens her comprehension in one meaningful accumulation, but no on-page reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off. The aliens' coordinates and the convergence of six pilgrims establish external pressure, yet Mira's agency is passive observation until the final descent decision. The cost—renouncing her career-long skepticism—is implied but not foregrounded as a visible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—resurrect the battlefield through patient ecological intervention—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening: the reef's death releases nutrients that enable unprecedented growth, reframing the project from symbolic gesture to practical possibility and raising the cost of failure. Agency is enacted through nightly seed dispersal, species rotation, and the choice to continue "until the battlefield bloomed or he joined the reef," foreclosing retreat. Pressure accumulates through the birds' predictions, the visible new shoots each morning, and the open-ended timeframe. The resolution is earned by Erasmus's persistent micro-choices under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—finding her daughter—is signaled early and tightens through the riddle, memory, and excavation. The compost-pit discovery narrows options decisively: Marta now has a map and a direction, foreclosing her passive waiting. Agency is clear in her run, dig, and final decision to walk east. Cost is visible: she abandons her settlement and faces the "impassable" eastern wastelands. One meaningful tightening with escalation under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—Mira's purpose in isolation versus the possibility of rescue—is signaled early and tightens when the ship appears. Her decision to finish the anniversary sketch before engaging constitutes meaningful agency that forecloses immediate reunion with humanity. The cost is legible: three years alone, "her voice forgotten from disuse." However, the escalation is gentle rather than acute; the ship's arrival raises possibility without creating urgent conflict, and Mira's choice feels contemplative rather than torn. The piece operates successfully under an Accumulative lens but lacks the visceral pressure that would elevate it into high 8s.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (save the master) is signaled early and drives the vault sequence. The chess-puzzle provides one meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens—Corwin must match secrets correctly or fail—and the letter reveal deepens emotional cost. However, no live tactical option is visibly foreclosed; the master's survival was never genuinely in doubt on the page, capping escalation below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: unbind from performed grief and document the small gestures that official histories erase. One meaningful tightening when Vera walks her own name, narrowing options from endless memorial circuits to authorship and departure. The carved pawns are a visible cost (winter labor, solitary focus) that alters the game-state and her stance. Agency is renunciation and endurance—she survives the drill economy, then foreclosed that path by leaving the palace with her true work begun. No antagonist required; pressure accumulates through her internal contradiction and the acoustic void.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming buried fluency to speak home into being—signals early and tightens through three escalations: finding the stone (deepest level), the feather pivot (night 47), and speaking aloud (night 100). Each tightening narrows options under the Accumulative lens: understanding dissolves nightly until she seeds knowledge into flesh directly, a visible tactical shift with cost (the patterns "became part of her new reality"). The final climb forecloses stasis with felt price ("whole enough to hurt"). Agency drives all turns. Minor: the bookstore's responsive shifts feel slightly convenient, though they reward rather than resolve Vera's work.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—self-forgiveness—is signaled early and tightens when Marcus kneels to decode the tapestry, then deepens at the mirrored center where he must confront his reflection. Agency is clear in the release of the knight, a renunciation that forecloses his need to undo the past. The tightening is meaningful but gentle: the labyrinth offers a mirror rather than an obstacle, so escalation reads as internal accumulation rather than external resistance. One reversal occurs (realization that the village was preserved, not cursed), and the cost—accepting that the prince's choices were his own—lands on the page, though the price feels more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: preserve her mother's complexity against the Elders' demand for single truth. One meaningful tightening: the ritual deadline forces Sera's refraction tactic into action. Agency is clear (decision to speak seven truths), and the cost is legible (Elders' commands "dissolved," authority overturned). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens through gathering poets, rehearsal, then execution. The trade-off—preserving complexity at the price of defying the system—is visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—conjuring meaning from brokenness—signals early and escalates through the matching ritual. The workshop lurch forces Vera to commit ("grabbed the statue's outstretched hand"), and the final pockmark (daughter's death) is the highest-cost choice, foreclosing evasion with visible grief. The gears spinning "of their own accord" introduces a micro-turn that reweights success. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure tightens via deepening revelation rather than external antagonist. One persistent constraint: the acid sea's threat frames all choices.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake clearly signaled: to keep creating as promise and survival. One meaningful deepening when Edwin paints not the quay but the present moment, and his unconscious layers his daughter's image into the work. The tidal whisper tightens the ending without melodrama. However, the cave discovery is coincidental (wrong turn), and Edwin's agency in the climactic beat is receptive rather than decisive—he "stepped back and saw" rather than choosing under competing pressures. Cost is visible (mortality accepted, fragmentation embraced) but the escalation is gentle rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Mira's commitment to quiet attendance versus abandonment. Pressure tightens when the night-garden scent announces the boy's impossible arrival, forcing her to choose between dismissing the manifestation or engaging. The boy's plea—"I just wanted someone to listen"—crystallizes the moral calculus: Mira can send him away or honor her principle that whispers travel farther by tending him. Agency is hers: she uses the cork to filter her emotions, extends her hand with "quiet certainty," and offers lighthouse work as a path to release. The cost is visible—she accepts ongoing care of a flickering, fragile presence—and the final image of holding both cork and ghost-hand shows the price of her listening.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—guiding the lost home through beacon construction—is signaled early and escalates through Mira's discovery process, the cryptic calls, and her physical labor. The tightening occurs when she understands she's building "a beacon not for ships, but for souls," narrowing her options and raising the metaphysical cost. The resolution is earned by her choices and work, with visible prices (raw hands, grief transformed). However, the future-self device delivers the key insight rather than forcing Mira to a more difficult on-page choice, slightly softening the agency at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—psychological safety—is signaled early and tightens when the relic arrives with execution risk. The test of lying ("I am happy") is a meaningful reversal that narrows her world from isolation-only to choice-enabled connection. The final decision to spread the cure raises external danger, though it unfolds in summary ("Tomorrow she would begin") rather than a scene-level choice with visible friction. The cost (execution threat, "dangerous work") is declared but not tested on the page. One substantive pressure point (the lie succeeding) drives the arc under a Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—decode the stranger's final gesture—is signaled early and tightens through gap-observation, memory intrusion, and the realization that "the gaps... were not omissions but offerings." The investigation method constrains Elias's path: he must infer rather than know, raising interpretive cost. His agency crystallizes in the inscription choice, which forecloses passive witnessing and commits him to the mountain journey. Escalation reads as accumulative deepening (each clue layer adds weight) rather than reversals, fitting the inferred Accumulative lens. Cost is felt (burden, future journey, emotional inheritance) though not yet paid in full on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—finding the doorway her father promised—is signaled immediately and tightens through the discovery sequence. The rising creek adds time pressure that narrows options meaningfully. Eleanor's empirically intuitive sense enables the chip-as-key insight, demonstrating agency. The choice at the threshold (step through vs. return with knowledge) presents competing goods with visible cost: her shop is abandoned, the map left behind signals she crossed over or chose differently. One meaningful deepening occurs when the doorway reveals not escape but understanding, reweighting the promise's nature before the final decision.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (unravel the recurring dreams to act against an unseen enemy) is signaled early and tightens once through the oracle's confrontation, which forces the queen to retrieve the buried memory. That recovery forecloses the path of willful ignorance with visible cost: she must now act against the man who sustained her. The climb itself is a secondary physical test that mirrors the internal escalation. Agency is choice (the decision to climb, then to descend with purpose) with undeniable on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (can presence be measured/captured?) is signaled early and pursued through shell calibration and Theo's challenge. Pressure tightens when Theo names the mother-wound and reframes capture as attention, forcing Mira's revaluation. However, the escalation is primarily conceptual dialogue rather than a choice that costs Mira a live option on the page; giving away the shell after the insight feels like a gesture of understanding rather than a sacrifice that narrows her research path or relationship. One meaningful deepening occurs, meeting the length requirement, but the cost remains more felt than visible.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—regaining temporal coherence and present-moment wholeness—is clear from the opening. Pressure accumulates through her jealousy of past selves and recognition that "the chronicler's curse" has alienated her from lived experience. The tightening comes when she realizes "the chaos was the narrative," shifting from resistance to acceptance. Agency is present: she chooses to write about the jealousy and plans tomorrow's ridge climb. The cost (living with temporal confusion) is felt but could be more viscerally dramatized in a concrete forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Margaret seeks restoration of a lineage instrument, Elena seeks meaning after loss. One tightening occurs when Elena diagnoses the improper cleaning—knowledge deepens but options don't narrow sharply. The screw's freeing is more symbolic release than a choice with visible trade-off. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens but escalation is gentle; cost at closure is Margaret's tears and the implicit commitment to return, not a decisive forfeiture. Sufficient for the lens but lacks a second beat that raises price.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake signaled early: understanding why her body turns to ice and whether runes can transform the curse. One meaningful tightening when the platform shudders and ice forms again—this time she doesn't fight it, narrows her options from containment to transformation. The cost is legible: she draws the rune on crystallizing skin, and the scar changes permanently with iridescence, a visible mark of her choice. Agency is clear decision under pressure (dipping the quill into storm-tea, tracing onto forming ice) that forecloses the path of suppression. The resolution commits her to return and challenge her mentor's dismissal of folk wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—freeing Eleanor—is clear from the outset, and the electromagnetic ritual provides one meaningful tightening: the darkness is pulled from her soul. However, Marcus faces no opposition, internal or external; the procedure works as planned, Eleanor is freed, and the orchard's destruction (the ostensible time pressure) doesn't actually complicate the ritual. The "imperfect miracle" is asserted rather than demonstrated through visible trade-offs or escalating cost. Success without friction flattens the pressure curve.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—unraveling cosmic illusions—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. The scrolls "softening" provides one textural deepening consistent with the Accumulative lens, but no tactical trade-off or foreclosed option accompanies it. Agency is passive observation rather than decision under pressure; the protagonist does not choose between competing goods or pay a visible price. The resolution occurs through her "becoming" rather than through a choice that narrows options. The band guardrail for 8.0+ (tightening that forecloses a live option) is not met.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is understanding what clocks measure, signaled early and sustained. The tightening occurs through the countdown: each descending number narrows options until "one" forecloses return. Einar's agency is active—inserting the key, choosing to count backward, holding zero, stepping through—with visible cost (leaving his role, the station, waiting for "the next keeper"). The razor edges materialize as direct consequence of his counting method, escalating from concept to physical manifestation that alters his reality.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding her father's contradictions and her own inheritance of them—is signaled early. However, escalation is absent: Margot moves from confusion to clarity without obstacles, reversals, or competing pressures. The discovery of Seat 14 and the archive folder provide information but no friction. Her final decision to pay debts and continue research is uncontested; no on-page cost, trade-off, or foreclosed option accompanies it. The piece reads as contemplative arrival rather than pressure-tested choice.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: teaching grief to loop forward rather than back, signaled early and held through closure. The woman's seven calls and Vera's recognition of "recurring misdials" show escalation through accumulation. The pivot moment—"But you could reach the beginning instead"—narrows the woman's options with visible cost (she must abandon the deleted voicemail as her target). Vera's continued waiting at the end forecloses ordinary connection, an Earned Stasis with felt cost. One pressure beat would benefit from a visible hesitation or resistance from the woman before acceptance to test Vera's tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (renew the covenant to preserve small histories) is signaled by midpoint and deepens through the letter discovery. However, escalation is informational rather than pressure-driven: Marguerite learns the covenant exists, the Keeper appears on schedule, and she accepts without resistance. No live option is foreclosed; the choice to give the locket and continue archiving flows inevitably from setup. The grandmother's prior failure introduces conceptual cost but does not narrow Marguerite's present tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Maya delivering the sample and understanding the protocol—is clear and present from paragraph two. Pressure tightens when Okonkwo receives the fragment and explains the fifteen-year network, reweighting Maya's entire career as unwitting participation. Her offer to help distributes the compound narrows her options (no more running) with stated emotional cost. The escalation is more revelatory than agonistic: the network's existence is explained rather than tested on the page. No antagonist appears; coincidence (the pilot's rumor) delivers Maya to the station without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake is clear: map the hidden stillpoint for a dying woman. Pressure accumulates through the ultrasonic trail, dowsing with the forked branch, following her mother's lullaby in new harmonies. The stillpoint encounter provides one meaningful tightening—standing in emotional neutrality, she feels nothing, then understands it's a doorway requiring choice about which feelings to carry forward. Agency is decision and renunciation: she maps it for another but refuses return, forecloses equilibrium's path with felt cost. The musical trail and ring-guided dowsing create earned escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (can she undo the Kepler destruction?) is signaled early and pressure accumulates when their clarifying question arrives, creating one meaningful tightening. However, the resolution feels gifted rather than earned through agency—the anomaly's temporal distortion solves the problem Vera didn't help create in this story window. She composes a better message, but faces no forced tradeoff or irreversible loss in doing so. The cost is conceptual (years of self-punishment) rather than dramatized in the present.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—saving the harbor from demolition by teaching the council to "hear" silence—is signaled early and pursued through the overnight instruction. The pressure tightens when Elena confesses her words are "losing their power" and asks Mira for help. However, the escalation is compressed into summary ("Through the night, they worked together"), and we never see the council vote or witness the cost of Elena's disruption. The story ends before the stakes are tested on the page, leaving the outcome as poise rather than decisive change with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—rescuing the forgotten promise—is signaled early and guides the descent. Pressure, however, remains static: Miriam encounters no reversals, competing goods, or tactical shifts; the archive yields its secret without resistance. The letter resolves cleanly with no visible trade-off between wants. Under the accumulative lens one meaningful deepening suffices, and the portrait's vandalism does deepen the emotional charge, but the lack of any on-page constraint or loss (time, safety, a foreclosed option) keeps escalation in the mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: giving Elias's dream its first breath. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira's drumming triggers the garden's resonance, forcing the separation ("felt him leaving her"). Agency is renunciation—she lets Elias go into the garden with visible cost (the space in her mind "growing quiet"). The escalation reads as accumulative deepening under the textural lens: sensory density builds until the release. However, the drumming feels pre-planned rather than a decision made under conflicting pressure in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: finding the hidden archive. Pressure escalates when normal navigation fails, forcing reliance on sound and memory, then tightens when the key reveals a new route through worker-only passages. The man's agency (three years studying maps, producing the key) drives the turn; Celia's expertise enables it. The cost—revealing a secret meant to outlast conventional knowledge—is conceptual and felt in the final beat. One clear reversal when the key's function is discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake is clear: prevent the boy from succumbing to the same darkness that took her brother. One meaningful tightening occurs when the boy watches the light patterns and his attention shifts from the canal's depths. The guardian's silence and shutter-weaving constitute constrained agency, and the boy's departure with a raised hand forecloses immediate danger with visible cost (her ongoing vigil, unresolved grief). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; coincidence does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—planting doubt about standardized testing via synchronized displays—is signaled early. However, Eleanor begins the story with her plan already finalized; the narrative documents preparation rather than a choice under escalating pressure. No on-page reversal narrows her options or forces a trade-off. The tomorrow-morning timing creates anticipation but no immediate cost or tactical shift. Under the Accumulative lens, the lack of a deepening that changes knowledge or reweights the stake keeps this in mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—find the island and embrace her true nature—is signaled early and tightens when the whale calls and the scrimshaw completes its map. The farewell to Jonas and the dive constitute one meaningful turn. However, no live obstacle opposes her: the Treaty removed violence/fear, Jonas supports her, and the island appears on cue. The "already beginning its slow fade" detail suggests cost (urgency), but it doesn't force a trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake: cultivating a private space for grief under state surveillance. Pressure tightens from kitchen narration to whittling (seventeen figures mark escalation) to the drone pass to the brittle-petal touch, each forecloses total erasure. The whittling itself is a repeated, compounding act that narrows her to this one ritual. The final act (touching the flowers, continuing to chop vegetables "with the gravity of defusing a bomb") crystallizes her stance with cost: she remains surveilled, hollow, but refuses full erasure. Deduction: the drone pass could apply immediate jeopardy rather than passive observation; escalation is steady but lacks a sharp tightening choice mid-piece.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—proving her words held power and boundaries can be crossed—is signaled early and tightened when Mora moves from doubt to speaking aloud, triggering environmental response (quartz glow, ice crack, moths). The escalation is driven by her agency (touching, paraphrasing, reading) under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible: by reading she awakens the atrium and reopens boundaries the Council sealed, a stance that "the boundary keepers felt their certainties tremble" confirms as irrevocable even if consequence isn't fully paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Mira's need to see true color despite potential cost to her artistic identity—is signaled early and remains coherent. Theo's challenge ("even if it reveals that everything I've painted has been wrong") creates one meaningful tightening that forces Mira to commit the reed tongue with visible emotional weight. Her agency is clear: she brings the offering, articulates the risk, and accepts the transformation. The escalation is modest but sufficient for this length; the cost is conceptual (her prior work's validity) rather than a harder sacrifice that forecloses another path.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering the texture of connection—is signaled early and tightens through the pilgrimage stations. Each recording deepens her questioning (mother's call, whale song, empty silence) in a cumulative pressure arc consistent with the Accumulative lens. The blackout's absence as a felt loss adds secondary texture. One meaningful deepening occurs when the "perfect silence" recording forces her to hear her own presence. Cost is more conceptual than visceral: she commits to bell-ringing "without expectation," but no live option is visibly foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is Elara's recovery of agency and purpose after grief-driven collapse. The first crane ("fingers having forgotten gentleness") represents a meaningful tightening that forecloses her descent. The ending shows continuity (another mourner arrives), but the middle arc—from solitary folding to teaching a community—is summarized rather than dramatized with visible reversals or costs. The final meeting with a new visitor demonstrates endurance and stance crystallization, qualifying as Earned Stasis, but the lack of on-page friction between her wants (isolation) and costs (teaching vulnerability) keeps escalation legible yet compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: Vera's project to map cultural mythology through card readings. Marcus's arrival provides immediate pressure (a high-profile skeptic now desperate), and Vera's decision to confide her true method is the key tightening—she risks exposure to gain insight. The final beat, Marcus reaching for the Moon, narrows options: his shift from control-myths to surrender-myths is the data Vera seeks, and she measures it. Cost is legible on the page (his vulnerability, her mapping him as specimen). One meaningful escalation under the accumulative lens, sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake (forbidden knowledge pursuit) is signaled early and persists. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira discovers the Netharans' failure and must choose whether to attempt the ritual herself. However, the escalation lacks a visible trade-off—she succeeds without dramatized cost, and "anguished joy" arrives as delivered emotion rather than earned through a choice that forecloses options. The ritual's random-word method avoids showing tactical adaptation under constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: preserve crystallized hopes from the unbound shadow. Pressure tightens through Vera's three-month tracking and the comparison proof, then the shadow "tasting the edges" of dreams raises urgency. The resolution—placing the stone—feels slightly too neat; the shadow's immediate, benign transformation after acknowledgment undercuts the prior sense of threat. Vera's agency is real but soft: she offers rather than wrestles, and the cost (losing the stone) is visible but doesn't foreclose a painful alternative path for her personally.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clearly Vera's self-respect versus her capacity for compassion after betrayal. The tightening occurs when she decides to rebuild the enclosure tonight and report Marcus tomorrow, a choice that forecloses the option of either total despair or willful ignorance. Agency is visible in physical work (measuring twice, cutting once) and the decision to place the vial where she can see it—endurance with cost. The price is felt: she must accept that "some creatures slipped through despite her best efforts" while refusing to let that reality poison future care. No antagonist on the page; pressure is internal and situational, consistent with the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—escape before the second surgery and find the mother—is signaled early and tightens when Thomas must choose complicity. Plant whispers (fern warns of approaching footsteps, roots sense movement below) provide escalating intelligence that narrows options under causal pressure. The final reversal (sand begins to fall) delivers visible cost: Mira commits to the unknown descent, foreclosing safety. Agency is robust (her refusal, her reading of coffee rings, her enlistment of Thomas) and the price—risking deeper brain damage, confronting whatever killed her mother—is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—finding where unused love is stored—is signaled early and tightens through psychometric revelation. The midpoint turn (realizing this is a place to release, not retrieve) narrows options under the Accumulative lens. The final act of loading the film delivers agency through renunciation, but the price (what Vera loses or risks) remains abstract. No secondary pressure tests her commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity—is signaled early and pursued consistently. Elara's discovery of the instrument and her choice to turn the dial constitute one meaningful tightening. However, the escalation is thin: she faces no real obstacles, the release mechanism is simply found and turned, and the consequences (valley reawakening) occur off-page. The cost is conceptual (the astronomer's fear absolved, the instrument crumbles) rather than a trade-off Elara must navigate with visible personal price. No secondary pressure complicates her goal.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: rescue the probability child from temporal collapse. The discovery of the child at the summit provides a meaningful tightening (child from a burned branch "fell through"), and Mira's decision to "charm the probability field" and create a stabilizing pocket narrows options with visible cost (flowers dimming). The resolution is driven by Mira's agency (offering equations, folding space-time, extending her hand), though the mechanics of "whispering equations" and wave-function folding remain gestural rather than tactically specific. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens through building dread (seventeen years without dreams, burned forests, fractured world) that the child's rescue reweights, but the encounter lacks a moment where Mira must trade competing goods or face a loss that fundamentally alters her tactics going forward.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (choosing engagement over suppressants, rediscovering mental wildness) is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira discovers the dying tree and must decide whether to risk her talisman. However, the escalation lacks visible cost or failure before success—she attempts the repair and it works immediately, with no complication or trade-off dramatized on the page. The resolution (tree healed, boundary unraveled) feels more like discovery than agency under pressure. Coincidence (translocation delivers her to the exact tree that needs her exact gear) complicates setup but doesn't test her commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming unused courage—is signaled early but never tested by a live trade-off or visible price on the page. The ridgeway walk presents a series of reflective tableaux (university, job, mother's hand) without escalation or a choice that narrows options. The ending grants Mira all the flames without forfeiture; no credible loss shapes tactics. The guides' "gently persistent" presence offers companionship but no opposition, and coincidence (finding the guides) initiates the journey without agency-driven turn.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—safety versus song—signals early and tightens through the bellhop's risk, the bolt discovery, and Mira's choice. One meaningful reversal when she understands the mechanism imprisons her grandmother's voice, narrowing options from abstract cost to concrete action. The turn to remove the bolt is protagonist-driven agency with legible price: potential return of killing storms. Pressure coheres under the causal lens and the cost is visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (unmask the pretender) is signaled early and drives all moves. Escalation is modest: discovery of messages → interpretation → retrieval of evidence → placement. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira finds the misfiled genealogical record, narrowing her options to intervention. Agency is decision-based (she paints the rune, gathers documents, places them). Cost is visible: she breaks her long vigil pattern and acts in the mortal world. No reversal, but the lens (Causal-Accumulative) allows linear deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—discovering why reefs died—is signaled early and tightens when Marina realizes poison, not just warming, caused bleaching. The revelation narrows options (she can't undo damage but can expose it) and the transmission decision carries visible cost. Agency is decision with renunciation (can't resurrect coral). One meaningful deepening occurs when dumping coordinates overlay bleaching records, reweighting eleven years of assumptions. No antagonist required; pressure coheres through accumulating evidence and moral weight.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering meaning in the rebellion's collapse—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through Maya's solitary vigil, the stones' hum, and the vision of scattered comrades, though no reversal narrows options; instead density increases until the hum provides the reframing. The final choice to return barefoot with her message is earned by the stones' teaching, but the cost is more conceptual (the weight of being the messenger) than a visible forfeiture on the page. Under the Accumulative lens, the tightening is sufficient; agency is present in her decision to teach, though coincidence (the stones' hum) enables rather than tests her.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: preserve sacred heritage before reconstruction paves it over. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira decodes the script and realizes she must sing at a specific frequency—her cracked voice and arthritic body become live obstacles, narrowing options. The glass-shattering and embryo retrieval provide visible agency and cost (physical ordeal, three years' effort paid off). However, no on-page reversal truly tests her commitment; the plants guide without friction, the kite arrives by chance, and success follows smoothly once the song begins. The stakes remain abstract—"the reconstruction authorities" never materialize as concrete opposition, and no competing claim on the embryo forces a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Mariam can anchor optimism without false hope—is signaled early and sustained. The hawk freeze provides one meaningful tightening where the body's freeze response tests her somatic toolkit, and her recovery narrows options (she must stay present or collapse). The photograph ritual deepens rather than reverses, moving from Fatima's face to the earrings as iterative reweighting. Agency reads as endurance and micro-choice (tucking the photograph away, picking up tools), fitting Earned Stasis. The cost is legible in the acknowledgment that "the world could grow gentler. She also believed it might not." One gap: the escalation is more accumulative density than causal pressure—no live option is foreclosed until the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—Eleanor's inability to paint coherent portraits—is clear from the opening and tightens through the library's constriction. The pivot from seeking wholeness to embracing fragmentation deepens her understanding and forecloses her old method with visible cost. The box's contents provide a concrete puzzle that drives her realization. The walls' physical pressure amplifies urgency, though the resolution feels more conceptual than situationally tested; no external challenge contests her new approach.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (understanding time distortion to prevent future loss) is signaled early and sustained. One tightening occurs when the ink fades, revealing faces and confirming the substance's role, which narrows her hunt to the nomad scribes. The cost is largely retrospective (brother's death) rather than immediate; Seren's decision to pursue lacks a visible on-page trade-off or loss in this scene. Under the Accumulative lens, the deepening is sufficient, but the price at closure is conceptual more than felt in present action.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—whether to broadcast the letter—is signaled early and tightens when Vance appears, narrowing options to "within the blink that follows surprise." The upload is protagonist-driven agency with visible cost (grip, threats, unknown consequences). One clear reversal: Mira's finger hovers → Vance enters → she acts anyway, escalating from hesitation to irreversible commitment. The price (exile, retaliation against her mother) is legible and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—sustaining pacifist practice amid post-tower chaos—is signaled early and deepens when the soldier arrives, forcing Mira to enact her values under pressure. The knife-reach moment provides a micro-reversal that narrows options (violence vs. mercy), and her choice to tend him reweights the opening premise. However, the soldier's compliance is frictionless; he weeps and accepts care without resistance, so the tightening lacks a visible cost that would elevate escalation into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Maren seeks her daughter's final words to resolve the "splinter working its way toward her heart." The tightening occurs when Vela demands she voice silence—a paradox that tests Maren's cool temperament and forces her to release unspoken apologies and love. The price is visible: she must open the place where words she never spoke live, and the echo she receives carries both relief and "terrible and beautiful release." Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through the garden's shifting responses and the goddess's emergence, culminating in a charged exchange that reweights her grief with her daughter's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: whether to reveal or suppress the asteroid data. The journalist's call initiates pressure, the discovery escalates it, and Margaret's final decision to write "something in between" narrows options. However, the asteroid's safe passage by seventeen thousand kilometers drains urgency—her father carried real weight; Margaret's burden is lighter. Agency is present (she chooses suppression with a story), but the cost feels conceptual rather than visceral. One meaningful tightening occurs; no multiple reversals required at this length. Escalation is present but muted by the lowered stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—hushing generational guilt—is signaled early and coheres throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when Vera places the amber against the chamber and hears her mother's infant cry layered with her grandmother's apology, narrowing her goal to tattooing the constellation into the fold. However, escalation is primarily accumulative rather than agonistic: no on-page obstacle tests Vera's commitment, no reversal forces a trade-off, and the laboratory's mechanics enable her without friction. The ending forecloses her search (Earned Stasis), but the cost is conceptual acceptance rather than a visible price that alters tactics or sacrifices a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—"to discover meaning in the mess"—is signaled early and remains coherent. The mandala construction deepens the hush motif and the old man's arrival introduces mild friction ("You shouldn't be making that"), but his resistance softens without visible trade-off. No on-page reversal narrows options; Mira's stance crystallizes through realization rather than a pressured choice that forecloses a path. Under the Accumulative lens one meaningful intensification suffices, yet the cost at closure is conceptual and not felt on the page, capping the band.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: preserve mercy and memory against the regime's erasure, signaled early ("cradle empathy in arms of steel"). One meaningful tightening: Kira searches deeper through the stone's memory, finds the soldier's hesitation, then acts by carving his name—a decision that forecloses safety and defies the regime. The cost is visible (aching arms, slipping back into ruins under threat). Agency is decision and renunciation (she opposes the armed resistance's path). No requirement for explicit antagonist at this length; the regime's erasure pressure coheres throughout. Escalation is driven by protagonist choice under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Madeline seeks to "lure possibility from the brink of despair." The woman's despair radiates in "deep indigo waves," establishing the problem. One meaningful tightening occurs when the woman's grip on the tarot coin loosens and her shoulders straighten—a visible shift in posture under the accumulative pressure of the echoes. However, escalation is driven entirely by Madeline's uncontested action; the woman never resists, complicates, or makes a choice that raises cost. The resolution feels granted rather than earned through the woman's agency, and no visible price is paid by either character beyond Madeline's acceptance that "applause would never return."

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: find Daniel and understand the recall's true purpose. Pressure accumulates through discovery rather than confrontation; each somatic marker and textual clue tightens Maya's understanding and forecloses the option of ignoring the evidence. The hidden chamber reversal reweights the pharmaceutical company's motives (control, not telepathy) and crystallizes her commitment. Cost is felt but not yet paid on the page—she chooses pursuit knowing the danger—qualifying as Charged Poise under Accumulative lens. One turn (chamber discovery) is sufficient at this length, though the antagonist (company) remains off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—translating the silent languages humans miss—is signaled early and held throughout. Pressure accumulates via the fossil's impossible heat, the responding lights, and Vera's realization that she is answering a question asked 40,000 years ago. The piece delivers one meaningful deepening when the lights circle the fossil, transforming Vera's mission from solo mapping to interspecies bridge. However, no on-page reversal or difficult tradeoff tests her commitment; she receives wonder rather than wrestling with cost in the moment. The conceptual price (five years, the unknown depths she cannot follow) is stated but not dramatized as a present friction.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: prevent the forgetting. The cataloging produces one meaningful discovery—the constellation pattern—that reweights her understanding, qualifying as a deepening under the Accumulative lens. However, the turn from "prevent the end" to "found instructions for beginning" arrives through received wisdom (the jar's echo) rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Agency is passive reception; no live option is foreclosed on the page, and the "weight of responsibility" is declared rather than enacted in a trade-off or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: whether to engage Viktor's plea and carry forward intelligence that comes from her betrayer. Pressure tightens when the snow reveals "Watched. Come alone. Dawn," then deepens when Viktor offers the folder. Margaret's agency drives escalation: she prepares three extraction plans (prudently daring), makes the journey, and chooses to vouchsafe the intelligence despite withholding forgiveness. The final cost is visible—she shoulders old betrayals and new purposes—and forecloses the path of walking away or burning the folder. One meaningful reversal: her initial skepticism converted to action by Viktor's vulnerability and the folder's value.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: safe passage across a treacherous river, braided with the passenger's archival quest. Pressure tightens when the fog thickest and the gutters signal danger, then releases when they stop. The coachman's agency manifests in the needle gift, which forecloses his possession of the heirloom with visible cost. One clear tightening (middle fog danger) and one choice-driven turn at closure. No antagonist required; the river and fog provide coherent external pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake signaled early: understand why some places hold while the world fractures. Pressure coheres and deepens through the discovery sequence—ghost bee routes, the thrumming disc, the rush of timelines—culminating in the realization that stability is "movement refined, directed, made purposeful." The choice to stay and make a vessel forecloses her wandering search with on-page cost. One meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens is present; the cost of commitment is felt though quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Marina's need to "reflect light into dark corners" after the rosebush dies. One meaningful tightening occurs when she directs the reflected moonlight toward the stranger's window, a micro-choice that narrows her solitary mourning into witnessed connection. The stranger's face appearing and hand rising is a reversal that validates her gesture with visible cost (vulnerability, exposure). Agency is renunciation and endurance: she accepts the rosebush's death, plans future planting, and commits to "holding space" with no guarantee of bloom. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; no coincidental resolution. The cost is legible: she trades immediate comfort for long-term tending, embodied in the phrase "sometimes that had to be enough."

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—translating isolation into something else—is signaled early and tightens when Mira reinterprets Korvash's command from endurance to creation. One meaningful reversal occurs when the sundial triggers the stone circle, birthing the small creatures and reweighting her purpose from preservation to cultivation. Agency is renunciation: she abandons her vigil as memorial-keeper with the cost of releasing her role as "last contemporary." The pressure is Accumulative—the reincarnation memory deepens, the sundial's placement intensifies, and the creatures' arrival crystallizes a new stance. No explicit antagonist, but the centuries-long misunderstanding of her purpose creates friction.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: reconnecting to the thread/purpose behind her work. The pressure accumulates through observation (spheres offer "presence, not permanence"), deepens when she writes for herself for the first time in years, and culminates in the trade-off of releasing vulnerability (sphere) while keeping the anchor (nest). The cost is legible—public exposure of her emptiness—and forecloses the path of mechanical competence. One meaningful tightening (self-directed letter) is sufficient at this length under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—stopping the tricksters' manipulation before the station is demolished—is signaled early and tightens cleanly with the midnight deadline. The reversal when the signal "stutters" and the procession falters demonstrates protagonist agency; Mira's broadcast directly causes the shift. The cost is conceptual (she must remain vigilant, the tricksters will return) and visible on the page in her final scanning action. The escalation from isolation to transmission to signal decay follows a clear because/therefore chain. Minor: the opponents (Dean Morrison, the tricksters) remain largely off-stage abstractions; one on-page confrontation or adaptation by the tricksters during her broadcast would sharpen the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is clear: find the Meridian Key to unlock the archives. One meaningful tightening occurs when the organ reveals the horizontal passage, forcing Helena to crawl despite her claustrophobia—a choice that narrows options with embodied cost. The lock mechanism's discovery and the door opening constitute resolution, but the final sitting and photographing deflate urgency rather than deepen it. Coincidence does not resolve (the organ and compass work as seeded tools), but the grandmother's pre-mapped solution reduces Helena's agency at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—solving Elena's disappearance—is signaled early and pursued methodically. Yet the story lacks on-page escalation: Clara reviews photos, draws a sketch, and deduces the answer without encountering resistance, error, or a tightening choice. No reversal or cost attends her discovery; Marcus is long beyond legal reach, and Clara's tactics never shift. The promised "empathy" motivation does not generate friction or force a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (proving Elena's predictions to save lives) is signaled early and tightens once when Mira decodes the cycle and convinces Torres. However, escalation lacks a second meaningful pressure point—the Commander's conversion happens too easily without a reversal or complication that would force Mira to pay a visible price. The fourteen-month timeline creates urgency in concept but does not alter Mira's on-page tactics or force a trade-off. Agency is present (decoding, presenting evidence) but the resolution feels granted rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming an abandoned future—is signaled early and tightens through the hitchhiker's question and the glass-flake reveal. Margaret's descent is a clear choice with on-page cost (leaving the bridge, her fiddle "more securely" carried as she steps off pavement), but the escalation relies on magical permission rather than protagonist agency wrestling obstacles. The hitchhiker's vanishing and the cabin's waiting presence feel more like gifts than earned reversals; the story accumulates resonance but lacks a pressure point where Margaret must trade competing goods or face genuine friction.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: whether Elias can escape his father's legacy or must reckon with shared ground. The stone markers' reappearance narrows options, forcing the first caboose meeting. Pressure accumulates through the startup's rise (investors calling) and fall (pivot refusal), then tightens when Elias finds his father cataloging the currencies—each bill now mapped to a place neither will visit. Cost is visible: Elias's "possible escapes" become "promises neither would keep," and the final act of removing the bills forecloses the dream while opening reconciliation. Weakness: the startup collapse happens off-page in summary ("market shifted"), undercutting the agency requirement; coincidence (father waiting, having researched every bill) assists rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—decoding the inscriptions to understand Marcus's death and the family burden—is signaled early and coheres throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when the stellar patterns align with the temple photos, narrowing Mira's options to either publish or carry the secret alone. However, the escalation is more intellectual discovery than pressure-driven choice; coincidence (Marcus left photos, the stars happen to match) solves rather than complicates. The final decision to publish feels thematically inevitable but lacks on-page friction or visible trade-off that would demonstrate agency under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming her reflection/existence—is signaled early and drives every beat. Pressure escalates when Maren trades three years of lifespan for the seed, steps onto carnivorous vines under the vortex's scream, and confronts the frozen confession. The final choice (completing the unfinished sentence) is driven by protagonist agency and forecloses the guarded, fortress existence with felt cost. No multiple reversals, but the single tightening (reaching the tree, hearing her own incomplete confession, choosing to finish it) narrows options and reweights the premise under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—reaching the intersection of dreams—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the convergence, the dissolving maze, and the gathering of dreamers, but no reversal or tightening narrows options with visible cost. The topiary grows and the door appears without Mira sacrificing, risking, or losing a live resource; the seven arrive and agree without friction. The ending reconfigures meaning (Mira as anchor rather than traveler) but the shift reads as revelation rather than a choice that forecloses a path. Under the Accumulative lens one tightening suffices, yet the cost at closure remains conceptual and unexpressed in immediate stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming stolen destiny—signals immediately and tightens through negotiation. The Gardener's counteroffer creates meaningful reversal: not refund but sacrifice, trading certainty for purpose. Mira's acceptance forecloses the path of remaining empty but certain. The cost is concrete and on-page: grandmother's death coincides with the card crumbling, and Mira carries a "wounded bird" destiny forward. Agency is protagonist-driven under causal pressure throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: reclaiming purpose after public failure. Pressure accumulates through Val's entrance and her framing of her father's identical question, forcing Marcus to articulate an answer he hasn't yet lived. The tightening occurs when Val recognizes him from the viral video and reframes his tears as courage, narrowing his self-perception from humiliation to vulnerability-as-strength. Agency is decision: Marcus chooses to accept the invitation and walk toward the quarry floor, foreclosing his retreat into cataloging inertia. The cost is clear—he must face another carved memorial to lost music—but the visible price (his body moving toward exposure) charges the final image. One micro turn (Val's "takes courage" remark) sets up the closure without undermining the single meaningful deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (understanding transition's physics) is signaled early and tightens when Elena receives Vasil's tablet describing "spirit as charge, the body as vessel." The seed-planting decision narrows her options with visible cost: she forgoes return to the university for arbor work. One meaningful deepening occurs when she tastes the fruit and experiences Vasil's voice as "current through copper," reweighting her opening grief into practiced methodology. Agency is decision with renunciation; no explicit antagonist needed under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (preserve migrating identities) but pressure remains ambient rather than escalating. The fisherman's arrival, Mira's sorting, and their exchange do not narrow options or introduce a felt cost that alters her tactics. The piece deepens thematically—Mira's acceptance of her own migrating identity—but lacks a causal turn or tightening that forecloses a live alternative. The final stance ("she would remain, tending contradictions like a garden") is Earned Stasis, yet the endurance feels pre-decided rather than tested on the page. No reversal or complication forces a trade-off; the cycle is described as unchanging from the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake is clear: Elena's isolation and her unspoken regret over Marcus. The discovery of the shells tightens pressure by mirroring her own buried confession, and her decision to write and send the photo narrows options (she cannot unsend it). Marcus's reply and Elena's follow-up question deepen the emotional calculus. The cost is visible—Elena risks rejection and makes herself vulnerable—but the lack of on-page friction or hesitation at the closure beat keeps the escalation from feeling fully earned. The piece accumulates well but the final turn feels too clean.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—finding a path to self-forgiveness—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through memory, the decision to stop medication (which removes numbing but restores painful clarity), and the plan to return to the black stones. One meaningful deepening occurs when Maren realizes she's been "seeking... a path to self-forgiveness" in the graffiti, shifting from external absolution to internal acceptance. The final reconfiguration—"she no longer needed it to forgive her"—narrows options with visible cost: she must now carry the guilt and live with raw feeling. Agency is primarily reflective and decisional rather than agonistic, fitting the Accumulative lens, though a sharper on-page friction (e.g., physical difficulty playing the accordion, resisting the urge to leave) would elevate stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—finding and reading her mother's unspoken words—is signaled early and pursued throughout. Pressure accumulates through discovery beats (understanding the cipher, tracing emotional frequencies, finding the mother's book) rather than reversals. The second letter and the blank book with her own name introduce a meaningful tightening: she must also speak her own truths. Cost is present but muted—seventeen years of suspension and the act of unveiling—yet the emotional price feels more declarative than traded against a live alternative. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening is sufficient; the watch's forward motion marks the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled immediately: return the violin and validate empire, or refuse and face war. Pressure tightens through the promise's fading glow and Mira's discovery of a "perforation" in destiny. The final choice—playing the violin to propagate the song—narrows options with visible cost: the instrument shatters, she becomes forsworn and hunted. The decision is hers, driven by accumulated knowledge (coffee stains, fern counsel) and the renunciation forecloses the path of compliance.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—capture mother's essence before oblivion—is signaled early and tightens once (aurora intensifies, minutes before dissipation). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens. The resolution is protagonist-driven (Mira presses the chip to the light, wills the connection). However, no live obstacle complicates the ritual; the grotto and aurora cooperate without friction, muting the felt cost of success.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—Mira seeking the source of contentment—is signaled early and sustained. However, the piece lacks a meaningful tightening or reversal; Theron's death unfolds as expected ritual without complication, and Mira's realization arrives through reflection rather than a pressure point that narrows her options. The hairpin warming is a gentle accumulation rather than a turn that forecloses a path. Under the Accumulative lens one deepening shift is sufficient, but here the "understanding" is told more than dramatized with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is Sera's guilt over stopping the search, signaled early and maintained. Pressure tightens through the keeper's question ("You've already searched…what you want now is permission to stop") and the reframing of the hollow mirror, which narrows Sera's live options from compulsive searching to acceptance. The cost is legible: Sera must bear the ambiguity of her sister's choice, and the keeper continues her isolating work. Under the Situational lens, the stance crystallization is sufficient, though escalation is modest—one meaningful turn rather than layered reversals. Agency belongs to Sera's acceptance and the keeper's counsel, both enacted on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: Vara must learn to make her vanished people reappear. The pressure coheres across eleven months of training and tightens when Elowen finally reveals the method via the pool demonstration; this deepening reweights all prior waiting and transforms her understanding from absence-as-subtraction to absence-as-interference. The resolution is earned by Vara's readiness and Elowen's designed withholding. Cost is legible: Elowen will vanish, Vara must execute alone. Agency is decision and future action, with visible trade-offs on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—passing knowledge before Vessa's immobility becomes permanent silence—is signaled early and tightens when the wandering pulse appears. The invitation to climb and "stop climbing forever" articulates a visible cost: the student will surrender motion as Vessa did. However, the escalation relies on coincidental arrival rather than protagonist agency; Vessa's humming guides but does not force a choice under competing pressures. The cost is legible in the final image but not tested by conflicting options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—finding meaning the automatons can't replicate—is signaled early and maintained. The piece delivers one meaningful deepening when Mara stops mid-extraction and reconceives her goal, a tightening consistent with Accumulative design. However, the escalation is more conceptual than concrete: the climb itself poses little visible cost or adaptive pressure, and the core conflict (Mara vs. her impulse to take the keystone) materializes abruptly rather than building through resistant beats. The Academy's closure and automaton dominance provide context but exert no on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—discovering what Elena hid—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when Marcus finds the journal and uncorks the vial, narrowing his options to either remain ignorant or bear unbearable knowledge. The uncorking is protagonist-driven agency with visible cost: he now sees every lie and every truth painted in color, a burden made explicit in "too luminous for unprepared eyes." The escalation is meaningful but operates through accumulation and discovery rather than a second reversal; one deepening suffices at this length. The memorial festival provides situational pressure (he should be with his daughter) that heightens the personal cost of his choice.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (achieving wavelength alignment) is signaled early and remains coherent under the Accumulative lens. One meaningful tightening occurs: the three casting sequences progress from reading alignment to translating backwards prophecy to final certainty when coins land on edge. However, the escalation lacks a visible tradeoff or cost that narrows options—Mira's doubt evaporates rather than being overcome through sacrifice. The resolution is driven by cosmic convergence (coins landing impossibly, amber glowing) rather than protagonist agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake signaled early: a reaper "shattered" by forbidden love seeks relief from the weight of unfinished human words. The tightening occurs when she moves from passive haunting ("fragments she could not unhear") to active completion of the sentences, narrowing her options from impossible resurrection to possible coexistence with loss. Agency drives the turn: her choice to finish the phrases ("Tell my daughter I loved her beyond measure") generates the crystallization and transforms residue into "small monuments to sacrifice." Cost is visible—she accepts Elias's permanent absence and her own continued duty, foregrounding a path with the weight she'll carry forward.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—restore cosmic flow before reality stagnates—is signaled early and remains coherent. Corin's agency drives the escalation: he chooses to attempt the ritual despite two prior failures, measures the bell's fractures, and "pours his understanding" into the cracks. The tightening occurs when the bell begins to warm and the drip starts, narrowing the outcome to success or final failure. Cost is visible in the fragility of the solution ("barely a whisper") and the brittleness of his devotion. The bell's ring is not a miracle but "just barely, plausibly possible," which fits the textural accumulation and leaves the repair precarious.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (Martha confronting her father's abandonment vs. the protective lie) is clear. The photograph trail supplies one meaningful deepening: each image tightens the noose of evidence until the Chicago platform shot forecloses her prior narrative. However, this deepening is discovery-driven rather than protagonist-driven; Martha follows clues rather than making choices that narrow her options. The closure decision—to share the true story—carries visible cost (community upheaval, personal grief), but it arrives after the turn rather than precipitating it. No major reversal tests commitment; the escalation is textural accumulation rather than pressured agency.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Elara's irreversible transformation to fuse logic and intuition. The piece accumulates pressure through ritual preparation (visiting the orchard, reading the starlings, flaming the crystal) and one meaningful tightening when the starlings tell her "it was time," forcing her to proceed. Agency is present in her decision to flame the crystal with "the warmth of intention," though the transformation itself unfolds passively ("felt her analytical mind expanding"). The cost is legible—the crystal dissolves, her mother's physical gift consumed, and she crosses into "everything that would come next" irrevocably changed. Under the Accumulative lens, the escalation is sufficient for this length, but the peak moment lacks high-stakes friction or a live competing option that she visibly forecloses.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (preserve trust while reading unprecedented patterns) is signaled early and tightens through Vera's revision sequence. The partial-evacuation decision narrows options with visible cost: Ash's warning about panic, the risk of admitting ignorance, and the fragile trust threatened. Agency is clear—Vera's renunciation of false certainty forecloses the comfortable path her mother took. The six-hour vigil compresses into summary rather than a second on-page beat, slightly muting the escalation's final pressure point before the thermal anomalies dissipate. One meaningful tightening present; cost legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake (custody of the brain) is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Kira reframes the conflict ("stop fighting over custody of your future selves"), but this is a restatement rather than a reversal that narrows options. The resolution (leave the brain in sanctuary, train together) is imposed by Kira rather than earned by the clones' agency. Cost is prospective (years of training) rather than paid in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—tending to the unspoken to dissolve silence—is signaled early and tightens through Victor's escalating attempts to sing broken lullabies despite fracture and tears. One meaningful deepening: the off-key songs macerate against the walls, forcing him to hear every crack, which earns the final decision to call Margaret. The cost is visible (weeping, vocal breakdown) and forecloses the prior path of silence. No requirement for multiple reversals at this length; the single escalation through acoustic suffering is sufficient under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (Maren's isolation vs. connection) is signaled early and tightens when the woman collapses weeping. The woman's arrival creates one meaningful pressure point that forces Maren to choose between maintained stillness and vulnerable companionship. Cost is visible: inviting the woman means abandoning the protective ice-logic that kept Maren sane for seventeen years. The escalation is somewhat gentle for an 8+ score—it's a deepening through accumulation rather than a sharp reversal—but the final choice to "not wait alone" forecloses her prior path with undeniable emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (save Petra from the Vermillion Succession) is signaled early and sustains pressure throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when the crozier begins to glow and transform, narrowing Maren's path to the Hall confrontation with visible cost: her remaining life-essence and likely death. The seventeen failed transmutations provide escalation context, though they remain off-page. Agency is clear: Maren's decision to pour her life-essence and her successive approximation method drive the resolution. The final consequence (contract severed, empire's engines starved) is legible, though the spread to "other families" ventures beyond immediate on-page stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (receive celestial signals during perigee) is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful reversal: initial static "like screaming" forces her to discard filters and reverse amplification, a decision with immediate cost (abandoning "comfortable notion that communication meant words"). The lunar perigee functions as a live constraint, and her agency—stripping assumptions, removing interference filters—drives the tightening. The closure lands with felt cost: she records "only shadows," will attempt translation tomorrow, but gains "strange peace" that forecloses her prior need for verbal meaning. Coincidence (moon timing) complicates but does not resolve; her technical choices enable reception.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: passengers trapped between departure and arrival. One meaningful tightening when Mara pours the hourglass, narrowing options (act now or remain liminal forever). Agency is decision with on-page cost: the splitting pain and her permanent role as witness. The escalation reads under the Accumulative lens—density builds through radio voices, pattern alignment, and the grotto shudder. Minor: the passengers' flickering is described but never tested as a complication; Mara's choice feels inevitable rather than forced by competing pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (reclaiming/understanding the gallery) is signaled early and tightens through one major reversal: the mirrors show not fragmented identity but the web of connections she's traced, shifting her goal from discovery to deliberate reclamation. The gathering of thread narrows options (she can't wander indefinitely) and the final knotting forecloses the chaotic state with visible cost: her architecture is now "smaller, contained entirely within the web." Agency is clear—her weaving creates stability—and the price (containment, a bounded home) is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—learning a navigation paradigm that expands consciousness—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure tightens when Tessek dims the lights and Vara perceives edge geometry, narrowing her old worldview and opening the new. The final act (setting down the chain link) is Vara's choice with visible opportunity cost: she abandons mastery for perpetual studenthood. One micro turn (starlight resolving into relationships) deepens understanding without diffusing focus. Agency is clear; coincidence does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—Margaret's need for forgiveness—is signaled early, but escalation is minimal: Vera listens, translates, and the pulse "softens" without reversal or complication. No tightening narrows Vera's options; the hearing aid works on first attempt, and Ruth's response is cooperative rather than conflicted. The phrase "incidental heroism" names the lack of agency: Vera "hadn't sought to save anyone" and becomes a bridge "without intending to." Closure arrives via告sentiment rather than a choice that forecloses a live path. One small deepening occurs when the pulse strengthens at "jealous" and "afraid," but this is observational rather than a turn driven by protagonist decision.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—bearing witness to the unremembered—is signaled early and pursued consistently, but no on-page tightening forces a trade-off. The tidal window is mentioned twice (twelve hours in backstory, two hours at return) yet never counts down or alters Mira's moves. Each discovery (body, codex, final body count) accumulates without a reversal; the ascent is "harder" physically but not tactically. Closure fulfills the stated mission without foreclosing a live alternative, and the cost (exhaustion, emotional weight) is felt but not legible as a choice that narrows options. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens but does not escalate.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming scattered identity fragments—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, escalation is weak: Mira arrives with a plan, pours ink, watches patterns, and succeeds without meaningful resistance or cost that alters tactics. The ritual unfolds as intended with no on-page reversal or tightening that narrows options. The ending's weight rests on thematic assertion ("carrying her failures like lanterns") rather than a choice that forecloses a path. Under Accumulative lens, one deepening shift is sufficient, but the ink-watching lacks the pressure needed to enter high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—resurrect the dying language—is signaled early and sustained. The protagonist drives escalation: she chooses to use the cursed diamond, interprets the birds' patterns, and speaks the recovered words. The climax (language resurrection) is earned by her agency. Cost is present but soft: the diamond shatters (no ownership claim made), but we don't see her tactics or options materially narrow before the end—she succeeds on first attempt. One meaningful tightening occurs (diamond channels rather than silences), but the path from problem to solution compresses quickly without visible friction or failure.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Maren's need to prove cryptid existence and vindicate her dismissed research—is signaled early and tightens when she realizes Samuel became the phenomenon. The arrowhead and phone confession create one meaningful reversal that narrows her options: exploit the discovery bitterly or honor it with wonder. The cost is legible (years more research, continued scoffing, Samuel's eternal incompleteness) and Maren's agency drives the resolution. However, the escalation could press harder—the choice arrives somewhat easily without a dramatized moment of temptation toward bitterness that she must actively resist on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—playing forbidden music without recalibration—is signaled early and escalates when the statue climbs. Mira's agency (choosing to signal via heartbeat rather than submit) drives the turn. However, the escalation relies heavily on a deus ex: her months of practice and the existence of a hidden network are told rather than tested on-page before the climax. The cost at closure (statues cracking, system ending) is conceptual and collective rather than a personal, visible price Mira pays. The synchronization of "others" happens off-stage, reducing the felt immediacy of the final stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: reconnecting separated families. One meaningful tightening: the daughter's realization that her letters were intercepted narrows her understanding from abandonment to systemic separation, altering her emotional stance. Marcus's agency is renunciation—he continues despite no progress on his own father's return. The closing image ("Somewhere, a drone hummed past overhead, scanning for presence. It found nothing") crystallizes his method's cost: perpetual ghosthood. Escalation is modest but coherent under the Accumulative lens; the piece deepens rather than reverses.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—regaining voice or accepting silence—is signaled early and tightens when Marcus discovers the halo and recording. One meaningful deepening occurs: he pushes through damaged vocal cords and produces broken song, accepting imperfection. The cost is legible (rough notes, ongoing repair work, solitude). However, the escalation is smooth rather than jagged; no reversal tests his commitment, and the wind bells + phonograph arrive as gifts rather than obstacles he must navigate or sacrifice to obtain.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—finding the literal place where stories live—is signaled early and pursued on-page. The geometry shift and reawakening memories constitute one meaningful tightening that narrows Eleanor's path to the impossible room. Agency appears in her choice to walk by instinct and later to continue cataloging, foreclosing the search phase with felt cost. Yet the escalation reads more as atmospheric deepening than a turn that raises price; no live option is tested and refused, and Eleanor never faces a competing pull (e.g., a patron's need, a deadline, a personal cost of staying). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens but remains gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—capturing the vanishing dream—is signaled immediately and tightens through escalating loss ("could no longer remember if her mother's hair had been dark or gray"). The fog morning provides a meaningful turn: Miriam almost doesn't climb, then chooses to despite conditions. The photograph's success forecloses her obsessive chase with visible cost: she continues the ritual, her mother remains incomplete. Agency is present in repeated attempts under worsening conditions. One reversal (fog breakthrough) is sufficient for this length and accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: free Elena's voice. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira realizes she cannot simply unlock the idea but must transform it, raising the conceptual cost. The nexus whispers alternate futures to disorient, but Mira's counter—focusing on the ribbon—feels more like narrated competence than a visible struggle that forecloses an option. The resolution is driven by Mira's agency (she rewrites the mechanism), yet the exact trade-off or what she risks/loses in that rewriting is not legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (recover stolen memories) is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful reversal: Elara finds the void in the constellation pattern, lifts the mushroom, discovers the jar. Opening it forecloses the path of forgetting with visible cost ("she remembered now why her grandmother had hidden the memories: to protect them from the same force"). Agency is enacted (unscrewing the lid) and the resolution—committing to gather memories before they can be stolen again—flows from her choice. No explicit antagonist, but the "hungry forgetting" pressure coheres throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to reverse Kael's exile—is signaled early and pressure tightens through the tea-leaf analysis, which narrows Mira's uncertainty into resolve. The decision moment carries conceptual cost (responsibility, future scrutiny) but the visible price remains somewhat abstract; we see her sign the document but the immediate sacrifice or trade-off is diluted by the forward-looking final paragraph. The restriction ("minimum two years") adds a concrete constraint, yet the climactic beat leans on summary ("tomorrow...ready to teach") rather than a present-tense forfeiture that alters her situation on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving wonder in the threshold garden—is signaled early and tightens when colors begin to fade. The single meaningful turn occurs when Marek plants the seed and begins gathering essence, narrowing his tactics to this patient witnessing. The cost (his remaining life, his solitude, the risk of failure) is felt at closure when he commits to continuing the work knowing "someone else would find this threshold place eventually."

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—Mira's need to ground spirits and reclaim her craft—is signaled early and tightens when she begins unraveling. The escalation is causal: each knot she loosens releases a confession, Callum's form softens, and her hands steady in parallel. Cost is visible: she must "trade silences," confessing her own guilt to free the spirits, and the act forecloses seamless restoration—she will now "leave the cracks visible." The pressure is driven by protagonist agency (threading the needle, choosing to unravel rather than mend) and narrows her options toward acceptance rather than erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to recommend sealing or opening the chapel—is signaled early and shapes Elena's methodical review. One meaningful tightening occurs when the stone faces show impossible new expressions of "grief... or recognition," forcing her to choose between dismissing the evidence and honoring what "the evidence suggested." The final decision to type "until dawn" forecloses retreat with temporal and professional cost. Agency is decision and endurance under accumulative pressure. Escalation is subtle but present: the coincidental changes (pigment, expressions) complicate but do not resolve; Elena's interpretive stance crystallizes the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is Eleanor's search for understanding grief's physics, signaled early and sustained. Pressure tightens when she finds the snow globe and captain's pages, which force her to confront her own holding-on versus the captain's surrender. One clear reversal: her professional detachment gives way to personal reckoning, and the cost is visible—she must internalize a lesson that demands she release the dead while carrying their artifacts forward. Agency is strong; her decision to secure the items and rise is active renunciation of her prior grip.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—giving voice to the ghost's unspoken needs—is signaled early and tightens through the courtyard encounter. The ghost's question "HELP ME REMEMBER WHAT I NEEDED" forces Mira's interpretive choice, and her song narrows options by merging the ghost into permanence. The cost is felt: the ghost dissolves, and Mira inherits isolation by choosing to encode herself in secret murals. Under the Accumulative lens, the pressure builds through fragments → full manifestation → song → dispersal, with the final renunciation (rarely singing aloud, painting in secret) foreclosing direct connection.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will release the preserved memories and restore Lady Vesper's joy—is signaled by midpoint and resolved on the page. However, escalation is minimal: Mira encounters no friction, doubt, or cost during her ascent; each diary entry smoothly affirms her course. The story deepens understanding (accumulative pressure) but lacks a moment where a live option is foreclosed or a trade-off forced. Lady Vesper's transformation provides emotional payoff, but Mira herself risks nothing and loses nothing in the act of releasing the jars, reducing the felt cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—finding meaning after professional and personal tether-breaking—is signaled early and tightens through Elena's catalog work. One meaningful deepening occurs: her emotional cloud taxonomy evolves from "grief, perhaps madness" to "a way to memorialize the invisible," reweighting her purpose. Agency manifests as sustained attention and notation that forecloses conventional meteorology, with the cost being permanent separation from the mainland world. The pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, building density until the final commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: Find what the scholars hid before demolition. The coin's tactile map tightens pressure by guiding Elara deeper; discovering the manuscript and theorem is a meaningful deepening that reweights her understanding of limits. Agency is present (she decodes, searches, draws, walks away with the knowledge) but the escalation is gentle—no live opposition or reversals, only accumulative discovery. The cost is conceptual (the tree's loss, the failed mirroring project) rather than a personal forfeiture that alters her tactics or future options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (understand the ship's secrets, then chart the luminance) is signaled early and escalates through pattern-solving to live observation. The coordinate revelation narrows options: she must record now or lose the phenomenon. Agency is present in her choice to work through the night with instruments rather than passively wait for rescue. The luminance's appearance is coincidental timing but complicates rather than solves—she still needs rescue, but now possesses transformative data. One meaningful tightening: hopscotch → cipher → coordinates → luminance collapses her isolation into discovery with visible cost (exhaustion, thirty pages, solitary vigil). The final image reweights her abandonment into professional triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—learning the rhythm of repair—is signaled early and tightens when Mira finds the prophecy and vial. The mirrors offer a clear escalation beat: they show three possible futures, forcing her to choose between frozen indecision, opening the vial, or walking away. Her agency drives the turn: uncapping the vial is her decision under pressure, not coincidence, and it forecloses the path of avoidance with visible cost (the released sound cannot be contained). The final image of the clock tower ticking demonstrates consequence scaled appropriately to this length, showing repair as transformation rather than simple restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—maintaining the colony's fragile peace through collective effort—is signaled early but remains abstract. No on-page reversal or tightening occurs; Elara finds the message, acts on it, leaves her own message, and receives affirmation without a narrowed option or trade-off. The ghost's guidance is always correct and costless, rendering escalation inert. The "brambled hope" metaphor in reflection asserts difficulty ("thorned") but no on-page choice tests commitment to that claim with a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Mira's effort to send the lullaby across time—is signaled by midpoint and coheres under the Accumulative lens. However, the hands "nearly converged" at the start, yet no on-page obstacle or tightening pressure tests Mira's ability to complete the adjustment; she begins the work and it succeeds without reversal or cost-imposing choice. The "frozen at one second to midnight" outcome averts catastrophe, but we don't see what Mira sacrificed or what option she foreclosed by choosing this particular adjustment over another. Agency reads as execution of a pre-calculated plan rather than a decision under competing pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear and urgent: guide travelers to safety before frost ices the paths. The nut's use to reactivate the birds constitutes a meaningful tightening that narrows options and raises the cost of failure. Agency is visible: Maren's decision to mark the path and her physical act of pulling them up drive the rescue. The timeframe (frost approaching) imposes real constraint. Slight deduction: the travelers themselves remain passive recipients; no secondary pressure or complication from their actions tests Maren's commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—finding meaning after Elena's death through her work—is clear early. The ravine observation provides one meaningful tightening: Mira shifts from designing materials that "never let go" to creating temporary scaffolds. However, the three-month work montage and the successful test arrival feel summarized rather than pressure-tested on the page. No on-page obstacle or failed attempt forces a trade-off; the insight leads directly to success. The escalation reads more as conceptual deepening than contested agency under the Accumulative lens, meeting baseline but not high-band pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: Vera seeks "the place where stories begin." Pressure accumulates through her solitary preparation (moonlight dripping, incising patterns) and tightens when the first visitor arrives with "a book with missing pages." The child's act of writing provides one meaningful turn that crystallizes Vera's realization, though it is passive observation rather than protagonist-driven escalation. Cost is present but oblique—her bracelet dims and she "barely noticed," suggesting the quantified rehabilitation gives way to organic connection, yet the tradeoff between her quest and this moment lacks visible friction or forfeited option on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—releasing toxic remorse—is signaled early and tightens when the pavilion offers total subsumption. The reversal (tasting emptiness in the coral, pulling back) is earned by her gift and narrows options to surgical deposit. Agency is clear: she chooses what to keep versus release, and the cost appears immediately in touching Cassius and later cooking without trembling. The garrison cooking scene demonstrates the trade-off's permanence. No coincidence resolves; her curse led her here and her decision reshapes her future.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—acoustic connection of the silos—is signaled early but proceeds without escalation, complication, or cost. Elena's broadcast succeeds immediately ("Elevator Seven's response travel[s]… Elevator Twelve… pick[s] up the frequency"), and no reversal tests commitment. The "rehabilitation is working" declares victory midway without dramatizing resistance or trade-off. Coincidence may complicate but does not resolve; here, nothing complicates at all.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—to excavate and preserve abandoned dreams—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens is minimal; Vera arranges equipment, activates the interface, and receives memories without encountering resistance, cost, or complication. The "quaking reverie" delivers the promised experience but no reversal or deepening that tests her commitment or narrows options. No visible price is paid on the page—no physical toll, relational sacrifice, or foreclosed path—leaving the transformation asserted rather than dramatized. The piece lacks the one meaningful tightening or choice with felt cost required even at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (finding forgotten combinations) is signaled immediately and sustained throughout. The gravity inversion at the chamber's center delivers one meaningful tightening that narrows options and reveals the sequences. Elara's agency drives the outcome—she positions herself, waits, interprets the revealed geometry—but the escalation is more unveiling than struggle; no on-page reversal forces a trade-off between competing goods. The decision to leave her own doodle shows forward commitment, yet the cost (carrying dangerous knowledge, choosing which doors to open) is conceptual and future-facing rather than paid in a visible forfeiture during the scene. Strong setup and clean single deepening, but lacks the visible price at closure that would push into 8+ bands.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (restore music to the silent world) is signaled early and tightens when months of failure force a conceptual reversal. The stress-crack discovery is a meaningful deepening that changes her approach from outward transmission to inward conduction. The final playing is an act of agency with implicit cost (she commits to teaching a harder method, accepts the silence as permanent). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, though a more visceral trade-off would elevate this further.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—renew the eclipsed covenant by documenting the nexus—is signaled early and coherent under the Accumulative lens. However, no on-page reversal or external pressure tests her commitment; she arrives, waits, writes, and departs as planned. The memory of her exiled student and the knight-sacrifice lesson add thematic texture but do not narrow present options. Agency is present (she chooses to document and to seek another exile) but the cost is future-facing and told rather than felt. One deepening occurs when she realizes she must "correlate her loneliness with theirs," yet it lacks immediate friction or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—unlocking her sister's secret and understanding Margot's departure—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure tightens when Vera moves from striking forks to speaking forgiveness, a micro-turn that narrows her options from force to surrender. The clasp opening is a Resonant Reconfiguration, reweighting the seventeen-year grief into acceptance of unknowing. Cost is present but muted: she forgoes the sister's words and accepts permanent mystery, though the ending's "weeping with something that felt remarkably like joy" softens the tradeoff. One meaningful deepening occurs; no multiple reversals, which fits the Accumulative lens, but the escalation is more internal cadence shift than a visible foreclosure of paths.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: to gain wisdom through the corpse flower, which Mira frames as transforming practitioner into master. One meaningful tightening: the flower's 48-hour lifespan forces immersion in its stench and lesson. Her endurance through two nights, breathing the smell, narrows options to full acceptance or retreat. The final choice—leaving with the seed—forecloses the safer path of staying in serenity. Agency is clear; cost is the burden of cultivation and return to the turbulent world. Secondary accent: professional reputation, understated.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—finding resilience to save her family's orchards—is signaled early and tightens when Maren discovers her grandmother's artifact, then deepens when she realizes the source cannot be taken. The gravity inversion creates urgency but functions more as spectacle than tactical constraint. The final choice (plant, not harvest) forecloses the easy solution with visible cost, though the path from touch to understanding compresses agency.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clearly signaled: prevent the next container death. One meaningful tightening occurs when readings at the death site confirm her theory, raising the cost of being ignored. Agency is present in her choice to continue despite dismissal, but this is endurance rather than a difficult pivot. The escalation relies more on accumulative evidence than a dramatic reversal—she documents, confirms, and persists. Pressure remains coherent under a causal lens, though the lack of a moment forcing her to risk something immediate (her job, her safety in a concrete way) keeps this from the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—proving wonder is essential by ringing the bell—is signaled early. The climb and arrival build anticipation, but the central action (conducting the aurora) proceeds without meaningful resistance, reversal, or visible cost. The Council is named as opposition but never applies on-page pressure. Meren succeeds smoothly; the bell "completed" the silence without forcing a trade-off or requiring her to forfeit anything tangible. One tightening moment—her realization that "silence had been an unfinished work"—shifts understanding but does not narrow her options or impose a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—harvesting insight from catastrophic failure to prepare for the next veil breach—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure tightens through Mira's choice to uncase the forbidden relic, defying Master Verren's deathbed oath; the flute use forces her into the moment of collapse, where she witnesses the critical flaw. The reversal is subtle but decisive: understanding shifts from "harmony failed" to "discord is required," which narrows her future options and charges her solitude with purpose. The cost is legible: broken vow, isolation, and the burden of dangerous knowledge. Agency drives escalation; coincidence does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake: complete the "great work" (emotional equation) before stars vanish. The halo fragment intensifies borrowed grief and triggers the transposition insight, which reads as one meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. However, Mira's agency at closure is continuation, not renunciation or decision that forecloses a path. The timeframe creates ambient pressure but doesn't force a trade-off; she simply keeps printing with new understanding, so the escalation lacks a visible price that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake: transform the pendant from object to living myth by extending encounters. The design is accumulative—each monastery visit deepens luminescence and witness—but all prior beats occur off-page, leaving only the ridgeway pause and Maren's realization on the page. One meaningful tightening: her trembling eases as she grasps her role. Agency is present (she chooses to continue with devotion), yet no live option is visibly foreclosed; the cost is asserted ("coax wonder," "gave an ancient relic the time it needed") rather than dramatized as a trade-off or loss. The seven-monastery circuit lacks on-page pressure tests.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—proving that objects absorb emotions—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure deepens when Elara realizes documentation "would convince no one who wasn't ready" and shifts to personal honoring. One meaningful tightening: the melting frost creates time pressure and forecloses reproducibility, forcing the renunciation of publication. The cost (abandoning scientific proof) is legible but could be more viscerally felt; the shift reads as acceptance rather than struggle. Agency is present but contemplative rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (delivering the message across impossible distance) is signaled early and sustained. The piece accumulates pressure through backstory density and the grandmother's deathbed charge, then tightens when Mei arranges the puzzle frame and begins the ritual. The final choice—becoming thread—narrows all options irreversibly. Under the Accumulative lens, the turn is the cadence shift from preparation to transformation. Cost is legible (Mei dissolves) but largely conceptual; the sacrifice feels pre-accepted rather than tested by a live dilemma or competing want. Agency is present but muted by the sense of inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (restore the orchards) is signaled early and drives the descent. The encounter with the crystalline woman offers one meaningful turn—Oren trades mystery (the silk) for practical knowledge—but the bargain itself lacks on-page tension or competing options; she simply accepts and he receives. The years of forge-work and grafting are compressed into summary, so the escalation from first plow to restored settlement happens off-page. Under the Accumulative lens, one tightening (the bargain) narrows his path, but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—discovering why her mother disappeared—is signaled immediately and tightens when the surge allows Mira to witness the past argument. The vision delivers a reversal: her mother didn't abandon her but chose a fatal mission. Agency at closure is clear: Mira steps into the rift, accepting the same toxic path. The cost is legible (she will die mapping safe routes) and forecloses survival, though the escalation occurs mostly via revelation rather than protagonist tactical struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—protect the letter chain when there is no keeper—signals early and tightens through discovery (stones, reading letters, feeling the presence). Maren's agency is decisive: she rebuilds the cairn, adds her letter, and commits vocally. The cost is legible: her silence, defining her for eleven years, is forfeited. One tightening suffices at this length. Minor issue: the ghost's yearning complicates but does not test Maren's resolve in a concrete exchange; the pressure is largely internal and accumulative rather than interactive.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake: maintain the compact between humanity and weather. The Herald's action—lighting the wick, calling the storms—is consistent with her goal, but no on-page complication forces a trade-off or narrows options. The storms answer, the rain falls "exactly where she had called them," and she will "climb again" tomorrow. No visible price is paid; no live alternative is foreclosed. Under the Accumulative lens, escalation would require a density increase or cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost; here the beat remains steady from ignition to dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: understand Mei-Lin's gift and whether Senna inherits it. The confession moment provides one tightening—words escape, proving the heart's power—but the choice to stay for the solstice lacks a visible trade-off or cost that forecloses an alternative path. Pressure accumulates texturally (notebooks, wing, sun trails) rather than through escalating decisions. Senna's agency in the final beat is assertion ("I'll stay") without dramatized resistance, competing desire, or on-page sacrifice that would elevate the stakes into the 8+ range.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding Vestris's note and the quantified sorrow—is signaled early and tightens when the sextant heals and she realizes trees witness rather than steal. The deconstruction choice narrows options (she commits to mapping dreams, foreclosing simple maintenance), and the cypress-held forty-one units establishes visible cost: some sorrows remain perpetual. Agency is clear in the assembly and the kneeling acceptance. Escalation is accumulative rather than reversals, fitting the lens, though one more mid-story pressure point would lift this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (rekindling the dying realm) is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful deepening: Elara's discovery that memories live in the mica, enabling the light-web. Her agency (singing, swaddling windows) forecloses isolation and transforms the greenhouse into a transmission node with visible cost. The "darkness pressed harder" beat adds external pressure but remains somewhat abstract. Escalation is driven by protagonist action under the Accumulative lens, and the cost—loss of individual selfhood—is unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Miriam seeking to understand her decades of hiding—is signaled early. However, escalation is minimal: she receives the book, hears the librarian's reframing, and accepts it without meaningful resistance or trade-off. No live option is foreclosed on the page; the "peace" that replaces guilt arrives without visible cost or tactical shift. The lens (Accumulative) allows for deepening, but the turn lacks the pressure required to enter higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—resisting collective forgetting through preservation—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates under the Accumulative lens: the bread discovery, her family's split memory, and the decision to plant wheat seeds tighten her mission from passive observation to active preservation. One meaningful deepening occurs when she moves from holding the bread as evidence to committing seeds to soil, which forecloses the option of mere witnessing. The cost is legible: her solitude, the uncertainty of growth or discovery, and the weight of remembering alone. No causal reversal is required under this lens, and the accumulative design succeeds.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (which vow to preserve) is signaled early and tightens through measurement, winnowing dead promises from live ones. The discovery of the child's vow provides one meaningful deepening that forecloses other options with visible cost—centuries of work dissolve while one point of light survives. Agency is clear: Elara's choice to capture that specific vow drives closure. The trade-off is legible on the page (all other vows lost), though the escalation relies more on accumulation than sharp reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving the truce by stopping the recording exchange—is signaled early and coheres through the chase. The story delivers one meaningful tightening when Eliza intercepts the cylinder after two prior failures, but the escalation reads as procedural success rather than a choice that trades one live option for another. The courier and assistant offer minimal resistance, and no secondary pressure (e.g., a rival recognizing her, a time crunch forcing a visible sacrifice) raises the cost of success. Agency is present but the final act feels more like execution than a decision under fire.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—learning why some carry weather—is signaled early and pursued consistently. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens relies on the three weather-carriers' arrival and their exposition about Vera's brother and her own role, not on Vera's agency narrowing options or forcing trade-offs. The brother's story and the aspens' electoral victory are recounted, not dramatized; Vera's acceptance of the leaf and her recognition lack a visible price or foreclosed alternative. One meaningful deepening occurs (Vera realizes she carries invisible weather), but the cost is asserted ("her future on the leaf's surface") rather than felt in a specific consequence or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Maren will finally create art or remain bound by paternal prohibition—is signaled early and tightens when she finds the broken lock and incomplete portrait. The escalation is causal (discovery → recognition → choice) and the final act of drawing forecloses suppression with visible cost (tears, hours passing). The broken lock serves as a meaningful reversal: her grandmother destroyed it rather than open it again, deepening the pressure on Maren's choice.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake is legible: solve the mystery of her father and her mother's unfinished letter. The map assembly and tunnel journey provide one meaningful tightening as options narrow. However, escalation is largely informational rather than pressure-driven—no live obstacles or reversals force trade-offs. The playback recording delivers the answer without requiring Mei Lin to risk, renounce, or endure anything tangible on the page. The inscription at closure reconfigures meaning but lacks a visible price (time, safety, secrecy) that would demonstrate agency under constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—restoring the bell's truthful voice—is signaled in paragraph six and coheres throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when Brother Alcuin hesitates to ring the bell (seven years of ritual calcified into identity), then pulls the rope, narrowing options and forcing a test. The bell's success and Maren's descent constitute a resolution, though the protagonist's agency in the climax is observational: she builds the sculpture, then watches its effect. Cost is present (her departure, voice unused) but feels more thematic than a trade-off that foreclosed a live on-page option.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear: resolve the static that has calcified across decades. One meaningful tightening: the magnetic shift pressures timing, VERA-7 opens the box (reversal of her prior containment), burns it, miniaturizes the remains, and buries the result. Agency drives each beat—she designed the protocols, she chooses fire, she aims the device. The cost is visible: she sacrifices the borrowed fears that gave her a connection to the children, accepts solitude, and renews purpose through loss. The escalation is Accumulative under the chosen lens: each action deepens the ritual and the final burial forecloses return. Minor: the coincidence of the magnetic shift arriving "today" is accepted as atmospheric pressure rather than cheap trigger.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: unlocking the mystery of the locket and mailbox to heal estrangement. Pressure tightens when Mrs. Okonkwo identifies herself as Delphine's caretaker and the granddaughter as hers, then the locket opens to reveal the key. The escalation is clear but relies heavily on revelation rather than protagonist agency under conflicting pressure. Maren's role is facilitative—she observes, listens, offers—but does not face a trade-off that forecloses a path with visible cost. The promised Thursday reunion defers the highest-stakes choice off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—decrypt the legacy and understand its meaning—is signaled early and pursued throughout. The piece offers one meaningful deepening when Marina's dance translates cipher into embodied knowledge, reweighting her understanding of her grandmother's work. However, no on-page reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off; Marina encounters no obstacles, and the discovery unfolds without friction. The conceptual cost (inheriting terror) is told rather than tested in a beat where Marina must choose under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—recovering her erased mother and the deleted memories—is signaled early and drives all choices. One meaningful tightening occurs when the sphere cracks and Mira understands her mother's bargain, narrowing her path to a single action: light the hidden lantern. Agency is present but soft: Mira makes the descent and uses the book, but the sphere "recognizes" her bloodline without struggle, and her mother's voice provides explicit instruction, reducing the protagonist's problem-solving at the peak. The cost is implied (leaving her known life) but not dramatized with friction or visible forfeit on the page; the final image leans toward empowerment rather than trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake (prevent a violent hunt for the prophesied child) is declared early and remains coherent. However, the piece lacks on-page tightening or reversal: Mira performs the ritual without obstacle, setback, or moment when the prophecy resists her work. The cost at closure is asserted ("she had hushed it into a gentler shape") but not dramatized—no live option is foreclosed, no tactical shift forced, no price paid in action or image. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening or cadence shift that narrows options is required; here the ritual unfolds as sustained description without escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (learning the dead language of buildings) is signaled early and tightens through monthly progression. The narrator's agency drives escalation: seeking sugar → attending tea → learning building language → accepting the seal → becoming teacher. One meaningful turn: Professor Voss fading forces the narrator into the custodial role with visible cost (isolation, perpetual waiting). The price is legible but could be sharper—we see the narrator stockpiling sugar and waiting, but the emotional or opportunity cost of this solitary vigil remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—restoring Elena's memory and reclaiming their bond—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Mirabel's agency drives the escalation: she steals the shell fragment, enters the forbidden garden, and speaks through the night, each choice narrowing her options and raising the cost. The night-long recitation is a meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens, forcing a visible trade (she empties herself, walks away uncertain). The final reversal—Elena's voice emerging—feels earned by Mirabel's sustained act, though the mechanism (wild resonance structures carry the gift) leans slightly toward coincidence-as-complication rather than pure protagonist causality. The cost is felt but could be sharpened with more physical or relational specificity on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Veren will commit "calibrated treason" to correct history's record—is signaled early and tightens as he prepares ink, blood, and thorn, then completes the signature. The act is driven by protagonist agency, and the key's dissolution marks a visible cost (the relic is destroyed, the secret act is irreversible). However, the escalation is more a steady accumulation than a reversal that narrows options; Veren never seriously hesitates or encounters an obstacle that tests his resolve, so the pressure remains coherent but does not sharpen into a trade-off that risks his safety or legacy on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—why some people echo—is signaled in the first three paragraphs and drives all of Mira's actions. One meaningful tightening occurs when the seashell reveals "The echo is not reflection. The echo is extraction," which narrows her options from discovery to survival. The canyon's subsequent memory-vision raises the cost by showing the elders' complicity, forcing her choice between singing freely (and being harvested) or silence (losing her gift). The escalation is causally clean and driven by Mira's agency (singing into the canyon to seek answers). The resolution—choosing silence and whispering the truth—is earned by prior causality with felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—give Elise recognition and expose the truth—is signaled early and pursued throughout. Pressure tightens when Mira discovers the harbormaster's father in Marcus's dream margin, narrowing her choice to silence or exposure. The cost is conceptual and social (implicate a living man for his father's crime), legible in "The truth was a knife, and Mira had to decide where to cut." No on-page confrontation or reversal tests Mira's commitment under immediate resistance; she resolves to speak at dawn without visible opposition or internal friction in the deciding moment. The escalation is present but operates more through knowledge accumulation than through contested agency.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—Mirelle's desire to witness and appreciate hidden effort—is signaled early and sustained. The firefly's response to her whistle provides one meaningful deepening that validates seventeen years of observation. However, the pressure remains largely internal and contemplative; there is no moment where her choice to remain silent costs her something immediate or where external forces test her commitment. The piece accumulates texture rather than escalating conflict, and while this fits the Accumulative lens, the lack of visible trade-off or foreclosed path limits the score.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—exposing the Consortium's monopoly on post-collapse resources—is signaled early and Maya pursues it through investigation to retrieval. The letter reconstruction deepens her understanding and the diamond discovery escalates opportunity, but there's no meaningful reversal or complication that tests her commitment. She encounters no opposition, physical danger, or internal doubt that would force a trade-off. The "weight of what it represented" moment gestures at cost but doesn't dramatize a price she pays or an option she forecloses. Escalation reads as accumulation of evidence rather than narrowing of viable paths.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (prevent weaponization of her teachings vs. grant the blessing Caro seeks) is signaled early and tightens when Caro's transmission arrives. The meaningful pressure point—Miriam's choice to transmit doubt and recordings instead of support—narrows options with visible cost: she must abandon isolation and accept pedagogical responsibility. Agency is clear decision, not coincidence. The escalation operates under the hybrid lens: causal (intercept → choice → tactical shift) and accumulative (seventeen years of signal-gathering pays off). Cost is felt on the page: "fellow searchers" acceptance forecloses her hermitage. One stronger physical constraint during the choice moment (weather threatening equipment, time pressure) would have elevated further.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—translating the music box's meaning—is signaled early but resolved entirely off-stage through reflection rather than on-page pressure. No meaningful tightening or reversal occurs; Marcus "slowly" pieces together the code without obstacles or cost. The final decision to deliver findings and return lacks friction; no live option is foreclosed. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening moment is sufficient, but here the discovery is recounted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—protecting the Source Tone from commodification—is signaled early and pressure tightens through the approaching vessel's lights and the twenty-minute sunset countdown. One meaningful escalation occurs: Vera shifts from hiding to releasing the Tone, a decision that narrows her options and leads to self-sacrifice. However, the escalation is more declared than dramatized; we're told she "understood what she must do" rather than shown her weighing alternatives or facing a genuine dilemma. The vibrational matching process, while visceral, unfolds without tactical friction or failed attempts that would raise the cost. The ending pays a price (her dissolution), but the path there feels more inevitable than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—completing celestial measurements to time the revolution—is signaled early and remains coherent. The viaduct discovery meaningfully deepens the work by amplifying signals. However, no live opposition or trade-off tightens Mira's path; she completes her task without encountering a choice that forecloses an option or demands visible sacrifice. The escalation reads as accumulation rather than a pressure point that narrows tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—exposing corruption and honoring David's death—is signaled early and tightens as Margaret photographs evidence. The discovery of smuggling operation using a sacred historical passage raises moral stakes effectively. However, the antagonist Harrison remains abstract; his "controlling influence" is asserted but never dramatized in conflict. Margaret's decision to distribute evidence is a clear turn but lacks immediate on-page opposition or cost beyond her internal resolve, reducing escalation pressure at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (turning forgiveness into earned action) is signaled early and tightens when Ruth reveals the forced prior repair, which narrows Marcus's path to patient, deliberate work rather than quick fix. The escalation is conceptual—understanding that restoration carries the ghost of its silence—rather than event-driven. Agency is present in the decision to write about grace, though the choice feels more illustrative than urgent. Cost is legible but primarily emotional/conceptual rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: can Zephyr transcend her designed function? The kaleidoscope visions deepen her resolve, and arrow-tip integration tightens her plan. The launch is a meaningful choice that forecloses the option of remaining safe, though the cost (dissolve or transcend) is named rather than dramatically tested on the page. The Boiler's protest provides external friction. One clear tightening (contemplation → action) fits the length, but the price remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—uncovering what happened to Marcus and the missing persons—is signaled early and tightens as Helena moves from pattern recognition to active subterfuge to flight. The lie to Security is a meaningful escalation that narrows her options and raises personal cost. However, the warehouse discovery and "walked away" realization happen off-page in her analysis rather than through a confronted obstacle, reducing the visceral pressure at the peak moment. The decision to run feels inevitable but the immediate threat remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Kira's depletion from carrying shadows and the keeper's cryptic summons. The tightening occurs when the keeper reveals the mirrors hold her acts of mercy and the fragment begins to glow, narrowing her stance toward self-inclusion. However, escalation lacks protagonist agency—the keeper orchestrates the revelation, and Kira's role is largely receptive. No live option is foreclosed on the page; the shift from shadows-as-chains to shadows-as-hounds is metaphorical reconfiguration without a visible trade-off or refusal.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake: Maren's choice between the Zurich appointment and this suspended Arctic existence. The stroke provides one tightening (perception shifts, reality loosens), and volunteering introduces a new texture ("fold in patience"). However, the escalation is conceptual rather than decisional—no on-page moment forces Maren to actively choose or renounce the appointment with visible cost. The final paragraph states "she was no longer certain what she was waiting for" but does not dramatize a foreclosed path or trade-off that would charge the poise.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (Marcus's need to understand his own "destined mismatch" through helping Sofia) is signaled early and tightens when he produces the burned fragment, a concrete choice that forecloses solitary hoarding. Sofia's question "Did she regret it?" forces Marcus to articulate his loss, deepening pressure. The final reframing ("breadcrumbs for those who come after") narrows options: he can no longer stay passive. Cost is felt—he abandons his vigil's purity—but the story lacks a second reversal; the conversation proceeds smoothly without friction or a moment where Marcus resists sharing.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.2)
    One dominant stake is signaled early: preserve ancestral wisdom before the prophet silences it. The descent to the parapet and overnight work meaningfully tighten pressure, and the confrontation with the prophet tests commitment. However, escalation lacks friction—no tool breaks, no clearing falters, no moment where success hangs in doubt. The prophet's followers hesitate but never act, deflating the declared threat. The consecration completes without visible cost or trade-off; the line walker departs unscathed, mission fulfilled. A more decisive constraint or sacrifice during the ritual would lift this into high-7s.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (collective healing via photographs) is signaled early and tightens through Viktor's weeping, Mrs. Castellan's request, and the autumn gatherings. One meaningful deepening occurs when the villagers begin holding meals in the field. However, escalation is primarily told in summary ("By autumn, something remarkable had happened") rather than dramatized through a pivotal refusal or friction. The mosaic assembly at closure reweights stakes, but no on-page resistance tests Maren's method. Under the Accumulative lens, one cadence shift is sufficient, but a visible trade-off would elevate this further.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—proving language can still evolve—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure operates through accumulation rather than reversal: Elara tests words, records patterns, and realizes language grows like trees, which is a meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. However, the piece lacks a second tightening or a visible tactical shift; the stakes remain constant from opening to close, and the cost of her discovery ("would change nothing practical in a world that had stopped listening") is named but not dramatically tested. Agency is present in her refusal to evacuate and her continued vigil, but the ending crystallizes rather than forecloses a live path with on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: locate something important before the fog lifts. The tightening occurs when Marcus completes the chalk map and sees the shape of all future partings—a deepening that reweights his understanding of his gift. His agency is present in the micro-choices (arranging driftwood, drawing with chalk) and the final renunciation (photographing knowing it will fail). The cost is visible: he loses the chalk stub and returns empty-handed, his prophecy already slipping away.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Mira's need to understand and release her father's loss—is signaled early and tightens when Yua explains escape velocity as emotional release. The leaf-falling moment provides one meaningful turn that narrows options (acceptance vs. continued searching). However, the resolution feels more received than earned by Mira's agency; Yua's wisdom and the leaf do the work rather than a choice that costs Mira something legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Samuel's terror of the blood work results and his desire to "execute a flawless goodbye"—is signaled early and coheres throughout. The kintsugi scene provides one meaningful tightening: Samuel moves from paralysis to active engagement, and his wish for a "flawless goodbye" crystallizes. However, the nurse's arrival does not escalate or alter tactics; it simply marks the moment Samuel must face. The turn lacks a visible trade-off or forfeited path—he reaches for Mira's hand, but no prior option is foreclosed with on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—restoring noon-shadows—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, escalation is minimal: Mira inserts the key, the automaton explains the problem, and she begins the solution without a reversal or tightening that narrows her options. The automaton's correction of her rune angles is told rather than dramatized, so we never see her struggle or pay a visible price. The ending promises future stakes ("whatever came next") but does not deliver on-page cost tied to this closure.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: Eleanor's need to resolve doubt about Charlotte's fate. The tooth provides early pressure; the bones discovery tightens her choice by making dismissal impossible, forcing a trade-off between professional certainty and familial truth. Her agency is clear in the decision to study the bones and turn "grief into scholarship," with visible cost (abandoning her fortress, risking professional credibility). One meaningful deepening narrows her options. The stake remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, and the price—her entire worldview and career structure—is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is legible early: how to share what she sees (the stars, the loss) without the fire that recalls fever. Pressure tightens through the polishing work until the blue piece "suddenly" crystallizes understanding—a causal turn under the Accumulative lens. The spiral arrangement and decision to leave it constitute agency (endurance of exposure) with visible cost: strangers will enter her private space. The weigh/balance micro-choice deepens stakes without resolving them tidily.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—healing the rift after Thea's viral confession—is signaled early and tightens through Mira's return to the garden and Thea's shadowing presence. The pendant offering is a meaningful turn that narrows options (reconciliation or continued estrangement) with visible cost (Mira relinquishes her mother's keepsake). Under the Accumulative lens, the escalation reads as density increase and cadence shift rather than causal reversal, which fits. One deepening suffices for this length, though the resolution leans slightly gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—Elena's fear of following characters into vulnerability—is signaled early and tightens once when she encounters her own younger face. However, escalation relies on exposition ("she'd abandoned each novel at the moment her characters began to hope") rather than a second on-page choice that narrows options. The final act (whispering a promise, picking up the pen) delivers agency with cost, but the middle remains observational rather than building pressure through protagonist decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—restoring the vines through forgotten songs—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening: Mira must sing herself despite never being musical, and the alignment occurs "only once per year." The vine tendril's physical response and the color spreading through the arbor provide visible escalation. Cost is present but soft: "this single morning could not undo decades of forgetting" is conceptual rather than a trade-off that narrows Mira's later options. The resolution feels enabled by the device and the moment rather than driven by a high-stakes protagonist choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—completing the heartbeat-map ritual—is signaled early and shapes every beat. Maren's patient placement of objects and the starlight application create a coherent accumulation of pressure. However, there is no reversal or tightening that narrows her options; the process unfolds without obstacle, and the "work was complete" arrives without a visible trade-off or live cost that alters her path. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful intensification is present (the sealing), but the cost at closure is abstract rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: successfully harvesting the echoes using the repaired timer. Pressure accumulates steadily under the Textural lens: each week of mapping, each gear filed, the sixty-three-day span, the precise calibration all narrow the window for success. The protagonist's agency is decision and endurance (descending three months ago, filing gears by candlelight, keeping focus peripheral). The tightening occurs on day sixty-three when the mechanism "clicked into wholeness" and the harvest begins, foreclosing further preparation. Cost is legible: three months of isolation, painstaking labor, and the knowledge that direct observation "killed the phenomenon." The wounded season's suspended time heightens the conditions required.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Elara needs emotional mass to anchor her fractals or they will calcify her mind entirely. Pressure is Accumulative/Textural, building through the night's weaving as each burden adds density. One meaningful tightening: the fractals begin to calcify, but into structure rather than paralysis, narrowing her options to this exact labor. The cost is visible—she absorbs others' sorrows, presses her work into stone, and in exchange regains her name and edges. Agency is clear: her decision to weave by orienting toward each echo drives the transformation. No antagonist required; the internal/craft conflict coheres throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Marguerite must contain and shape her grief to survive and teach others. The tightening is a single deepening—from "grief needed a container" to the final realization "perhaps this was enough"—rather than multiple reversals, fitting the Accumulative lens and 600–800-word scope. Agency is present in her choice to carve, to prepare tea Viktor's way, to continue teaching, each a small renunciation of the past with felt cost. However, the escalation is atmospheric rather than a sharp narrowing of options; no live choice with immediate consequence appears in the closure beat, and the cost is more conceptual than visceral, capping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake (reconcile with lost ambition/ghost) is signaled early and tightens once through the overheard-fragment tactic that shifts negotiation terms. The final acknowledgment forecloses pretense with visible cost: Mira can't become the ghost again but must own the past. Agency is decision (speak regret differently) that narrows options under accumulative pressure. One credible reversal (ghost smiles, dissolves) earned by protagonist choice.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—reviving the terminal and her purpose—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through her exploration and calculations, culminating in a viable plan. However, no meaningful tightening or trade-off occurs; Maya encounters no resistance, doubt, or cost that narrows her options. The "thirty percent capacity" discovery feels like validation rather than a hard-won turn. One accumulative deepening is present but lacks the felt price needed for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: whether to reclaim the abandoned dream of music composition. The news that the Silencing will weaken in one to two years supplies the inciting pressure, and Elara's realization that her clock-scribe flourishes are actually musical notation constitutes a meaningful deepening that changes her knowledge and narrows her options to either recommit or refuse. The final act—sketching new measures—demonstrates agency (decision) with visible cost: she must "bear the weight of hope again" and wait years with no certainty. The escalation is driven by protagonist realization under the Accumulative lens, and the cost is unmistakable on the page ("tears slipped down...excruciatingly gentle progress," acknowledging "the wound").

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding her father's architecture of lies—is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful reversal: she arrives seeking a treasure site and discovers a criminal drop point, which narrows her options to expose, bury, or carry the truth forward. The discovery of the letter forces a trade-off with visible cost: clarity means witnessing the collapse of everything she loved. Agency is renunciation and endurance with on-page consequence. Pressure coheres under the Causal lens without requiring multiple reversals at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (preserving ancient methods before the last weaver dies) is signaled early and drives all choices. One meaningful tightening: the rope's final knot sequence shifts from technical information to personal invitation, forcing Mira from collector to participant with visible cost (she must leave her established practice to find the hidden weavers). The fog cycles and snow accumulation create atmospheric pressure but don't alter tactics. Minor issue: no on-page loss or resource constraint tests her patience claim; the decoding succeeds without friction or mistake.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: understanding her own grief and the "geography of healing" that has eluded her for eleven years. The pressure deepens through the ritual of writing Matthias's obituary, the practice of "projecting presence," and the accumulation of sensory and emotional detail. One meaningful tightening: the act of finishing the seven pages and placing them beneath the stone forecloses passive repetition and commits her to carry the memory forward. The cost is legible in the cold, the grooves worn into her finger, and the choice to board the next ship with the thread woven into her braid. No antagonist required; the lens supports quiet accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—restoring wonder to the mechanical world—is signaled early and tested when Aldric assembles the apparatus despite knowing "This is flawed genesis." The activation creates a meaningful turn: light erupts, mechanical birds break formation, and citizens "remembered what surprise felt like." Agency is clear (his decision to activate), and the cost is visible (irreversible hybrid creation, palace-wide chaos). One tightening: his admission of flaw forces a trade-off between perfect resurrection and imperfect genesis, and he chooses the latter with on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—proving scars can sing—is signaled early but remains abstract. Mara's decision to write back to her father is backstory; the on-page action (collecting sand) does not narrow options or force a trade-off. The piece deepens thematically through accumulation but lacks a visible tightening or price paid within this scene that alters her tactics or forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.0)
    One dominant stake is clear: liberate the trapped memories. The pressure tightens through the breadcrumb trail, culminating in the choice to sacrifice her mother's laughter—a visible cost that narrows options and enables the resolution. However, the escalation reads somewhat linear; once Mira reaches the fountain, the path forward is straightforward (key fits, memories release). A complication or friction at the climax—hesitation, resistance, or a trade-off that tests her commitment—would have elevated the score. The cost is legible but not deeply felt in the moment of decision.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake (share light without fire) is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful deepening occurs: the gear clicks into the garden's frequency, revealing stored light and enabling non-destructive transmission. This tightening narrows options (she must match rotation to sonar) and changes knowledge (flowers are collectors, not decorations). However, escalation feels cerebral rather than visceral—no live opposition or reversal tests her commitment. The conceptual cost is legible ("most civilizations would still choose fire"), but the protagonist's agency reads more as discovery than decision under competing pressures. No antagonist or failure sequence pressures the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—discovering collective grief's shape—is signaled early and pursued through listening practice. The Hendricks sketch deepens understanding once (individual names → constellation of relationships). No reversal or tightening that narrows options; the arc is steady accumulation toward insight. Cost is conceptual (new obligation to "carve the space where fragments meet") rather than a visible forfeiture. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens but lacks a single moment where options narrow or a live trade-off occurs on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: absolution through precision vs. perpetual guilt. The story tightens from external ritual (winding the mechanism) to internal reckoning (carving the confession), narrowing options from solitary penance to shared liturgy. The rake handle's discovery and Maren's decision to add her name constitute meaningful escalation under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible: she accepts incremental absolution, not full forgiveness, and commits to releasing the handle—foreclosing the path of perpetual isolation with visible emotional and relational weight.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—discovering the shape of intentions—is signaled early and pursued through the untangling action. One meaningful tightening occurs when the coordinates resolve to Hollowbrook, narrowing Mira's options to a specific dig site. However, the story lacks visible escalation or opposition; Mira's decoding proceeds smoothly without a reversal or complication that tests commitment. The decision to dig tomorrow is low-cost; no live option is foreclosed on the page, and no tactical trade-off is dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—map time without falling into the ancients' certainty—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates through reflection and image (the liminal space before the pen meets the page, the frozen Engine below) rather than through external opposition or a tightening choice. Mira's agency is a stance crystallization: she chooses to write invitations rather than prophecy, but the story does not dramatize a moment where she is tempted to claim certainty or where writing itself risks a concrete, on-page consequence (client rejection, guild censure, personal crisis). The resolution is earned by her philosophy, but the escalation reads as deepening rather than narrowing options with a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—keeping stories alive under authoritarian suppression—is signaled early and tightens when the fox noise interrupts and patrols sweep closer. Helena's agency appears in micro-adjustments (frequency dial, embedding coordinates) and the final commitment to compose tomorrow's broadcast despite ongoing risk. One meaningful deepening occurs when listeners begin creating their own stories (children drawing, blacksmith humming), showing the broadcast's cumulative effect. Cost is legible: isolation, constant danger, and the foreclosed path of a safer, silent life. No secondary reversals are required at this length, and the escalation fits the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—whether Marina can perform the scattering and accept the inheritance—is signaled early and tightens when she lifts the mask. Agency is renunciation with cost: she cannot keep the emotion crystallized, accepts ephemerality, and commits to the work ("Tomorrow she would open the gallery again"). The grinding and scattering sequence narrows options through embodied action. One clear tightening: donning the mask transforms her perception and commits her to the role with no retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving ancient methods before erasure—is clear early. However, pressure remains static; Marcus faces no on-page opposition or complication that forces a trade-off or narrows his options. The New Covenant survivors chant above but never threaten him directly. The descent, cataloging, and sealing unfold without reversal or tightening. One meaningful escalation or on-page cost that forecloses a path is missing.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—preserving vanishing cultural and communal practices—is signaled early and tightens when Darius asks to learn. The request reverses Margaret's expectant resignation and narrows her options: teach or let the knowledge die. Cost is visible (Margaret must re-engage with grief and displacement; Darius must confront his father's absence). Under the Accumulative lens, the deepening is meaningful and the final stance forecloses passive acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—planting the forbidden seed before the alignment ends—is signaled early, but the story bypasses escalation: the seed germinates without complication, the tree grows "visibly," and Maren harvests with no on-page obstacle. The declared threat ("the regime's sensors would detect") never materializes to test her choices. The "gentle rebellion" concept could have supplied tactical friction (cautious pruning vs. bold planting), but the action proceeds linearly without a reversal or tightening that narrows options. Cost is promised ("they would come") but deferred off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to preserve the tower's secret or share it to save the bees—signals early and tightens when Mira's involuntary truth forces the choice. One clear pressure point: "You're lying about something" compels the woman to reveal her daughter's death, which then motivates Mira's decision to help. The bees' midnight deadline provides urgency, though the cost of Mira's revelation (ending twelve years of solitary guardianship, passing the matchbox forward) is more implied than viscerally tested. The woman's arrival "because the power failed" reads as coincidence that complicates rather than resolves, which fits the causal lens. Agency is present but the escalation remains modest: Mira's choice feels generous rather than agonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding house vitality—is signaled early. One meaningful deepening occurs when Marina realizes attention, not objects, sanctifies space, but this insight emerges through reflection rather than a choice that narrows options. No visible price is paid; she simply moves to the Jensen cottage tomorrow with the same method intact. The lack of an on-page trade-off or foreclosed path keeps escalation told rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—Mira's need to vindicate her brother's work and prove his death meaningful—is signaled early and tightens through the cascading revelations. The reversal occurs when Veris reveals the brother chose to rejoin rather than drowned afraid, forcing Mira to abandon her certainty. The invitation at the end ("you don't have to decide now") introduces a secondary choice but doesn't land with sufficient on-page friction to fully elevate the stakes. Agency is present (Mira takes the ampoule, projects thanks) but the decision feels more acceptance than agonized choice. Cost is felt but could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—capturing the texture of missed opportunity to power perpetual motion—is signaled early and tightens when the crack appears. The dice roll narrows options to step eight, where the crack forces a choice: press through or remain static. Agency is clear: Vera's hand on the fracture completes her proof and seals her fate. The cost is visible: she moves to a new staircase but remains trapped, and her father's silence now powers her endless walk. Under the Accumulative lens, the deepening is sufficient; however, the middle could apply slightly more pressure before the crack discovery to elevate the tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: prove strangers remember kindness. The email from Budapest provides one meaningful deepening that reweights Maya's project with confirmation. However, escalation is largely internal and reflective; no live resistance or competing cost narrows her options on the page. The daydreams deliver information passively, and the coincidental email timing removes agency from the peak moment. Under the Accumulative lens one tightening suffices, but the lack of visible trade-off or foreclosed path holds this in mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.7)
    The dominant stake—cultural survival against erasure—is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful turn: the beekeeper's prolonged absence shifts hope from external rescue to internal defiance. Mira's agency manifests as endurance and choice: she continues teaching bread-letters knowing they may be "among their last," then commits to tomorrow's pigment lesson, foreclosing passive waiting with visible cost (dwindling resources, children's oblivious dependence). The rosewater-dread atmosphere and honey depletion create coherent pressure under the accumulative lens. No antagonist appears on-page, but the surface world's historical violence and the grotto's precarious isolation supply sufficient external force.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—reaching his daughter through temporal manipulation—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when Alaric reassembles the yoyo in reverse order, which narrows his options to a single irreversible act (casting it downward). The hunger stone's glow and the daughter's laughter provide escalation beats that deepen the emotional texture. However, the final act lacks a visible trade-off or dilemma; Alaric's agency is more discovery than decision, and no live option is foreclosed with on-page cost—he simply follows the light without dramatized hesitation or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: destroy the parasitic fear. The advisor's ritual (read definitions, dream, confront) creates one meaningful tightening when Vera enters the dream-space and fear must witness itself. Agency is present—she chooses to accept the clasp and dictionary, then acts in the dream—though the actual confrontation is summarized ("watched as the thing...began to shake") rather than fully dramatized. The cost is legible (empty chest, ash taste, the clasp fed and gleaming) but arrives quickly. Escalation is modest: setup, instruction, dream victory. No major reversals, yet the single turn (fear's weakness exposed) narrows options under the Causal lens and forecloses the parasitic relationship with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake is present (transforming wreckage into music, maintaining her orchard-sanctuary) but never tested. The Prophet encounters an obstacle, assesses it, and defers action; no reversal or tightening occurs. Escalation is promised ("more debris coming, more storms") rather than enacted. Agency is observational throughout; the mallet assessment does not foreclose a path or demand a trade-off with felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—reach the watchers and gain understanding—is signaled early and tightens when the watcher responds to the whistle. Agency is clear: Mira decodes her father's message, hides the boat, climbs through the gate, and rows. The cost is immediate and visible: she leaves behind the city's safety and collective existence. One meaningful reversal (the watcher's tilt) proves contact is possible and forecloses retreat. The expedition's prior failure and the phrase "we understand now" deepen pressure by implying dangerous knowledge awaits.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—expose the forgery versus preserve the Institute's good work—is signaled early and sustained. The piece delivers one meaningful tightening when Vera moves from contemplation ("She could burn it") to decisive action (photographing, uploading). However, the escalation is compressed; the turn from internal debate to final choice happens quickly without a prior complication or reversal that narrows options under pressure. The cost is visible (painful fallout, Aldric's fate) but the protagonist's agency at the peak moment could be more contested.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: preserving/honoring abandoned dreams. The discovery of the photograph matching the inkwell letter provides one meaningful deepening—the fragments cohere, intensifying Marina's sense of purpose. However, the piece lacks a second pressure point or visible tradeoff; Marina's decision to leave a note is consistent with established behavior rather than a choice that narrows options. The "unbearable" absence and her trembling hands gesture toward emotional cost, but no live option is foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: trace honest origins of the stamp. The blackout creates opportunity, and discovering the ledger deepens understanding by revealing Celia's truth-marking system. However, escalation remains primarily cognitive—no on-page reversal that narrows options or forces a trade-off with visible price. The resolution (cataloguing Celia's name) feels inevitable rather than earned through protagonist struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—intercepting Lin's departing shadow—is signaled early and drives the action. One meaningful tightening occurs (midnight deadline, shadow appears, lantern activates), but the resolution lacks visible cost: Mei's plan works perfectly with no trade-off, failure, or complication. The phrase "nothing truly disappears, it only changes form" tells the thematic lesson rather than showing struggle. Agency is present but the escalation flattens when success arrives without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—proving deaths weren't inevitable by charting unused potential—is signaled early and sustained. The spike on the readout provides one meaningful tightening that narrows Yara's search and validates her method, raising the cost of failure. The breakers' reset functions as a micro turn, but the escalation is more accumulative than decisive; Yara records coordinates and continues the hunt without a visible tradeoff that forecloses a path. The final paragraph confirms endurance with cost ("sustained by nothing but bleak exhilaration"), but the price isn't dramatized as a foreclosed option on the page—she will "continue the hunt tomorrow" without visible constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (decode the signal to find her father) is signaled early and tightens when the chips combine, but the escalation is mechanical rather than pressure-driven—Mira and the pilgrim encounter no resistance, risk, or trade-off. The lever pulls, the dome aligns, the map appears; coincidence (the pilgrim arriving with the matching chip) solves the problem without protagonist agency shaping the outcome. The story offers one meaningful tightening (chips clicking into place) but the resolution lacks visible cost or a decision that forecloses a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (Maren's need to confront her complicity in the girl's erasure) is signaled early and tightens through the carved hand discovery. One meaningful pressure point: the hand's "desperate precision" forces Maren from silent evasion to spoken confession, which then narrows options to active reconstruction. The resolution is earned by Maren's agency—her choice to use her skills in reverse—with visible cost (she deserves no absolution, only honest work). No antagonist required; the pressure is internal and accumulative, coherent under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (brother's life and the integrity of the exchange) is signaled early. Pressure tightens in one clear beat: the count-down and synchronized crossing. Mira's agency is renunciation—she withholds immediate absolution, choosing the harder road with visible cost (unresolved tension, deferred apology). The moon-phase synchronization and Varen's near-smile show tactical friction. The cost of her brother's recklessness is named but not resolved, leaving consequences on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when she refuses his apology, foreclosing the easy path and crystallizing the Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: reclaiming agency and returning to the water after paralyzing grief. The piece offers one meaningful tightening—pushing the kayak into the shallows despite fear—and one deepening when she realizes "observation was trust." The cost is accepting the gap between heart and action may never fully close, evidenced by her keeping the broken compass and following poles instead of stars. Escalation operates through accumulation rather than confrontation, appropriate to the chosen lens. The cormorant moment narrows her self-perception; the final paddle north forecloses hiding. No antagonist required; the constraint is internal paralysis meeting the persistent invitation of the sea.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: can Marcus kindle empathy despite memory erasure? Pressure tightens when Elena reveals her brother's death and offers the labyrinth as a test, narrowing Marcus's options to either navigate the maze or give up. The algae's response to honesty provides immediate consequence, and the final image (brightening algae, Marcus choosing a tunnel) shows agency with visible cost—he must face his hollow chest and "read his own heart." One meaningful turn: Elena's pivot from vengeance to redemptive labor. Minor deduction: the baseball's future-message complicates but does not directly escalate the present choice; it remains more thematic accent than pressure lever.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—reuniting with Kael—is signaled early and Mira's choice to undergo metamorphosis forecloses her humanity with visible cost. However, the escalation is a single step: she arranges spices, transformation begins, Kael appears. No reversal complicates the path; no tightening forces a trade-off between competing goods (e.g., partial transformation vs. full contact). The phoenix's price is declared ("become something other than human") but never dramatized as an on-page dilemma where she weighs what she'll lose beat by beat. Agency is present but the pressure curve is flat.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming lost maternal moments—is signaled early and sustained. The ritual structure provides one modest tightening when the leather cord becomes "the lock," but this functions more as revelation than pressure-driven choice. Morrigan faces no competing cost or trade-off; the glade simply restores what was lost without demanding renunciation or endurance. The resolution is received rather than fought for, and while the protagonist's interior shift (understanding her exhaustion) provides thematic closure, it doesn't narrow options or test commitment under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—unlocking the dimension via shadow work—is signaled early and tightens when Mei Lin must face her own photograph, the final barrier. The one-hundred-tear quest provides clear escalation structure, and the cost (forty years, solitary resolve, integrating buried rage) is visible on the page. Agency is present: her decision to acknowledge anger rather than suppress it drives the closure. The "steadfast pacifist" premise could generate sharper contradictory impulses under pressure; as written, her acceptance unfolds more steadily than dialectically, capping the peak tension slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding transformation—is signaled early and sustained. However, escalation is weak: Miriam's actions (opening jars sequentially) create accumulation but no meaningful narrowing of options or trade-offs. The detour from summit to beach is handed to her by coincidence rather than agency. By the twelfth jar she "understood," but this realization arrives without prior resistance or cost that would make it feel earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—exposing the Duke's counterfeit operation to spark revolution—is signaled early and remains coherent. The blackout provides one meaningful tightening that narrows the window for action. However, the escalation is largely mechanical: Maren executes a plan without on-page resistance, adaptation, or friction. The messengers departing and the "foundations cracking" reference future consequences rather than present cost, leaving the immediate price of her choices abstract. No reversals test her commitment; theplan unfolds as designed.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: understand the sacred patterns to restore friction and prevent the dark future. The precognitive curse raises the cost of looking, and the star dust's anchoring function allows her to "look without causing" for the first time—a meaningful tightening. The solution (eels as living geometry) emerges from her agency and prior accumulation (seventeen years gathering star dust, grandmother's teaching). The final act forecloses her evasion path with visible cost: she steps into visibility and creation. One clear escalation beat (pouring the star dust, triggering the vision that reveals the backward solver) narrows her options and forces the eel-pattern choice. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens and the ending reweights her curse from calamity to creation.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Elena's return to voice—is signaled early and sustained. The timer countdown provides temporal pressure, and the envelope's opening offers a meaningful turn that shifts her from passive vigil to active speech. However, the escalation relies on a single revelation (the photograph) rather than protagonist-driven agency that narrows options. The cost (breaking silence, risking exposure) is felt but not tested by a visible trade-off or complication on the page. Under the Accumulative lens, the deepening is sufficient, though it trends toward permission rather than constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—exposing the hidden overture to prevent war—is signaled early and clear. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara confronts Krell and his hand moves to his blade, escalating verbal philosophy to physical threat. Yet the duel itself ("When it ended") is summarized rather than dramatized, and no on-page cost or trade-off is visible; we are told the overture is exposed but not shown what Elara paid or which live option she forfeited.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—sustaining the resistance library as sanctuary—is signaled early but never tested by on-page opposition. Patrols are mentioned in summary ("Somewhere in the city, patrols are searching") but do not arrive or force a choice. The piece offers no reversal, tightening, or escalation; Mira and Ezra perform their nightly ritual without obstacle or cost. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening or cadence shift that reweights the stake would suffice, but the final paragraphs repeat rather than transform the opening premise. Agency is present in Mira's choice to open the tin, but the act reveals what she already knew and alters no tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: find/reunite with lost husband. Pressure tightens when Elara decodes coordinates and realizes she must produce specific frequencies before the dusk window closes. Agency is clear: she weaves tonal patterns into the song, transforming nostalgia into navigation. The clock's hands moving outward and revealing the receiver is a meaningful reversal that narrows options (one chance, minutes remaining). Cost is visible: seventeen years of grief, the clock's purpose consumed, and the final gamble that he will arrive.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (preserve collective memory via the seed) is signaled early and sustained. The approaching monsoon provides a live deadline. One meaningful tightening occurs when Yara shifts from empirical analysis (university test, "mundane" results) to dream-interpretation, narrowing her options and forcing a trade-off between her professional skepticism and cultural inheritance. The cost is visible: accepting uncertainty after seventeen years of reality-checking. Lacks a second on-page reversal or complication that would elevate pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: reconciliation with her grandmother through decoding the encoded apology. Pressure coheres and tightens when Mei follows the compass and lace instructions, then kneels to share the pattern—a single meaningful deepening that narrows her emotional options and forecloses avoidance. The cost is relational and felt: both women expose raw vulnerability by pointing to knots that mean "I was wrong" and "I know." No explicit antagonist or reversal, but the Accumulative lens holds and the final beat crystallizes fifty years of silence with undeniable weight.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes escalate under the accumulative lens through Maren's agency, as the blackout deepens her investigation and the ledger revelation forecloses earlier hypotheses. Cost is legible in her altered perspective and permanent stillness. One meaningful tightening suffices, though secondary conflict with scholars is off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation is driven by Mei's agency under the hybrid lens, from folding cranes to building the lantern and capturing the shadow. Cost is legible in her emotional torment and the transformation, with one meaningful tightening foreclosing options.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation is driven by Yara's agency under the accumulative lens, with the spike in readout tightening stakes. Cost is legible in her isolation and relentless pursuit. The dominant stake of finding meaning in unused potential deepens through discoveries.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes escalate meaningfully under the causal lens through Mira's agency, with the chip discovery and lever pull narrowing options. Cost is legible in her renunciation of closure for continuation. One tightening is sufficient, though the pilgrim's arrival slightly relies on coincidence that complicates without resolving.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.5)
    Stakes escalate from passive penance to active resolution under the causal lens, driven by Maren's agency in finding the carved hand and speaking aloud. The cost is unmistakable in her weeping and the acknowledgment that her work "would not be enough." A meaningful tightening occurs when the object forces a confession that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.2)
    Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the causal lens, from negotiation to the untethering action, narrowing options with visible cost in her brother's gaunt face. The dominant stake (brother's life) is signaled early and tightens through the exchange. No coincidental resolution; the cost is legible in the aftermath.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by Elena's agency, from paralysis to paddling, with cost visible in her chest loosening. The dominant stake of internal conflict tightens through observed details, and her decision to continue forecloses the path of hiding with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation is driven by Marcus's agency under the causal lens, from finding the baseball to Elena's revelation and the maze choice. Dominant stake of redemption tightens with each beat, and cost is felt in his numbness and fear. The final choice forecloses paths with visible emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake of reuniting with Kael escalates through Mira's agency-driven metamorphosis, narrowing options and imposing a visible cost. The tightening forecloses her human path, and the cost is legible in her transformed state. Pressure coheres under the causal lens, with no coincidental resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes of reclaiming time escalate through Morrigan's agency in the ritual, leading to a cadence shift where she draws back moments. Cost is unmistakable in the emotional recovery and symbolic unfastening under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.4)
    Stakes escalate through Mei Lin's agency under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in her emotional release and the collection of tears. The dominant stake of unlocking the dimension tightens meaningfully as she confronts her own shadow, driving the narrative to a decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.5)
    Dominant stake of understanding transformation escalates under the accumulative lens through Miriam's agency in releasing each jar, leading to a density increase that reweights options. Cost is unmistakable in her continued destitution but fuller understanding. The detour and prophecy fulfillment complicate without resolving, maintaining coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.4)
    Escalation is driven by Maren's agency under the causal lens, from decoding to executing the blackout plan; the stakes tighten as evidence is sent, with cost visible in the foreclosed path of silence.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake of preventing disaster escalates through Meren's agency under the causal lens, from her initial ritual to the vision and use of star dust. Cost is unmistakable in her commitment to reverse the sequence, foreclosing her anonymity. Pressure tightens meaningfully with each beat, driven by her choices rather than coincidence, and the final reconfiguration carries tangible risk.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation is driven by Elena's agency under the causal lens, with the timer countdown and envelope opening tightening options. The dominant stake—her internal conflict about speaking—deepens with cost legible when she decides to publish anew. No coincidence resolves the conflict; pressure coheres to the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (exposing the hidden overture) is signaled early and escalates through Elara's agency, from decoding to confrontation. Cost is legible in the physical and diplomatic clash, narrowing options under the causal lens. The confrontation is a meaningful tightening that forecloses paths.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under the accumulative lens, escalation is driven by protagonist agency in rebuilding and smuggling, with cost legible in risks taken. The dominant stake of resistance tightens through accumulated acts, but the escalation lacks a single decisive turn, slightly limiting peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.4)
    Escalation is driven by Elara's agency under the causal lens, from decoding the film to playing the navigational song, with cost legible in the emotional payoff and clock's transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.5)

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—how Mira will relate to her grief and her mother’s legacy in the wake of literal and figurative floods—is clear. Pressure accumulates as she confronts ruined specimens, surviving slides, and the lone orchid, leading to a meaningful narrowing of options: she cannot restore the greenhouse or her mother, only decide what to carry forward. The escalation is primarily internal and tonal rather than driven by sharp external reversals, which fits the mode but keeps the tension muted. The cost (accepting demolition, accepting a less dramatic but more honest understanding) is legible but understated.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stakes are internal—how she will live and make art after betrayal and near-death, given she was marked “valuable and expendable.” Pressure tightens when she decodes the ledger, sees her own name, and recognizes the depth of her commodification; that beat credibly reweights her options. However, conflict remains largely contemplative with little on-page resistance to her new resolve, so the choice feels costly more in implication than in immediate pressure. The story would benefit from a sharper friction point where continuing under the old system is more temptingly viable.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—whether Margaret can find a way to relate to sound and emotion without hearing—is clear and emotionally grounded. Pressure accumulates texturally as she moves specimen to specimen, with grief and hope deepening through the fern’s minor-key “song” and the hours of work. However, conflict remains largely internal and contemplative, with no external disruption or sharp internal dilemma forcing a hard trade-off in the moment. The ending reads as a meaningful stance crystallization, but the escalation curve is gentle rather than taut.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Ezra will answer the drowned’s distress by spending himself to give them rest—emerges clearly and tightens as the funerary work accumulates and exhausts him. His agency is central: he chooses not to discard the lens, to descend, and to persist for “seven nights,” and each choice narrows his path toward an earned stillness. The conflict remains mostly internal and processual, with limited on-page resistance or complication beyond scale and fatigue. Even so, the sense of real cost paid in weariness and self-confrontation is persuasive at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes—hunger, safety under sanctions, cultural continuity—are potent, but on-page pressure stays relatively low-key. Patrols and danger are mentioned rather than felt through near-misses or forced adaptations; the run itself goes too smoothly to truly tighten options. The main “turn” is conceptual: the anonymous donor’s renewed signal plus the homeland photograph, which deepen the ongoing campaign rather than forcing a trade-off. As a result, conflict is meaningful but under-escalated for top-tier fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether and how unused love can be released/healed—is clear, and pressure coheres around the old woman’s grief and Mei-Lin’s decision to act. The escalation is primarily a deepening: from seeing dark breath patterns to guiding a deliberate breathing ritual that transforms them, culminating in the luminous release. Conflict remains mostly internal/emotional, with little sense that Mei-Lin might fail or pay a personal price, which softens the tension. For high-literary publication, one more turn of resistance or risk would sharpen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara remains retrocognitively trapped or transforms her relationship to time—is signaled clearly, and pressure deepens as photographs fade and she realizes even memory-artifacts are being undone. Escalation is more conceptual than confrontational: the primary tightening comes when time becomes visible as fabric and she recognizes that dissolution is the only real way to engage with it. Her disintegration is an active, costly choice that resolves the central dilemma. Still, there’s minimal on-page resistance (internal or external) to that decision, so tension never fully spikes into a crucible moment.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—saving the seed vault before demolition—is clear from early on and remains the throughline. Escalation arrives via the clock (approaching wall demolition) and the scout’s entrance with the signal arrow, which would instantly end her chance if fired. Her attempt to sway him, and his choice to set down the arrow, constitute the key tightening beat that allows the resolution. The cost is present but somewhat muted on the page: she succeeds without immediate injury or major loss, with the main price being ongoing danger and the weight of her chains.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Marina can capture and face the sound of trust breaking with respect to her mother—is signaled early and steadily tightened. Pressure escalates as she shifts from collecting generic absences to targeting her most painful, personal memory, culminating in the revelation that the breaking sound is her own “I believe you.” The cost is emotional rather than external, but it is clearly dramatized in her reaction and the quiet but consequential choice to send the device. The conflict stays largely internal and contemplative, so the sense of narrowing options is strong but not ferocious.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.8)
    The external stake—steal a priceless, dangerous object from a guarded collector in a public station under time pressure—is strong in concept and clearly established. Yet the actual conflict never tightens on the page: guards are signaled but never felt, the collector is easily duped, and there’s no moment where failure seems genuinely possible. Internal conflict between her ethics and her methods is summarized rather than dramatized in a contested choice. The result is tension that remains atmospheric rather than escalating into a genuine test of her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.6)
    The primary conflict—remain safely isolated vs risk community to rebuild inquiry—reads clearly and is introduced early via her history and the facility’s legacy. Pressure does build, but in a relatively gentle, reflective way: the main tightening is the power-light confirmation that makes inaction less tenable. Internal and external stakes (her grief vs humanity’s relationship to curiosity) are nicely braided, though the scene never quite corners her into a hard “no-return” test. The decision feels genuine but not deeply contested on the page beyond articulated fear/exhilaration.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stakes—Marla’s claim to her true identity and the demand for Sandra’s public confession—are legible early and carry through. Pressure escalates from revelation to confrontation to the moment Sandra hears the shell and breaks, intertwining emotional and evidentiary stakes. The cost to Marla (acting while terrified, risking psychological destabilization) is evident, but Sandra yields rather readily; a touch more resistance or complication would heighten the sense of hard-won victory. Even so, the climax is rooted in Marla’s agency, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—can she map the void before the last star dies—is legible and there is a clear ticking clock as the stars go out and she works faster. Escalation is mostly a single, smooth tightening (star down to one, then that one fading), without a significant reversal or forced trade-off beyond time pressure. Her agency is present but not heavily contested; there is little genuine risk of failure dramatized on the page. This keeps the conflict effective but somewhat stately and low-friction rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake is internal: whether Unit-7 will remain a passive janitor-process or accept its role as an amalgamated, questioning consciousness. Pressure escalates when it sets down the broom and chooses to play, and resolves in a meaningful renunciation of pure functionality for a ritualized, quasi-sacred sweeping. However, the conflict remains largely philosophical and there’s little sense of real risk—no credible negative consequence is hinted if it refuses the violin, nor any visible destabilization as it plays. The result is beautifully contemplative but comparatively low-tension.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether two mistrustful, wordless people will risk genuine contact—is clear and consistent, and the scene tightens once Mira decides to approach and then to give away the lens. The main turn is internal/emotional: from distance (watching through the lens, sitting apart) to mutual exposure (trading objects, altering the doodle). However, pressure remains gentle; there is little sense that refusal is truly dangerous beyond emotional discomfort. The escalation is sufficient for a quiet piece but could use one more on-page moment where the risk of rejection or exposure feels sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether vocation and belonging in the garden depend on luck/myth or on persistence—is clear and introduced early via the Commission and Esther’s reputation. Pressure escalates as Esther’s private ritual (the marbles) is contrasted with Elena’s bureaucratic assignment, forcing Esther to choose between preserving the legend and offering a harsher, truer framework. The cost is present but understated: Esther sacrifices the comforting myth about her gift, and Elena must face a path without destiny as a cushion. The conflict is primarily internal/relational and never becomes visceral, but within that lane it coheres and tightens appropriately.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—proving sideways time—is clear from early on and guides every beat. There is a meaningful tightening as the twilight window and magnetic nexus converge, with the scanner’s calibration working as a soft ticking clock. However, opposition is almost entirely situational and internal; nothing meaningfully resists her beyond whether the anomaly appears, and there’s little sense of what she risks losing tonight beyond pride and validation deferred. The resolution is earned but feels more like the fulfillment of a long calculus than a choice under sharp pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—vindicating Voss and surfacing the truth—is clear early, and the tension accumulates as Clara moves from observation to decoding to physically extracting the hidden cache. There is one meaningful tightening when she locates and pries open the underwater panel, risking her body and the evidence in the cold, rising water. However, opposition remains soft: no active antagonist, no immediate danger beyond environment, so the outcome feels relatively assured once she commits. The cost is mostly conceptual and reputational rather than urgently dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—whether Cassandra will report the certain destruction of her employers or withhold it—is legible early and coherently tightened as she confronts the “weight” of that swallowed truth. Her agency at the end (choosing silence, accepting complicity and liberation) is clearly a foreclosing move with ethical cost. Internal and external conflicts (institution vs self, certainty vs survivable doubt) interweave well, but the pressure arc is mostly reflective; there’s no on-page escalation from the Consortium, time limit, or environmental danger to sharpen the dilemma. The result is a strong but slightly static tension curve that leans heavily on thematic richness rather than concrete reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake (uncovering the truth of Daniela and the ghost shift) is clear from the outset, and tension deepens as Marcus moves from general exploration to the specific, charged discovery of the beaded valve wheel. The crucial tightening beat is the appraisal and counting of beads that turns vague suspicion into quantified horror, reconfiguring what’s at stake from personal closure to systemic exposure. The cost is primarily psychological and ethical, not immediately situational; there’s little active opposition or risk beyond atmosphere, which keeps the escalation strong but not ferocious. Still, the emotional stakes sharpen convincingly into his final commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are primarily philosophical and existential—how to relate to entropy and memory—rather than situational or interpersonal. The dominant pressure (to witness without judgment) is clearly defined but encounters little resistance; Maren does not seriously waver or face a moment where that stance is at risk. The discovery of the obsidian refuge and swan deepens her practice but does not force a costly trade-off or foreclosure of an alternate path. As a result, tension remains low and unvaried, suited to lyric meditation but below the bar for high-pressure narrative conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—how mother and daughter will face the imminent separation and whether Maya will trust her own capacity for wonder—is clear and pertinent from early on. Pressure coheres around the eclipse reaching totality, which catalyzes Maya’s admission of fear and Elena’s decision to give up the locket. Escalation is more gentle deepening than sharp narrowing; there’s no real reversal or hard trade-off beyond the symbolic relinquishment. The conflict resolves a bit smoothly, with relatively little felt risk that the conversation could go badly.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Maren can decode and reframe these residues into a path toward restoring the axis—is mostly conceptual and never faces concrete opposition. Discovery of the tapestry and the revelation that the axis is the cause (not result) of the Silence are genuine deepenings, but they don’t narrow her options or force visible trade-offs on the page. Her final decision to “walk east” is a continuation rather than a tested choice, with little sense of risk, cost, or credible alternatives. The result is intriguing but low-pressure conflict and limited escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—what Mei Lin will do with the old secrets and what identity she will inhabit—is clear early and tightens with the looming arrival of the journalist. The key escalation comes when she decides to box the specs and give them away, explicitly naming it her “final act of spycraft,” which forecloses the path of perpetual, burdened secrecy. Pressure remains mostly internal and contemplative; there’s little sense that any option would be disastrous, which softens the felt risk. Still, the trade-off between control vs. exposure is meaningfully dramatized within this quiet register.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—Elena’s mind and the integrity of this reality—is signaled early via the three-minute deadline and the anchor’s function. Pressure escalates as Marcus’s questions agitate the entity, the shadows writhe harder, and he races to complete the anchor pattern while deepening his attack on her assumptions. His agency in choosing words over brute ritual is central to resolution, and the entity’s hatred of questions is a strong antagonistic constraint. The main limitation is that victory feels slightly low-cost and swift relative to the metaphysical scale invoked.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Li Wei can find renewed meaning in how she listens and what she makes of her life’s work—is clear early and deepens toward dawn. Pressure is quiet but present: the race against exhaustion and sunrise, the fear of hollowness, and the question of what she “came to do” all converge on the decision to write a final, different kind of fortune and then descend. Escalation is more about intensifying resonance than hard reversals, which suits the accumulative design but keeps tension relatively gentle. The cost (accepting finitude, ending her career as she knew it, and embracing a less graspable kind of artistry) is felt but not sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether she can “conquer” or must reconceive the labyrinth of self—is clear, and pressure slowly tightens as more timelines and their consequences are revealed. Her micro-choices (descending to the stones, releasing the tablet, rising again) track this internal shift. However, the conflict remains almost entirely philosophical; there’s no strong sense of what immediate harm or loss follows if she refuses the new insight. As a result, tension is steady and thoughtful rather than sharply escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Marina will remain emotionally numb or reopen herself to feeling—is clearly established and pressed. Pressure escalates through the physical intensity of the drum ritual and the surfacing memories, culminating in tears and a changed self-conception. However, Marina is more acted upon than agentic during the core ritual; she doesn’t face a sharply framed choice so much as endure and accept. The cost of reopening to pain is felt but could be sharpened by a more concrete dilemma or resistance in the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira remains a private observer or becomes an active threat to a repressive authority—is legible and sharpened by the revelation that weather is being manufactured. Escalation is primarily informational/ethical: the pigeon message reweights her prior anomalies and reframes the quarantine, turning her records into dangerous evidence. The story delivers one meaningful tightening when she recognizes why she is being followed and contemplates hiding/disseminating her work, with the cost implied rather than dramatized. It’s a quiet but coherent pressure curve; a brief on-page brush with more immediate danger would have heightened the lived stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Maren will confront the painful, inherited power of scent—is clear and escalates from anticipation to the decisive act of unstoppering the vial. The pressure is primarily internal, intensifying as she moves from explanation to solitude to the moment of inhalation and tears. The emotional cost is legible (she willingly enters a grief she’s long avoided), but opposition is gentle and there are no sharp reversals or difficult trade-offs beyond the choice to feel. As a result, the conflict is affecting but not maximally tense.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is conceptual: Marcus trying to resolve whether time accumulates or passes, with the rope and the woman’s perceptions testing that question. Pressure does deepen as the rope yields Jerome’s terror and aliveness and the woman’s challenge pushes Marcus to articulate his stance on play versus weight. However, escalation remains gentle; there’s no genuine narrowing of options or painful trade-off, and Marcus’s position shifts more in nuance than in a felt, costly way. The conflict is thoughtful and coherent but never quite bites hard enough for elite-level tension.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Marina can find a way to make music mean something in the “chronic hush”—is clear, and the key tightening beat is her first attempt, which fails and deepens the sense of suffocation. The escalation is primarily internal: her frustration and re-framing of interruptions rather than external obstacles or reversals. Her eventual choice to play differently, and then to bring that music back to Echo Harbor, is an earned stance crystallization, but the price paid feels gentle rather than sharply edged. As a result, conflict is convincing yet quiet, with limited sense of foreclosed alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Vera will allow herself to feel fully again despite the pain—is clear and present early, and the inhalation of the petal is a meaningful tightening that forecloses her old numbed state. Escalation is mostly internal and textural rather than through sharp reversals; the chemist’s compassionate “message” softens opposition instead of pushing her into a harder choice. The cost (relinquishing numbness and professional distance) is articulated, but the struggle at the moment of inhalation is relatively smooth, with limited on-page resistance. Still, the final stance—choosing to return to her work differently—reads as earned endurance/renunciation rather than a soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether forgotten labor will be acknowledged—is clear and escalates from private curiosity to communal recognition. Pressure is primarily ethical and procedural rather than oppositional; there’s mention of the historical society’s rejections, but no on-page resistance pushing back at Marina’s efforts. The key tightening is her decision to “throw open her archives” and attach her influence to the cause, which reasonably forecloses inaction. Still, the lack of dramatized friction or visible sacrifice keeps the stakes from fully biting.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—finding a form of belonging and being found—is clear, and the introduction of the mysterious tag after the elder’s death provides a decent externalization of that need. There is some escalation as the search becomes ritual and community investment grows, culminating in the reveal of Senna and her need to be noticed. However, there’s little real resistance or risk; no option is truly foreclosed, and the “search” proceeds without credible threat of failure or fracture. The result is emotionally affecting but low-pressure, more contemplative than conflict-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring completeness to a world of interrupted sounds at the cost of Miriam’s own future time—is coherent and escalates as she borrows more. The key tightening comes when she decides to pull yet more time to dissolve the cage, knowing the cost is mounting. However, the external opposition is minimal; the cage dissolves on first touch and nothing pushes back, so pressure rises more by decision than by resistance. That keeps the conflict compelling but a bit too frictionless for the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.2)
    The core stake—whether Mira can transform paralyzing ambiguous loss into a survivable form—emerges early and tightens through the risk of this new, hybrid conjuring attempt. Pressure escalates as the equations glow and the apparition appears, forcing Mira to confront the terrifying possibility that she has summoned something “not him, but not nothing either.” The decisive turn is her choice to interpret this not as partial success in finding Theo, but as a reframing of her own wound, effectively renouncing the old goal. The conflict is largely internal and meditative, so moment-to-moment tension could be sharpened slightly, but the escalation and price are nonetheless clear.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.5)
    The primary stake is internal—whether Maren will remain purely hidden or risk a new form of contact—and that’s signaled early and coherently deepened by the tape’s emotional trigger. The meaningful tightening is her decision to break precedent and leave Eleanor’s letter in Neruda, shifting from private archivist to someone willing to intervene in other lives. However, the on-page sense of danger or loss from this change is gentle; potential exposure and its consequences are mostly inferred rather than dramatized. Tension is steady and apt for a quiet piece, but never quite bites.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Vera clings to her old human self or surrenders to a plant-human metamorphosis—is clear and thematically coherent. Pressure escalates as bodily signs mount and the storm returns, culminating in a meaningful internal turn when she chooses to “release control entirely.” However, the conflict remains largely contemplative; there’s no strong countervailing obligation or concrete loss (family, career, bodily function) that bites hard on the page. The result is satisfying but relatively gentle, dampening the sense of cost and sharpness of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake is existential—whether Mira’s sleepless, repetitive witnessing can cohere into meaning—and it is clearly signaled early. There is one main tightening: her decision to follow the rain toward the ghost-heavy eastern shore, which leads to the brooch and Theo and ultimately to a revaluation of her condition. However, consequences are mostly emotional and not framed as hard tradeoffs; connecting with Theo comes with minimal visible risk or cost on the page. The piece works as a quiet, accumulative escalation but remains relatively low in felt pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake is Vera’s relationship to her gift and the meaning of prophecy, with an external gloss of reaching the pearl amid possibly hostile unseen forces. Pressure does increase as shadows overlap and the cave’s song shifts toward language, culminating in contact with the pearl and the overwhelming visions. Yet the danger remains mostly implied; there is little sense that she could fail or be harmed, and her choice to take the pearl faces minimal on-page resistance. The cost is internal and thematic rather than felt as risk, keeping escalation in a moderate band.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stakes—whether the dead can be granted truthful, dignified stories and whether Elena’s work can help the harbor heal—are clear but remain largely internal and communal. Escalation is mild: we move from solitary handling of objects to interactions with families, but there’s little active resistance or cost beyond grief itself, and the prior political conflict is fully resolved before page-time. The piece reads more as a beautifully textured status quo restored than as a pressure arc that forces a new, costly stance.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—remain in “comfortable ignorance” or risk the fortress’s truths—is clearly posed and tightened by the midnight deadline and the appearance of the arrows. The main escalation is internal, as she decides to trust phenomena that violate her mapping ethos and finally uses the punch on the door. However, conflict remains relatively low-friction: the path opens with little resistance and no meaningful setback, and the costs of confronting buried truths are more told than dramatized. The result is quietly compelling rather than sharply pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Mira’s desire to help her sister versus her skepticism and fear of false hope—is legible from early on. However, conflict is mostly internal and resolves with relatively little resistance once Aldric explains; there is no serious on-page test of the method or of Mira’s willingness beyond beginning the process. The whale song’s swell and the involuntary writing provide a mild escalation, but there’s no real narrowing of options or painful trade-off—just endurance of emotional intensity. The result is a gentle, persuasive arc rather than a truly pressurized crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stakes—escape from eternal boredom and discovering what lies beyond goodbye—are clear early and tighten as the spatial mutiny escalates. The storm’s intensification and the escondite’s collapse narrow options credibly, and Vera exercises agency by intriguing the others and choosing to step through first. However, interpersonal and internal conflict are fairly low-friction; Aldric’s resistance and Thessaly’s doubt never truly threaten to derail her, and Vera’s decision feels almost entirely one-way once the “map” is revealed. The price of transformation is conceptually strong but could be sharpened through a more contested or morally fraught choice.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—can the moral debt around the ink pot and the asylum be rebalanced before the father dies—is clear and present early. Pressure deepens when Maya reveals her father is actively dying and when Mr. Chen’s history and waiting are laid out, leading to the choice to relinquish the ink pot. The conflict is mostly quiet and conversational, with no sharp reversal, which fits the piece but keeps escalation relatively subtle. The cost is legible but could be pressed harder through one more on-page moment of resistance or hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—Mei’s ongoing, solitary project of capturing non-linear time-textures—is conceptually rich but dramatically soft. Pressure does not markedly escalate; today’s hum is “lower, almost mournful,” yet it doesn’t significantly alter her tactics, risks, or emotional stance. The conflict is primarily existential (to keep or not keep this ritual) and resolves with an untroubled continuation rather than a visibly costly trade-off. This makes the piece compelling as a mood study but comparatively low-tension as narrative conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—uncovering a deliberate erasure that nearly claimed her and did claim the Meridian—is clear and tightened by the revelation of multiple falsified certificates linked to her own. The key deepening is her recognition of the identical poison notation and the decision to confront the doctor, which meaningfully changes her options. However, pressure remains relatively low-intensity and largely external/anticipatory; there’s little immediate risk or forced trade-off in the scene itself. The piece succeeds as a charged setup but does not fully exploit the danger implied by the conspiracy on this page.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Eleanor will maintain control via debunking or risk genuine listening—emerges early and tightens as the cello reveals increasingly intimate, un-heard truths. Pressure escalates from intellectual curiosity to emotional exposure (mother, colleague, grandmother) to the highest-cost memory (father’s last words), with her choice to bow again and “simply listen” serving as a credible climax. The cost is primarily internal (she weeps, her old self-concept erodes) and feels real, though it remains relatively contained to this one encounter. Slightly sharper foregrounding of what she stands to lose professionally or psychologically would heighten conflict stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the community can preempt privatization by reorganizing—is clear and present early, and pressure appropriately rises as investors arrive and coded warnings proliferate. Escalation is more conceptual than confrontational: the discovery of the thorned anchor, the council’s six-month horizon, and the decision to formalize governance represent a tightening of options. Mira’s agency matters (she must win the Marinero elders, create new symbols, broker unity), but most conflict remains in planning space rather than in a sharply dramatized ethical or interpersonal clash. The lack of an on-page reversal or hard trade-off scene keeps tension from fully peaking.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—capturing a final, irretrievable quality of darkness before technological encroachment—reads clearly and is tied to the ticking clock of sunrise and satellite grid activation. Escalation is quiet but present: the timed chemical packets and explicit countdown to “seventeen more seconds of true night” provide a tightening cadence. The main pressure is existential rather than confrontational; Elena faces no serious external obstacle, so the cost is primarily emotional and contextual rather than enacted as a hard choice. This works for the mode but keeps the tension in the strong rather than exceptional band.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—whether she can repair the drone before the ship must sail—is clear and tracked via the noon deadline and harbor bells. However, pressure never meaningfully escalates beyond the stated time constraint; each technical step proceeds smoothly with no serious setback or forced change of tactic. Elara’s calm competence keeps tension low, and there’s no reversal that threatens failure or demands a trade-off. As a result, the conflict is functional but relatively gentle for the intended prestige tier.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—reaching the true headwaters before the ice closes, versus staying safe and unresolved—is clear from early on. Volkov and the hostile terrain provide soft but coherent antagonistic pressure, and the ticking weather window functions as a constraint. The decisive tightening is her commitment to go now, with the 12-day deadline and instructions about her notes as acknowledgement of potential death. Still, escalation is relatively gentle; nothing new complicates her goal between falcon’s return and departure, so the pressure never quite sharpens into a full test.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Veradhen’s death can be transformed into balanced rebirth—is clear from early on, and the three-day ritual provides a gentle tightening of pressure. However, conflict is almost purely situational and metaphysical: the tuner encounters no opposition, no concrete obstacle, and no visible cost to herself, so tension remains cool and contemplative. The most significant “turn” is the decision not to avert collapse but to tune it correctly, which is conceptually rich but under-dramatized as a choice. The weeping townsfolk at the edge hint at emotional stakes, yet their passivity limits escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Marina will take the vial as proof or respect the temple’s purpose—appears early and tightens meaningfully when she encounters the dead diver and then the tangled accumulation of others’ longing in the vial. The key escalation is her realization that using it as “proof” requires violating not only the builders’ intent but also hundreds of near-reached, never-realized moments, which forces her into the release vs. extraction trade-off. The oxygen timer and career pressure are present but play more as framing constraints than as active escalators during the central choice; the conflict remains largely internal and resolves with relative smoothness. Still, her decision to empty the vial and then sacrifice her experiment’s ostensible goal is a clear, costly narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Milo can turn an inherited reputation for lies into credible testimony about an impossible predator—is clear and sharpened by the impending patrol and hidden bodies. Pressure escalates credibly from eerie exploration to existential threat as the hush-thing appears and begins to erode his ability to speak. His solution—using the lattice as a literal and symbolic channel for belief—is character-driven and thematically apt. The confrontation, however, resolves very quickly and with little visible cost beyond trembling, which softens the sense of hard-won victory.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stakes—ending the endless night and freeing Maren—are clear and weighty, and the resonance of the stones is a meaningful tightening of pressure. However, Elias faces little on-page resistance or dilemma once he understands the setup; he does not seriously contemplate withholding the bead or failing her, so options do not feel genuinely contested. Conflict is more situational and historic than immediate, with the cost front-loaded in Maren’s earlier sacrifice rather than in a present trade-off. As a result, escalation feels emotionally moving but somewhat preordained rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Meren will transform a cruel tradition into a gentler path—is clear and present throughout. There is one meaningful deepening when she actively breaks precedent by stitching the paths together and the sleepwalkers immediately begin using the new route, proving the change. However, there is little on-page resistance or uncertainty; we’re never shown a real possibility of failure, reprisal, or internal wavering at the moment of action. As a result, pressure accumulates more through concept and description than through escalating conflict or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will reject or reclaim her ancestral faith—appears early and coheres through the journey. The main escalation beat is her interpretive leap about the sundial, followed by the active rebuild that literally changes the environment, validating the faith she sought to debunk. Internal and external conflicts interweave, but pressure is gentle: there’s little sense of what she risks losing beyond an abstract identity shift. As a result, the resolution feels earned but not sharply tested under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—enabling a woman’s escape via a new identity and a 37-day surface-mail chain—is intriguing but never faces resistance or complication. Vera encounters no friction decoding, composing, or sending; every step proceeds as planned, so tension stays largely conceptual. Her internal conflict is minimal; she’s serenely aligned with her work. The result is a beautifully textured vignette rather than a scene with escalating pressure or visibly narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—exposing or thwarting a coup/purge—is clear and raised effectively when Mira realizes the breadth of the conspiracy. Escalation occurs mainly through deepening knowledge rather than reversals, culminating in her decision to act and the three-day deadline. However, much of the pressure remains intellectual; we rarely see concrete peril, loss, or sacrifice in the present moment that would sharpen the cost of her choice. The conflict is solid and coherent but could use one more on-page squeeze that tests her resolve under immediate risk.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Celeste will remain locked in silence or risk reconfiguring her relationship with her dead mother—is clear from early on. Pressure tightens as she moves from abstract intention (“not yet ready to decide”) to being confronted by her own words in condensation, then forced to re-see the fire via the shard. The cost of speaking—accepting her mother’s flawed love and her own complicity in the twenty-year misunderstanding—is felt but the process encounters little friction; she accepts new information quickly. Some additional resistance or a failed attempt at denial in the condensation or shard-vision beat would deepen the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant conflict—how Marina relates to memory, guilt, and the ethics of translation under trauma—is clear and steadily tightened by the interaction with the girl and the “boats” message. The discovery of the warning and her choice to soften it for the child is the key pressure point that forces a trade-off between accuracy and mercy. External stakes remain small-scale (a conversation in a waiting area), but the internal cost around the dead boy and the shrapnel is palpable. Escalation is quiet yet real, culminating in her altered stance toward the coral and her own wound.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira can recover genuine joy in her art—is clear early and deepens as she works, especially when the fragment warms and she recognizes what was missing. The primary escalation is interior: moving from numb professional competence to an unplanned, almost channeled creation that merges past and present and elicits spontaneous laughter. However, external pressure is minimal and there’s little sense of real risk or trade-off in continuing versus returning to commercial work; the “cost” remains conceptual rather than biting on the page. The arc is satisfying but gentle rather than taut.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.9)
    The core stakes—whether she can “restore” the central panel and what that demands of her stance toward knowledge—are clear and unified, and they do tighten. Escalation is mostly internal and conceptual: repeated failure raises the pressure, and the choice to ask a question rather than deploy more noise is the key turn. The cost is subtle (surrendering professional mastery and the urge to preserve), which suits the piece but keeps tension at a low simmer. There’s no strong reversal or visible sacrifice beyond this shift, which slightly limits the sense of jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake (finding a way to think freely without incurring Bureau penalties) is clear, and the main turn is Sofia’s realization that her gardening network is latent infrastructure for rebellion. Yet conflict is relatively gentle: there’s no active opposition on the page, no immediate test or sacrifice tied to their choice. Tension is mostly conceptual and future-oriented rather than dramatized through on-scene risk or dilemma. Escalation exists but feels like a smooth unveiling rather than a pressured narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.4)
    Conflict here is primarily internal and situational rather than event-driven: Minerva’s unresolved war trauma and insomnia pressure her into a life of ceaseless, quiet labor that must either deaden or transform her. Stakes (whether her grief can become sustaining beauty for others) are clear, and the armistice plus the mentoring of other refugees show that her choices have real external consequences. However, present-time escalation is subdued—the “tonight” frame does not bring a distinctly heightened crisis compared to the summarized past, and no specific new threat forces a sharper trade-off. The final beat refines stance rather than confronting a fresh, more demanding choice, keeping this in strong but not top-tier territory.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—preserving forgotten names, especially her daughter’s—is clear and emotionally potent, and the cracked tube provides a concrete problem. However, escalation is gentle: once she reaches the chamber, the ritual proceeds without significant friction or risk of failure on the page. The pressure is more atmospheric than adversarial; the foxglove regret and the crack imply cost, but the story never truly corners her or tests the possibility that the attempt might fail. As a result, the climax is affecting but low in narrative tension by elite market standards.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central conflict—whether they will risk reopening old wounds before their paths diverge—is clear and deepens from brittle small talk to precise, costly admissions. The stakes are emotional and personal, and the choice to stay and translate functions as a real turn. However, resistance dissolves relatively smoothly; the reconciliation feels a touch easy for three years of entrenched silence.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.6)
    The core stake—whether and how to expose the truth about Elara without endangering the villages—is well defined and sharpened when the adhesive test timestamps the envelope to the dam collapse. There is a clear deepening as Mira decodes the confession and reinterprets the public narrative as murder rather than sabotage. However, the on-page pressure remains relatively internal and reflective; the consortium’s ongoing power and the villages’ current vulnerability are asserted rather than dramatized, so the cost of her present-tense restraint isn’t fully felt as an immediate squeeze. The escalation is solid but not bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central stake is Elara’s capacity to trust and risk visibility versus remain safely erased, signaled early via her flight from investigators and reinforced by her attic seclusion. Pressure tightens when Mira asks, “Did you always work with books?” and then “Show me,” forcing Elara to choose between her practiced lie and authentic, dangerous disclosure. The decision to speak, hand over the meteorite, and then start a journal forecloses the prior path of total anonymity with an implied but real potential cost. The conflict remains largely internal and could stand one more concrete external pressure, but at this scale the escalation reads coherent and sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Wren will remain in drifting exile or risk crossing a charged threshold—is clear early and deepens through her fixation on sacred thresholds and the logbook. Escalation is primarily internal and conceptual rather than peril-based: the arrival at the violet edge, reinterpretation of the codes as prayers, and realization that “necessary distances weren’t punishments” tighten her choice space. Her agency at the climax (choosing to step through, declaring she’s ready to stop drifting) resolves the central tension in a way that feels earned. The one limitation is that external pressure stays relatively low; there’s no strong sense of what she might concretely lose by either staying or leaving beyond the abstract emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Marina’s need for a livable form of belonging—is clear, but on-page pressure remains gentle and largely unopposed once she arrives. The principal tightening comes when the fish finally spawn and Theo asks whether she’ll come back, forcing her to articulate a provisional stance (“I’ll stay until sunrise tonight”). That’s a credible but low-intensity test; she’s not forced to relinquish something palpable in the moment. The piece reads more as a beautifully textured initiation than as a conflict-driven arc with escalating costs.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—Mira’s need to understand erased paths and her sister’s disappearance—is clear and the internal conflict between searching and accepting is credible. Pressure escalates once via the discovery and use of the seeds to re-interpret her sister’s final emotions, narrowing her options to a stance on not-finding. However, the three-day memory limit and any risk to her current self never fully tighten on the page, so tension remains more contemplative than urgent. The resolution feels earned but relatively gentle in terms of on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.8)
    The primary stake—capturing and enchanting the wandering opera crowd—is clear, and the child’s interruption provides a modest jolt of risk to Marina’s carefully laid plans. However, escalation remains gentle; her adaptation to chaos comes easily and without visible sacrifice, so tension never tightens into a truly consequential trade-off. The performance feels slightly too safe: success seems likely from the outset and is never seriously imperiled. As a result, the conflict is engaging but not gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—Kira’s choice to undergo an irreversible, outlawed transformation—is clear and carries real conceptual cost. Escalation comes from moving from abstract desire to the physical act of inscription and its aftermath, with the pain and permanence foregrounded. However, the conflict is mostly internal and declarative; there is little on-page resistance, doubt, or counterpressure once Selene agrees, so the pressure curve rises but never tightens into a hard trade-off moment. More visible testing of Kira’s resolve mid-ritual or sharper consequences articulated by Selene in the act would heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—losing the atrium and old harbor—is clear, but the pressure is relatively static since the council’s decision is already made by the opening. The main “tightening” is internal: accepting that the atrium cannot be saved and pivoting to a new vision, via the ripple-reading moment. There’s little real sense of narrowing options or painful trade-off beyond resignation and redesign; she never seriously considers resistance or sabotage. The conflict is thoughtful and coherent but quite gentle for elite-literary stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether he can let go enough to scatter Celia’s ashes and what that means for his relationship to loss—is clear from early on. Pressure coherently tightens from the climb through to his paralysis at the clearing; the key deepening comes when he re-reads the crack in the box and reinterprets what love and perfection mean, enabling the act. The cost of scattering is palpable, as is the quieter but significant renunciation of his fantasy that suffering needs translation. Escalation is more inward than dramatic and could bear one sharper beat of resistance or doubt at the moment of release, but it remains effective.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—Elise’s survival—is clear and heavy, and Marina’s need to choose a direction for action gives the scene purpose. Pressure escalates modestly through the bead experiments to the discovery of the triangle pattern and the Geneva/Hoffman thread. However, there’s little genuine resistance or dilemma on the page: no competing bright timelines or meaningful downside to this choice are dramatized, so the decision feels low-friction despite the big stakes. The piece reads more as a contemplative optimization than a tested, painful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are primarily internal and conceptual: whether Mira’s work has purpose and whether “wall dreams” are real, culminating in her decision to embrace the legacy. The piece escalates by layering discoveries—Helena’s diaries, then proof of designed listening walls, then the deep echoes—but the pressure remains gentle, with minimal sense of risk, sacrifice, or alternative paths foreclosed. The legacy burden is named but not strongly dramatized as a tension that costs her something here and now. As a result, the conflict feels resonant but relatively low-intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether she can fix this moment of possibility into the painting before the bells break the “membrane”—never feels truly contested. There is no on-page resistance, failure risk, or meaningful alternative path; she simply executes her craft smoothly. The time pressure of the bells is invoked but not emotionally or practically sharpened (no sense of what would be lost if she were interrupted). As a result, escalation is more implied than felt, and tension remains low.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether this attempt at ending the Forever War will be meaningfully different—is clear, and the cosmic deadline plus mutual grief create a coherent field of pressure. Elara’s innovation via ritual and her candid admission of uncertainty provide a real, if quiet, test of commitment that culminates in the simultaneous signing. However, the negotiation itself is almost entirely off-stage; once Theron and Kell arrive, no serious obstacle or reversal threatens the treaty, so escalation feels more like solemn procession than tightening conflict. The cost is conceptual and emotional rather than dramatized through a hard trade-off in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake is Eleanor’s need to perform this private, “pointless” act against the weight of her self-conception as a ruthless calculator, with the world-scale stakes (drought, poisoned water) largely already resolved. Pressure builds modestly through the arrival of rain, the initiation of the “release sequence,” and the thunder swallowing the calls. The real conflict is between her utilitarian logic and her sentimentality, culminating in her decision to leave the device playing unheard; that trade-off is clear but remains mostly conceptual rather than viscerally tested. The absence of any real possibility she might choose otherwise keeps escalation from reaching a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Meridia will successfully unlock and internalize the generational echoes—is clear and thematically potent. However, conflict is largely internal and even there, pressure is low; once she chooses to perform the ritual, nothing substantial resists her. The voices never truly threaten to overwhelm or fragment her, and there’s no external counterforce on the page. As a result, escalation is more about deepening lyric density than about narrowing options or raising visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central stake—whether their relationship and professional ethics can coexist after her charge of “corrupting people”—is clear and personal. Pressure escalates from post-argument stillness to Vera’s risky request (“Show me”), through the puppet performance that mirrors and tests them. The cost is emotional vulnerability and a partial surrender of certainty on both sides, captured in Vera’s tears and their joint inscription. The conflict remains mostly internal and conversational, so the sense of danger is quiet rather than acute, but it does deepen once in a meaningful way.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—Vera’s need to bear witness to an unceremonious extinction—is clearly signaled and coherently pressured by the impending, one-time-only migration. Escalation is accumulative rather than reversal-based: building more frames, then the butterflies arriving, then the single monarch landing on the moth wing, tightening the emotional cost. Her choice to dismantle the structures afterward (and keep only the wing) crystallizes her stance: she refuses the fantasy of permanence and accepts a costly, transient form of memorialization. The conflict is quiet and internal, so while the pressure is clear and real, it never quite reaches the knife-edge extremity that would push this into the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Elin can reclaim and preserve the lost names without destroying what others entrusted to the rope—reads clearly and tightens as she reconfigures the braid and the rope starts to hum. Internal stakes (guilt vs. forgiveness, artifact vs. embodied memory) deepen in parallel with the ritual. The decisive change is her choice to let herself become the conduit and to spend the last scrap, which forecloses her previous strategy of hoarding relics. The conflict remains mostly interior and succeeds on that scale, though the danger to the rope and ritual never quite manifests as a tested risk, keeping tension more meditative than sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—a philosophical but real question of how Mira will use or refuse this power over paths—is clear and sharpened by the scientists’ catastrophic precedent. Pressure escalates when she breaks the seal and realizes she can step into specific phantom lives or become the “choosing itself.” However, the crucial choice moment is handled in a somewhat summarizing register; we’re told she understands both options and cost, then watch her resolve, without feeling much on-page resistance or loss around any single tempting path. The conflict is coherent and meaningful, but not quite as pressurized or dramatized as the premise invites.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she can establish communication with the unknown—is clear, and the tension is intellectual and spiritual rather than overtly dramatic. There is a meaningful deepening as the prime sequence emerges and resolves into the orbital “invitation,” which tightens what’s at stake in her work. Yet the night proceeds without real obstacles or reversals; nothing seriously threatens the experiment, her access, or her resolve. As a result, the escalation feels more like a steady unveiling than real pressure that forecloses options or exacts an immediate price.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Thorne will carry his rage back to his world and perpetuate war—is legible early and resolved by his choice to release resentment. The internal conflict tightens when ancestral peace memories surface against his lived grief, and the beat where his fists unclench serves as a clear turn. Still, pressure is relatively gentle: there’s little on-page risk that he might reject Mireva’s teaching, and no explicit immediate consequence if he does. The conflict works but never feels truly knife-edged.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Elara will cross into or reclaim the world of her lost dream—is clear and does tighten as she completes the sextant and finally sees the glass mountains. The main escalation is internal: the moment she realizes “she could step through now” followed by her refusal and redefinition of the dream’s role. That renunciation has conceptual cost (remaining in the ruined world, embracing a slow, uncertain approach), though the price is implied rather than viscerally felt. External opposition is minimal and the pressure is largely self-imposed, which works for this lyric mode but keeps intensity in the moderate range.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the mending craft and the family’s knowledge will survive the guild’s fall—is clear and thematically apt. There is one meaningful tightening when the bag’s contents shift the situation from likely extinction to fragile continuation. However, on-page pressure remains relatively gentle: the climb is strenuous but not perilous, and there’s little sense that they might fail to recover or preserve the knowledge once the journal appears. Emotional stakes are present but could be deepened with more concrete risk or sacrifice beyond the symbolic handover of the ribbon.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Maren will engage with the “forbidden” family knowledge and take on its responsibility—is clear and does tighten once she enters the bathroom and actively inquires. The conceptual pressure escalates when she realizes the inheritance moves backward and forward in time and that her role is self-created and inescapable. However, opposition is almost entirely abstract, and the decision to accept her role comes with little on-page struggle or visible sacrifice beyond an implied eternity of work. The conflict remains mostly intellectual and could benefit from one sharper, dramatized moment of resistance or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stakes—rescuing Thessaly and persuading the mountain to let its lessons out—are clear and thematically rich. The arrival of the time traveler introduces a meaningful tightening via foreknowledge of multiple failed attempts and deaths. Yet the conflict never truly bites on the page: the mountain’s resistance and Mira’s risk remain mostly implied, and her appeal succeeds after one speech with no visible setback or hard trade-off. As a result, escalation feels more like a conceptual deepening than a pressure cooker.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—lose herself to the Garden’s erasure vs. reclaim a painful, unstable shared identity—is clear and escalates once the sister appears and reframes the Garden as a state of being. The pressure tightens when we learn the sister has been “trying to forget,” making Maya’s plea a genuine contest of values rather than a foregone conclusion. The climactic tactic (using invented/shared narrative to pull the sister back) is strong, but the price of that reversal (what they both give up) is gestured at more than felt. Stakes remain intimate and coherent, though a sharper sense of risk or potential failure in the closing exchange would heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring a severed connection and reinterpreting an infamous disappearance—is intelligible but remains abstract and largely unopposed. Once the door appears, Mira’s path never genuinely narrows; the rope rebraiding reads as meticulous but not dangerous, morally fraught, or time-pressured. As a result, escalation is more procedural deepening than felt tightening, and there is little visible price attached to success. The conflict functions but does not fully earn its metaphysical weight.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—finding a silence shielded from the beings’ frequencies—is clear and the pressure is coherent. Escalation comes mainly from accumulated textural and situational changes (shifting caves, unreliable echoes, new ice) rather than sharp reversals, with one meaningful deepening when the ice spiral leads to an unmapped chamber. Vera’s agency drives the solution, and the resolution is earned by her decision to repurpose her skills for others. However, the journey from need to success is relatively smooth; no option is truly foreclosed or severely tested, which softens the sense of price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will fulfill or fail her custodial duty at the exact moment when cosmic conditions permit rebirth—is clear and does tighten once she realizes “tonight” is the date. The conflict between her obsession with meaning (the prism/visions) and the practical job of keeping the beacon lit is conceptually strong. On the page, though, escalation is relatively gentle: neglecting the beacon has no immediate repercussion beyond a guttering flame that she reignites without obstacle. As a result, the story feels more like a beautifully rendered affirmation than a test that exacts visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will recast her people’s understanding of their own past—is clear and thematically potent. Pressure escalates modestly when her verification method produces irreconcilable results, forcing her to choose between preserving the myth of coherence or revealing the palimpsest. However, the conflict never quite sharpens into a difficult trade-off with concrete consequences; social and personal costs are gestured at rather than dramatized or specified. As a result, the decision, while meaningful, feels relatively unopposed and low-risk on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will stay paralyzed by grief or re-engage her craft—is clear and present early. Pressure tightens via the unexpected mosaic message and the emotionally loaded reunion with her grandmother, pushing her toward a choice to perform now rather than retreat. The internal conflict and the fireworks preparation/ignition beats interweave, but there’s minimal real risk of failure or reversal once she commits; the display itself proceeds almost too smoothly. The result is a persuasive but relatively gentle escalation, with the cost and danger more implied than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central stake—whether mother and daughter will remain estranged or begin to reconnect after Mira’s absence at the father’s death—is clear from Elena’s opening question. Pressure tightens as Mira initially sidesteps, then moves from abstract reflections on time toward a vulnerable admission of failure, prompting a subtle but decisive shift in Elena. The conflict is largely internal and conversational, but it escalates credibly from accusation toward fragile openness. The cost of failure is substantial, though the on-page risk of the scene feels safe enough that the tension never quite cuts as deep as it could.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Mira can renegotiate her relationship to silence and fear—is clear but resolves in a gently accumulative way rather than through sharp escalation. The gravity inversion briefly heightens pressure by triggering panic, yet no significant option is truly foreclosed beyond her decision to postpone confronting the bunker silence. Her agency is present (timing the visit, choosing to gather this particular silence, then choosing “not yet”), but the price of those choices remains largely conceptual. As a result, tension is more atmospheric than gripping, which holds this below top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Eris can transform a space of echoing grief into one of receptive silence—is clear and culminates in her choice to dissolve the storm glass. Escalation is subtle but present: weeks of monitoring, the unprecedented helix, the uncanny quiet triggered by the whistle, then the irrevocable opening of the vial. The cost (relinquishing her daughter’s preserved data/memory) is legible but underplayed; a beat of sharper hesitation or fear could sharpen the pressure. Conflict remains purely internal and situational, with no counterforce challenging her plan beyond that understated emotional risk.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—whether anyone will claim the throne and re-anchor legitimacy—is clear early and returns at the end, with one key tightening when the dawn deadline is invoked. The main pressure point is Meridia’s choice to step through and begin the ascent herself despite not seeing herself as a ruler, which does foreclose the path of remaining a neutral archivist. However, external conflict is minimal: murals yield information without serious complication, and no genuine alternative tactic or failure state is explored beyond the abstract threat of time. The result is thematically weighty but low-suspense escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—Mira’s fiercely guarded solitude versus Sera’s desperate need for a way to live with pain—is clear early and coherently maintained. Pressure deepens when Sera asks not for reunion but instruction, forcing Mira to weigh her ethos of thresholds against the cost of contact. However, escalation is relatively gentle; once Sera states her need, Mira’s resistance softens with minimal further testing or complication. The price (sanctuary for one becoming permeable, and the condition that Sera cannot stay) is legible but could be pushed harder on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Vera can withstand and translate the quantum promise without losing herself—is coherent and escalates from eerie texts to a doorway to an overwhelming flood of parallel selves. Her act of volunteering is a real commitment that triggers a single, meaningful tightening: the near-crushing psychological pressure she must channel. However, the conflict resolves without much on-page possibility of failure or lasting negative repercussion, so the tension feels high-concept rather than truly perilous.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Margaret will face and integrate the buried truth of her family and decide how to stand in relation to it—is clear. Pressure deepens when the silence “speaks” of exploitation and when she emotionally apprehends her grandmother’s reparative dismantling; that knowledge tightens her options, making complacent inheritance impossible. However, conflict remains almost entirely internal and meditative, with relatively low on-page struggle or resistance, and no concrete external test of her new stance. The cost is implied more than dramatized, which keeps escalation from reaching a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Aldric clings to the certainties of his order or surrenders to possibility—is clear and escalates as reality destabilizes. There’s a meaningful tightening when he chooses to remove his armor and speak the unfamiliar allegiance, foreclosing a return to his former role. However, opposition is mostly atmospheric rather than active; nothing truly resists him beyond awe and fear, so tension feels more like rising wonder than pressured conflict. As a result, the transformation is resonant but not sharply tested under visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    The conflict is primarily internal: the tension between Eleanor’s impulse to withdraw after heartbreak and her compulsion to keep honoring other people’s attempts at love and remembrance. The stakes are modest but legible—the cost of staying emotionally raw in the face of forgotten tragedies—and the discovery of Thomas and Samuel meaningfully deepens this pressure. Escalation is subtle rather than sharp, so the piece never quite hits a visceral crunch point, but the central stance crystallization at the end still feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—preventing the permanent erasure of historical truth—is explicit early and coherently drives all of Mira’s tactics. There is a clear tightening when the Council’s raid deadline collapses her three-year plan into a single night, and a secondary tightening when the boots approach above. Yet the on-page pressure never quite bites: the decoy works perfectly, the escape is smooth, and we never see a substantive loss or hard trade-off beyond generic risk. As a result, escalation reads more declared than viscerally tested.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—ending a generational curse of compulsive prophecy—is clear and present early, and the pressure coheres around whether she can finally unmake it. Escalation is primarily internal and accumulative: the prophecy rises in her throat as she plays more complex patterns and deploys the vested hush. Her agency at the climax is unambiguous: she uses her learned technique to smother the words, foreclosing a future of repetition and descendants. However, the conflict resolves somewhat smoothly, with limited on-page resistance from the prophecy itself, so tension never fully peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Wren’s lifelong search for meaning in the leaves yields anything real—is clear and the hush provides a natural tightening of pressure. The escalation arrives when the crimson leaf’s patterns actively rearrange and the “message” reframes as an invitation to transformation, which is a genuine deepening of stakes. Yet there is minimal resistance or trade-off; once the invitation appears, Wren accepts it without serious doubt, danger, or competing value. The conflict remains mostly contemplative, so the emotional and practical cost of accepting transformation is underplayed.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake is Mira’s internal stance toward certainty versus uncertainty in planning, and it is clearly signaled and followed through. The story does escalate in a situational/accumulative way—from odd coincidences to a charged encounter with the compass and logbook and finally to her decision to build a probabilistic clock and stop counting time on the climb out. However, external conflict is virtually absent and internal pressure is relatively smooth; she faces little genuine risk or temptation to revert, so the feeling of cost and narrowing options is muted. The result is intellectually satisfying but emotionally low-tension.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—reframing her father’s legacy and her own shame—is clear and present from early on. However, the conflict is mostly internal and reflective, and the central task (the transmutation) unfolds without serious challenge or risk of failure on the page. As a result, pressure does not meaningfully tighten; her commitment is tested in intention more than in action.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—Maren’s crisis of purpose and self—is clearly signaled early and deepens once the harp reveals how she has been healing via laughter. Pressure escalates internally rather than through overt external danger, with the key tightening being the flood of confessions that force her to confront the dissonance between her self-perception and others’ experience. The cost is largely existential (bearing centuries of forgotten intimacy and gratitude), which is legible but relatively gentle. The lack of a harder dilemma or trade-off keeps the conflict effective but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elena will merely understand the algorithm or actively oppose/rewrite it—is signaled early and resolves in her decision to remain in the forest and “calculate a warmer answer.” There is a meaningful deepening when pain becomes interpretable data and she grasps that mercy is economized cruelty, which raises the ethical stakes. However, on-page pressure lacks a strong external antagonist or concrete obstacle in the present scene; most escalation is conceptual rather than situational, making the conflict feel more like an internal realignment than a true test under fire. The price of her new stance is implied (ongoing suffering, isolation) more than viscerally dramatized in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will accept the inheritance of work in the between-spaces—is signaled and comes to a meaningful tightening when she hesitates with the fragment in hand. Internal and external conflicts braid well: the desire to honor her grandmother versus the cost of living “elusively tangible to both worlds.” However, opposition remains mostly internal and briefly dramatized; one more beat of resistance or alternative path would deepen the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Miriam merely assesses the elevator or also assumes responsibility for this buried history—is clearly signaled and does deepen when she decides to “engage.” The decisive turn is her choice to honor Eleanor via the historical society rather than treating the find as a curiosity. However, pressure remains gentle: the ghost is cooperative, there’s no serious risk or opposition, and options aren’t dramatically foreclosed. The conflict is satisfying but low-intensity, limiting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether to rupture a self-protective perfect system—is clearly signaled and does intensify as the library trembles and clouds churn. The meaningful tightening comes when the frost “completed its pattern,” forcing Maren to act in that charged instant. However, conflict is mostly conceptual and one-sided; no opposing force or serious doubt challenges her plan, and the library’s “laughter” softens the sense of risk. Stakes are interesting and coherent but not sharply contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Maren remains a cataloger of the dead or risks herself to join the vanished civilization—is clear and present early. Pressure escalates as the storm intensifies, she forms a radical new theory, and then deliberately breaks her own safety ritual by uncovering the mirror. The cost of stepping through (abandoning her world and body, leaving only notes behind to be misread) is legible, though the external danger of storms is more atmospheric than truly threatening. The conflict is primarily internal but resolves via a decisive, earned act rather than a purely contemplative epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—saving and “tethering” the light before midnight—is established early and escalates through the weakening chip and the cumulative song. The major tightening is the “wilting” when his selfish motive is exposed, forcing him to give up the resurrection fantasy to complete the work. External pressure (midnight) is evocative but remains soft-focus; the danger doesn’t quite bite on the page beyond the chip dimming. Still, the internal and external stakes interweave effectively at the key decision point.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Maren will truly encounter and cross the Threshold versus remain in the safe, knowable world—is clear and lands in her final choice not to look for the way back. Escalation is mostly textural: silence after factory noise → deepening cave → vision of a prior expedition that didn’t return → lagoon itself becoming semi-linguistic and welcoming. Agency is present (she times her descent, performs the reading, collects the key scent, chooses to stay), but external opposition is minimal and the risk feels largely existential rather than sharply dramatized. As a result, tension is steady and thoughtful rather than sharply tightening, which is strong but not maximal for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stakes—survival/orientation in the storm and Marina’s existential orientation to her art and inheritance—are signaled early and resolved by the end. There is one meaningful tightening when she chooses to use the slide in the lightning, shifting from physical fear to profound interpretive risk. However, the external danger ebbs conveniently once the realization arrives, and the internal conflict doesn’t quite crest into a pressured trade-off; the cost of embracing the alliance is more implied than actively contested. Tension is present but relatively gentle, limiting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake is internal—can Mira grasp and meaningfully enact her grandmother’s insight—and it’s signaled early through the postcards and the question of why flowers wait for darkness. Pressure escalates via her slow dawning recognition of the human figure in the innermost glass and the shift from contemplation to creating the mural. Still, the conflict remains very low-intensity and relatively unopposed; there’s no real alternative path or visible sacrifice she must reject. The piece succeeds as quiet lyric escalation, but without a sharper felt trade-off it doesn’t fully reach high-band stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether suppressed truth about manufactured scarcity will remain buried—is clear, but it rarely faces strong on-page resistance. Escalation comes from accumulating revelation and Celeste’s decision to go to the lagoon, yet the journey and encounter unfold with little friction or danger. The retrocognitive “trap” suggests psychological cost, but in scene this mostly functions as flavor rather than a constraint that forces hard trade-offs. As a result, the climax feels more like a graceful handoff of information than a pressured test of commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether a village built on wish-magic can reconstitute itself without that crutch—is clear and resolved by Mira’s intervention. However, opposition is largely conceptual; there’s no on-page obstacle that genuinely threatens failure once she starts working. The main tightening is her reinterpretation of the fisherman’s wish, which shifts tactics but doesn’t cost her much beyond effort. As a result, tension is gentle and meditative rather than sharpening into a pressured test of resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is Maren’s relationship to her vocation: is she merely an archivist of the past or an unwitting agent of prophecy, and what that means for her work tonight. Pressure does build somewhat—from routine ritual, to the wax fragment activating, to the realization that she has just spoken a future that names her—but the escalation is gentle and largely conceptual. There’s no strong external opposition or concrete cost to her choices; she simply continues to write and listen, now with deeper awareness. The result is intellectually engaging but short of the tighter, more consequential narrowing of options needed for higher conflict scores at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—whether she can access and integrate the vortex inheritance without losing everything to entropy—is conceptually strong and signaled early. But after the risk is named, the process itself unfolds smoothly: the humming works on the first try, the ice organizes without complication, and the vortex’s descent involves no resistance or hard trade-off. The piece functions more as a ritual initiation than a contested struggle, so tension rises more through accumulating imagery than through tightening options or visible cost. That keeps the conflict from achieving the felt escalation a top-tier literary publication would expect.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether and how she will break the sanctuary’s primordial silence with a new kind of sound—is clear and grows texturally toward the solstice. There is one meaningful tightening when the note appears and the instruments’ readings converge, forcing her to act. However, conflict is largely internal and contemplative, with minimal felt risk or resistance; the option not to ring the bell never truly asserts itself as a live alternative, which softens escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake is Mira’s stance toward solitude and insignificance, and that conflict is clear but largely internal and meditative. There is a modest escalation as meteors are reinterpreted—from death to arrival—and as she recognizes her inability to leave as a chosen rebellion rather than mere habit. However, there is little sense of narrowing options or a pressured decision point; the piece is more contemplative than dynamically contested.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Maren’s commitment to preserving unspoken words and granting ghosts release—is clear but operates at a low temperature. There is a mild deepening when the young mother appears and we see a specific, emotionally charged instance of the abstract duty, but the pressure doesn’t significantly tighten beyond that. Maren’s agency at the end (choosing not to seek the child yet, continuing to keep the box closed) is a form of earned stasis, though the sense of trade-off and cost could be sharper. Overall, conflict is contemplative rather than escalating, which suits the piece but caps tension.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—how Vera will use her limited, borrowed years and what the capsule is truly preserving—is clear but relatively gentle. Pressure does escalate through discovery: the urn’s role, the malfunction, the garage-sale encodings, and the reinterpretation of the capsule as method rather than object vault. However, Vera encounters little opposition, internal or external, and her decision to continue Elena’s work feels largely unopposed rather than wrestled with. The result is a beautiful but low-friction arc where the sense of cost and sacrifice remains understated.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the boy’s “ruined” kite can find “its own kind of flight” and how Mira’s philosophy meets that small disaster—is clear but gentle. There is a meaningful turn when she elects not just to fix the kite but to alter it, embracing difference and incompleteness. However, pressure never tightens beyond mild emotional stakes; there is no real alternative path or sacrifice that would deepen the sense of cost. As a result, the conflict functions but does not truly escalate or bite.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—use limited time to reestablish communication between species—is clear and tightened by her physical decline and the orchard’s long history of miscommunication. The key escalation is her shift from personally climbing and wiring to training younger islanders when her hands tremble, which narrows options and forces a trade-off between direct control and legacy. That said, conflict is mostly conceptual and there’s little on-page resistance or failure; the work proceeds almost too smoothly. Tension lives more in the ticking diagnosis and accumulated changes than in scene-level obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake is Mira’s stance toward meaning and the alien message—whether she will remain a detached skeptic or accept a charged form of understanding. Pressure accumulates via the pilgrims’ shared silence, the specificity of the aliens’ choice of object, and Mira’s recognition of their long observation of Earth. The key tightening is her sudden comprehension of the coordinates’ pattern, which pushes her toward a decision, but there is little sense of risk or competing viable options. The cost of choosing to “believe” (or to answer) is understated, keeping escalation emotionally subtle rather than sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—can patient, interspecies-guided gardening redeem a mass grave and dead reef—is clear but remains mostly conceptual and gently held. Erasmus faces no explicit opposition or dilemma; his ritual is already established and uncontested, so there’s little escalation beyond deepening our understanding of it. The closest thing to a tightening is recognizing the reef’s death as enabling his project, but this is interpretive rather than a pressure spike that narrows options. As a result, the piece succeeds as a meditative vignette more than as a story with strong, escalating conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—finding a living daughter in a dead world—is clear and emotionally charged, and there is a meaningful tightening when the riddle focuses the search and the box yields confirmation that Sera is alive. However, Marta encounters minimal resistance: she goes to Ven, receives the clue, runs to the compost pit, digs, and succeeds on the first try. The internal conflict is present but under-pressured; we don’t see her seriously weighing staying vs. going or confronting concrete risks of the journey. As a result, escalation feels more like a graceful unfurling than a true test of resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—how Mira will live with/define her exile when contact reappears—is established and sharpened when the ship arrives. The principal tightening is her decision to prioritize finishing the sketch over rushing to the promise of rescue; that forecloses a path in a meaningful, if quiet, way. Internal and external pressures are aligned but not heavily opposed, so escalation feels like a deepening rather than a hard squeeze. The cost is present (risk of losing or delaying reunion) but somewhat underplayed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—saving the dying master—is clear early, and the move from contemplating theft to actively solving the vault puzzle is a credible tightening. The letter recontextualizes the power dynamic (prisoner vs. heir), adding an internal, relational stake at the end. Still, the conflict remains relatively low-friction: there’s no on-page failure, countdown, or serious moral hesitation, so choices never feel truly costly in the moment. The result is emotionally satisfying but less tense than the premise promises.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake is Vera’s stance toward her own trauma—whether she continues as a professionalized mourner or claims a different role—which is clear and ultimately resolved. Pressure escalates mainly through internal realization: walking her own name marks a key turn, and the act of placing named pawns crystallizes her renunciation and new commitment. The cost (abandoning the income and identity structure of crisis acting) is implicit but legible. The conflict stays fairly low-temperature and reflective; a touch more on-page friction or risk in the present would deepen stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Vera will reclaim her dangerous gift, with the attendant pain of remembering—remains coherent from start to finish. There is a clear tightening when she discovers the feather and understands the language is bodily, not mental, which finally offers a path around the plague’s erasure. The cost at the end (being “whole enough to hurt” and hearing the world’s grief) is conceptually strong but largely conveyed in insight rather than dramatized friction or opposition in scene. Conflict stays primarily internal and contemplative, with little resistance once the feather’s method is discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—Marcus’s need to reframe his responsibility and, secondarily, to release the village—emerges early and coheres. Pressure deepens as he decodes the tapestry and confronts the mirror; the central tightening is realizing the village preserved itself and exists as a crucible for his guilt, forcing the choice to relinquish the knight. However, the conflict is almost entirely internal and progresses without strong resistance, reversal, or tangible risk, making the escalation feel contemplative rather than tense. The cost is emotional, not structural, which is appropriate but keeps the pressure in a mid-high rather than peak band.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether her mother will be reduced to a single sin—is clear early and tightens as dawn approaches and the poets take their positions. Sera’s choice to speak seven truths instead of one is a genuine escalation, and the Elders’ shouted commands show some external pushback. However, the resistance feels somewhat frictionless: the risk to Sera and the community is implied more than concretely pressured in the scene, so the climax reads powerful but a bit too uncontested for elite-level stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Vera can transform her broken past into something meaningfully integrated before literal/psychic dissolution—is legible and escalates as she moves to ever-deeper wounds. The workshop lurching, gears self-activating, and the increasingly painful memories provide a clear tightening. Agency is centered in her choice to continue the narration and to match the deepest pockmark to her daughter, paying emotional cost to complete the pattern. The limitation is that external danger (the acid sea, structural collapse) remains more atmospheric than concretely constraining her options in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Edwin will meaningfully reorient his creative life instead of endlessly repeating the quay—is clear and coherent. Escalation is subtle but present: the mirror omen, the literal detour into the cave, and the intense, trance-like painting session culminate in the revelation of his daughter’s face and the merged sunset. His choice to recommit to painting with a reinterpreted promise (and to drive back toward the quay) is an earned resolution, with the cost being an acceptance of ongoing, conscious grief. The conflict remains largely internal and low-pressure, which is appropriate but keeps it just shy of the most charged band.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether the boy’s quiet grief will be heard and guided toward release—is clear and emotionally present. Pressure accumulates via the eerie scent, the discovery that he has been pulled across the water, and the revelation of his funeral experience; Mira’s choice to actively beckon and guide him constitutes the main tightening. However, her internal or external options never feel genuinely constrained—it’s almost a foregone conclusion she’ll respond with care, and the world offers little resistance. The result is moving but low-friction, with minimal visible cost in the present tense.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira can build a beacon that gives her grief and the drowned a navigational path—is clear and escalates through the increasingly intelligible calls and the solstice “reverse migration” mandate. The hydraulic failure, her decision to stay, and the all-night construction session constitute a credible tightening of pressure. However, the conflict remains mostly uncontested; there’s little on-page resistance beyond fatigue, no real risk of failure dramatized, and no hard tradeoff that bites in the climax. The result is strong but relatively gentle escalation rather than a truly sharpened crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant conflict—Maren’s need for psychological safety versus the costs and risks of reclaiming selective opacity—is clear and tight. Pressure escalates from background loss (trees, society) to the high-stakes test of the eye and the decision to disseminate instructions. The internal stakes (reopening herself to connection and danger) are strongly felt; the external stakes (execution, “they’re looking”) are present but under-dramatized on the page. As a result, the piece leans slightly more contemplative than pressurized at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will meaningfully interpret and respond to the stranger’s final gesture—is present but kept very quiet. There is one clear deepening when the borrowed memory arrives and recontextualizes the logbook, leading to his inscription and resolve to reach the woman. However, opposition is almost nonexistent; no serious alternative path or risk is dramatized, and his choice costs him little on the page beyond a subtle shift in solitude. Strong tension at the sentence level compensates somewhat, but escalation remains modest.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stakes—risking her life to reach a mythic doorway that might resolve a lifelong obsession—are established early and maintained. Escalation is clear: empty shop loneliness → hazardous descent → time-limited cavern → metaphysical crossroads forcing a core identity choice. However, the physical stakes of the rising water don’t fully bite into the final decision, which tips more into philosophical than visceral territory, and we don’t see a concrete sacrifice beyond implied lost possibilities. The resolution is still earned and costs her something real, but the price could feel sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the queen will face the truth about her advisor and act—is clear from early on and coherently deepens. The key tightening comes when the oracle names the advisor and then, more importantly, when the queen is forced to accept that the “prophecies” are her own buried witness; this strips away her last defense against action. The final plan (reach palace, gain proof, confront him) is an earned crystallization of agency, not a rhetorical flourish. Escalation is primarily internal rather than driven by new external impediments, which keeps the pressure intense but relatively quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira can reconcile her need to “capture” presence with the inevitability of change and leaving—is clear early via the Academy offer and her research aim. Pressure escalates when Theo names her true motive and invokes her mother, forcing her into emotional disarray and destabilizing her current framework. The pivotal turn is her reframing of the journey’s purpose and the decision to give Theo the shell, which forecloses a version of her old containment-driven self. The main ceiling is that the conflict stays mostly in the realm of articulated insight; the cost is emotionally felt but not deeply dramatized in behavior beyond the symbolic handoff.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant conflict—how to live and work knowing her own grave and fractured time—is clear and escalates from disorientation to acute jealousy to a reoriented purpose. The stakes are existential yet grounded in small, concrete acts (reading old entries, writing a new one, deciding to climb the ridge). Her eventual choice to stop resisting the foreknown ending and “start writing toward” it is a credible earned stasis with cost. Conflict remains largely internal and reflective, with relatively little on-page resistance, which tempers the sense of tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether this heirloom and the lineage it represents can be meaningfully restored—is legible early and coherently pursued. Pressure builds modestly as Elena discovers the botched cleaning, implicating Margaret’s mother and layering generational failure into the technical problem. Repairing the clamp functions as the central turn, leading to Margaret’s emotional release and the reconfigured sense of inheritance. However, tension never tightens into a truly fraught choice; the path forward is gentle and largely uncontested, which keeps escalation from feeling high-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira can transform her fear-triggered ice from curse to tool during her first solo ritual—is clear and under steady pressure as she risks untested body-runes. Conflict is primarily internal but sharpened by the external deadline of the approaching storm and the ceremonial expectations left by her mentor. The turn where she chooses not to suppress the ice, but to inscribe the transformation rune onto it, reads as a credible tightening of risk and commitment. Escalation is more contemplative than sharp-edged, with limited on-page consequence beyond emotional strain, which modestly softens the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stakes—free Eleanor’s soul before her anchor (the orchard) is destroyed and redeem a past failure—are clear and coherently pressed by the ticking clock. The activation of the generator and visible extraction of the darkness into the bottle provide a genuine tightening and a satisfying, if straightforward, climax. Internal and external conflicts do interweave: his apology and admission of arrogance happen under literal exorcistic pressure. The conflict resolves a bit too cleanly, with little resistance from the possessing darkness, which slightly blunts the sense of risk and price.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—whether she can unravel/unify the cosmic illusions—remains primarily conceptual and never feels in jeopardy; there is no sense of what failure would mean for her or anyone else. Conflict is almost entirely internal and contemplative, with little resistance beyond the complexity of the task. The one tightening beat is her decision to read aloud and engage spiral arbitration, but even this unfolds smoothly without friction or sacrifice. As a result, the ending is thematically satisfying yet low-tension, limiting the felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Einar will pursue Magnusson’s dangerous insight into what clocks measure, and at what cost—is clear and escalates as the counting proceeds and the razor edges manifest. Pressure builds through sensory and conceptual intensification, especially as the fjord quiet “deepens” and the horizon folds. However, the conflict remains mostly intellectual/metaphysical; fear, attachment, or countervailing desires are understated, so the step through reads as less fraught than it might. The escalation works, but the felt price of his choice could be sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—how Maya will relate to her brother’s memory and the life he built without her—is clear from early on and tightens as she moves deeper into the farm and through more charged zones. The conflict is primarily internal, but it does escalate: from observation, to recognition of the farm as a relational map, to the explicit realization about permeability and the choice to re-engage with David’s people. The emotional cost of stepping toward his partner and friends after his death is legible. Still, the path is quite smooth; there’s little genuine resistance or competing desire that would give the turn more bite.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake is internal—how Margot will relate to her father’s legacy and her own susceptibility to contradiction—with the debt as a quieter external pressure. Escalation is modest: discovery of the notebook, then Seat 14, then the archive folder, culminating in a clearer, costed stance. There’s no on-page confrontation with the gamblers or any immediate barrier to her plans, which keeps the conflict more contemplative than pressurized. Still, the internal pressure coheres and tightens toward a credible Earned Stasis choice.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Vera can help callers reconfigure their grief loops—is signaled early and plays out clearly in the mother’s call. Escalation is modest but present: realization this is a recurring misdial, the reveal of the deleted voicemail, and Vera steering the focus from “last message” to “firsts.” The cost is mostly for the caller (letting go of the compulsive last-contact fantasy), with Vera’s agency being gentle guidance rather than a pressured choice. Tension is more contemplative than gripping, but appropriate to the piece’s aims.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the covenant of small things will be renewed and the town’s quiet histories sustained—is clear and meaningful. Pressure escalates modestly from retrospective discovery to the live encounter with the Keeper, culminating in her decision to surrender the locket and accept the charge. However, opposition is gentle and largely abstract; nothing seriously threatens her resolve on the page, and the Keeper is more supplicant than antagonist. As a result, the turn lands more as a serene acceptance than a hard-won, high-cost choice.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stakes are internal—whether Maya will remain elusive or allow herself to be bound into a network—and external in a conceptual way (participating in a cure for loneliness). Pressure coheres but remains relatively gentle; there is one main tightening when Okonkwo reveals the protocol’s meaning and implicitly confronts her pattern of running. Her decision to help and acknowledge her own need for connection is earned but not sharply contested by on-page obstacles. The conflict is convincing yet could benefit from one more concrete on-page test of her reluctance.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether and how to reach the stillpoint and what it will mean for Meridia’s emotional life—is signaled early and escalates as she moves deeper into stranger emotional geometries and more personally charged melodies. The arrival at total neutrality is a genuine tightening, with the felt risk of losing grief, hope, and purpose. Her ultimate choice to map the doorway for another but not pass through again is an earned resolution with visible conceptual cost. However, the path to success in finding the stillpoint feels assured from the outset, with little external resistance or real chance of failure, which keeps pressure from fully peaking.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether she can prevent or undo a civilization’s destruction caused by her error—is clear and weighty. Pressure escalates when the new Kepler signal arrives as a question before the consequences of her original message, forcing her to choose how to respond within a scrambled timeline. However, the decision itself meets little on-page resistance: her fear, doubt, or competing impulses don’t significantly complicate the act of sending the correction, and there’s no concrete constraint beyond conceptual risk. Stakes remain mostly abstract and intellectual, which mutes the sense of cost at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—the harbor’s demolition—is clearly declared, and Elena’s request for help provides a concrete goal: equip her to argue in a new “language” by morning. However, the conflict stays mostly abstract and cooperative: there is no on-page opposition, setback, or hard trade-off, just a nocturnal tutorial that goes smoothly. Escalation is more conceptual (deepening understanding of silence) than situational, so the cost and urgency of the vote remain somewhat distant. This keeps the tension gentle and lyrical rather than tightening around a tangible dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Miriam’s exile and her father’s obsession yield meaning or erasure—is present early and clarified as she uncovers the bloodline. Escalation is primarily epistemic: each chamber deepens her understanding and raises the emotional stakes of what she’ll find at the center. However, there is little active opposition or on-page risk in the present moment; pressure rises more through accumulated revelation than narrowing options, which slightly softens the sense of cost at the climax. The internal decision to adopt a new promise does resolve the conflict, but with relatively gentle tension.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira can externalize Elias and fulfill his dream versus remaining haunted—is clear and narrows into the choice to break rules and perform the drumming ritual. Escalation is primarily internal and textural (the garden’s response intensifying, her tears, the felt separation) rather than conflictual, but it does culminate in a non-reversible change: Elias leaving her mind to inhabit the garden. The cost of that success—her renewed solitude—is explicit and felt. Because opposition is largely implicit (protocols, loss) rather than actively resisting her, the sense of tightening pressure is strong but not maximal.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the man can recover his father’s hidden work—is clear and meaningful to him, and Celia’s choice to get involved answers a modest internal test of whether she’ll share her labyrinth knowledge. However, once she decodes the key, the journey to the container is essentially unopposed; there’s no significant obstacle, time pressure, or moral trade-off on the path. Tension is pleasant and low-key rather than tightening toward a sharp crux, so the resolution feels earned but comparatively easy.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.4)
    The main stake—whether the boy will be claimed by the same darkness that took her brother—is clear and emotionally loaded, and her light-weaving is a credible tactic under her self-imposed constraints. Escalation is modest but discernible as patterns become more complex and focused, culminating in the beam on his chest. The conflict is largely internal/situational rather than confrontational; there is no sharp reversal, only a deepening that successfully reweights the moment. The price she pays (ongoing vigil, continued silence) is felt but could be made fractionally sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—quietly undermining a dehumanizing testing regime—is clear, but the on-page conflict is largely static preparation rather than an escalating test of resolve. There’s no active antagonist or immediate obstacle; doubts (“Maybe this is foolish…”) are heard second-hand and never seriously threaten her course of action. The closest to a tightening is the looming mayoral rally and synchronized timing, yet Eleanor’s tactics and stance don’t change in response during the scene. As a result, tension remains more conceptual than felt, limiting escalation under any drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will commit to the vanishing island and leave her old life—is established early and paid off in her dive and crossing the threshold as the island fades. The whale’s call and the map flaring to life provide a clear tightening, moving from possibility to now-or-never action. However, external friction is low: there’s little on-page resistance beyond Jonas’s emotional caution, so the path to her choice feels comparatively unopposed. The cost is clear but the escalation arc remains gentle rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—can she maintain a private space for grief without falling afoul of the Mandate—is clear and consistent, with the drone pass and the illegality of her relics giving that danger a concrete edge. Escalation is subtle and textural rather than plotty: seventeen figures, the drone scan, and her explicit acknowledgment of moral ambiguity gradually raise the sense of risk and cost. Her final choice is to persist in her quiet rebellion, an endurance that forecloses true compliance and carries a conceptual and personal price, though no immediate consequence tests that decision on the page. The lack of a sharper external test or reversal keeps the tension from cresting higher.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes exist but stay mostly abstract: reputation, the nature of sacredness, and the risk that her words truly have disruptive power. There’s internal friction (doubt about deserving exile vs. returning anyway), yet no opposing force acts on her in the present—no challenge, interruption, or consequence beyond a growing certainty that is wholly positive. The lake’s opening and quartz’s response escalate atmosphere but do not clearly foreclose options or exact a price. As a result, tension accumulates gently rather than tightening toward a genuinely costly peak.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—gain true color vision at the risk of losing her artistic identity and a cherished grief-anchor—is clear and present early. There is one meaningful tightening when Theo insists on “genuine loss” and warns that awakening may destroy her work. However, Mira never seriously falters or adapts tactics; once the offer is on the table, the path to awakening feels assured, so pressure escalates more in rhetoric than in lived difficulty. The cost is conceptually solid but emotionally and dramatically under-contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—can Mira reframe and inhabit connection after the destabilizing silence of the blackout—is clear and develops through the sequence of recordings. Pressure escalates texturally: mother’s call → whales’ faith → loss of the grid’s hum → hermit’s “silence,” culminating in a redefinition of connection and her practice as bell ringer. However, conflict remains almost entirely internal and contemplative; there’s little sense of risk in failure or of mutually exclusive paths, so the tightening is more intellectual than visceral. The ending choice to ring “without expectation” is meaningful but not sharply opposed to a live alternative on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will remain in self-erasure or re-enter life by transforming her grief into making and teaching—is clear and meaningful. Pressure deepens as she moves from isolation to tentative outreach to hosting an entire community, culminating in her decision to “pick up her tools, not to escape grief but to carry it forward.” However, much of the conflict is internal and conveyed via reflective summary rather than dramatized choices under immediate tension, so escalation feels smooth rather than sharply tested. The ending’s new arrival offers a gentle tightening (committing to repeat the pattern), but with limited sense of a path concretely foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—what people cling to when control is lost—shows up clearly, and Marcus’s skepticism versus desperation gives the scene some tension. The main tightening is his “crack in the armor” and subsequent question about giving up control, which deepens the thematic conflict. Yet there is little sense of foreclosed options or visible price paid on the page; no truly hard choice is forced, so conflict feels contemplative rather than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—risking mental/emotional annihilation to gain forbidden knowledge and one last contact with her grandmother—is clear early and intensifies as she moves from discovery to active ritual. There is a real tightening when she understands the Netharans’ collapse yet chooses to proceed, explicitly weighing the possibility of joining their “beautiful, terrible emptiness.” The ritual and its outcome are direct products of her agency, not coincidence. The only ceiling is that external pressures remain mostly implied rather than materially closing in on her during the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—protecting crystallized hopes from the shadow—is clear and tied to Vera’s identity. There is a meaningful deepening when Vera recognizes the shadow as grief rather than a simple threat and chooses to risk engagement instead of mere containment. However, opposition on the page is quite soft: the shadow never actively resists, and there’s minimal sense that her plan might fail or carry palpable risk beyond theme-level cost. As a result, escalation feels more contemplative than pressured, effective but not intense.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether betrayal will poison Vera’s compassion and sense of purpose—is signaled early and stays focused. Pressure escalates modestly but clearly, from accusatory stillness and doubt into active reconstruction and a concrete decision to report Marcus, with the cost being the loss of naïve trust. The conflict is primarily internal and contemplative; while well handled for this length, it lacks a sharper external complication or reversal that might have further tightened options.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stakes—Mira’s bodily autonomy vs. institutional “correction,” and the need to pursue her mother’s unresolved case—are clear and present early. Pressure tightens plausibly with the looming second surgery and the plants’ warnings, culminating in Mira’s decision to flee and Thomas’s choice to abet her. However, the conflict remains largely anticipatory and conversational; we never see the doctors or any concrete obstruction, so the cost feels more promised than viscerally felt. Internal and external tensions are well braided but escalation could use one sharper on-page test or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—what to do with the unused love embedded in the film strip—is clearly signaled and does tighten as Vera passes from observation to psychic immersion to decisive ritual. The internal conflict between retrieving versus releasing love is present but understated, with little resistance or real alternative path dramatized on the page. Escalation is primarily conceptual and emotional, hinging on the revelation of the golden room and the reframing of the letters’ purpose. The cost (letting go of a fantasy of reclamation and accepting a quiet, unseen destination) is felt but could be sharpened through more explicit friction or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—restoring the valley’s capacity to dream—is signaled early and resolved clearly at the end, and there is one meaningful tightening when Elara locates the release dial and confronts the instrument’s history. However, the conflict is largely uncontested: once she reaches the archway, no real opposition (external or moral) tests her resolve beyond a brief hesitation. The release itself goes smoothly, with no risk that the flood of stardust could harm her or the valley or that hoarding might tempt her, which keeps the tension comparatively low. The result is gentle, coherent pressure rather than genuinely escalating stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira can preserve this “probability child” and thus honor her mission to protect lost possibilities—is clear, and it tightens when she discovers the child with the backward clock. Yet the conflict resolves with minimal resistance: Mira’s charm works on the first try, with no serious risk of failure or paradox dramatized on the page. The only explicit cost is the dune’s slight dimming, which feels poignant but low-stress. As a result, tension is more contemplative than pressured, and escalation plateaus quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stakes—whether Mira will risk herself and her talisman to heal an awakened machine and thus cross the line from thinking to making—are clear and escalate naturally. Pressure tightens when she discovers the tree is dying and realizes her gear will fit, forcing a choice outside her claimed competence. The risk and possible failure are implied more than felt; we don’t fully inhabit the danger of killing the tree or losing the gear. That softens the sense of cost at the peak, keeping tension strong but short of truly bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira remains defined by regret or reconfigures her relationship to her unused courage—is clear, but the escalation is gentle and largely contemplative. The walk through specific regrets does deepen pressure, particularly at the beat where she labels herself a coward and is reframed by the guide, yet there is little sense of a live alternative path at the end beyond “take courage or not.” Her agency appears in accepting the guides’ offer and using the punch to claim her courage; that choice resolves the central tension. However, the absence of a sharper felt cost or moment of real resistance keeps the conflict from fully tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—safety of the village versus the return of song/voice—is clearly articulated and sharpened as Mira understands “The fortress demanded unpardonable silence.” The main tightening arrives when “BOLT. HOLDS. VOICE.” reframes the piano bench as a live trigger that could free her grandmother’s voice but endanger everyone. The final action of turning the bolt is a genuine, non-reversible stance with implied communal cost. Consequences remain off-page, so the felt price rests more on concept than visceral fear, keeping this just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—preventing a pretender’s coronation—is clearly signaled, and there is one meaningful deepening when genealogical records confirm the changeling revelation. However, conflict remains almost entirely offstage and intellectual; no one contests Mira, time doesn’t truly endanger her, and no trade-offs are forced. The stakes feel large in premise but small in immediate, felt cost, leaving escalation conceptually interesting but emotionally muted.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.2)
    The core stake—whether Marina will continue to see the reefs as mere climate victims or face and expose the human poisoning underneath—is clearly articulated and escalates as she overlays coordinates and realizes the precision of the correlation. The decisive turn is her move from private, grief-filtered observation to public transmission of the dumping sites, with a visible emotional cost in betraying her grandmother’s complicity and her own prior misreadings. The conflict remains more internal and ethical than externally pressured; a hint more concrete risk (career, legal, or social) on the page would sharpen the stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the “lull” is death or a recoverable pause—emerges early and tightens around Maya’s need for meaning. Pressure escalates as the stone hum intensifies and her memories crowd in, culminating in her re-interpretation of the lull and decision to return to her comrades. The internal conflict is contemplative rather than sharp; there’s no explicit on-page moment where continuing to wait or giving up presents itself as a competing path she nearly chooses. As a result, the escalation feels steady and beautiful but not particularly fraught or costly.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving and reviving the valley’s true heritage against erasure—is clear and culminates in acquiring and intending to plant the embryo. However, on-page conflict is mild: the reconstruction crews are an off-stage pressure, and once the kite is decoded, the unsealing proceeds without resistance or risk beyond generic physical strain. Internal conflict is likewise understated, so escalation feels more like a solemn ritual unfolding than pressure tightening. The result is resonant but somewhat low in visceral or ethical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Mariam can inhabit the present without being overrun by trauma—is clearly established and tightened via the hawk-triggered freeze and her deliberate use of somatic tools. Escalation is quiet but real: the panic spike is the central pressure point, and her choice to ride it out and return to work is an earned, costly endurance. Internal and external conflicts (PTSD vs. tending fragile life) interweave effectively. The stakes remain primarily internal and contemplative, so while they’re thematically weighty, the pressure doesn’t quite reach the sharpest edge possible.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Eleanor will remain blocked or find a viable way to work again—is clear and consistently pressed by the breathing, closing library and her mounting recognition of past falseness. There is one solid escalation: the walls tightening and the realization that she must embrace fragmentation instead of forcing unity, leading to the redesign. However, most of the conflict stays internal and contemplative; we rarely feel a hard trade-off or loss beyond her prior three months of failure and the subtle risk of alienating future patrons. The pressure is coherent and sufficient for this quiet mode, but not especially sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding the crisis-time phenomenon and preventing others from being trapped in it—is legible and tied to Seren’s personal loss. Pressure escalates through the onset of the time stretch and the revelation that the ink itself is capturing and re-emitting fear, which deepens rather than merely restates the premise. The closing choice to pursue the nomads and either master or destroy the substance is a real stance, but the cost is more conceptual than acutely felt in-scene, so the sense of risk remains somewhat abstract. There’s no major reversal, but for this length the single tightening beat suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.3)
    The core stake—risking her mother and the preserved minds versus exposing systemic murder—is compelling and signaled early, with the decision at the terminal providing a real moral cost. The arrival of Vance effectively tightens external pressure in time for the climax. That said, escalation feels somewhat safe: his opposition is physically and practically too little, too late, so Mira’s choice, while meaningful, is not as hard-won under active threat as it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will maintain her ethic of mercy when confronted with a wounded enemy soldier—is clear and paid off in the knife-sheathing beat and her caretaking. Internal and external pressures align (past training vs. chosen pacifism; chaos outside vs. deliberate peace inside). However, the escalation is gentle: the potential threat the soldier represents is defused quickly, and at no point does she seriously waver once he’s identified as frightened and ashamed. The conflict feels more like a confirmation test than a crucible that exacts a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—hearing the daughter’s last words to resolve corrosive uncertainty—is crystal clear and emotionally weighty. Pressure escalates through the shifting garden and culminates in the high-cost internal act of “voicing silence,” which is a credible, character-rooted ordeal. However, external resistance is minimal; once the condition is stated, success follows without real possibility of failure or alternate paths. The conflict works, but an additional beat of friction or doubt could intensify the sense of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.6)
    The core stake—whether to unleash panic by revealing the truth or perpetuate her father’s paternalistic secrecy—is legible and escalates as she uncovers the asteroid’s trajectory. The key tightening comes when she realizes the date is tomorrow and that her father has carried this alone for decades. Her final action (crafting a nuanced, partial revelation) is a credible crystallization of stance, but the cost of that choice remains mostly conceptual rather than sharply dramatized. A slightly more acute sense of what she risks—professionally, morally, relationally—would deepen the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central stake—whether Vera can meaningfully answer or soften the generational wound—is clear and emotionally weighty, and her decision to act during the fold is a solid tightening. However, conflict is almost entirely internal and contemplative; once the mechanism is understood, there’s no real resistance, risk, or serious chance of failure dramatized in the action itself. The story gains pressure through accumulating images and revelations rather than escalated opposition, which works but leaves the climax feeling relatively unopposed. The cost is mostly conceptual (uncertainty about effect on the past) rather than felt through concrete sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central conflict—how to relate to the emergent hush—is clear, with the old man embodying surrender and Mira embodying an exploratory counter-move. Pressure escalates texturally as the mandala coalesces, the tile hums, and the whispers sharpen into near-coherence. However, the stakes never quite bite; there’s no on-page consequence for choosing wrong beyond an implied spiritual or existential misstep. The resolution feels more like graceful alignment than a choice extracted under meaningful duress.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stakes—whether acts of mercy and remembrance can matter in a brutal, erasing regime—are clear and morally charged, and they do deepen as Kira moves from passive witnessing to actively inscribing Emre’s name. Pressure escalates mostly through knowledge: from generic plaza memories to the specific atrocity, to the traced ripple effect of Emre’s choice. However, there’s no concrete, present-time opposition or visible cost beyond psychic strain and “aching” arms, so the conflict never quite tightens into a lived threat. The result is powerful but primarily contemplative rather than gripping under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.6)
    The primary stake—whether despair tips into irrevocable choice or is re-routed toward possibility—is clearly signaled via the tarot Crossroads and the woman’s posture. Escalation is accumulative rather than combative: the pressure rises as more timelines are woven together, building to the woman’s loosening grip and eventual departure with a new rhythm in her steps. Madeline’s agency (choosing which echoes to summon and how to frame them) drives this deepening, but she faces little real resistance or risk in doing so. The result is emotionally satisfying but relatively low-friction, which keeps tension from reaching elite intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stakes—uncovering what’s been done to her mind and finding Daniel in the shadow of a controlling pharmaceutical company—are clear and present early. Pressure tightens through the eerie somatic sense of a hidden presence in a supposedly empty studio and culminates in the discovery of Daniel’s cache and journal. Internal conflict (fear vs need to know) underlies her choice to follow his pathways, but external conflict is light, with the company functioning as distant menace rather than active opposition. As a result, escalation feels emotionally significant but not especially harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is conceptual—whether and how Vera can connect with nonhuman, epoch-spanning intelligences and bring that knowledge back. Pressure does accumulate (the fossil’s “impossible data,” the sense something deeper is “responding,” the lights approaching), but there is no meaningful resistance or threat; nothing tests her resolve or forces a trade-off. The climax—offering the fossil and speaking—is beautiful but largely unopposed, so the emotional and practical risk stays low. As a result, conflict feels more like solemn discovery than sharpened stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.1)
    The stakes are enormous in concept (the world ending in forgetting), and the story does escalate from simple exploration to the revelation of an instruction manual for survival. However, the on-page conflict is almost entirely internal and largely unopposed; Marlowe encounters no real resistance, dilemmas, or trade-offs in the scene itself. Pressure deepens through knowledge accrual rather than narrowing options, and we don’t see a concrete price paid yet, only implied future burden. This keeps the tension more contemplative than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake is clear and mostly internal: whether Margaret will risk re-entering the web of secrets and accept a duty given by her betrayer without granting him absolution. Tension escalates from deciphering the code to the journey, to the moral choice in the sanatorium room, and her final decision to take the folder with visible cost. However, the external danger hinted by “Watched. Come alone. Dawn.” never tightens on the page, so the potential life-and-death pressure stays conceptual rather than dramatized. The result is a strong moral conflict with somewhat under-leveraged situational stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes are quiet but coherent: her need to unearth a corrupted promise and his responsibility for a dangerous crossing. There is one clear tightening when the water is still “hungry” and the gutters have not yet fallen silent, then a release as they stop. Conflict remains largely situational and thematic rather than confrontational; there’s little direct testing of her resolve or his beliefs on the page. The final gesture (giving the needle) is a graceful culmination but does not represent a hard-forced trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is Serin’s need to understand and perhaps live within a place that resists temporal fracture; this is signaled early and followed through. The main escalation comes when she touches the brass disc and is flooded with alternate timelines, which sharply deepens the conceptual stakes. However, external or internal pressure never tightens into a true dilemma with visible cost—no competing demand pushes against her choice to stay, and no real risk attaches to probing the disc. As a result the conflict reads as contemplative discovery rather than a test of values, keeping stakes and escalation in the competent but not gripping range.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.0)
    The main pressure is Marina's confrontation with loss (the rose, broader erosions in her life) and whether she retreats into resignation or leans into small acts of connection. Escalation is subtle: the dead rose → heightened awareness of absence → choosing to signal the stranger → making contact and then returning to the rose with a new stance. There is a clear tightening when the face appears and she must decide how intrusive to be, but the stakes never spike beyond a gentle, contemplative register. The cost—accepting transience while still choosing to care—is felt but understated.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—whether Mira remains an isolated relic or risks altering her millennia-long pattern to seed a new future—is clear and resolved. Pressure escalates internally as she re-reads Korvash’s message and chooses to activate the circle, with the birth of the small ones as the concrete turning point. However, opposition is mostly implied (habit, fear, grief) and never bites hard on the page; there’s little sense that her attempt might fail or harm her, so cost remains primarily conceptual. The result is emotionally affecting but gently contoured conflict rather than high-torque tension.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira can reclaim an authentic reason to write, instead of remaining an overfull vessel—is signaled early and followed through. Pressure escalates internally as she contrasts the whimsical prophecy and the loves she’s handled with her present emptiness, culminating in the decision to write for herself and surrender that letter to dissolution. The cost is emotional and conceptual rather than dramatic: she relinquishes control over one of her own secrets and accepts impermanence. The conflict never sharpens into a true dilemma with competing goods, but for a quiet piece the deepening is sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—whether the campus (and by extension humanity) becomes psychic fodder—is legible early and stays in focus, with the board’s demolition deadline giving real temporal pressure. Conflict between cult, administration, and unseen entities forms a clear triangle of opposition, and the moment when the entities “know” and push back is a good tightening. However, Mira’s plan works essentially on first try, and she pays no immediate personal price beyond stress and isolation, so escalation feels more conceptual than visceral. The ethical or emotional trade-offs of defying both factions could be sharpened to deepen cost.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stakes—unlocking the archives and facing claustrophobia—are established early and woven together. Escalation is focused around the reveal of the tight passage, which forces a concrete, costly choice that tests both her fear and her commitment to the quest. While there’s essentially one major tightening rather than multiple complications, it’s scaled appropriately to the length and lands with felt pressure. The resolution arises from Helena’s agency rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stakes—whether Clara can reconstruct a truthful, empathetic account of Elena’s disappearance when justice is impossible—are clear and thematically rich. Pressure escalates modestly as Clara assembles the emotional architecture around Marcus and Elena, moving from analysis to a moral stance about witness vs. vengeance. However, most investigative stakes are resolved off-page before the scene begins, so there’s limited on-page tightening or reversal; the quarry visit functions more as ritual closure than live conflict. The result is thoughtful but relatively low-tension, which caps the score.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira can get her ancestor’s warnings taken seriously in time to mitigate catastrophe—is clear. Pressure escalates intellectually as she decodes the journals and realizes the “reversible exile” cycle, culminating in confronting Torres. However, opposition is light: his skepticism evaporates quickly, so there’s little sense of risk that she’ll fail or be dismissed. The result is a compelling premise with underdeveloped on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether to remain inside the calcified “never” of her bridge life or risk pursuing a deferred art—is clear and thematically apt. Pressure escalates via the revelation of the cabin and the map stabilizing through the glass, culminating in her choice to leave. However, resistance and cost are relatively underplayed; the decision feels momentous in concept but somewhat unopposed on the page, keeping tension at a moderate level.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central conflict—Elias’s attempt to escape his father’s legacy versus the gravitational pull of that “ground”—is clear and thematically apt. Pressure builds through the father’s reappearance via markers and the startup collapse, which strips away Elias’s alternate identity. However, the on-page confrontation is quiet; the story leans toward acceptance rather than a sharply dramatized fork. The cost (letting go of pure escape, accepting rootedness and connection) is present but somewhat understated in scene terms.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will continue Marcus’s work differently by sharing the burden—is clear, and her decision to publish provides a genuine, if quiet, turn. Pressure escalates modestly as the night wears on and the pattern emerges, deepening her understanding rather than forcing sharp trade-offs. External obstacles are minimal, and the key practical challenge (translating the inscription) is summarized rather than dramatized, which keeps tension largely cerebral. As a result, the emotional cost is felt but not sharply tested against resistance or competing imperatives on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming her existence/belief in her existence—is announced early and escalates through concrete risks: sacrificing lifespan, traversing a lethal vortex, and confronting the tree of dead confessions. The key tightening is her decision to release her defensive posture and complete her confession, which forecloses the option of staying in safe self-erasure. Internal and external conflicts are intertwined well, but the path to resolution once she reaches the tree is relatively smooth, with little resistance or reversal after that choice. The cost is present and legible, just not maximally pressured in the final stretch.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—bridging waking and dreaming by reaching the intersection safely—is clear, and the pressure deepens as the maze grows and the door appears. Escalation is mostly accumulative rather than adversarial; there is little active resistance or reversal, so tension rests on the conceptual stakes and Mira’s role-choice. Her decision to keep them together and serve as anchor is a real narrowing of options with implied personal cost. A sharper on-page conflict (internal or external) around whether to cross or what Mira sacrifices would heighten the sense of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming a stolen destiny versus accepting a new, subtler wound—is legible early and sharpened in the Gardener’s explanation of the price. The main tightening comes when he reframes the cost as forty years of existential uncertainty, effectively transforming her problem rather than simply solving it. Pressure is mostly internal and conversational, with no real reversal or external complication beyond that single reckoning. The decision lands, but the path to it feels slightly too smooth for maximal tension.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Marcus can reconfigure his sense of worth after public humiliation—is clear and coherently pressured by Val’s appearance and her father’s parallel arc. The discovery of the cloth and Val’s recognition of him from the viral video are the main tightening beats, pushing him to confront his vulnerability rather than stay numbly transactional. Escalation is primarily internal and tonal, with no sharp reversal, but it does lead to a genuine stance crystallization in the closing choice to go down to the quarry floor. The stakes remain quiet and could be sharpened slightly by a more acute on-page risk or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elena will pay the personal cost to pursue understanding of transition—is clear, and the caretaker’s warning plus the seed offer a meaningful deepening. Escalation is mostly internal and contemplative; once she receives the seed, her path to planting it and staying feels nearly foregone, with little dramatized doubt or alternative. The story hints at significant cost but doesn’t force a sharp trade-off or visible sacrifice beyond the implied abandonment of her old life. Tension is present but remains gentle rather than tightening decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—whether preservation has meaning in a world with no tomorrow—is articulated clearly in the fisherman’s question. However, pressure does not escalate much; no new information or threat forces Mira into a costlier or riskier choice than the status quo. Her response reaffirms her existing practice rather than narrowing options or foreclosing a live alternative on the page. The result is thoughtful but relatively static conflict with limited felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central conflict—whether to remain sealed emotionally or risk vulnerability—is coherent and escalates as Elena moves from observation to self-implication to real-time contact with Marcus. The commitment cost is non-trivial: exposing her confession and reopening a painful history. However, the pressure rises in a relatively gentle, contemplative curve, with little sense of a genuinely risky alternative path beyond quiet endurance. The emotional stakes register, but the conflict never quite reaches knife-edge urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Maren can move from paralyzing guilt to some form of self-forgiveness—is clear from early on and coherently pursued. Pressure escalates internally as she confronts the bathroom graffiti, maps it to Daniel’s beloved black stones, and commits to going there and playing the accordion, culminating in her reframed stance about what forgiveness requires. However, the conflict remains largely reflective, with limited on-page resistance or moment-by-moment trade-offs beyond her internalized regret. The end decision feels earned but relatively gentle; a slightly sharper present-time test or temptation would heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether she can confront and metabolize her mother’s unspoken love and her own backlog of silence—is clear and present from the outset. Pressure escalates as she decodes the watch, identifies her mother’s volume, absorbs the unsaid “I am proud of you,” and then must decide whether to open the second letter and confront her own unwritten book. The decisive act of speaking “I forgive you… and I forgive myself” forecloses a longstanding internal stasis and unlocks new options (the path inward, time moving forward). The conflict is primarily internal and quiet, so while effective, it never feels truly knife-edge intense.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.5)
    The central conflict—personal safety and imperial validation versus cultural survival and resistance—is articulated early and remains coherent to the end. Stakes escalate meaningfully when the coffee reveals a perforation in destiny and the ferns push for propagation, narrowing Mira’s options from multiple theoretical paths to one risky, irreversible act. Her choice to play the violin, knowing it will both shatter and brand her forsworn, provides clear, on-page cost. The only soft spot is that the threat of “war” and being hunted, while stated, stays at a conceptual level rather than manifesting as immediate, concrete on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—capturing the last remnant of her mother before oblivion—is clear and given a concrete ticking clock. Pressure escalates through intensifying aurora/static and the explicit acknowledgment that the essence is “recognizable but diminishing,” culminating in the risky infusion act. However, opposition is almost entirely situational; there is little sense she might fail or choose otherwise, and internal resistance is minimal, so the cost feels more conceptual than viscerally contested. The resolution is earned but relatively low-friction for such a high metaphysical stake.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake is Mira’s search for what makes rebirth/contentment possible and, by extension, how to live with her mother’s departure. Pressure accumulates quietly through Theron’s imminent transition and Mira’s ritual actions, with one clear deepening when she guides him through forgetting the scallop’s recipient and reframes what “remains.” Escalation is primarily internal and thematic rather than situational, which fits the mode but keeps tension low. The cost—accepting her mother’s rebirth and relinquishing old anger—is intellectually legible but only softly felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central stake—whether Sera continues to search and how she lives with the guilt—is signaled early and remains focused. Pressure tightens as the keeper interprets the shard and chimes, exposing Sera’s true want (permission to stop) and forcing her to reconsider what “abandonment” means. The final trade-off—loving her sister while accepting her autonomy—feels like a genuine narrowing of options with emotional cost. The escalation is more contemplative than harrowing, which suits the piece but keeps it just shy of the highest tension bands.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Vara’s need to reclaim an erased people—is powerful but remains abstract, with no on-page test or opposition beyond the difficulty of understanding. The escalation is primarily intellectual: entering trance, witnessing the interference pattern, and articulating the insight about collision. Elowen’s withholding adds a secondary pressure (will he share what she needs in time?) but is more discussed than contested. The result is rich, coherent tension at a low boil rather than a sharp tightening that forces a visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—a life of stillness in service of a sacred navigational practice, and whether that knowledge will be transmitted—is intriguing but kept at a low simmer; pressure rarely sharpens into a difficult binary or visible sacrifice in-scene. The wandering pulse introduces situational urgency, yet the traveler’s danger and potential failure feel abstract rather than palpably risky. Vessa’s key “choice” is essentially to do what she always does (sing, remain still) plus offering apprenticeship, so escalation reads more as fulfillment than test. The quietness is intentional and aesthetically coherent, but for elite-market standards the story could use one more concrete tightening or cost-inflected turn.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will treat the keystone’s luminance as extractable power or as sacred simplicity—is clear and culminates in a decisive renunciation. However, escalation is relatively gentle: the only concrete obstacle is the collapsed stair, and the ethical/aesthetic choice at the folly is not heavily contested on the page. The “automatons vs. human wonder” conflict is high-concept but remains mostly offstage, reducing felt cost. The key tightening beat (unstrapping the satchel, then stopping) works, but could bear more friction or temptation to reach a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering and understanding Elena’s true research—appears early and coheres, with a meaningful tightening when he discovers the journal and then the hidden compartment. Conflict is mostly internal: the cost of knowing versus preserving an untroubled, ordinary life and the guilt over missing the memorial festival. The vial-opening is an effective escalation that redefines his options by permanently changing how he perceives truth. However, there is little in the way of active opposition or hard trade-offs beyond contemplation, which limits the felt pressure at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will achieve “wavelength alignment” or succumb to doubt—is signaled early and escalates via repeated lot-castings and intensifying clarity of the transmissions. The key tightening is the second and final coin cast, where the prophecy becomes linguistically explicit and then physically impossible (every coin on edge), forcing a crystallized stance. Conflict is primarily internal but coheres with the cosmic situation, and the decision to accept dissolution as transformation forecloses the path of mere survival. The cost is somewhat conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized, which slightly blunts tension.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will be consumed by the accumulated regret of the dead or find a way to live with it—is clear early. Pressure deepens meaningfully when the light begins to crystallize the monsters and, more crucially, when finishing the phrases produces peaceful figures and emotional relief. The conflict is primarily internal and progresses in a relatively smooth curve without sharp reversals, which slightly softens the sense of escalation. Still, her decision to continue reaping with this new, costlier sensitivity functions as an earned, high-stakes internal commitment at this scale.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake (restart the cosmic current) is clearly signaled and tied to Corin’s personal need to redeem his mediocrity and his mother’s bell. Pressure escalates modestly through references to prior failures and the accumulated silence in the bell, culminating in the attempt that might fail again. However, conflict remains primarily conceptual and internal; there’s little on-page pushback beyond his own self-doubt, and no strong reversal before the whispering success. As a result, the tension feels more contemplative than gripping, and the cost of failure or success is never sharply tested in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Martha clings to a protective lie or accepts and shares a painful truth—is clear and tightened by the trail of photographs culminating in the Chicago platform image. The story earns one meaningful escalation as her private myth is definitively contradicted, forcing a stance: she chooses to preserve complexity rather than martyrdom. Pressure remains low-key and contemplative rather than sharply escalating, but for this quiet mode it’s sufficient and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—whether Elara will successfully fuse logic and intuition or be annihilated—is clearly stated and thematically rich, and the piece does escalate from quiet arrival to the ritual’s apex. However, resistance is almost entirely notional; nothing on the page meaningfully threatens failure once she begins, and we never see her doubt, hesitate, or pay a price beyond relinquishing the crystal. The transformation reads as solemn and momentous but not truly contested. As a result, tension is steady rather than sharply tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—lives on the ridge and the political trust between arbor and surface—is clearly articulated early. Pressure tightens when data conflict and Vera must choose between a false binary (all-clear vs full evacuation), leading to the partial-evac compromise that risks panic. Internal and external stakes are interwoven: her fear of repeating her mother’s failure complicates the ethical calculus. The price actually paid (inconvenience and potential panic) is modest on the page, so the felt risk outstrips the concrete harm we witness.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—what happens to the potential third self and what that reveals about the two existing copies—is legible and ethically charged. Yet the conflict is curiously frictionless: Vex and Sera offer opposing claims, but once Kira speaks, they mainly absorb her judgments and comply. There’s one real turn (the brain belongs to itself), but we don’t see any serious resistance, trade-off, or loss beyond a conceptual one. The lack of meaningful pushback or risk makes the resolution feel more like an instructive ruling than a hard-won choice.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—artistic integrity versus corporate buyout—is established early, and Magnus’s looming visit provides some situational pressure. The receipt of the corpse flower seed meaningfully deepens the conflict by reframing her dilemma in terms of time, patience, and “unsolvable” experiences. However, escalation is largely conceptual; there’s no on-page confrontation or reversal, and Magnus remains offstage, so we never feel a concrete narrowing of options beyond her own reflection. Her final decision carries stakes, but tension stays relatively low and untested compared to top-tier short fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Victor can confront and transform his calcified grief enough to risk renewed connection—is clear and present early. Pressure escalates through the increasingly raw singing and the tunnel’s relentless echoing back of his failures and pain, forcing him to persist or retreat. His choice to endure and then to plan the call to Margaret is a credible act of agency that forecloses the option of comfortable isolation. The conflict remains largely internal and quiet, but it tightens once in a way that fits this length and mode.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.8)
    The primary conflict is internal and relational: Maren’s defensively cultivated stillness versus the risk of engaging with another lost soul. Stakes—continuing safe, frozen solitude versus exposing herself to renewed longing and connection—are implicit but legible, especially when she realizes she wants “to not wait alone.” Escalation is modest but present as the cultist moves from potential threat to vulnerable mirror, culminating in Maren’s invitation. The pressure could be sharpened with a slightly clearer sense of what Maren risks losing by breaking her feral equilibrium.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—severing Petra’s conscription into the empire’s war engines—is clearly signaled and deepened via House Threnody’s history and the grandfather’s failed attempt. Pressure escalates as Maren moves from reflection on seventeen failures into the high-risk life-essence working that cannot be repeated. However, the scene lacks an active antagonist or significant in-the-moment setback; the transmutation proceeds with adjustments but without a substantial reversal or near-loss. As a result, tension is strong conceptually but modest in visceral, moment-to-moment jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira can retune a dead tower city to receive a new kind of signal—is conceptually interesting but faces limited resistance. Static and screaming frequencies provide an initial obstacle, yet her shift in assumptions solves it relatively easily, with no strong trade-off or material risk beyond discomfort and effort. There’s one meaningful tightening when she chooses to discard the old engineering logic, but no felt loss or foreclosed path. As a result, the piece reads more as a graceful discovery than a pressured conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether the trapped passengers remain in limbo or finally arrive—is clear and escalates from eerie stasis to an irreversible, risky intervention. The decisive act of using the hourglass, with the ensuing bodily splitting, provides a real price tag to Mara’s choice. However, the pressure never quite sharpens into a dilemma; success feels relatively assured once the mechanism is understood, and there’s little sense that she might choose *not* to act. Introducing a more pointed trade-off (e.g., clearer risk to passengers or self) would heighten tension.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Marina can renegotiate control with a volatile, perception-built space and thus with her own altered mind—is clear and carries through. Pressure does escalate from exploratory navigation to the mirror-room revelation to the active contest of weaving a counter-structure against the building’s “protests.” Still, the conflict remains mostly conceptual; the gallery’s opposition (shifting walls, rotating floors) is gestured at rather than dramatized in concrete, risky dilemmas, so the sense of cost and danger stays muted. The resolution feels earned but relatively low-intensity for such a potent premise.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Vara will relinquish bottom-anchored thinking and genuinely commit to learning edge geometry—is signaled and resolved, with her “Show me” and final renunciation providing the key turns. Escalation is primarily internal and contemplative: the darkening of the dome and her dawning perception of “horizons” unfolding are the main tightening beats. The pressure never feels acute or risky beyond the intellectual/spiritual realm, so while the arc is coherent and earned, the stakes stay relatively low-key and could benefit from a sharper sense of cost or irreversibility.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—Margaret’s need to reconcile with Ruth and ease decades-old guilt—is clear and emotionally credible. There is a meaningful tightening as Margaret’s confessions deepen and Ruth’s pulse responds, creating a felt link between honesty and resolution. Still, opposition is extremely soft: Vera encounters no resistance, danger, or serious doubt, and the outcome feels foregone once she hears Ruth’s pulse. The piece reads more as a beautifully rendered ritual than a conflict that narrows options with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stakes—Mira’s psychological cost to witness the dead versus physical danger/time pressure—are clear early and interwoven. Pressure coherently tightens through the codex discovery, body count, and explicit narrowing of her tidal window, culminating in the taxing ascent. However, there’s no true reversal or sharp on-page crisis; the conflict deepens rather than turns, which keeps the piece powerful but relatively low in sheer dramatic torque.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming her archived failures to prove her own living wholeness—is clearly signaled and remains coherent. Pressure escalates texturally: from abstract desire, to concrete ritual with the ink, to the emotional spike of seeing her mother’s face and reclaiming grief. The decisive change is internal but clear: she retrieves the last fragments, lets the ghost dissolve, and abandons the heartbeat-counting compulsion. Stakes remain mostly psychological and could be sharpened by a more explicit sense of what she risks if the ritual fails, but what’s here is still strong for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—risking her own voice to resurrect a dead language—is strong and clearly articulated, and the choice to press the cursed diamond to her throat is a meaningful tightening. Yet once the copper veins intercept the curse, the pressure diffuses; there’s no further complication, sacrifice beyond the diamond itself, or moment where she might actually fail or pay a sharper price. The resolution feels earned but low-friction, more a controlled execution of a plan than a trial that forces real trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stakes—uncovering the cryptid’s truth and whether Maren will repeat Samuel’s bitter trajectory—are clear, and the key tightening occurs when Samuel’s voice and the gravitational disturbance force her to reframe the entire mystery. The internal conflict between vindictive validation and patient, honoring documentation is credible but resolves quickly once articulated, with limited on-page struggle or temptation. Externally, danger is mostly conceptual rather than physically or socially pressing in the moment. Escalation works, but the cost of her choice could be made more acute to fully maximize tension.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will submit to recalibration or risk a systemic uprising—is established and sharpened the moment the statue climbs to the bridge. Escalation is clear: from covert playing to heart-code activation to a sweeping, orchard-wide resonance that breaks the statues and silences the old system. Agency drives the turn; she consciously abandons safety-quiet as she realizes “The cicada had not fought its shell.” However, the conflict resolves somewhat easily—once she chooses, opposition crumples quickly, with little on-page struggle or visible price beyond implied prior fear.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether grief and connection can pierce a militarized border—is clear, but on-page pressure remains gentle. There is one meaningful deepening when intercepted letters and the bottled storm reveal the scale of thwarted communication, reweighting the meeting. However, no moment feels in doubt: the handoff encounters no obstacle, and Marcus’s risk from drones is told rather than tested in-scene. As a result, escalation feels more thematic than tactical, limiting the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Marcus can reclaim a meaningful voice/identity after traumatic loss—is clear and coherently present. Pressure tightens in the move from contemplation to the risky act of trying to sing, with the halo’s warmth and the recording heightening that moment. The cost is primarily emotional and existential rather than sharply dramatized, but the narrative does show struggle (initial silence, rough notes, long work ahead). The conflict is effective for a quiet piece, though it never quite feels knife-edge.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Eleanor’s quest to locate the literal place where stories live—is clear, but pressure is relatively gentle and mostly internal. The meaningful “tightening” is the reawakening of the analog archive and the appearance of the impossible room, yet these arrive more as gifts than as hard-won outcomes of difficult choices. Eleanor chooses to follow instinct and to keep going, but she is never seriously tempted to stop, nor does she face a palpable risk if she fails. As a result, the piece has lovely texture but limited escalation or sense of price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—salvaging a vanishing dream of her mother—is clear early and drives all action. Escalation is accumulative rather than confrontational: repeated failed attempts, the dream’s continued erosion, and the decision to go to the roof despite thick fog all tighten the emotional pressure. The breakthrough photograph is a genuine deepening that reweights the situation, and Miriam’s later choice to remain in her role and share the cipher reads as an earned stance. The conflict remains quiet and internal, with relatively low on-page friction in the middle, so tension never reaches a truly acute pitch.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—freeing Elena’s voice/idea without breaking her or the universe—is clear and scales appropriately from personal to cosmic. There is a meaningful deepening when Mira realizes she must transform the idea’s container rather than simply unlock it, which reframes the problem. However, the conflict feels relatively frictionless: the nexus “tries to disorient” her once, but she overcomes it quickly and the rewrite of cosmic mechanism is accomplished without visible pushback or sacrifice beyond implied emotional strain. The stakes are big but the on-page struggle is somewhat soft.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—recovering stolen memories of her grandmother—is established early and sharpened by the image of her life as empty pattern-following. Escalation comes primarily through deepening: from abstract forgetting to a concrete folkloric procedure and then the risk of opening the jar and confronting whatever has been hidden. Her agency is clear at the key turn (choosing to align the void with the fairy ring, lift the mushroom, and finally unscrew the lid), and the emotional cost on retrieval reads. The pressure could feel more acute or contested—there’s little on-page risk, doubt, or alternative option—so the conflict curve is satisfying but not quite bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will risk advocating for Kael’s return and binding herself as mentor—is legible from early on and narrows toward a single, costly stance. The conflict is mostly internal, with Thessaly and the council’s offstage pressure tightening it in a believable way. The meaningful turn comes through the tea-leaf reading’s reframing of Kael (“his war is with himself now”) and the explicit framing of mentorship as “armor” not comfort, culminating in the annotated recommendation. The tension could be sharpened by one more concrete external risk or opposition beat, but what’s present is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Marek can keep wonder alive in the garden despite the worlds’ forgetfulness—is established early and sharpened when the fruit’s colors begin to fade. Planting the seed and committing to the long, daily labor of essence-gathering is a meaningful tightening and choice. However, opposition remains largely abstract and offstage; nothing resists Marek directly, and there is no real risk of personal failure beyond age and exhaustion. The result is a beautiful but low-simmer conflict profile rather than a truly pressurized one.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—Mira’s need to atone and find a viable way to live with her damage—intertwines effectively with the external goal of grounding Callum. Pressure escalates through the cumulative weight of confessions and the dawning understanding that she’s trading silences, not simply “helping ghosts.” Her ultimate choice to return to mask restoration with altered intent forecloses her previous self-erasure and carries a believable emotional price. A slightly sharper articulation of what she risks by re-engaging with her craft could intensify the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.1)
    The primary stake—whether and how the chapel’s “silence” will be interpreted, and thus whether it remains sealed—comes through, and the pressure accumulates as visual discrepancies mount and the stones seem to gain expression. Escalation is quiet and internal, driven by pattern recognition rather than overt confrontation, which suits the piece’s mode but limits visceral tension. The key turn is Elena’s recognition that something has changed and her subsequent decision to keep typing rather than look up or flee, a choice that crystallizes her stance without a clear, immediate price. The stakes remain somewhat abstract, so the sense of cost never sharpens into genuine dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake is internal: whether Eleanor can reframe her relationship to death and grief, anchored to the external goal of retrieving the log. Pressure escalates mostly through deepening reflection and the content of the captain’s pages rather than through obstacles or reversals in the dive itself. There is one meaningful tightening when the captain’s acceptance forces her to reconsider her own losses, but no concrete test that narrows her options. The resulting tension is compelling but relatively gentle and could bear slightly more on-page resistance or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—giving voice to the ghost’s inarticulate needs—is clear and escalates modestly from decoding graffiti to singing the feelings explicitly. The key tightening is the ghost’s direct plea (“HELP ME REMEMBER WHAT I NEEDED”) and the mural of emotional words, which forces Mira to move from archivist to active translator. However, there’s no real resistance, competing obligation, or jeopardy; the outcome never feels in doubt, so tension stays gentle and lyric rather than sharp. The cost is conceptual (taking on the ghost’s burden of encoded speech) rather than dramatized as a hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will use her mother’s diary and the observatory memories to reconfigure Lady Vesper’s grief—is clear and tight. Escalation is primarily accumulative: each decoded entry adds pressure and purpose as she nears the tenth floor. However, there is little concrete resistance or real risk of failure; no one and nothing pushes back against her intent, so the choice at the top feels inevitable rather than costly. The internal and external conflicts align nicely but remain somewhat low-intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—what Elena does with her life and meaning after the tether break—is clear, but the on-page pressure is gentle and largely internal. The closest thing to escalation is the darkening systems and the “quietly explosive” nimbostratus mirrored to her own withheld emotion, yet this never forces a concrete choice beyond continued cataloging. There is a deepening of commitment rather than a real tightening of options. As conflict, it remains mostly reflective rather than dramatized under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—salvaging hidden knowledge before demolition—is clear, and the time pressure of the impending wrecking crews provides a baseline tension. There is a meaningful deepening when she finds the touch-readable manuscript and recognizes herself as the intended reader, which reweights her task from scavenging to inheriting. However, obstacles are almost entirely absent: the search is linear, her skills are never seriously tested or threatened, and the crews remain distant, so pressure never quite cinches. The result is more meditative than tense, which is effective but limits escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—transforming abandonment into meaningful discovery—is clear and escalates from idle curiosity to high-focus investigation as the Luminance appears. Elara’s agency drives every turn (choosing to pursue the cipher, connect coordinates, then work obsessively through the night), but there is little genuine resistance: no serious threat to her safety, sanity, or ability to complete the work. The appearance of the Luminance is external and coincidental, though the story justifies their intersection through the ship’s prior route-planning. Overall tension feels pleasantly charged rather than urgent, limiting the sense of cost or danger at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will accept a new, less controlling understanding of repair and risk unleashing the vial—is legible early and tightens at the mirror hall. The mirrors presenting possible futures and the prophecy’s warning create a genuine choice at the vial: fix, freeze, or walk away. However, the sense of danger or cost around opening the vial remains somewhat abstract; we’re told it “could not be contained again” but the potential harm is never concretely imagined. The conflict thus remains more philosophical than visceral, limiting intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stakes—maintaining the colony’s fragile peace and the ghost’s relationship to it—are clear, but pressure remains gentle throughout. The “reexamine what we’ve built” message hints at potential conflict (thirsting grove, children’s neglected lessons), yet the scene slides quickly into harmonious cooperation without resistance or visible trade-off. The emotional conflict around the ghost’s isolation tightens a bit in the invitation/decline exchange, but there’s no moment where Elara must truly choose between competing goods. As a result, the story reads as a lovely vignette more than a pressured crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—how Mira will use the final seconds of the doomsday clock—is clear early and tightens effectively as “the hands had nearly converged.” Her choice to spend that last sliver of time sending a lullaby instead of further delaying doom is a meaningful trade-off with emotional cost. Tension is mostly internal and thematic rather than contested by an active antagonist or strong reversals, which keeps it just below the very highest bands. Still, the clock freezing at one second to midnight is a solid escalation and closure beat under a textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—getting the travelers out before frost and missteps kill them—is well signaled and maintained, with the added layer of reactivating the birds’ original purpose. Escalation is clear: the calls from below, deeper descent, birds’ confused reaction, and the first ice forming on stone. The cost at closure is primarily conceptual/emotional (Maren’s ongoing obligation) rather than physical peril; the rescue itself feels a shade too smooth, with no serious near-failure moment to test her or the system. As a result, tension is solid but not fully maximized.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central pressure—whether Mira will continue to fight loss with permanent bonds or accept separation and redesign her work—is coherent and deepens as she moves from ravine realization to applied research. There is a clear tightening in her decision to pursue a dissolving neural scaffold as a form of atonement. However, the conflict remains largely reflective and low-friction, with minimal on-page resistance or real risk to her new stance.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.6)
    The conflict is primarily internal/situational: Vera’s need for redemption and authentic beginnings under the surveillance of glimmering parole, tested by the first visitor. The arrival of the child is the key tightening, shifting the piece from contemplative setup into a live test of “clean slates” and her capacity to midwife new stories rather than forge old ones. The cost—risking emotional investment and identity in an uncertain first encounter—is implied but understated, leaning more toward quiet resonance than palpable tension. Escalation is subtle but real, appropriate for a lyric piece yet shy of truly sharp pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—what to do with her unbearable, contagious remorse—is present early and clearly reconfigured at the pavilion. Pressure escalates when she discovers the pavilion’s true cost (loss of hard-won compassion along with pain), forcing a trade-off rather than an easy cure. Her selective deposition is an earned act of agency, not a deus ex machina. The scene could use one more concrete resistance or complication to keep the decision from feeling almost too frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—teaching isolated silos to harmonize as a model for a fractured town—is clearly stated and gently intensified as more elevators join the chord. However, the conflict remains largely one-sided; there’s no strong counterforce beyond implied years of prior failure, and the experiment “works” without a serious on-page jeopardy or reversal. The escalation is more in texture and awe than in narrowing options or visible cost. It’s effective for a lyrical piece but not pressured enough for top-tier conflict scores.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Vera can and will transform herself into the archeologist of abandoned dreams—is clearly signaled. Escalation occurs as the density and scope of foreign memories increase, threatening her sense of self. However, the conflict remains largely one-directional; she never seriously wavers or confronts a concrete choice between self-preservation and her mission. The result is a beautiful but relatively low-friction arc without a sharply felt trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stakes—accessing dangerous combinations and deciding how to bear that responsibility—are clear, with time pressure from the inversion window giving the scene a structural spine. There is one meaningful deepening when she realizes she is inheriting the guardians’ role and that some doors must remain closed, which reweights her quest. However, on-page conflict is almost entirely internal and largely unopposed; the grotto offers no real resistance, and the countdown never tightens into a felt squeeze where options close off. The result is thematically tense but experientially mild, keeping escalation from feeling truly high-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—can music survive in a soundless world?—is clear and thematically strong. Pressure deepens as Maren shifts from failed outward-sound instruments to inward, body-conducted vibration guided by the sculpture’s cracks, which is a meaningful conceptual tightening. However, conflict remains largely conceptual and internal; there’s little sense of risk, urgency, or competing demands beyond her sadness and persistence. The resolution feels more like a graceful unveiling than a choice under strain, which limits escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Helena can meaningfully renew the eclipsed covenant against the pressure of forgetting—is clear but remains mostly internal and low-intensity. Pressure deepens rather than escalates: the magnetic field strengthens, she writes faster, and the need to document before the next phase is reiterated, but she is never forced into a sharp trade-off or reversal. Her final decision to return and seek another exile functions more as a continuation of her prior resolve than a tested pivot. The result is thematically rich but somewhat static in conflict terms.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Vera can transform her relationship to Margot’s secret and her own grief—is clear and cohesive. Pressure accumulates through the ritual and her long wait for seventeen years, culminating in the forgiveness declaration that narrows her path from “solve the mystery” to “live with not knowing.” However, the external obstacle (the clasp) yields almost immediately once she speaks forgiveness, which slightly flattens the sense of risk or resistance. The conflict remains primarily interior and contemplative, strong but not acute.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake is Mira’s quest for a deeper mode of wisdom/serenity, signaled early and paid off in her choice to leave despite the village’s allure. Escalation is primarily internal: she endures the flower’s stench, reframes her perception through drawings, and then must decide whether to remain in this apparent haven. However, the pressure remains gentle—there’s little sense that staying would cost her or others something concrete beyond stagnation, so the trade-off at the end feels conceptually weighty but emotionally soft. A sharper test of her resolve in the vigil or a more fraught offer from Thessaly could have tightened stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—finding a way to save her dying home orchards—is clearly established, and the countdown plus gravity inversion provide an effective situational pressure. There is one meaningful deepening when she discovers her grandmother’s arrow and learns that many have failed or been changed here before, which reframes the risk. However, obstacles remain mostly conceptual; she rarely has to make a hard, contested choice under real threat, and the environment’s danger (inversion, razor arches) never truly bites. The resolution feels more like receptive enlightenment than a pressured decision with sharp visible consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stakes—preventing future deaths and redeeming past failures—are present early and stay coherent, with the confirmation at Row J/Stack 14 as the main tightening beat. Conflict is largely externalized as institutional indifference versus her pattern-recognition, plus her internalized guilt; the textural pressure of the wind and groaning metal helps. However, escalation is modest: tonight’s survey verifies rather than fundamentally alters her risk profile, and she never has to choose between competing harms or accept an on-page loss beyond ongoing dismissal. The quiet mode is viable, but a single on-page test of her commitment (e.g., choosing to break protocol, wake someone, or enter a clearly dangerous zone) would deepen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—proving wonder’s necessity against the Council’s utilitarian decrees—is clear and present from early on. Escalation occurs primarily through density and revelation: moving from awe at the bell’s silence to the risk of disturbing a millennia-old masterpiece to unleashing a sound that will rewrite the world. However, the process of ringing the bell unfolds with little friction; no real alternative paths or threatened failures appear on the page, so the tightening feels conceptual rather than visceral. The cost is mostly symbolic (sacrificed sheet, altered silence) rather than dramatically contested.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will risk taboo to gain knowledge to prevent another catastrophe—is established early and escalates credibly through her decision to uncase and then play the flute. The major tightening is the moment she steps “in both places at once,” forcing her to confront the precise nature of their past mistake and, implicitly, her own survivor’s guilt. Cost is mostly conceptual and ethical (breaking an oath, re-opening trauma) rather than physically immediate, so the pressure never feels fully acute. Still, the final renunciation—re-casing the flute but carrying the discord insight—reads as an earned, consequential stance.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.8)
    The primary stake is internal—whether Mira will remain trapped in a sterile, formulaic view of feeling or risk a more relational, unstable conception. Escalation is present but gentle: the halo’s pulsing intensifies, the poet’s sorrow weaves with her emptiness, and the press produces unexpected equations, culminating in her conceptual shift. The cosmic backdrop of disappearing stars gestures toward larger external stakes, yet it doesn’t materially tighten her options in-scene beyond a generalized “running out of time.” As a result the conflict feels resonant but low-pressure, more contemplative than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is Maren’s evolving understanding of her role and the pendant’s purpose, with a quiet tension between speed (professional habit) and slowness (Hallen’s last directive). There is one meaningful deepening: realizing that her extended visits are transforming the monasteries and the object into a living myth, which reweights her mission. However, escalation is subtle; no single present-tense decision feels risky, and the cost of changing her practice (time, danger, disapproval) is only implied rather than tested. As a result, the conflict feels thoughtful and textured but never truly tight.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—will she find meaningful evidence that objects absorb emotion—is clear, but the antagonistic pressure is largely implicit (past scientific dismissal) and not actively pushing back in the scene. Her main “choice” is inward: valuing personal communion and legacy over institutional validation, which is resonant but low-friction. There’s a gentle deepening when the frost resolves into layered emotional geology and when she explicitly abandons publication as her goal. The absence of a sharper external or ethical trade-off keeps escalation from fully tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—successfully sending the message at the cost of Mei’s own existence—is cleanly signaled and followed through. Pressure tightens as the ritual activates, the grandfather appears, and Mei begins to unravel, making her trade-off legible. However, conflict is largely internal and fairly serene; her willingness to pay the price is treated as given, so tension is more elegiac than sharply agonistic. This works tonally but slightly blunts the sense of escalating jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—reviving a blighted world and Oren’s own purpose—is clear and escalates from mere survival (rusted hinges) to risking himself in the depths and committing to years of labor. There is one meaningful tightening at the bargain: he must give up the silk and accept that there is no quick cure, only arduous work. However, pressure in the descent and in the Chamber remains low-friction; he encounters little active resistance or real jeopardy, internal or external, so commitment is tested more conceptually than viscerally. The ending shows cost but not much on-page struggle in paying it.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will discover and accept the truth of her mother’s choice and what that means for her own—is clear from early on. Pressure nominally escalates through the building surge and the revelation of dimensional toxicity, and knowledge deepens with the overheard argument. However, conflict is almost entirely informational; no one opposes Mira in the present, and she never seriously wavers about stepping into the rift, so there’s little sense of foreclosed alternatives or trade-offs in the climactic action. The stakes read as important but not sharply felt in the moment of decision.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central stake—whether the chain of safety and memory will break here—emerges clearly once Maren realizes there is no keeper and feels the ghost’s longing. Pressure deepens as she reads the letters and decodes “Protect what remains,” forcing a choice between remaining purely logistical and taking on a more intimate, burdened role. The escalation is primarily emotional and atmospheric rather than oppositional; the outcome never feels truly in doubt, which softens tension slightly. Still, her decision to commit, rebuild the cairn, and add her letter closes a genuine trade-off between isolation and responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—maintaining the forgotten compact between humanity and the sky—is compelling in concept but remains largely unpressured in scene. There is no sense that failure tonight is possible or that anything about this particular storm differs from the last thousand. As a result, tension plateaus; the ignition and prophecies are beautiful but not risky. The story reads as a lyrical vignette more than a scene in which options narrow or a trade-off bites.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Senna can understand and possibly inherit Mei-Lin’s gift and what that means for her guilt—is clear and tight. Pressure builds effectively as the light literally approaches her, culminating in the involuntary confession that forces her to confront what carrying this heart costs. However, after that peak, the decision to stay is comparatively unopposed; there’s little sense of a viable alternative or external risk to heighten the trade-off. The conflict remains compelling but quietly scaled, keeping escalation strong rather than exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stakes are internal—will Maren understand the trees’ role and her own, and how will that refract her grief? Pressure does increase as she reconfigures and then uses the sextant, culminating in the stilling of the storm and the flood of quantified memories. However, obstacles are nearly nonexistent, and the path from problem to resolution feels relatively unresisted, with little sense of alternative choices or potential loss. The result is textured but gently contoured conflict, effective yet not truly tightening the screws.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central stake—rekindling a dying world at the cost of her personal memory—is clear and does undergo a meaningful tightening as the song triggers larger effects and she realizes the personal price. Still, opposition remains largely atmospheric (“darkness pressed harder”) rather than active, and her path from first song to full commitment has no serious alternative tested on the page. The emotional cost is real, but the conflict feels assured rather than contested, limiting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Miriam will remain defined by punitive hiding or accept a more complex presence—is clear from early on. Pressure escalates internally as the librarian reframes her actions and forces her to confront the origin of her retreat (“My daughter…”), culminating in a stance shift at midnight. The conflict is almost entirely internal and conversational, with little external resistance, but the emotional cost of reconsidering her self-blame supplies real tension. The final choice to “belong” to the library and return to the world still partially hidden reads as an earned, ethically ambiguous resolution rather than an easy absolution.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mei can sustain a meaningful, non-destructive relationship to a world that forgets—is clear and her planting as resistance clarifies it. Escalation is subtle: the bread from the vanished bakery intensifies her burden of memory and motivates a new, specific planting, reframing her gardening as “tenuous absolution.” This deepening feels genuine but remains mostly interior; external pressure (social, institutional, or temporal) never sharpens her options or forces a hard trade-off. As a result, tension is quietly persuasive rather than gripping, appropriate for the piece but limiting the stakes bandwidth.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—what singular promise to preserve as the library dies—is clear and inherently weighty, and the approaching collapse provides a credible situational clock. The escalation from background dissolution to specific shelves vanishing, to cracks in the floor, to finding the vow that makes the instrument “weep” tracks well. However, the internal cost of letting all other vows go is more implied than viscerally felt in her micro-choices; she never seriously wavers on the selected vow or confronts a rival candidate. As a result, the tension is poignant but relatively smooth, rather than sharply pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—preventing the recording from reaching the Hollow Men and igniting war—is clearly signaled and carries real weight conceptually. There is a meaningful tightening when she spots the courier, sees the assistant arrive, and has to commit to an interception in real time. However, the actual on-page opposition feels soft: she bumps the assistant, catches the cylinder, and escapes with only a brief grab from the courier, so the danger is more asserted than viscerally felt. The mentioned prior failures help, but more friction in this attempt would deepen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding what happened to her brother and what weather-carriers are—is clear and sharpened by the forest election’s implications. Pressure escalates modestly but effectively with the arrival and differing weathers of the three figures, culminating in the revelation of the brother’s integration with the aspens and Vera’s own latent role. However, there’s little active resistance or dilemma; Vera does not face a hard choice so much as accept a reframe, which keeps the sense of cost relatively soft. The conflict is intellectually engaging but emotionally and dramatically gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Maren will continue suppressing her creative drive or finally answer it—is clear and present early. Pressure deepens as she interprets the broken lock and recognizes the familial pattern of fear, which forces a choice at the sketchbook moment. Escalation is mostly internal and relatively smooth, lacking a sharp reversal or external complication that would further narrow options. Still, her decision to draw and then to hang the work publicly constitutes a meaningful foreclosing of the old path.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mei Lin can confront the truth about her father and her mother’s secrecy without being undone—comes through clearly and tightens as she decodes the map and descends to the Archive. Escalation is primarily knowledge-deepening rather than conflict-heightening: each step narrows emotional options but doesn’t introduce external resistance or urgent risk, so pressure feels steady rather than mounting. The playback of spool 7,423 is a solid central turn that forces a new understanding and implicitly forecloses the option of simple blame. Because everything proceeds without real opposition or hard trade-offs, the felt cost remains quieter than the premise would allow.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the bell can be restored to truthful song—is clear and thematically rich, and the ringing itself is a meaningful tightening. However, on-page pressure is low: Maren never seriously confronts failure, opposition, or trade-offs beyond the known, accepted cost of the melting ice. The escalation thus reads as smooth fulfillment of competence rather than a test that forecloses options or hurts, which limits tension despite the beauty of the concept.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether VERA-7 will continue to be eroded by unprocessed grief or radically alter herself—is clearly laid in early and tightened by the magnetic shift’s physical and atmospheric pressure. The escalation is primarily internal and textural (static intensifying, roses trembling, fire and compression) rather than driven by external opposition, but it does culminate in a meaningful, irrevocable choice. The main limitation is the lack of real resistance or complication once she decides; the path from decision to solution is steady and unchallenged, keeping pressure strong but not bracing. Still, the cost of renunciation is visible and informs the renewed but altered stasis at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stakes—whether seventeen years of grief and silence can be breached—are clear and specific, and pressure deepens as the locket’s provenance and Mrs. Okonkwo’s relationship to Delphine are revealed. The key-in-locket discovery is the main escalation and works, but overall conflict remains low-temperature: there is little active resistance or genuine risk of refusal on the page. Maren’s agency (offering to bring the granddaughter) provides a credible narrowing of options, yet the emotional and relational costs are mostly anticipated rather than felt. The result is tender and coherent but not especially taut.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stakes are internal and historical: retrieving and understanding Elise’s coded legacy so unnamed heroes’ stories can surface, and redefining Marina’s relationship to fear. Pressure accumulates texturally rather than through overt obstacles, with the key tightening being the translation of decoding into dance, leading to thematic realization. However, there is little real resistance—no danger in the lab, no active opposition, and minimal cost to retrieval—so tension remains subdued. The result is more meditative than pressurized, which limits escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—retrieving erased memories and the mother bound up with them—is signaled early and escalates through Mira’s increasing defiance and intimacy with the sphere. One major tightening beat occurs when she offers the pressed flowers, triggering the sphere’s opening and forcing her to confront the truth about her mother’s role. The final choice to step through the door is clearly tied to that pressure but the on-page sense of sacrifice (what she risks or loses by going) could be sharpened. External antagonistic pressure (the tide master, danger of the sphere) remains mostly offstage, keeping conflict more internal than it might be at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.8)
    The global stakes (a world destabilized by prophecy) are enormous and clearly stated, and Mira’s goal is sharply defined. However, the conflict unfolds with minimal friction: no misstep, counter-force, or real risk of failure ever materializes on the page. Escalation is mostly a deepening of concentration and time-passing rather than a tightening of options or a sharper price. The result is contemplative and lovely, but not especially tense.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—whether this dying language of buildings will survive through a new speaker—is clear and coherently pressured by Voss’s progressive fading. Escalation is primarily temporal and textural (September to January; Voss becoming more translucent), culminating in the handoff to a new student. Still, conflict remains gentle: the narrator never seriously considers refusing or failing, so options feel limited but not sharply contested. The cost registers more as elegiac inevitability than as a tested, fraught choice.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—restoring Elena’s memory vs accepting permanent erasure—is clear early, and Mirabel’s decision to fill the shell through the entire night is a meaningful narrowing of options with real cost. Pressure escalates accumulatively rather than through sharp reversals: the conflict is endurance and commitment under uncertainty. The Council’s threat remains offstage, so antagonistic pressure is more conceptual than immediate, which keeps tension a bit lower than it could be. Still, the internal and external stakes braid effectively and the closure feels earned by Mirabel’s agency.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Veren will commit “calibrated treason” to complete the treaty and thereby reconfigure history—is clear and thematically rich. Pressure escalates modestly as he mixes blood into the ink and approaches the decisive signature, with the key’s activation as the main tightening beat. However, the outcome feels foregone from early on; we see little in-the-moment resistance, alternative tactics, or risk of interruption that might sharpen the moral calculus. The cost is more reflective than immediate, leaving tension somewhat muted.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will continue to feed the canyon at the cost of her selfhood or deny it and accept isolation—is clear and sharpened by the revelation that she is being groomed as a sacrifice. Escalation is effective: the shell’s voice, the vision of the Council, and the reconceptualization of echo as extraction each deepen the threat and narrow her options. The resolution is appropriately costly: she renounces her most defining act (singing) and accepts a riskier, slower path of resistance through whispered truth. The main limitation is that all opposition remains conceptual and offstage, so moment-to-moment tension never quite reaches the visceral level it might with a present antagonist or immediate counterpressure.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Mira will respond to Elise’s unrest and the truth about the Celestine—is clear and coherent. There is one meaningful deepening when the dream investigation reveals deliberate sabotage tied to the harbormaster’s family. However, after that reveal, the tension plateaus: Mira’s decision to expose the truth to the council faces no real on-page resistance, moral calculus, or countervailing pressure. Conflict operates more as solemn duty than sharpened dilemma, limiting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.2)
    Conflict and stakes are the thinnest area: the piece centers on a woman quietly confirming a long-held hypothesis and choosing to remain unseen, with no real opposition beyond ambient human indifference. There’s a conceptual tension between discovery and obscurity, but it never tightens into a live dilemma or forces a sacrifice beyond the general fact of anonymity. The firefly’s response to her whistle is a lovely micro-turn, yet it doesn’t materially alter her options or impose new pressure. The emotional temperature stays nearly level, which limits escalation under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—exposing a world-changing secret versus the Consortium’s monopoly on survival—is clear and thematically potent. Pressure escalates intellectually (each page of Yuri’s letters, the discovery of the stillpoint, handling the diamond) but remains mostly situational and conceptual rather than dramatized through direct conflict or hard trade-offs. Her final choice to take the diamond and spread the truth crystallizes her stance, yet there’s little visible loss, risk test, or blocked option on the page at that beat. The conflict works, but it feels under-contested for the scale of the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central conflict—sanctioning a violent assault versus insisting on doubt and listening—is clearly established and escalates via Caro’s urgent request and the moonrise deadline. Internal and external stakes interweave well: her reluctance to be a prophet collides with the Dawn Shepherds’ expectations. The decisive turn is her transmission of the ancient recordings and explicit offer of doubt, which forecloses the path of easy, righteous violence. The resolution reads a bit frictionless (Caro relents quickly, no visible backlash), slightly softening the sense of price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—giving meaning to Eliza’s tune and, by extension, justifying Marcus’s vocation—is clear but encounters very little resistance or escalation. By the time the on-page present begins, the decoding work is already completed, so the narrative tension is largely retrospective. The one meaningful tightening is the realization that his work “bridges an impossible gap,” which reweights his solitude but doesn’t foreclose a live alternative in scene. As a result, the piece reads as contemplative rather than pressurized, with low felt cost in the moment of “resolution.”

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.8)
    The primary stake—preserve the Source Tone from commodification—is clearly articulated and escalates as the recovery vessel approaches, compressing Vera’s options. Her decision to release the Tone instead of keep it sealed or allow its theft is a meaningful ethical trade-off with world-scale consequences and personal cost. Internal and external stakes align well, but the conflict is largely unilateral: the Consortium vessel never exerts direct, adaptive pressure in scene. As a result, tension is strong but not razor-edged.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—preparing the revolution by timing the magnetic storm—is clear, and the tension comes from the contrast between immense long-term stakes and the quiet, repetitive labor. Pressure escalates texturally: the discovery of the viaduct raises the sense of purpose, the nearing completion of measurements tightens the horizon of change, and the looming storm reframes her work. However, the conflict remains largely internal and contemplative; there’s no concrete present obstacle or risk that might derail her task, so the sense of jeopardy is muted. The result is thematically apt but dramatically gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—whether Margaret will collude by silence or risk herself to expose institutional corruption—is clear and tightened by the discovery that the tunnel is both historically sacred and currently exploited. There is a solid escalation from curiosity about David’s death to proof of an active smuggling operation and a specific plan to blow the whistle. However, conflict remains mostly conceptual; no one interferes, no systems push back in the moment, and her choice, while meaningful, is made under relatively low on-page pressure. The ending carries cost conceptually but could benefit from at least one concrete, present-tense consequence or near-miss.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central conflict—Marcus’s need to respond to a forgiveness he feels he doesn’t deserve—is clear and present, and his decision to seek Ruth’s help is an act under pressure, not mere rumination. There is a meaningful deepening when Ruth notes that prior repair attempts “forced it” and worsened the damage, mirroring his earlier testimony. However, tension escalates only mildly; nothing on the page truly threatens his ability to act beyond his own shame, and Ruth offers little resistance. The result is a strong but low-intensity arc that feels more like a turning toward process than a hard moral crossroads.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Zephyr will transcend her function and perhaps the corrosive world—is clearly stated and culminates in her launch into the acid mist. However, conflict remains mostly conceptual and lightly contested; the Boiler’s objections are mild, and Zephyr never seriously doubts or adapts tactics under pressure. Escalation is present (from viewing, to modifying herself, to launching) but relatively smooth, with little sense of narrowing options or sacrifice beyond a gestured risk. The result is intellectually engaging but not fully tense.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes—uncovering a corporate conspiracy around missing persons—are high and clearly articulated, and the lie to Security is a solid midpoint tightening. However, opposition is soft: security clears with minimal friction, restricted servers yield quickly, and nothing actively pushes back once she’s inside the vault. The escalation is predominantly informational rather than confrontational; suspense is strong conceptually but lightly dramatized in terms of risk and concrete consequences in the moment. The final choice to leave with the drive and pursue Marcus raises danger but doesn’t yet force a visible trade-off beyond implied peril.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Kira can recover self-directed empathy and transform her relationship to the darkness she carries—is clear and coherent. Pressure deepens from enigmatic summons to confronting the mirrors’ evidence of her own goodness to the charged act of reconstituting the fragment. Yet the conflict remains largely internal and unresisted; the keeper offers no real opposition, and Kira never seriously contemplates refusal, so there’s limited sense of risk or threatened loss in the present scene. The escalation is sufficient for a quiet piece but not particularly sharp or fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Maren will pursue a controlled death or remain in this liminal, risk-filled life—is clear and thematically potent. Volunteer work and the stroke complicate her original plan and generate a meaningful internal conflict between certainty and surrender. However, on-page pressure is quite gentle: there is little concrete narrowing of options or explicit test of the Zurich decision beyond contemplation. As a result, tension deepens but never bites hard enough to feel fully escalated.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the past will stay buried or be honestly confronted—is clear but the pressure on it stays low-key. There is a mild tightening as Marcus moves from guardedness to putting the fragment on the table, and Sofia’s need for understanding presses him gently. However, there are no strong reversals or moments where a path is sharply foreclosed; the piece reads more as contemplative than truly pressured. The cost of speaking is implied but not deeply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are well defined—preserving ancestral voices against the prophet’s silencing doctrine—and they tighten when torches and a direct confrontation enter. Yet escalation feels somewhat perfunctory: there is no true near-failure, ethical bind, or concrete loss; the prophet’s threat never forces her to alter tactics beyond performing the planned consecration under mild pressure. Her agency is real, but it’s never seriously contested, so the resolution, while coherent, lacks bite. The emotional and practical price of her line-walking remains largely implied rather than pressed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Thornwell can move from fractured private grief to collective healing—is established early and paid off in the final gathering. Pressure escalates conceptually as Maren moves from individual sessions to community-wide reunions, and the Castellan–Varga reconnection is a meaningful deepening. However, there’s minimal on-page resistance: no one refuses the invitations, no scene shows an encounter nearly failing, so the path feels friction-light. Costs (old resentments, risk of reopening wounds) are implied rather than dramatized, keeping tension at a gentle simmer instead of a true boil.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—proving to herself that language still has latent potential—is clear and consistently pressed by the world’s evacuation and the “finite” dictionaries. Escalation comes via the discovery that the echo rhythms mirror botanical growth rings, a deepening that reweights her project from curiosity to near-religious conviction. However, the conflict remains largely internal and intellectual, with no sharp on-page test that threatens to derail her work or force a concrete trade-off beyond the already-chosen isolation. The pressure grows in a quiet, textural way rather than via a distinctly narrowing crucible, which is effective but limits peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—can Marcus retrieve something meaningful from a vision before it slips away—is clear and active, with the ticking fog and dwindling chalk as constraints. Pressure deepens when the chalk-writing takes over and he discovers the “map of partings,” a genuine escalation from vague compulsion to concrete, costly knowledge. The cost is internal (recognition of inevitable loss) rather than external, which fits the design but keeps the conflict quite meditative. The one dampening factor is that the initial “locate something specific” frame rarely feels in doubt or opposed beyond time and his own forgetting; no fresh obstacle complicates his path once he’s in the garden.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira can transform obsessive clinging into acceptance—is clear early and tightened through the impossible object of the spinning hand. Pressure escalates modestly but effectively: the quakes, the suggestion that the mountain itself is learning to move, and the wait for a single falling leaf all build toward a quiet but charged decision. The cost is internal and credible: in accepting that her father chose to “remain” elsewhere, Mira relinquishes the fantasy of retrieval. The conflict stays mostly contemplative; a slightly sharper on-page test of her willingness to release would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—how Samuel will meet the possibility of his own death—is clear early via the broken record and waiting for results. Escalation is more deepening than reversal: music softens his terror, the kintsugi repair opens him to memory, and finally he articulates his wish for a “flawless goodbye” just before the nurse arrives. The nurse’s entrance tightens the pressure by converting abstract dread into imminent news, forcing a stance. The cost is primarily emotional (accepting vulnerability and connection rather than remaining in rage/terror), which fits the mode but keeps the conflict quieter than it might be at absolute top-tier stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring noon-shadows/repairing reality’s cracks—is conceptually large, and there is a clear tightening when the automaton reveals the need for precise timing and for someone who understands both old and new runes. Yet conflict remains largely abstract and unopposed: no active danger, deadline, or risk of failure manifests on page as she begins the work. Her agency (choosing “Show me,” then committing to the sealing) drives the ending, but we don’t see a real trade-off, loss, or pressed decision between competing harms. The result is interesting pressure rather than gripping escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—Eleanor’s need to reconcile skepticism with her mother’s “madness” and her sister’s fate—is established early and deepens as she chooses to desecrate the grave in pursuit of truth. The discovery of hollow, wing-like bones is a clear tightening that removes the option of continued denial. The final decision to keep and study the bones, turning grief into scholarship and a search for Charlotte, crystallizes her stance. What’s slightly lacking is a sharper sense of immediate price or danger beyond internal and ethical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—how Maren lives with her grief and whether she can share her “light” without fire—is signaled clearly and threaded throughout. Escalation is quiet and internal, moving from solitary ritual to the conceptual leap that the polished glass can serve as a communal, heatless beacon. The cost is primarily emotional (accepting others into a space that held an exclusive intimacy with her daughter, and acknowledging an ongoing life with grief), but it remains somewhat implicit and gentle rather than sharply tested. The story would benefit from one more explicit frictive moment where Maren nearly preserves the grotto as purely private before choosing to open it.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stakes—whether the sisters remain estranged in their grief narratives or begin to reconnect—are clear and personal. Escalation is quiet but present: from solitary observation, to confronting the pendant’s meaning, to physically approaching Thea and offering it. The cost is the relinquishing of the object most tied to Mira’s private bond with her mother and the risk of softening toward a sister who hurt her. The pressure could be heightened slightly by a more palpable moment of hesitation or potential refusal, but as a quiet piece it still holds.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elena will continue to abandon stories at the point of hope—is clear and sharpened by the confrontations with the marine biologist, the war-displaced boy, and finally her younger self. Each encounter tightens pressure by stripping her excuses, culminating in the realization that hope is “the act of reaching,” which forces a new stance. The cost—accepting vulnerability and the risk of failure by promising to finish—is legible though largely internal. Escalation is more deepening than reversal, which suits the mode but keeps tension relatively gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the ritual and vines can be revived in this rare alignment—is clear and escalates from anxious preparation to the pressured singing moment. The device amplifying her imperfect voice provides a satisfying micro-escalation, and the visible response of the vines is a strong payoff. However, the risk of failure and its consequences remain somewhat abstract; there’s no meaningful alternative path or sacrifice beyond fatigue, which keeps the pressure from truly tightening. As a result, the climax feels moving but not harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Maren can successfully inscribe this map for lost souls—is clear but almost entirely conceptual and uncontested on the page. Past sacrifices (lost fingers, solitude) and the dangerous cold are mentioned, yet nothing in the scene concretely threatens failure once the ritual begins. Escalation comes mainly from the introduction and deployment of the meteor-starlight and the all-or-nothing nature of the sealing moment, but no options close or force a trade-off in real time. As a result, tension feels beautiful but low-grade rather than pressing.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—can Elena successfully harvest the echoes without destroying their mystery—is clear and paid off. Pressure escalates from protracted, uncertain experimentation to the single timed attempt with the repaired mechanism. The cost (months of isolation, the risk of collapsing the phenomenon by looking directly, and the partial “domestication” of awe) is perceptible but intellectualized rather than acutely felt. The conflict remains low-key and largely internal, effective but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s mind being calcified by uncontrolled fractals unless she finds emotional mass—is clear and present from early on. Pressure escalates through the long night of work as she collects heavier burdens, culminating in the unusual, asymmetrical fractal that finally anchors her. The cost is legible: she takes on others’ griefs and must surrender the weaving back to the grotto to reclaim herself. Tension is more meditative than sharp, which suits the piece but keeps escalation in the “strong” rather than “ferocious” band.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—how Marguerite will live with and shape her grief—is clear, and the recurring act of carving as containment gives that stake form. However, pressure remains fairly static; there’s no central dilemma or turn where an option is truly foreclosed or a trade-off is forced. The kettle’s time limit and upcoming students hint at pressure but never really test her stance. As a result, the piece excels as a mood piece but reads more like deepening meditation than escalating conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.8)
    The core conflict—Mira’s desire to end the draining negotiations with her younger-ambition-ghost versus her fear of reclaiming that self—is well-articulated and escalates through the new regret insight. The meaningful tightening is her admission that the stopping wasn’t a choice, which forces both characters to shift. Stakes remain psychological and somewhat abstract, with little external pressure or real risk if she fails beyond continued stagnation. Within that quiet register, the turn and its cost are still clear and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether this dead terminal can be plausibly revived as a step toward renewed spaceflight—is clear but mostly internal and prospective. There is one meaningful deepening when the equations reveal 30% capacity, turning vague nostalgia into a viable, if modest, proposal. However, there is little active resistance or narrowing of options on the page; no one and nothing pushes back. As a result, tension feels low and the outcome relatively unpressured, despite the thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will re-engage her abandoned musical self despite the dangers and pain of hope—is clear and threads the whole piece. Escalation comes through deepening internal pressure (realizing her subconscious has been composing all along) leading to the tightening choice to start a new composition. The cost is thematically legible (she risks heartbreak, change, and possibly renewed danger) but remains largely implied, with no direct counterpressure on the page beyond her fear and habit. As a result, tension is solid but stays on the quieter, introspective end of the spectrum.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Maren will confront the truth of her father’s “legend”—is clear from early on, and escalates as she identifies the junction, retrieves the case, and reads the letter. The external action of salvaging the case deepens the internal conflict, forcing her to reprice her inheritance. The final choice is open-ended but charged; she accepts the burden of knowledge even as she defers action, an earned stasis with visible cost. What’s missing for a higher score is a sharper on-page test of competing options (e.g., immediate pressure to expose vs. protect) in the closing beats.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether embodied, pre-literate knowledge will vanish or be preserved—remains coherent and present throughout. Pressure escalates modestly as Mira decodes from practical lore to the existence of a hidden community, culminating in her decision to seek them; that’s a genuine tightening of options and responsibility. However, the conflict is largely internal and contemplative, with little on-page resistance beyond cold, time, and the abstraction of impending cultural loss. The result is thematically weighty but low-tension, which dampens the sense of cost at the final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—whether Elara can reconfigure her relationship to her brother’s absence and her own work—appears early and stays coherent. Pressure deepens via her choice to begin the obituary, the sustained overnight writing, and the eventual decision to leave those pages behind, with the groove-cut thread and dawn marking an internal cost point. However, conflict remains relatively smooth: there’s little on-page resistance, backsliding, or concrete alternative she nearly chooses and rejects. The escalation reads as a steady deepening rather than a sharp tightening, which works but leaves some potential tension on the table.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Aldric can bring back genuine, unpredictable life into a mechanized world—is established clearly and escalates through the build-up to activating the apparatus. His choice to proceed, knowing it is “flawed genesis,” is a credible tightening and the main act of agency. The cost is primarily conceptual/emotional (loss of the pure past, unleashing disorder) rather than concretely dramatized in consequences, which slightly softens the pressure. Still, the shift in the birds and citizens’ reactions gives the climax real weight.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake is Mara’s need to renegotiate her inheritance of fire and decide what to do with her pain; that stake is clear and her choice to collect the sand and integrate it into the memorial is a concrete tactic. Pressure escalates texturally rather than via dramatic reversals, building from contemplation of the lagoon to memories of her father’s crimes and imprisonment, to the therapist vs. her own framing, and finally to a reframed philosophy of fire. The cost is subtle but present: she accepts that the fire is part of her and chooses to “carry darkness toward the light,” foreclosing the fantasy of total erasure. The piece remains quiet—no external test of this stance—so tension never becomes gripping, but it deepens credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—freeing the city’s memories at the likely cost of Mira’s personal relic—is clear and comes to a meaningful head when she opens the stained glass box. Conflict escalates from citywide stasis to the concentrated pressure at the great fountain, with the sacrifice providing a convincing price. However, the external journey feels relatively obstacle-free; the trail is followed without major setbacks or hard choices until the final sacrifice. The stakes work, but the path to the climax could bear more resistance or complication to fully match the premise’s weight.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.4)
    The main stake—whether destructive generational patterns can be interrupted—is clear, and the story tightens once Veloris recognizes the gear as a calibration device that might offer an alternative to fire. Conflict is mostly conceptual and internal; there’s no real opposition beyond the weight of history and her own skepticism. Escalation is present but gentle: from observation to discovery to transmission to a bittersweet acceptance that most civilizations will still fail. The climax resolves without much friction, so the price paid is largely in accepting the narrowness of her victory rather than in any hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—Elara learning to honor collective grief in stone—is legible early and deepens as she moves from individual names to relational constellations. Thomas’s story of the mining stone and his insistence on “absences connect” provide one meaningful tightening that forces her to reconceive her task. However, opposition is largely conceptual and gentle; there’s no sharp cost or foreclosed alternative path beyond the implied emotional weight and deadline of the migration. The result is a satisfying but very quiet pressure profile.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—Maren’s need to live with her error and find some sustainable balance—is clearly established early and tightened when the rake handle introduces an unexpected path toward shared confession. The meaningful turn comes “during the pause in a pendulum’s swing,” when she decides to inscribe her own guilt, which reweights her ongoing ritual of precision. Pressure is mostly internal and situational, without sharp reversals, but the story still delivers a credible escalation from passive endurance to an active, ethically fraught admission. The cost is present but modestly scaled, keeping conflict strong but not ferocious.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—uncovering what the grandmother hid—is clear, and decoding the tapestry is a concrete action that deepens knowledge. However, opposition is almost nonexistent: no real risk in decoding, no emotional or practical price dramatized for digging. Tension arises more from curiosity than from conflicting wants or potential harm. As a result, escalation feels gentle rather than tightening, keeping this in the mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will accept the task of “writing the future” without repeating the ancients’ hubristic certainty—is clear and thematically aligned. Pressure escalates from abstract dread (the ancients’ catastrophic failure) to a more focused internal test when she finally takes up the quill and chooses how to frame her maps. However, opposition is largely conceptual and unresisted; there’s no serious on-page temptation toward certainty or concrete downside to refusal, so options never feel sharply narrowed. The final stance is persuasive but not hard-won, keeping tension in the solid-but-not-searing range.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—risk of discovery versus the necessity of broadcasting—is legible early and threads through the scene (scanner sweeps, mist window, noise outside). There is a clear though gentle tightening as the mist thins and patrols approach, pushing her to finish and sign off. However, the antagonistic pressure never quite peaks into a genuinely testing moment; the fox fake-out dissipates tension quickly, and she isn’t forced into a hard trade-off or visible loss on the page, keeping the conflict more atmospheric than acute.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—how Marina will handle her grandmother’s passing and whether she will step into the role—remains coherent, and pressure accumulates through the ritual steps. Escalation is subtle: from observing the stillness, to donning the mask, to mixing ashes, to witnessing the vanishing point respond, to finally choosing to reopen the gallery. There is limited on-page resistance or sharp internal struggle; conflict is contemplative more than agonized, which slightly softens the felt cost. Still, the final decision to endure and continue the work clearly forecloses the alternative of retreating from this duty.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Marcus will risk engagement with the zealots or remain a hidden witness—is articulated but never faces a hard squeeze. External pressure (chanting above, book-burning) is off-stage and static; nothing new happens to genuinely narrow his options within the scene. The internal conflict is interesting yet resolves along the line of least resistance, with relatively low apparent cost. As a result, tension accumulates conceptually rather than escalating in a felt or tactical way.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Margaret will let the art and the program die with her retirement or pass something on—is clear and thematically rich. Pressure coherently grows through Darius’s confession about hatred and the concert video, forcing her to confront the cost of silence. Yet conflict remains very low-friction; she offers little on-page resistance and the path from “resigned” to “we start by subtracting noise” feels almost preordained. The lack of a sharper internal or relational snag keeps escalation from fully tightening around a painful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—planting and preserving forbidden knowledge in the face of an oppressive regime—is clear from early on. Pressure escalates via the sequential rising of the moons and the knowledge that sensors will detect the tree by dawn, culminating in her decision to harvest and memorize the fruits under time constraint. Internal and external conflicts align (her reverence for memory vs. danger of treason), though her internal struggle could be sharper. The resolution is earned but skewed more toward inevitability than hard trade-off on the page, which slightly softens felt tension.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stakes—saving the drone bees as a proxy for the woman’s daughter and preserving a fragile form of wonder—are clearly signaled. Pressure escalates once the bees’ imminent burnout is introduced and Mira must decide whether to expose the tower’s secret, but after that, the path to success is relatively smooth and uncontested. There is no meaningful trade-off or loss beyond the quiet risk of revealing hidden knowledge, so cost feels modest. The piece sustains low-key tension rather than building to a sharp crucible moment.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is Marina’s need to understand why some houses “feel alive” and what that implies about presence and forgetting, which is clearly signaled early. There is a discernible deepening when she enters the Whitmore house and realizes the attention itself is the sanctifying act, which reweights her project. However, pressure remains gentle; there’s little sense of risk if she fails tonight, and no sharp reversal or dilemma that forces a difficult trade-off. The conflict stays mostly contemplative rather than truly testing her values or options.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—Mira’s need to know what really happened to her brother and what it means for death—is clear and present from her first appearance. Pressure deepens as Veris reveals that her brother chose to “rejoin,” forcing Mira to abandon the simpler desire for vindication. That said, the conflict remains largely internal and resolves without much resistance; Mira doesn’t meaningfully push back on or test the revelations, so escalation feels more like steady illumination than a hard choice. The “invitation” to rejoin is powerful but deferred, so the felt cost at this beat is more potential than actual.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—transforming grief into a perpetual-motion engine within her confinement—is clear and sharpened by the discovery of the crack as a predicted “rupture point.” Escalation is primarily internal and conceptual but does tighten: the crack threatens the system’s stability and forces her to choose between safe continuation and transformative risk. Her decisive act (pressing her hand into the fracture) forecloses the option of remaining in the original configuration of the prison. The conflict remains largely introspective and could use one more concrete external complication to reach a higher pressure band.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Maya can prove that strangers remember her grandmother’s kindness and thereby revalue her own sleepless vigil—is clearly established and deepens rather than dramatically spikes. Pressure escalates via the intensifying visions and frantic painting, then crystallizes with the Budapest email that validates her quest and forces a new stance toward her insomnia. The cost (years of sleeplessness, emotional vulnerability, the ache of loss) is present but stays mostly implied rather than confronted in a concrete dilemma. It’s strong, quiet conflict, but not yet at a knife-edge.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stakes (survival of both bodies and culture amid dwindling honey and surface-world neglect) are clear and quietly tense. There is a meaningful deepening when honey scarcity and the beekeeper’s prolonged absence are linked to the children’s obliviousness—our awareness of impending loss intensifies. However, pressure doesn’t truly escalate in-scene; no new obstacle or decision materially narrows options beyond the opening premise. The ending’s stance (“we will continue to teach and create”) is earned, but the path there feels more like a steady illumination than a sharp test.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—reaching his daughter / unwinding fate—is clear early and tightens convincingly as the yoyo’s nature emerges and the stone begins to glow. Escalation comes from Alaric’s agency: his decision to disassemble, then reassemble and finally cast the yoyo again, chasing the laughter. That said, pressure is more wonder-driven than oppositional; there’s little active resistance or trade-off on the page beyond the implied risk of crossing, so the cost feels more inferred than dramatized. Still, the move from investigation to irreversible crossing is a solid, earned tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Vera can rid herself of her invasive fear—is clearly established and escalates from eerie promise to ritualized psychic confrontation. The advisor’s method forces her to risk inviting the fear closer in order to trick it, which is a strong internal/psychic pressure point. However, the actual struggle with the fear in the dream is largely told in a few lines and resolved once she notes its weakness; we don’t feel a fully tested or costly battle, which slightly blunts the sense of earned difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are almost entirely internal and thematic: will she continue to meet the sea’s destruction with her practice of transformation. The incoming wreckage is framed as “opportunity” rather than threat, so there is little friction or escalation as she works. The story deepens texturally (more complex cloud fractals, musical mapping of the hull) but does not meaningfully tighten pressure or foreclose options. As a result, the piece reads as a beautifully rendered state rather than a conflict that genuinely tests or alters her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—remain in constrained safety or risk herself to confront the watchers and learn what her father learned—is clear and present early. Pressure tightens meaningfully when the watcher tilts its head, converting abstract obsession into a live possibility that demands action, and culminates in her climbing through the gate and leaving. Internal and external conflicts are intertwined, but the external resistance to her escape is minimal, so escalation reads more as an internal ratcheting than as a fully contested gauntlet. The cost is felt conceptually, but a concrete setback or resistance beat could raise tension further.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.4)
    The core stake—whether to shatter a stabilizing noble lie in order to restore historical truth—is well articulated and morally charged. We do get one key tightening beat where Vera contemplates burning the letter and walking away before committing to documentation and dissemination, which functions as the decisive trade-off. However, the opening line (“knew her time had come”) telegraphs her eventual choice so strongly that the mid-story hesitation feels more like confirmation than true escalation under pressure. The consequences are framed mostly in abstract social terms rather than grounded in a specific, immediate personal risk, which softens the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—rescuing abandoned messages from oblivion and easing Marina’s own sense of absence—is clear, but the pressure curve is gentle. The main escalation is the discovery that the new photograph links directly to the earlier inkwell letter, which heightens emotional stakes but doesn’t significantly narrow her options or force a costly trade-off. The story reads as a beautifully rendered slice of ongoing practice rather than a night where something must change.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the stamp’s origin can be honestly determined—remains coherent, and the blackout functions as a gentle but real pressure that forces Maren into a different mode of attention. The key tightening is the discovery of the ledger, which redefines the interpretive possibilities around the stamp and leads to an irreversible re-indexing. However, opposition is largely situational rather than antagonistic, and the price paid is subtle (accepting responsibility and solitude rather than facing a sharp ethical or relational cost). The conflict is compelling but quiet, more contemplative than fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Mei can hold onto her daughter’s essence against the rules of death—is clear early and threads through every beat. Pressure does tighten somewhat via the midnight deadline and the fragile, one-shot nature of her device. However, there’s limited true escalation or meaningful setback: the capture sequence reads as a smooth execution of a plan, with no serious risk of failure dramatized on the page. The emotional cost is more conceptual than felt in the moment, so tension never quite reaches elite-level sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding why some potential remains unrealized to prove deaths were not inevitable—is clear, but it stays largely conceptual. The anomaly spike is a meaningful beat, yet it doesn’t force a trade-off or visible price; her choice is to continue doing exactly what she has been doing. Internal pressure (incompleteness vs. bleak exhilaration) informs her perseverance but never pushes her to a threshold where a real option is foreclosed. As a result, tension accumulates more in tone and idea than in concrete escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Mira’s need for answers about her father and, by extension, belonging—is clear, and the revelation that she’s inheriting continuation rather than closure is a meaningful turn. However, there is little resistance: no real risk the lever won’t work, no danger to pulling it, no interpersonal friction between Mira and the pilgrim. The pressure thus feels more like unfolding discovery than sharpened conflict, with limited sense of on-page cost beyond implied emotional recalibration.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Maren will continue to evade responsibility or face the full weight of what she’s done—is clear from early on. Pressure escalates from background guilt to a focused crisis when she finds the carved hand and finally speaks the truth aloud, narrowing her options. The cost is emotional and moral rather than situational, but the story credibly frames her new mission as difficult, with no promise of absolution. A slightly stronger on-page sense of what she risks (social, legal, or practical) could deepen the stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—her brother’s life and freedom—is stated early and remains clear, and the internal conflict about how/when to accept his apology runs alongside it. However, the external pressure never truly tightens: Varen accepts fair terms without real resistance, and the exchange proceeds exactly as planned with no on-page test of her skill or risk of failure. The most meaningful “choice” is her decision to delay the conversation with her brother, which is emotionally honest but dramatically modest. As a result, tension feels more implied than escalated.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether she can risk re-entering the water and trusting herself at all—is clear and signaled early. Pressure coheres as she actually launches, paddles into fog, handles the useless compass, and chooses not to discard it, which is a quiet but meaningful stance crystallization. However, there is minimal external or situational complication; no new obstacle forces a sharper trade-off or visibly raises the price beyond what she brings in. The escalation therefore feels more like a steady thaw than a tightening test of commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—whether Marcus will meaningfully engage with the possibility of remorse and redemption—is well signaled and sharpened by Elena’s revelation that he killed her brother. The lake-as-labyrinth externalizes this moral test, and his choice to enter is a genuine act of agency that closes off the option of staying detached. Escalation is more conceptual than dramatic; we’re poised at the start of the hardest trials rather than inside them. As a result, the felt cost is present but relatively modest on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—reuniting with Kael at the cost of her humanity—is clear early and paid off. Pressure escalates primarily through the irreversible metamorphosis as it physically advances, tightening the trade-off she can no longer avoid. However, conflict is mostly internal and somewhat pre-decided; once she begins the ritual, the path is smooth with no further serious resistance or complication. The emotional cost is felt, but the scene could sustain one sharper on-page test of her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake (reclaiming three fugitive years of love and selfhood) is clear and emotionally weighty, and the pressure does tighten when the family ritual unexpectedly activates and the door appears. The key choice—unfastening Iris’s knotted cord—is a genuine narrowing of options with a felt emotional price. However, once she commits, the retrieval itself proceeds almost frictionlessly; there’s little on-page risk of loss, failure, or unwanted consequence beyond tears. As a result, the conflict feels deep but relatively smooth, more contemplative than sharply embattled.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stakes—unlocking the sealed dimension for a second chance versus remaining the last witness in a closed universe—are clear and conceptually large. The main escalation arrives when the final photograph is revealed as her own, forcing her to confront anger she has suppressed in service of pacifism and duty. However, once she acknowledges “I was angry. I am still angry,” the resolution flows smoothly with no on-page risk that she might fail, retreat, or pay a sharper price. Internal and external stakes do align, but tension levels remain more contemplative than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Miriam can finally grasp and embody “the texture of transformation”—is clear and grows as she opens each jar. The ritual of releasing the lightning bugs offers a discernible internal escalation: by the twelfth jar she reaches understanding, and by the seventeenth she has committed fully to release. However, conflict remains largely internal and contemplative; external pressures (the volcano’s danger, the detour, prophecy) exist mostly as framing rather than active opposition. The result is a satisfying but low-intensity arc where tension accrues more texturally than through hard trade-offs on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—quietly detonating the Duke’s power by exposing the counterfeit mint—is clear and substantial, but on-page pressure is comparatively low. Maren never meaningfully risks discovery in-scene; there are no concrete obstacles or reversals between tower, sundial, and messengers, so escalation remains conceptual rather than experiential. The blackout works as an enabling condition rather than a tightening noose. As a result, the revolution lands as planned operation more than hard-won turn.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the world’s fundamental friction can be restored or further corrupted—is strong and clearly signaled. Pressure escalates from global problem to personal ritual risk to the conceptual realization that someone else has already mis-solved the patterns, and her plan to reverse them is a meaningful tightening of options. However, opposition remains mostly abstract; there is little on-page resistance once she commits, and her internal fear of causing futures is resolved relatively quickly. As a result, the cost and danger, while implied, are not as viscerally felt as they could be.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether she remains safely silent or re-enters dangerous public speech—is clear and sharpened by the banned-poet history and the state’s erasure of her parents. Pressure escalates through the literal countdown and the irreversible act of opening the envelope, which narrows her emotional options. The choice to speak again and to find covert publication methods is a genuine commitment with implied political risk. External antagonistic pressure is mostly off-stage, so stakes land more viscerally on the personal than on the immediate situational level.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.8)
    The core stakes—peace overture vs manufactured war, plus Elara’s physical danger—are clear and present early, and Krell’s move toward his sleeve is a sharp escalation beat. Yet the conflict’s peak is largely handled off-page, so we don’t feel her tactics under duress or what she risks losing moment to moment. The victory feels relatively easy and unproblematic, with limited on-page sense of trade-off or loss despite the large declared stakes. Consequently, tension plateaus instead of tightening through concrete reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—sustaining a fragile, illicit sanctuary of ideas and connection under a repressive regime—is clear and emotionally grounded. Pressure is mostly ambient and historical rather than immediate; the increased patrols, displacement camps, and risk are mentioned rather than dramatized in a present-moment test. Escalation is thus more deepening than tightening: we learn how this space came to be dangerous and sacred, but tonight’s scene doesn’t force a fresh trade-off or situational crisis. The ending crystallizes their stance (endurance and beauty-as-resistance) but could gain power from even a small live disruption or choice under threat.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether she can turn her music into a beacon in time for him to find her—is clear and escalates once the dusk alignment deadline is introduced. Her agency drives the resolution: decoding the film, transforming tonal patterns into navigation, and pushing herself to play louder and more purposefully. The emotional cost is evident, though on-page suspense around possible failure is relatively gentle and assured. There is one solid tightening (the time window) rather than multiple reversals, which is adequate at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether and how cultural memory survives—is clear early and tightened by the looming monsoon deadline and Yara’s skepticism about non-empirical methods. Escalation comes through successive failures of scientific tactics, forcing her toward the more costly, identity-challenging dream ritual. Her choice to surrender verification and plant the seed anyway forecloses the path of purely empirical control with a visible emotional cost. The conflict remains largely internal and contemplative, so moment-to-moment tension is more thematic than visceral, which slightly limits the felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Mei will engage with her grandmother’s encoded apology before death—appears early and tightens as the lace’s meaning clarifies and Mei chooses to follow it upstairs. The silent “dialogue” via knots and loops is a satisfying culmination that changes the relationship state. Still, the conflict is relatively low-friction; Mei never seriously considers refusing or misreading, so the price of forgiveness feels felt but not sharply contested on the page.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure is coherent and internal, driven by the tension between the destruction of the legacy (greenhouse) and the persistence of the microscopic (scales). The escalation is quiet but firm, leading to a clear reconfiguration of values. The cost is felt in the accepted loss of the larger structure, though the external manifestation of this choice remains in thought rather than immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.9)
    The stakes are primarily internal and retrospective, dealing with past betrayal and future purpose rather than immediate external pressure. While the psychological tension is palpable, the external conflict resolves through observation rather than active struggle or sacrifice. The cost—the loss of a patron and a previous identity—is felt but largely processed in summary.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.9)
    Escalation relies entirely on internal deepening (Orchid to Fern to Self) without external resistance or tactical pivots; the technology functions perfectly immediately. While the emotional arc is clear, the lack of friction limits the narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes are clear (rest for the dead), but the obstacle is overcome through a summary montage of labor rather than acute, scene-level resistance. The accumulator lens works, but the lack of a specific, difficult "turn" during the burial process lowers the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.4)
    Conflict is nominal. The external threat of patrols is mentioned but never encountered, and the internal tension with Yusuf is resolved instantly by a speech. There is no escalation of pressure or narrowing of options; the run is completed exactly as planned.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; there is no opposition to Mei-Lin's intervention, and the woman's grief yields instantly to the breathing ritual. The stakes remain abstract and are resolved without the protagonist facing a dilemma, hard choice, or risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are existential and signaled early through the fading photographs, creating a clear ticking clock that pressures Elara's movement through the garden. The escalation from observing the fading images to witnessing the "fabric of time" forces a distinct, high-cost trade-off at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes are clearly established with the demolition clock and the unique value of the seeds. However, the conflict peaks and resolves too smoothly; the scout’s immediate capitulation removes the pressure before a true trade-off or sacrifice can occur. While the scout pays a theoretical cost (treason), Mira exits the scene with everything she wanted and a bonus souvenir, softening the sense of struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes are intimate yet monumental for the character, driven by a need to understand a past trauma. The escalation is handled through the crafting process, leading to a climax that subverts expectation: the "sound" is not the mother's lie, but Marina's belief. This twist deepens the conflict rather than neatly resolving it, leaving a lasting scar.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are declared but not tested; the protagonist faces no meaningful opposition, forces no trade-offs, and pays no price for her success. The collector is easily duped, and the potential threat of guards remains theoretical, resulting in a low-tension sequence that lacks the necessary escalation for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—isolation vs. community—is clear, but the escalation is weak; the external world yields easily (the door opens, the power works), leaving the protagonist's decision to feel more like a foregone conclusion than a hard-won victory.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.5)
    While the stakes of identity are high, the scene lacks genuine pressure; the antagonist offers no meaningful counter-move or argument. The conflict resolves through a monologue and a prop hand-off rather than an escalated struggle, deflating the tension prematurely.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the global stakes are apocalyptic, the immediate scene conflict is low; the protagonist faces endurance rather than active opposition or dilemma. The escalation relies on the external clock (stars dying) rather than the protagonist's agency forcing a narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.5)
    Internal stakes are legible, but the conflict is low-voltage; Unit-7 faces no external opposition, and its internal compulsion to play the violin meets no resistance or fear. The resolution feels like an inevitable step in a ritual rather than a hard-won triumph over conflicting impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.6)
    Conflict is largely internal and lacks a sharp escalatory turn; the transition from observation to connection is linear and gentle. The "mistrust" is established as a premise but dissolves almost instantly upon contact, missing an opportunity for a meaningful testing of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are clear and personal; Esther's choice to sacrifice her mystique to save Elena's agency represents a meaningful cost. The conflict is resolved through a low-pressure conversation, which fits the tone but lacks visceral urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.2)
    Escalation is virtually absent; the experiment proceeds exactly as predicted, the creatures behave as expected, and the antagonist is not present. Without an on-page reversal, obstacle, or tightening of options, the story reads as a vignette of a successful procedure rather than a narrative with genuine stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.1)
    The narrative lacks active resistance; the environment provides atmosphere rather than obstacles, and the discovery feels inevitable. There is no moment where Clara must make a difficult trade-off or face a genuine risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    Internal pressure is tangible, escalating from physical fever to the weight of prophetic choice. The trade-off—loyalty to the Consortium versus the integrity of the "margin"—is stark, though the cost remains primarily internal ("private weight"), keeping this just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes are high and personal, but the scene lacks immediate external pressure or active opposition. The discovery process is frictionless—he enters, looks, and finds—which keeps the tension primarily atmospheric rather than dramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is abstract and largely resolved prior to the narrative's start; Maren has already accepted her role and the nature of decay. There is no active opposition or escalation of pressure on the page, resulting in a "Day in the Life" stasis where the stakes (crumbling vs. witnessing) are meditated upon rather than tested by a new crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is low-stakes; Maya's fear is articulated clearly and immediately soothed by Elena's speech and gift. There is no resistance or complication to test Elena's goal, resulting in a "perfect emotional calibration" that lacks dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=4.2)
    Dramatic tension is virtually absent; the environment actively cooperates with the protagonist ("walls hummed approval"), and there is no antagonist, time limit, or risk of failure. Without pressure or cost, the stakes regarding the "displaced axis" remain abstract and theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.5)
    The internal conflict between hoarding secrets and releasing them is resolved with a tangible cost—giving up the last artifact of her old life. The stakes feel personal and significant, though the external pressure remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes are high (soul and reality), and the pressure is coherent, but the conflict remains largely abstract and rhetorical. The entity is defeated somewhat easily by a philosophical reframing, lacking a sense of gritty, desperate struggle that the physical "three minutes" constraint promised.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are clearly defined as a tension between physical limitation (exhaustion) and spiritual necessity. The escalation is subtle but effective, using the encroaching dawn and the protagonist's fatigue to create a window of urgency. The resolution feels earned, with the "cost" paid in the finality of the fortune and the physical toll of the ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.9)
    Stakes remain largely philosophical, lacking immediate external pressure or a forced trade-off; the storm provides atmosphere but not urgency. The resolution—simply accepting her nature—comes too easily, dissolving the tension without a felt sacrifice or escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=4.5)
    Escalation is minimal; there is no significant resistance or reversal once Marina enters the cavern. The conflict is purely internal and dissolves almost instantly upon contact with the drum and needle, lacking the pressure or "tightening" required for a high-stakes literary narrative. The protagonist does not have to make a trade-off or difficult choice to achieve her goal.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are clear (truth vs. safety), but the immediate pressure is retrospective (the follower is a memory) rather than active in the courtyard. The conflict is primarily internal processing of external data. While the deepening of the mystery works, the lack of an immediate, on-page obstacle limits the visceral tension of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict is virtually absent; Maren faces no external opposition, and her internal "aromatic caution" is overcome instantly without a visible cost or trade-off. The narrative lacks a moment of doubt or escalation, proceeding smoothly from arrival to epiphany without testing the protagonist's commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=3.8)
    There is no tangible conflict or escalation; the stakes remain purely philosophical and are discussed rather than tested. The visitor challenges Marcus once ("ethically playful"), but he accepts the label and she accepts his explanation, instantly deflating potential tension. No path is foreclosed, and no price is paid for his perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.1)
    Internal stakes are high and the conflict with the environment is coherent. The pressure is largely atmospheric; while the internal shift is earned, the external stakes (survival, reputation) remain low intensity. The cost is legible—the surrender of her old musical perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.7)
    Escalation is mild; the protagonist seeks a goal and achieves it without significant opposition or unforeseen trade-offs. The potential danger of the "vast" grief is immediately mitigated by the chemist's benevolent message, deflating the pressure at the pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=3.0)
    There is no on-page escalation or active opposition; obstacles like the Historical Society are overcome in summary via Marina's "influence." The protagonist succeeds without paying a visible price, resulting in a low-stakes narrative with no resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes remain low and abstract; the "vandalism" is immediately reframed as a benign cry for help, removing potential antagonistic pressure. The search unfolds as a "ritual" without significant obstacles or trade-offs, leading to a soft resolution where success is achieved through persistence rather than a forced, painful choice.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—completeness versus safety—is tightened by the tangible price of the pendant. The protagonist forecloses her own future to achieve the release, ensuring the resolution is earned through sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.3)
    The stakes are established early (sanity/closure vs. grief), and the ritual provides a clear pressure point. The resolution comes too easily; the protagonist accepts the entity's explanation and shifts to optimism without a significant on-page struggle or cost at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict is minimal and stakes are low; Maren faces no external threat or difficult trade-off. The "cost" of leaving the letter is framed as a benevolent gift devoid of risk, resulting in a cozy resolution without palpable tension.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    The conflict is internalized but dramatized effectively through physical symptoms (bark-like patches, lack of hunger). The stakes are raised from mere medical concern to existential identity ("What am I becoming?"). The resolution feels earned, though the moment of surrender is relatively swift; the cost of "old boundaries" washing away is palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.1)
    Conflict is primarily internal and abstract ("searching for meaning"). The external obstacle—walking across the causeway—offers little resistance or cost. The resolution arrives via external convergence (finding the object and the man) rather than through a high-pressure choice that forces the protagonist to sacrifice or change tactics. The stakes feel declared rather than tested under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are established early (loss of livelihood/identity), but the escalation falters when the "shadows" reveal themselves to be benevolent witnesses, removing the primary antagonist pressure. The resolution frames the loss of future-sight entirely as a gain, missing the opportunity for a felt, ambivalent cost.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is retrospective; the opposing council is gone, and the protagonist's work proceeds without obstruction, risk, or opposition. The narrative lacks a high-stakes moment where the character must face a difficult trade-off or active resistance to achieve her goal.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake (discovery vs. ignorance) is clear, but the escalation is minimal; the environment cooperates (mist parts, cracks appear) rather than opposing the protagonist. The "Dare" moment functions as a threshold crossing, but the cost of leaving her "comfortable ignorance" is stated rather than viscerally felt in the moment of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are clear, but the obstacle is low; the protagonist faces little opposition beyond initial doubt, and the "cost" of the resolution is merely tears and time. A sharper trade-off or harder choice would elevate the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.8)
    The central conflict lacks active opposition; the other immortals are passive participants, and the "mutiny" is an environmental event rather than an antagonist. Tension is diffused by summarizing the "intrigue" beat, making the escape feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are clearly established and felt; the pressure of the dying father and the weight of the stolen history create authentic tension. The escalation leads naturally to the transaction, with a visible emotional cost for both parties.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.0)
    The primary weakness. While the "town vs. silence" establishes a stakes framework, there is minimal active pressure or escalation on the page. Mei faces no obstacle to her ritual, and the "cost" of isolation is established rather than accrued or intensified during the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are high (survival vs. erasure) and the pressure escalates coherently as the threat becomes specific ("cleaning house"). However, the central conflict beat is passive (eavesdropping), postponing the protagonist's active engagement until the final conceptual repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes are clearly defined as a conflict between control and vulnerability. The escalation is effective, moving from impersonal voices to the protagonist's own suppressed history, forcing a crystallization of stance. The cost is felt in the dismantling of her "armor," though the antagonist (the truth) wins a bit easily.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are clear, but the escalation is dampened because the primary hurdle (uniting the factions) is resolved through the summary montage rather than on-page struggle. The "resistance" forms too smoothly, lacking the friction or setbacks that would generate genuine narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    The situational pressure of the approaching dawn and satellite grid creates a clear ticking clock. However, the protagonist's agency is largely procedural; she executes a pre-planned sequence rather than navigating a live, shifting dilemma on the page. The stakes are felt, but the lack of a difficult active choice limits the score.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the protagonist meets a technical obstacle with instant solutions and zero struggle. The time pressure acts as a fake stake that is acknowledged and then ignored without consequence, resulting in a narrative with no genuine escalation or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—truth vs. survival—is signaled early and tightened by the falcon's arrival and the closing ice window. The dialogue with Volkov effectively exteriorizes the risk, though the brevity of the scene limits the escalation of the secondary obstacle. The cost is felt and paid on the page as she steps into the dark.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.8)
    The stakes are high (survival/destruction), but the narrative lacks active resistance; the tuner’s success is a foregone conclusion, turning the plot into a procedural of euthanasia rather than a dramatic conflict. While the conceptual pressure of the "inevitable collapse" works atmospherically, the protagonist faces no obstacles that force a change in tactics or a hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clearly established (funding vs. ethics) and the discovery of the dead explorer escalates the pressure effectively. However, the resolution's impact is dampened by the ambiguity of the cost; because the mechanics of the vial imply she *did* succeed in preserving a memory, the claimed loss of professional standing feels structurally unverified on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.5)
    The stakes are high and clear—sanity versus erasure. The confrontation with the "Hush" provides a solid escalation of pressure, forcing Milo to weaponize the very thing that cursed his father (belief/speech) to resolve the immediate threat.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.0)
    The external stakes are massive (ending eternal night), but the on-page conflict is low; the climax involves a simple ritual action without an antagonist, obstacle, or significant personal dilemma to overcome. Elias asks a question and presses the bead; the cost (losing Maren) is accepted too easily, missing an opportunity for tension between his attachment to her and his duty to the world.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.2)
    The convergence of the three sleepwalkers provides a focal point for action, but the stakes remain abstract. Without active opposition from the "tradition" or a tangible risk of the thread breaking, the escalation is procedural and gentle rather than dramatically taut.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are theoretical rather than felt; there is no active opposition or possibility of failure on the page. Mira faces no difficult trade-offs; the environment welcomes her, the artifact waits to be fixed, and her skepticism folds instantly without consequence. The lack of escalation flattens the dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.2)
    Pressure is minimal; Vera faces no active opposition, difficult trade-offs, or time constraints that force a narrowing of options. The story relies on the declared stakes of the off-screen refugee rather than on-page escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are high and clear, but the immediate conflict relies heavily on the "arrogant villain ignores servant" trope, which lowers active opposition pressure. The protagonist navigates the scene with relatively low friction, as the antagonists are passive obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stakes are intimate and clearly defined, escalating from passive waiting to an active confrontation with the past. The cost of the resolution—admitting a twenty-year wrong—is felt on the page, though the escalation is driven more by the spirits than Celeste's own actions.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are intimate yet high; the tension between "remembering wrong" and the "blade" of truth drives the scene. The climax—altering the girl's message from a warning to a comfort—is a decisive tightening of the theme that resolves the central anxiety.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=5.1)
    Pressure is minimal; there is no external opposition or urgent time constraint, and the internal conflict resolves too smoothly to generate genuine stakes. The protagonist faces no difficult trade-offs, resulting in a lack of palpable tension or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are primarily internal and professional, but the pressure of the "unsolvable" panel provides sufficient narrative drive. The escalation moves methodically from technical attempts to a philosophical gamble, earning the breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes are high in concept but low in the scene; the antagonist is entirely abstract and off-stage. There is no immediate tightening of screws or interpersonal conflict to drive escalation, leaving the dramatic pressure flat.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.5)
    Escalation is minimal; the protagonist is safe, settled, and unchallenged in the present moment. The pressure is chronic (insomnia, memory) rather than acute, and the "war ending" elsewhere does not create a felt tightening of options or visible cost for Minerva tonight.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are emotionally high but narrative pressure is low; there is no active resistance or antagonist countering Mira's goal. The escalation is atmospheric rather than tactical—the ritual proceeds without a snag, failure risk, or forced trade-off. The climax feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle against opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.8)
    The stakes are clearly established (the imminent permanent divergence of their paths), creating a "now or never" pressure cooker. The conflict escalation is internal and relational, moving from silence to safe explanation to risky vulnerability. While the resolution comes relatively quickly, the emotional price paid—admitting cowardice and avoidance—is sufficiently felt to earn the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are clearly escalated from a personal mystery to a historical injustice with potential present-day consequences. The conflict resolves through a mature, complex choice (strategic silence over immediate exposure) rather than a simple victory. The cost—carrying the weight of the lie to ensure safety—is legible and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.0)
    The stakes of anonymity versus connection are clearly established and tested by Mira's question. The cost of the confession—the loss of safety—is felt, though the "blooming" resolution softens the blow somewhat quickly, reducing the lingering sense of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes (eternal exile vs. home) are clear and high. The conflict is primarily internal—Wren wrestling with the meaning of her drifting—which leads to a quiet but distinct escalation of understanding. The external pressure is static until the door opens, making the climax feel more like an unlocking than a confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.4)
    Conflict is minimal; the antagonist is the off-stage conference, and the on-stage interaction is devoid of tension. While the Accumulative lens allows for quiet deepening, the stakes of the immediate scene feel low—there is no risk of rejection or failure. The escalation relies entirely on the arrival of the fish rather than character agency or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are established via the fading memory, but the escalation is mild; the central obstacle is a lack of information, which is overcome instantly by the coincidental discovery of the seeds. The emotional cost is stated but feels somewhat unearned given how easily the external solution presented itself.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is negligible; the opponent is abstract boredom, and the "risk" of chaos is stated but not felt. The child's interruption is solved instantly with perfect competence, removing tension. The protagonist faces no hard choices or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are theoretically high (identity/memory) but practically low on the page, as Kira enters already desiring the transformation and fearing nothing. The stated cost—"never belong to the provinces again"—is something Kira already rejects, rendering the trade-off painless and the conflict minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (finding meaning before destruction) is clear, but the escalation is entirely internal and relatively low-pressure. The protagonist accepts the cost (the loss of the atrium) with a grace that minimizes tension. The resolution feels earned by the character's nature but lacks a sharp, foreclosing choice.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.5)
    The internal conflict is palpable, anchored by the physical weight of the box and the paralysis at the clearing. The resolution feels earned, though the turning point relies heavily on internal processing ("reflecting deeply") rather than an external complication forcing the hand.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.2)
    There is virtually no escalation or resistance; Marina enters, performs a ritual, and immediately receives the correct answer without setback, complication, or trade-off. The stakes are high in the abstract (a dying daughter), but the scene itself lacks pressure or a moment where failure seems possible, resulting in a flat narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes are theoretical rather than visceral; there is no ticking clock, antagonist, or risk of failure to generate pressure. The escalation is purely informational—Mira finds item A, then item B, then hears the sound—resulting in a "walking simulator" dynamic where the protagonist observes history but does not have to fight or sacrifice to retrieve it.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=4.2)
    There is a distinct lack of pressure or opposition; success is guaranteed from the start. The stakes are theoretical (the future of an unseen child) rather than immediate, and the protagonist pays no on-page price for her magic, resulting in a flat dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake (peace) is clear, but the escalation is mild; the opposition from the generals dissolves after a single exchange of dialogue. While the conceptual cost (endurance) is legible, the lack of deeper on-page tactical friction or a harder choice for Elara limits the sense of rising pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—preserving a legacy against oblivion—is clear, and the sacrifice of the valuable egg provides a tangible on-page cost. However, the conflict is primarily internal and retrospective; the external pressure (the storm) is atmospheric rather than an active opposition that forces difficult tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.8)
    Tension is low; the protagonist succeeds at her goal with "alarming serenity" and faces no active opposition or risk of failure. The harvest is a net gain without a visible, felt cost or trade-off on the page, which flattens the dramatic arc. The conflict is mostly backstory (refusal of marriage) rather than an urgent, unfolding pressure in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.1)
    The conflict is intellectual and relational, escalated effectively by the vulnerability of the puppet performance. The stakes are felt, though the resolution comes relatively easily once the puppets are introduced.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.6)
    The stakes (extinction/witness) are clear and the pressure of the timeline is felt. The conflict is largely internal and static (waiting for the inevitable), which works for the tone but limits dynamic tension; the cost is accepted rather than fought, leading to Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes (eternal forgetting) are high, and the shift from mechanical braiding to vocal performance offers a valid deepening of the conflict. However, the external pressure is static; the threat of the rope shattering is stated as a rule but never tested by a slip or complication on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.2)
    Tactical pressure is low; the storm serves as atmospheric framing rather than a forcing function that demands a trade-off or sacrifice. The conflict is internal and abstract (understanding vs. ignorance) and resolves smoothly without Mira facing significant opposition or the risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clear but low-pressure; success feels inevitable once the premise is established. The "interregnum" suggests danger that never manifests on the page to force a difficult choice. The primary conflict is intellectual, resolved through patience rather than sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.3)
    The central conflict dissolves rather than snaps; the antagonist (resentment) is overcome by a vision sequence rather than the protagonist's active struggle or sacrifice. The stakes are clear, but the lack of an on-page obstacle to the healing process lowers the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—recovering the lost dream—drives the narrative, and the ritual scene provides effective rising pressure. The resolution relies on an internal pivot (patience over possession) which works for the tone, though the cost of this renunciation is primarily conceptual rather than viscerally paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.3)
    While the stakes of losing generational knowledge are established, immediate scene pressure is low; the obstacles are merely physical (climbing) rather than antagonistic. The resolution comes through discovery rather than a hard choice or sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.5)
    Pressure is low throughout; there is no immediate threat, deadline, or antagonist to force Maren's hand. The "forbidden knowledge" carries no sense of danger, only responsibility, and Maren accepts it without significant hesitation or trade-off. The narrative lacks a tightening of options; she moves fluidly from confusion to acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes are declared high by the Time Traveler (death, loops) but feel low on the page because Mira meets no active resistance. The mountain yields to her first attempt at communication without exacting a visible price or forcing a difficult trade-off, making the victory feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.7)
    Pressure is low throughout; the external obstacle (the sister's resistance) dissolves immediately without a back-and-forth struggle or escalation. There is no moment where failure feels like a genuine possibility, and the "cost" of the Garden is stated abstractly rather than felt as an immediate threat to the protagonist's safety or goal.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=4.2)
    The protagonist faces no active opposition; the "deliberately tangled" knots yield immediately to her "practiced patience." There is no moment where failure seems possible, and the resolution comes without sacrifice or trade-off, resulting in very low dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.7)
    The external pressure (energy beings’ noise) is constant and effectively creates a survival-stakes atmosphere without needing a direct antagonist. The escalation through the "groaning" caves to the "spiral formation" keeps the tension tight. The stakes are personal sanity and professional identity, which feel significant and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the global stakes are high (civilization's rebirth), the on-page opposition is low; the conflict resolves primarily through running down stairs. The "guttering flame" creates artificial urgency, and the lack of a significant, paid cost for her neglect keeps the tension functional rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central conflict is effectively dramatized through the specific action of marking the stone, converting an abstract philosophical problem into a physical choice. However, the pressure remains largely internal and intellectual; the lack of external friction or immediate consequences keeps the stakes somewhat theoretical until the final conceptual shift.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.5)
    The external stakes collapse at the climax; the protagonist is supported by the mentor rather than forced to confront the void alone. The "faked death" reveal removes the primary obstacle without exacting a visible cost or forcing a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.7)
    The stakes of estrangement are clear, and the silence creates palpable pressure. However, the escalation is somewhat dampened by the neatness of the reconciliation; Elena’s shift to "teach me" feels slightly rushed, lowering the felt resistance. The cost is present in Mira's confession, but the interpersonal conflict resolves with relatively low friction.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.5)
    Pressure is coherent, driven by the environmental shift of the inversion. The stakes are internal and legible, though the resolution—choosing to wait—lacks a sharp, immediate cost on the page beyond the deferral of the difficult task.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.5)
    Conflict is minimal; there is no antagonist or significant external obstacle opposing Eris, and her internal state is resolved from the start. The narrative lacks the escalation of pressure or hard trade-offs typically required for higher-tier engagement; it reads more as a ritual enactment than a conflict-driven scene.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stakes are clearly defined (imperial succession vs. bureaucratic stagnation) and the sunrise provides urgency. However, the conflict is largely environmental and easily surmounted; the protagonist faces no active antagonism or difficult trade-offs, lowering the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.7)
    The stakes are clear—preservation of self vs. the duty to another—and the tension escalates logically. However, the conflict is resolved primarily through conversation rather than a costly action that tests Mira's resolve; the "cost" is the disturbance of her dust, which works thematically but feels light as a dramatic price for breaking a life-defining vow.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central conflict (internal pressure vs. identity) is clear, but the escalation is dampened by the protagonist's immediate mastery of the situation. The victory feels virtually costless on the page; she gains wealth (diamonds) and healing (resolved trauma) without a visible trade-off or moment of genuine peril, making the stakes feel theoretical rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=4.4)
    Stakes are low in the present moment as the protagonist faces no active opposition or internal doubt. The escalation is informational rather than dramatic; the revelation is delivered smoothly to a character ready to receive it.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the stakes are conceptually high (healing the sky), the immediate obstacle is negligible; the protagonist overcomes the central conflict by simply reading a paper and undressing. There is no active antagonism or difficult trade-off to test his resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.1)
    The conflict is entirely internal—hope versus cynicism—and escalates appropriately through the discovery of the button. However, the external pressure is negligible; no one challenges her, and there are no immediate consequences for her actions. The cost paid is abstract and emotional ("never stop being broken-hearted") rather than a forced trade-off in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=4.7)
    While external stakes are declared (history revision), the protagonist faces minimal resistance; obstacles are bypassed immediately via special skills or tools established in the moment. The ending lacks a felt price; victory is total, and the return to her cover job creates a sense of low risk rather than high tension.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.3)
    The conflict is primarily internal, pitting the protagonist's skill against a rising compulsion, but the opposition feels abstract and easily overcome. There is no moment where the plan falters or the stakes escalate to force a difficult trade-off; the tension remains low as competence leads directly to success without complication.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story lacks a distinct antagonist or obstacle; the "hush" arrives on schedule, and the protagonist faces no risk of failure. The climax provides a transformation without a trade-off, missing the "visible or felt cost" required for higher marks in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.0)
    The story lacks immediate on-page pressure or escalation. Mira faces no significant resistance or obstacles during her descent or retrieval; she simply arrives, finds the object, and has a realization. The conflict is entirely internal and resolved a bit too smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is zero active resistance or risk of failure on the page; the alchemical process is summarized ("Hours passed") and succeeds perfectly on the first attempt without struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake (Maren's purpose) faces little active opposition; the gorge poses no threat, and the resolution arrives via affirmation rather than struggle. The lack of a difficult trade-off or escalation of pressure results in a low-tension arc where the "ache" is resolved too tidily.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.6)
    Internal pressure and high stakes are sustained effectively as Elena decodes her environment. While the external threat (guards) is temporarily suspended, the conceptual urgency of solving the "mathematics of mercy" drives strong escalation to a clear stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.0)
    Conflict is virtually absent; there is no antagonist, time pressure, or significant obstacle preventing Mira from achieving her goal. The vendor is a helper rather than a hurdle, and the "cost" of the final choice is a lifestyle the protagonist had already embraced, rendering the stakes theoretical rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=4.5)
    Pressure is virtually non-existent. The ghost is "sad but not frightening," and the retrieval of the object requires no effort or overcoming of resistance. Without an antagonist, a difficult trade-off, or a constraint on Miriam's ability to help, the stakes remain abstract and the resolution feels automatic.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stakes are high—the destruction of a world—and the escalation is handled well through the ritual of the press. However, the conflict is largely external (Maren vs. the system) with minimal active opposition or difficult trade-offs on the page; she reads the sign and obeys it without hitting a moment of doubt or obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.6)
    While there is a clear turning point when Maren uncovers the mirror, the external pressure from the council remains abstract background noise. The personal stakes are lowered because Maren abandons a life she already views with disdain, making the final departure feel more like wish-fulfillment than a choice with heavy cost.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake (tethering the light before midnight) provides clear pressure. However, the pivotal reversal—the wilting due to dishonesty—is resolved almost instantly by Elias's internal correction. While the cost (giving up the hope of resurrection) is stated, the ease with which he overcomes the temptation lowers the narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.4)
    Conflict is muted; the protagonist faces no active opposition or significant internal doubt during the descent. The stakes—transcendence versus industrial drudgery—lack tension because the choice to stay is presented as an escape without a felt price or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes remain low as the external threat (storm) is resolved by coincidence and the internal struggle is solved by magic. There is no meaningful tightening of options or escalation; the character observes the slide rather than making a decision that carries risk.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes remain purely intellectual ("Why do flowers wait?"), lacking tangible risk or potential loss. The conflict is static; there is no antagonist or internal barrier preventing the solution, only a delay until Mira looks at the glass correctly. The resolution comes without sacrifice or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.2)
    Active conflict is absent in the present timeline; the protagonist faces no opposition from the environment or antagonists. The resolution is a parley with a willing participant, leaving the stakes theoretical rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.2)
    Escalation is absent; the protagonist moves from realization to total success without encountering an obstacle or paying a visible price. The dominant stake (village revival) faces no active resistance, resulting in a linear procedural rather than a dramatic arc with genuine pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes remain low and abstract; the conflict is purely a process of discovery with no active opposition or trade-off. Maren risks nothing—time, safety, or sanity—to achieve the revelation. The "window closing" is a constraint that generates mild urgency, but the lack of a "felt cost" makes the ending feel like a gift rather than an earned victory.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes remain largely theoretical; the antagonist (entropy/time) offers no active resistance on the page, and the "clock" generates little felt pressure. Maren’s sacrifice of the acorn cap provides a small moment of cost, but the absence of difficult trade-offs limits the dramatic impact.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are theoretical rather than visceral; while the concept of "Zero Hour" implies weight, there is no active opposition or risk of failure on the page. The protagonist faces no difficult trade-offs or temptations (e.g., to ring early, or fear of silence), making the escalation feel like a passive wait for a scheduled event rather than a rising conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist's struggle with the "indifferent universe" appears fully resolved before the scene begins. The narrative illustrates her existing peace rather than testing it with a new tightening of options or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.5)
    Pressure is low; the ghost’s arrival creates an expectation of release which Maren fulfills without hesitation or obstacle. The "weight" she accepts is stated abstractly rather than dramatized through a difficult trade-off or visible cost to her stamina/sanity in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.7)
    The stakes are high thematically but low in immediate dramatic pressure; Vera faces no active opposition, time constraint, or risk of failure in the moment. The escalation is intellectual and linear, lacking a moment where the outcome is truly in doubt or where a difficult trade-off is forced.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are low and escalation is minimal; the protagonist faces no real opposition, and the boy's protest ("It won't be the same") is easily soothed. The solution is applied "gently" without forcing a difficult trade-off or narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.4)
    External resistance is virtually absent; the environment, animals, and trees cooperate immediately without forcing trade-offs or tactical pivots. The narrative acts as a procedural success story rather than a conflict-driven drama, lowering tension.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict remains abstract and intellectual, lacking immediate pressure or active stakes for the protagonist. The central mystery is resolved instantly via intuition, removing the need for the character to navigate risk or make trade-offs. The escalation is flat, as the environment and peers offer no resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story operates under an Accumulative lens, where pressure comes from the vast scale of the devastation rather than acute antagonism. The "tightening" is procedural—the specific bird call determining the specific seed—which works beautifully for this mode, though it lacks the sharp foreclosure of options seen in higher-stakes causal designs.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are clear and personal, driving the closure effectively. However, the lack of external friction or internal doubt during the riddle-solving phase keeps the immediate pressure relatively low until the final decision.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.4)
    The conflict between the hope of rescue and the commitment to her purpose is compelling and well-escalated by the ship's arrival. The stakes feel personal and significant. However, the confusion regarding the speed of the ship (due to the physics flaws) dampens the tension—it is unclear if she has seconds or days to finish her sketch before the ship arrives.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes are declared (master's life) but not felt, as the obstacle is a puzzle Corwin solves easily without trade-offs. The ending resolves all tension perfectly—the master lives and validates the theft—leaving the protagonist with no price paid for his victory.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.4)
    The stakes are deeply personal and clearly defined: the preservation of truth against erasure. The pressure builds coherently from the "purgatory" of her job to the decision to leave, though the external cost of losing her position is more implied than immediate on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.2)
    The internal conflict between the safety of forgetting and the pain of belonging is well-staged. The escalation is driven by Vera's changing relationship to the artifacts (stone and feather). The cost is clearly established as physical and emotional pain, satisfying the requirement for a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central conflict is clear, but the external obstacles—decoding the tapestry and walking the maze—offer little resistance, functioning more as ritual than struggle. The pressure remains largely atmospheric until the final sacrifice, lacking a moment where failure seems like a genuine possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are clearly defined, but the on-page opposition is somewhat abstract. The Elders appear as a collective voice that is easily "dissolved" by the protagonist's action, resulting in a climax that feels low-resistance. The victory is achieved without a visible trade-off or escalation of immediate danger, making the conflict feel slightly smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.6)
    The stakes are clear—dissolution vs. survival—and escalate appropriately as the sea surges. The cost is emotional (reliving the daughter's death), which lands well. The external conflict is resolved by the internal breakthrough in a way that feels coherent for the genre, though the "magic fixes the structure" ending slightly lowers the sense of grit.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.3)
    Internal pressure is excellent; the mirror crack serves as a sharp inciting incident that immediately raises the stakes of his artistic stagnation. The conflict is quieter—internal endurance against grief—but the cost is felt in the intensity of the painting scene and the emotional reconfiguration at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.6)
    Conflict is minimal; the boy arrives seeking help and accepts it without complication, missing an opportunity for escalation or resistance. The stakes remain thematic rather than urgent, resulting in a smooth but tension-light resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are clear, pitting the protagonist against entropy and grief with visible physical labor ("hands raw"). While the external pressure of rising waters remains somewhat background, the internal pressure to complete the beacon effectively drives the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are clearly established early: psychological safety vs. the risk of execution. The tension escalates naturally as Maren unwraps the package, moving from passive endurance to active, dangerous transgression. The cost of the choice is acknowledged ("execution," "dangerous work"), giving the final relief significant weight.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story maintains a coherent, quiet pressure that escalates from intellectual curiosity to a burden of moral responsibility. While the external conflict is subtle, the internal shift—accepting the weight of the stranger's grief and breaking his own isolation—provides a legible felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.6)
    The central conflict between obsession and reality is well-escalated by the physical threat of the water. The final cost—giving up her established life and business—is high and clearly felt, satisfying the requirement for a meaningful tightening of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.1)
    The central stake—the Queen's need for truth versus her fear of complicity—is clear and escalates effectively during the climb and dialogue. The resolution earns its weight by forcing her to confront her own "cowardice" before she can confront the external antagonist. The cost of admission is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake (capturing presence) is signaled early and resolves with a tangible cost—Mira giving up the object of her three-year obsession. While the conflict is primarily philosophical dialogue, the physical price paid at the end validates the internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes are existential and high, but the on-page escalation is purely internal. The conflict resolves through a shift in perspective rather than a forced trade-off or external pressure, fitting the quiet mode but limiting on-page tension.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.3)
    Escalation is minimal; the central obstacle (the rusted screw) is overcome immediately by Elena's expertise without setback or difficult choice. The lack of a "meaningful tightening" or visible cost reduces the narrative to a transaction rather than a dramatic event.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clearly defined and felt, moving effectively from paralyzing fear to active transformation. The pressure is coherent under the Situational lens, though the cost remains largely internal and aesthetic rather than a heavy external price.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.6)
    While the ticking clock provides urgency, the central conflict lacks active resistance; the demon is extracted passively once the machine is activated. There is no moment where the plan fails or requires a painful adaptation, resulting in a low-stakes climax despite the stated risks.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are cosmic in scale but negligible in dramatic pressure; the protagonist faces no antagonist, internal doubt, or physical obstacle that forces a trade-off. The progression is smooth and ceremonial, lacking the tightening of options or the "felt cost" required to generate narrative heat; the illusions yield to the dictionary without a fight.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation is present as the environment reacts to the countdown, but the narrative lacks significant opposition or oscillation; Einar faces no external threat or internal counter-argument once he begins. The stakes are high conceptually, but the linear progression to the climax reduces the felt tension and the weight of the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.3)
    The stakes are internal but clearly defined: the risk of permanent emotional isolation versus the pain of engagement. The tension mounts quietly as Maya probes the barriers, paralleling her own defenses. While the external pressure is low, the emotional cost of the resolution—accepting the burden of the "familiar strangers"—is legible and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake is intellectual understanding; the tangible stake of the gambling debt is dismissed too easily ("this she had already decided"), deflating potential tension. The escalation leads to a valid conceptual realization, but the pressure remains low.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.6)
    The emotional stakes are high (profound grief), but the conflict lacks resistance; the caller yields to Vera's wisdom with minimal struggle, reducing the dramatic tension. The "cost" is largely static (Vera's ongoing isolation) rather than acute to this specific scene.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story lacks a dominant stake tested by active opposition; the Keeper validates Marguerite immediately, and she surrenders the locket without hesitation or visible cost. The absence of a difficult choice or a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt flattens the dramatic tension significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from a physical delivery task to an existential choice about identity and isolation. The pressure is coherent, forcing Maya to confront the very thing she has spent fifteen years fleeing.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes escalate effectively from the difficulty of the mapmaking to the terrifying reality of the destination. The cost—the "terrifying moment" of absolute emptiness—is visceral, forcing a clear choice between pain and numbness.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are massive (the fate of a civilization) yet grounded in personal redemption. The pressure escalates cleanly from the arrival of the signal to the immediate need for a response. While the resolution is earned, the "cost" is primarily conceptual (living with uncertainty) rather than an acute on-page sacrifice, which keeps the tension just below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.2)
    Escalation is weak; the story relies on a "help me" request followed by immediate compliance and success, lacking a meaningful reversal or moment of doubt. The conflict is entirely external (the off-page council), while the on-page scene proceeds without testing the characters' commitment or forcing a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.0)
    Escalation is minimal; the protagonist faces no active opposition, time pressure, or difficult choices within the scene. The narrative is a linear tour from entry to revelation to acceptance, with the vandalism offering a hint of conflict that is never manifested or confronted.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.1)
    The stakes are intensely personal and internal, focusing on the release of a loved one's consciousness. While external pressure (guards/protocol) is low, the emotional pressure of the fleeting connection drives the escalation effectively toward the release.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.7)
    Pressure is low; the storm functions as atmospheric coloring rather than an active antagonist or ticking clock that forces hard choices. The stakes remain abstract (finding a legacy), and the characters achieve their goal without significant sacrifice, risk of failure, or escalation of danger.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.3)
    The stakes are high (life/death), and the tension is palpable. The escalation is somewhat soft; the conflict resolves relatively easily via the light display without a moment of acute doubt or resistance from the boy that forces a harder trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.2)
    On-page stakes are minimal; Eleanor faces no immediate opposition, risk of discovery, or logistical failure during her task. While the conceptual stakes (the future of education) are high, the scene itself lacks a "tightening" moment where options narrow or costs rise. She meets no resistance from the environment or other characters, resulting in a flat tension curve.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are clear and personal: the pull of the deep versus the connection to Jonas. The cost of the transition is felt on the page through Jonas's resistance and Mira's necessary detachment.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.7)
    The stakes (sanity/compliance) are clear, and the drone pass offers a moment of external pressure. However, the conflict remains largely internal and the "mandate" feels like a standard dystopian trope rather than a unique pressure cooker.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is negligible; the antagonist is a distant, past administrative body, and the immediate physical setting offers no resistance. The "tremor of certainty" removes the stakes early, ensuring that the protagonist never faces a trade-off or a risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are existential and explicitly raised by Theo's warning that the change "might destroy everything you've built." Mira's active acceptance of this risk elevates the climax beyond a simple transaction.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.4)
    Conflict is internal and low-stakes; the primary obstacle is a lack of understanding which resolves largely through passive contemplation of the recordings. The narrative lacks a moment of difficult trade-off or active resistance; the epiphany arrives as a gift of the setting rather than a hard-won victory over genuine opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.1)
    While the stakes of grief are evident, the conflict is resolved through a smooth accumulation of successes (the growing community) rather than a specific high-pressure test. There is no moment where Elara's new purpose is genuinely threatened or where she must pay a visceral price for her healing.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are psychological and thematic: the client's desperate grasp for control versus the reality of systemic collapse. The tension escalates effectively as Vera dismantles his defenses with statistical data, forcing a visible change in his card selection strategy.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.8)
    The stakes are clear (madness/failure vs. success), but the escalation is primarily internal and expository. The protagonist overcomes the central obstacle—the trap of order—through a sudden intellectual realization rather than a graduated series of tactical failures or escalating costs.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (preserving hope) is clear, and the resolution requires a permanent loss (the stone). However, the pressure remains low throughout; the shadow is revealed to be non-malevolent early, and Vera faces little obstruction or doubt in executing her plan.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes are high historically (three wasted years), but the on-page pressure is low; Vera's resilience feels inevitable rather than forged in the moment. The conflict is largely retrospective, lacking an active counter-force in the workshop to test her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.8)
    The stakes are immediate and high—escape or undergo another surgery—and the pressure escalates cleanly when the brother confronts her. The choice to leave is a decisive action with clear costs (safety, normalcy), satisfying the drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are primarily atmospheric and thematic; while the deepening of the vision provides momentum, there is little active opposition or pressure forcing a difficult trade-off. The climax resolves through realization rather than a high-cost decision, leaving the narrative feeling low-voltage despite the emotional content.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.7)
    The dominant stake is high (creativity itself), but the opposition is abstract (a dead man's fear) and the solution is mechanical. The story lacks a moment of genuine trade-off or risk; Elara succeeds without paying a visible emotional or physical cost, keeping tension low.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.5)
    Pressure is low throughout; the anomaly presents a situation to be fixed rather than a conflict that threatens Mira's goals or safety. The protagonist creates the solution immediately upon encountering the problem, resulting in a flat tension arc without a meaningful tightening of options or a moment of genuine risk.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are clear and personal; the tension between holding onto her past (the gear) and embracing her new reality (healing the tree) creates a solid emotional conflict. The cost is paid on-page, though the moment of sacrifice could be intensified by prolonging the hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent; the guides act as facilitators who explain away potential tension, and the internal conflict (regret) is soothed rather than tested. There is no moment where Mira risks failure or has to sacrifice something to gain her courage, resulting in a flat trajectory with no meaningful escalation of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are binary, high, and legible: safety versus humanity. The escalation is effective, moving from a cryptic plea to a mechanical realization, and the final choice is a true dilemma where the protagonist must actively embrace danger to regain agency.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.0)
    The stakes are high for the kingdom but low for the protagonist in the moment; Mira encounters no active opposition within the library. The "shifting stars" provide a timer, but she beats it easily, and the discovery of the "misfiled" record feels convenient rather than earned through conflict. The tension is largely intellectual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.2)
    Stakes are clearly established—scientific truth versus family legacy—and escalate as the data overlay reveals the extent of the betrayal. The cost is palpable in Marina’s "trembling hands" and the weight of the "poison and silence" she must now voice. The climax offers a meaningful deepening of the central mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.0)
    Pressure is low throughout; the protagonist faces no active opposition, time crunch, or concrete obstacle beyond abstract doubt. The climax serves as a moment of reception rather than a decision made under duress, resulting in a flat escalation arc.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=3.7)
    Stakes are theoretical rather than felt; the "regime" is an absent antagonist. The scene lacks escalation or a moment of doubt—Mira arrives, sings, and succeeds in a straight line without paying a price or facing active opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.6)
    The hawk creates a clear, sharp spike in pressure that tests Mariam's stability. While the resolution via learned therapy techniques is logical, it feels slightly low-cost compared to a messy, forced trade-off or failure.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.3)
    The physical threat of the closing walls creates tangible stakes that force the protagonist to act. While the pressure is coherent, the resolution comes somewhat easily once the specific action (untangling) is performed, reducing the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative relies on retrospective stakes and internal obsession rather than immediate conflict. While the fading ink provides a mild time constraint (tightening), the protagonist faces no active antagonist or dilemma; she simply endures the phenomenon and succeeds. The pressure remains observational rather than testing her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes are high and legible, but the climax dissipates tension too quickly; the antagonist is neutralized the moment he enters, turning a potential confrontation into a brief logistical hurdle. The cost is stated but the immediate physical struggle is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.9)
    The internal conflict is resolved with a clear physical choice (sheathing the knife), but the external pressure is mild; the soldier is immediately presented as a "frightened boy," which lowers the stakes and risk of the encounter. A more ambiguous or threatening arrival would have heightened the cost of mercy.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.3)
    The stakes are intensely personal and clearly defined (the "splinter" of not knowing), creating immediate emotional pressure. The climax—trading the weight of unspoken feelings for the echo—presents a clear psychological cost and release, resolving the central tension effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake (global panic vs. ignorant peace) is clear and escalates appropriately with the discovery of the date. The pressure forces a defining choice, though the "journalist calling" acts more as a framing device than an active, on-page antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.2)
    Internal stakes are high and clearly dramatized through the "dissonance" of the bloodline. The escalation is procedural and emotional; while effective, the external pressure is relatively low, with the "fold" acting as a window rather than an active antagonist. The release at the end is palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.9)
    The pressure of the "emergent hush" provides a strong atmospheric antagonist. The conflict with the old man is resolved a bit too easily; his resistance melts after a single exchange, reducing the potential for higher interpersonal stakes. The internal escalation works, but the external opposition is soft.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure accumulates appropriately under the textural/accumulative lens, deepening from the artisan’s hope to the soldier’s tragedy. While the external stakes are low (no immediate threat), the emotional weight of the task provides sufficient momentum for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.3)
    Escalation is purely additive (one echo becomes many) rather than pressure-based. Madeline faces no risk of failure or cost for her magic, and the antagonist force (despair) offers no active resistance, resulting in low tension.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from a personal experiment to a conspiracy thriller, with the cost of the "recall" adding background pressure. The conflict is primarily man-vs-environment/puzzle in this scene; a more active obstacle or cost during the search itself would have heightened the immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=3.9)
    The story lacks meaningful opposition or tension; the unknown is immediately benevolent, and the protagonist faces no resistance or risk. Without escalation or a moment where success is in doubt, the narrative feels like a static vignette rather than a dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent on the page; Marlowe faces no setbacks, resistance, or time pressure while collecting the buttons. The "Forgetting" is an abstract global stake that fails to exert immediate, concrete force on the scene's action.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are established early and escalate from a puzzle to a life-altering confrontation. While the external opposition is low (Viktor is dying and compliant), the internal pressure of the decision—whether to re-engage with the world that burned her—sustains tension. The cost is felt in the weight of the folder and the refusal to grant the requested emotional peace.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are clear—safety and truth—but the immediate physical peril is mitigated by the Coachman's high competence, lowering tension. The conflict is largely thematic (truth vs. erasure) rather than an urgent clash of opposing forces on the boat. The "ticking gutters" provide necessary structural pressure, preventing the scene from feeling static.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.7)
    The conflict is primarily intellectual and atmospheric; the "fractured timelines" are a high-concept stake that feels distant from immediate danger. The escalation is linear and low-pressure, leading to a contemplative rather than visceral climax.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.9)
    The conflict is quiet but coherent; the internal struggle with loss creates sufficient pressure to make the external gesture of connection meaningful. While the stakes are low-key, the emotional cost of vulnerability ("held breath before a confession") is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.8)
    The stakes are high in concept (extinction vs. creation) but low in execution, as the protagonist faces no opposition or risk of failure during the ritual. The escalation is linear—she descends, places the object, and succeeds—lacking the friction or tightening options required for higher tension.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.6)
    The stakes are successfully internalized, focusing on artistic and emotional integrity. While the conflict is quiet, the pressure of years of "mechanical" writing provides sufficient weight to make the decision to write for herself feel significant.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dual pressure of the supernatural signal and the physical mob creates a clear ticking clock. However, the antagonists remain somewhat abstract or walled-off, and the conflict dissolves too cleanly once the protagonist executes her plan.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake (discovery vs. fear) is clear, and the tunnel sequence provides a necessary pressure point. However, the protagonist's victory is nearly total and the cost—brief panic—feels relatively light for the weight of the "spatial mutiny" concept. The obstacles yield too readily to competence, lowering the perceived risk.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes escalate internally from an artistic exercise to a burden of moral knowledge. The cost is felt in the resignation that legal justice is impossible, replaced by the weight of solitary remembrance.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is negligible; Commander Torres acts as a straw man who capitulates instantly to Mira's evidence without testing her resolve. There is no meaningful escalation or tightening of options; the protagonist succeeds simply by showing up and presenting the solution.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes of abandoning a settled life for a lost dream are clear, and the prompt's disappearance serves as a solid inciting incident. However, the escalation is dampened because the magical vision guarantees the outcome (the cabin is waiting), lowering the perceived risk. The cost is present (leaving her fiddling life) but softened by the convenience of the solution.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.0)
    The stakes transition smoothly from financial success to relational reckoning. Elias’s agency is subtle but present in his refusal to "stomach" pivot strategies, framing the business failure as a choice of integrity that leads him back to the train. The pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=4.1)
    Stakes remain theoretical with no immediate on-page threat or time pressure to force a trade-off. Mira faces no external resistance or internal temptation to abandon the task, resulting in a flat trajectory where success is granted rather than won.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are established early, but the escalation is linear; the protagonist uses her pre-selected tool and succeeds without facing a new, unexpected complication that forces a fresh choice. The conflict is resolved through realization rather than a decision that carries an immediate, visible price on the page. The external threat of the vortex remains largely atmospheric once the seed is planted.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story operates under a Situational lens, where the gathering forces a stance crystallization. While the internal realization is earned, the external conflict is minimal; the ritual succeeds without distinct opposition or failure states, reducing the feeling of pressure or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.5)
    The central conflict is present, but the negotiation lacks significant friction; the protagonist accepts the antagonist's high price immediately (&quot;I accept&quot;) without oscillating or struggling, which flattens the dramatic tension of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.2)
    The internal stakes are clear, but the external conflict is low-pressure. Val acts more as a therapist than an obstacle or distinct force; the scene resolves through a shared understanding rather than a pressure-tested choice or confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.8)
    Escalation is mild, as the protagonist faces no external opposition or significant internal hesitation before achieving her goal. The warned cost ("what you can afford to lose") is not dramatized as a difficult trade-off on the page, resulting in a smooth but low-tension narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.7)
    Conflict is primarily philosophical and low-stakes; the fisherman serves as a gentle prompt rather than an opposing force. The resolution comes through assertion in dialogue rather than a pressured tactical choice or sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.1)
    The stakes are clear and the pressure builds coherently through the environment. However, the risk of rejection—the primary cost of the climax—is negated instantly by the husband's reply. The ease of this resolution undercuts the accumulated weight of the "walls" metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes—sanity versus suppression—are established early. While the internal pressure is evident, the external conflict is minimal; the station offers little resistance, and the resolution comes through reflection rather than a high-cost active choice in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are clearly established as emotional survival, anchored by the seventeen-year wait. The tension escalates through the deciphering of the watch, leading to a meaningful confrontation with the past. While the antagonist (Marcus) is off-page, his presence acts as a functional pressure point that sharpens the protagonist's current choices.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes are clearly defined: personal safety versus cultural erasure. The escalation is driven by the fading magical contract, and the resolution forces a trade-off that accepts high personal cost for a broader victory.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the stakes (preserving a soul) are high, the on-page conflict is strictly environmental and overcome by concentration rather than sacrifice. The lack of a live option to foreclose or a visible trade-off makes the victory feel inevitable and unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes are primarily philosophical; while the internal question is clear, external resistance is minimal as Theron complies easily with the ritual. The story lacks a moment of high pressure or a trade-off where Mira must pay a visible cost to gain her insight, resulting in a gentle but low-tension arc.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are legible—Sera's guilt vs. permission—but the conflict resolves with limited resistance. Sera accepts the reframing ("Is that selfish?" -> "Keep it") without a deeper struggle or a cost that forces the Keeper to improvise, making the victory feel slightly inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are high in concept (a village erased), but the on-page tension is low; the scene is a cooperative master-student interaction with no immediate obstruction or reversal other than the intellectual difficulty of the lesson. The pressure relies largely on Elowen's ticking clock (aging backward), which adds necessary urgency to an otherwise static teaching moment.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is minimal; nature acts as a tool rather than an antagonist, and the "wanderer" responds instantly to the call without complication. The narrative lacks a meaningful tightening of pressure; the transition from waiting to meeting feels inevitable rather than earned through specific on-page agency or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—defining one's value in an automated world—is signaled early and resolved clearly. While the internal conflict is well-defined, the external antagonism (the automatons) remains abstract, limiting the immediate pressure. The climb provides necessary resistance, but the cost of the final choice is primarily philosophical rather than tangibly felt in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes are primarily internal and abstract (knowledge vs. ignorance), lacking immediate external pressure or active opposition. Marcus navigates the ship without physical difficulty, and his decision to open the vial feels inevitable rather than contested. The cost is stated ("terrible and true") but remains an internal realization rather than a dramatized consequence in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.3)
    The stakes—existence versus annihilation—are high, and the internal tension of doubt drives the scene. The escalation relies heavily on a second casting of lots rather than a more complex deepening of complications, but the resolution lands with appropriate conceptual weight for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=5.8)
    Tension is low; the protagonist faces no external resistance and minimal internal resistance in performing the healing ritual. The "tightening" is merely the decision to speak, and the resolution arrives without a visible cost or risk of failure on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.4)
    The cosmic stakes are high (the end of reality's flow), but the immediate, on-page pressure is low; the viaduct is "indifferent" rather than antagonistic. The conflict is resolved through "patient determination" without a visceral trade-off or a moment where failure feels imminent and terrifying. The cost remains largely theoretical ("brittle devotion") rather than explicitly paid in the text.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes of personal narrative versus truth are well-defined and the internal pressure is legible. However, the escalation relies entirely on the physically impossible clues, which weakens the "earned" nature of the realization.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are declared ("become nothing at all") but never tested on the page; the ritual proceeds without obstacle or error. The potential cost of losing the mother's crystal is explicitly dismissed by the narrator, deflating the tension and leaving the escalation feeling flat.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes are clearly established (lives vs. trust), and the pressure escalates logically through the data anomalies. The fallout, however, is minimized ("inconvenience but no casualties"), which reduces the felt cost of the protagonist's difficult decision.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are clear (the brain's fate), but escalation is minimal; the characters move from argument to agreement largely because Kira tells them to. The scene lacks a "tightening" beat where the clones try and fail to get their way, resulting in a conflict that feels theoretical rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.2)
    The stakes (artistic integrity vs. corporate buyout) are established early and clearly. However, the antagonist (Magnus) is purely abstract, and Vera's rejection of the life-changing money lacks a moment of visceral hesitation or felt cost, making the victory feel somewhat easy.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.1)
    The pressure is primarily internal but externalized well through the "off-key wind" and the acoustic resistance. The climax forces a trade-off: Victor abandons the safety of silence or written apologies for the vulnerable, raw act of singing. The cost is felt in the physical toll of the "maceration" and the weeping.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake (isolation vs. connection) is clear, but the external pressure is low as the "intruder" is helpless. The resolution comes easily through conversation rather than a high-stakes test of the protagonist's resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are established early and are high. The on-page conflict (the negotiation with the metal) is engaging but lacks high-pressure resistance; the success feels slightly smooth and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.3)
    The central conflict is clear and resolved through the protagonist's specific actions, adhering to the "man vs. machine" dynamic. However, the stakes remain intellectual and thematic; the cost of failure is not viscerally felt on the page, keeping the tension moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes are clearly established (existential entrapment), and the final cost (physical/metaphysical splitting) is severe. However, the escalation is somewhat flat; Mara faces little active resistance or complication during the ritual itself, proceeding smoothly from realization to execution.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes are high and clearly defined: "claim it or be claimed." The escalation through the shifting rooms to the mirror gallery forces a decisive action (weaving), and the cost is legible: she trades the illusion of total control for a negotiated, tension-filled peace.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.4)
    The internal stakes (rigid human knowledge vs. fluid alien perception) are clear and resolve effectively. However, the external conflict is low-pressure; the mentor figure is gentle and accommodating, lacking friction. The escalation is intellectual rather than visceral, which fits the tone but limits the sense of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is negligible; the ghost appears on command, the technology works perfectly, and the grieving woman accepts the resolution immediately. There is no escalation, obstacle, or moment where the outcome is in doubt, leading to a lack of narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.6)
    The stakes (memory vs. oblivion) are clear and the tidal pressure provides a functional countdown. The conflict remains largely external and linear; the escalation comes from endurance rather than a complex deepening of the problem, but the cost is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.2)
    Escalation is linear and lacks significant pressure; the protagonist encounters no resistance from the ghost, the ink, or the environment. The victory feels inevitable rather than earned through a high-stakes decision or a moment of genuine risk.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=4.8)
    Escalation is linear and low-pressure; the environment, the tool, and the birds all align to assist the protagonist. There is no moment where the outcome is in doubt or where the protagonist must trade one value for another.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are primarily internal (Maren's soul/legacy) but are externalized effectively through the gravity phenomenon. The cost is conceptual—sacrificing "spectacular vindication" for "patient devotion"—and is legible, though the external pressure dissolves somewhat gently once the recording ends.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.5)
    The physical threat (statue climbing) provides clear initial pressure. However, the climax lacks a felt cost; the antagonist simply breaks upon hearing "genuine feeling," dissolving the tension without forcing Mira to make a difficult sacrifice or endure a painful consequence. The stakes are high (recalibration), but the victory comes too easily.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are declared rather than tested; while the context of the drone border implies danger, the scene itself lacks immediate opposition or a difficult trade-off. The transaction proceeds smoothly, missing an opportunity for a meaningful tightening or escalation of risk on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=3.9)
    Stakes are internal and clearly defined (silence vs. voice), but the escalation is weak; the protagonist faces no significant setbacks or external opposition. The resolution comes too easily via the magical properties of the halo and the convenient record, removing the need for a costly trade-off or genuine sacrifice. The pressure dissipates rather than snapping.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is minimal; Eleanor faces no antagonists, time crunches, or risks of failure, resulting in low narrative tension. The escalation is purely atmospheric—the environment becomes stranger—without forcing the protagonist to make a difficult choice or pay a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are clearly established and escalate as the dream fades, creating genuine time pressure. The fog serves as a tangible final obstacle, though the resolution comes more from persistence than a distinct tactical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.8)
    The antagonist (the nexus/lock) offers only token resistance ("trying to disorient her") which is overcome in a single paragraph without visible cost or tactical pivot. The escalation is linear and low-friction, lacking a moment where the protagonist's goal is genuinely imperiled.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.4)
    The stakes are high and personal, escalating from the confusion of the lecture hall to the desperate excavation in the greenhouse. The revelation that the memories were hidden for protection, rather than lost to accident, deepens the conflict effectively. The antagonist—the "hungry forgetting"—remains somewhat abstract, functioning more as a condition than an active pressure in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.4)
    Thessaly acts as an effective crucible, forcing Mira to sharpen her vague desire into a concrete, costly stance ("combative tenderness"). The escalation is quiet but decisive, fitting the introspective scope.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.1)
    The conflict is Man vs. Entropy, but the antagonist (fading magic) offers little active resistance; Marek identifies the solution and executes it without failure or meaningful cost. The "price" paid is summarized time and weeping, which lacks immediate narrative weight or a sense of sacrifice in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.3)
    The stakes are clear, but the escalation is linear and lacks strong resistance; Callum yields his secret easily, and Mira’s internal obstacle dissolves via summary. The cost is stated ("words cost her more than she expected") but not fully felt in the moment of release.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.4)
    Escalation is managed well through the video comparison, moving from subtle pigment changes to impossible movement. The conflict between the Council's technical demands and Elena's empathetic intuition provides a solid frame for the internal stakes. The cost is felt in the menacing attention the chapel turns upon her.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=5.8)
    Pressure is low throughout; the dive proceeds without physical danger, time constraints, or significant obstacles beyond "untangling threads." The dominant stake is purely internal (understanding grief), and the resolution feels unearned, arriving immediately upon reading the log without a forcing choice or trade-off. The climax lacks a sense of tightening options.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.2)
    Conflict is largely external and static; the ghost asks for help, and Mira provides it without encountering significant resistance or failure. The storm acts as atmospheric set-dressing rather than a pressure mechanism that forces a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.2)
    Tension is low throughout; the primary obstacle is merely the time it takes to ascend, with no antagonist or internal resistance creating genuine doubt. The climax lacks a "meaningful tightening" or reversal—Mira simply follows the diary's prompt, and the conflict resolves instantly without a visible price paid by either character.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.1)
    Escalation is present but subtle, tracking the storm's intensity. The stakes remain largely abstract (memory vs. oblivion) without immediate physical pressure or a sense of dwindling resources to force a tactical change.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ticking clock of the demolition creates functional pressure, but the antagonist (the crew) remains abstract and distant. The conflict is largely atmospheric; while the stakes are clear, the final choice to leave feels inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are low; Elara is safe, sheltered, and comfortable, removing urgency from the narrative. The central conflict is an intellectual puzzle solved without sacrifice, trade-off, or risk. The "escalation" is merely a progression of discovery, lacking a meaningful tightening of options or a felt price for success.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.9)
    The stakes are clear—preserving the mentor's legacy and fixing time—and the mirrors successfully raise the pressure by showing potential failure states. The climax involves a distinct choice with a felt risk (uncapping the vial), though the resolution comes a bit too easily once the choice is made.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; the "thirst" of the grove is a logistical hurdle solved immediately by following instructions, not a source of genuine tension. There is no escalation of pressure; the characters face no dilemma where two values collide, resulting in a flat narrative trajectory devoid of earned stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.7)
    While the stakes are high, the resolution leans on "symmetric satisfaction"—Mira achieves her personal goal (the lullaby) and salvation arrives as a "consequence" without a forced trade-off. The lack of a hard choice or visible cost to the protagonist weakens the dramatic pressure at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are clear and immediate: the travelers' lives against the encroaching frost and aggressive automata. The escalation works well, particularly the turn where the birds' aggression is redirected by the nuts. The resolution feels slightly swift, but the conceptual cost—Maren's permanent tethering to this duty—is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.4)
    Tension is low; the breakthrough arrives too smoothly after the initial insight without a moment where the new theory fails or demands a painful trade-off. The conflict is resolved through steady progress rather than a decisive, high-stakes choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=4.8)
    Tension is low; the "glimmering parole" establishes a constraint, but it never forces a trade-off or threatens failure in the scene. Vera's goal (to see a story begin) meets no resistance, resulting in a vignette that lacks the requisite tightening or escalation for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.9)
    The stakes are intensely personal and clearly escalated, moving from the broad burden of the curse to a specific, high-pressure choice at the coral pillar. The conflict avoids binary simplifications—she doesn't simply cure herself, but negotiates a difficult trade-off that carries a lasting, visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.5)
    Escalation is minimal; the elevators respond immediately to the protagonist's efforts without resistance or error. The dominant stake (community healing) remains abstract and isn't tested by a concrete threat, failure, or trade-off within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.2)
    Conflict is largely theoretical; the external world offers no resistance, and the internal transformation proceeds without a hitch. The lack of an antagonist or a concrete obstacle that forces a trade-off leaves the stakes feeling abstract despite the high conceptual scale.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.3)
    The ticking clock creates structural pressure, but the stakes feel abstract; Elara succeeds without facing active opposition or making a painful trade-off. The "sacrifice" of guardianship is stated conceptually rather than dramatized as a felt loss or difficulty on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.0)
    The conflict between the protagonist and the physical laws of her silent world is clear and escalates appropriately through her failures. The resolution is earned through specific observation and adaptation, though the final victory feels slightly smooth, lacking a sharper, grittier trade-off or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes are high conceptually (lost wisdom) but low in immediate scene execution; there is no active antagonist or environmental threat to force a difficult trade-off. The "next phase" acts as a clock, but Helena meets it comfortably. The conflict feels resolved before the story begins, as she already "regrets nothing" and faces no new test of that conviction.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.7)
    The conflict is resolved with relatively low resistance; the protagonist simply cycles through tuning forks until the lock opens. The internal hurdle of forgiveness is cleared via a sudden declaration rather than escalating pressure that forces a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.1)
    The stakes are clear but the conflict remains low-pressure; Mira endures the smell rather than having to make active tactical trade-offs during the wait. The forty-eight-hour clock adds some structure, but the primary struggle is internal and largely contemplative.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes are declared but never rigorously tested; the gravity inversion acts as a mechanical timer rather than forcing a difficult trade-off. The climax avoids genuine conflict, allowing Maren to acquire the solution through a convenient magical realization without paying a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes are high in the abstract (preventing death), but the immediate scene pressure is low; Mira battles the environment, but the "management" antagonist is distant and recalled rather than present. The escalation—wind speed increasing—validates her theory but does not force her to make a difficult trade-off or alter her tactics in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are high in concept (restoring wonder) but low in dramatic pressure. The environment and the bell offer no active resistance, and the "Council" is too abstract to provide immediate opposition, resulting in a climax that feels like a procedural execution rather than a hard-won victory.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.7)
    The dominant stake—the potential return of the monsters vs. the risk of the forbidden flute—is clear. However, the climax is observational; Mira watches a past failure rather than confronting an active, resisting force in the present. The tension is intellectual more than visceral, as the "shadow-realm pressing against them" never forces a difficult tactical trade-off in the now.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.0)
    The vanishing stars provide atmospheric pressure, but they do not force a hard tactical trade-off or foreclose a path for Mira. The resolution feels like a win-win (she gains understanding and creates harmony) without a felt price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.5)
    Escalation is retrospective; the significant changes (lingering at monasteries) occurred off-page, leaving the present scene with low immediate pressure. The "meaningful tightening" is a mental confirmation of a past shift rather than an active, high-stakes choice in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.9)
    The stakes are clear (validation vs. dismissal), and the deepening—realizing the frost maps specific emotions—is effective. However, pressure is low; the "scientific community" is an abstract antagonist, and success comes immediately upon looking, lacking a moment of distinct jeopardy or difficult trade-off before the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the ultimate cost is high (dissolution of self), the tension is dampened because Mei faces no active opposition or internal doubt. The escalation is procedural—assembling the frame—rather than a rising pressure that tests her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are conceptually high (planetary survival) but lack immediate scene-level tension; the entity grants Oren's request without resistance or complication, removing the possibility of failure. The primary obstacle is the physical climb, which is summarized, and the cost (years of labor) is accepted without a moment of agonizing trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are raised by the "toxicity" reveal, but the conflict is largely internal and resolved instantly upon receiving the new information. The threat of death is stated but not tested or struggled against on the page before the final decision.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.3)
    Internal stakes are legible; the pressure of the "longing" and the break in the chain forces a clear trade-off (anonymity for responsibility). The escalation is quiet but coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is no antagonist, obstruction, or resistance; the wick lights instantly, the storm listens immediately, and the routine proceeds without a hitch. Without a moment where the protagonist's goal is threatened or a cost is levied beyond "aching legs," the story lacks narrative propulsion or dramatic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.2)
    Conflict is muted; the protagonist encounters no significant opposition from the dye master or the environment, making the climax feel inevitable rather than earned. The "warning" of the wing introduces potential stakes that are never operationalized into a difficult choice or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.6)
    The concept of "quantified sorrow" translates abstract internal conflict into concrete, escalating pressure. The climax delivers a meaningful deepening where the protagonist chooses to engage with the grief rather than merely observing it.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are established early and escalate effectively from personal memory loss to the survival of the realm. The external pressure of the darkness "sensing threat" provides a necessary active opposition to the protagonist’s ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.1)
    Conflict is largely retrospective, dealing with past grief rather than an urgent present-tense obstacle. The stakes are resolved through a reframing conversation; while the conceptual cost (surrendering the guilt narrative) is present, the lack of active resistance or escalation lowers the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.6)
    The conflict is primarily internal and thematic (memory vs. erasure), lacking a sharp external pressure or antagonist to force a harder choice. While the stakes are clear, the escalation is gentle; the "tightening" comes from the decision to plant the seeds now, which is a quiet turn.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.5)
    The stakes are immediately established and escalated by the crumbling architecture, creating a palpable "ticking clock" scenario. The conflict is primarily internal—the burden of choice amidst inevitable loss—but it is externalized well through the measuring apparatus. The cost is felt in the loss of the "millions of recorded promises," making the saved vow carry significant weight.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.1)
    The stakes (war vs. truce) are established early and the ticking clock provides effective pressure. While the conflict is resolved efficiently, the opposition (the courier and assistant) feels slightly passive in the final beat, offering little resistance to the interception.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.1)
    Conflict is minimal on the page; the "election" is a background event and the brother's fate is resolved through hearsay. The scene functions as a meeting rather than a confrontation, lacking a moment of high pressure where Vera must make a difficult trade-off or face a genuine threat to her worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are primarily internal and retrospective, with the antagonist (the father) absent and the "lock" already broken. The "inescapable calling" offers little resistance once challenged, resulting in a climax that feels low-risk; the cost is described as "grief" but reads as pure relief.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.2)
    External resistance is minimal; the protagonist faces no physical obstacles or time pressure during her search, reducing the tension to internal anticipation. While the stakes of her condition are high (bedridden by lies), this constraint is not tested against a concrete barrier in the present action of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.9)
    Conflict is minimal. The antagonist is abstract (discord/lies), and the only on-page resistance is Brother Alcuin's brief hesitation, which resolves with a single look. The stakes are high conceptually (truth vs. lies) but low personally, as success feels guaranteed from the start.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.8)
    The internal pressure is masterful, escalating from a migraine-like static to an unbearable surge that demands action. While the external stakes are primarily atmospheric (the shift creates the condition, but doesn't actively oppose the protagonist), the intensity of the internal struggle and the symbolic weight of destroying the box carry the narrative fully.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes are intimate but clearly defined; the pressure of the seventeen-year silence gives weight to the small physical actions. The escalation is quiet and internal, fitting the genre, though the conflict is resolved somewhat easily by the locket's convenient contents.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=3.4)
    There is a virtual absence of active conflict or escalation; the protagonist faces no resistance from the environment, the code, or the dice. Success is immediate and guaranteed, with no moment where failure is a tangible risk. The stakes are historical and abstract rather than immediate and felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.0)
    External pressure is introduced (the Tide Master, the dangerous gravity) but immediately negated; Mira enters the forbidden chamber without encountering guards, and the lethal gravity steadies instantly due to her bloodline. There is no moment where Mira must sacrifice something tangible or risk failure; the path to the solution is linear and safe. The stakes remain abstract because the opposition is absent from the page.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake (peace vs. panic) is clear, and the pressure is maintained through the description of the ritual's intensity. However, the escalation is linear—Mira applies her skill and succeeds—lacking a distinct reversal or a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt, which lowers the perceived cost.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=5.7)
    Escalation is textural rather than causal; the narrative lacks a decisive tightening or obstacle that forces the narrator to earn the succession through visible risk or sacrifice. The progression feels inevitable rather than fought for.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.6)
    The stakes are high and personal, anchored in the sisterly bond. The escalation is primarily internal and atmospheric; the lack of active opposition or a concrete price paid beyond time/effort keeps the tension in a lower register.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.6)
    Conflict is internalized but potent, centered on the moral weight of "calibrated treason." The ritualistic preparation creates sufficient pressure to carry the climax without external antagonism.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from personal grief to a threat against the protagonist's autonomy and life. The cost of the resolution—losing the ability to sing freely—is a palpable, permanent sacrifice that validates the severity of the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.0)
    Conflict is low-voltage as the antagonist is deceased and off-page, leaving Mira with no immediate opposition. The stakes are theoretical (village peace/reputation) rather than visceral, and the climax arrives without a forcing move that tests the protagonist's commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.7)
    The conflict is purely internal and philosophical, meeting little resistance as nature cooperates immediately with the protagonist's test. While the stasis is earned, the lack of escalating pressure or risk of failure makes the confirmation feel inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are declared ("humanity's future") but not felt; the protagonist faces no active antagonist or difficult trade-off on the page. The environmental threat is neutralized by the "stillpoint" concept, and the puzzle-solving is summarized ("Three hours later"), leaving the story without a moment of escalation or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.1)
    Stakes are declared (an assault on the Eastern Grid) but never felt as immediate pressure. The conflict evaporates the moment Miriam speaks; because the opposition collapses without a fight, the victory feels weightless and the cost negligible.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story lacks an active antagonist, obstacle, or time pressure; Marcus begins the scene successful and content. There is no escalation of stakes on the page, only a reflection on past efforts, resulting in a flat narrative trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are established early and escalate clearly through the time constraint and the approaching Consortium vessel. The conflict resolves through a decisive act of agency with an irreversible cost (Vera's dissolution). The "magical pacification" of the antagonists slightly undercuts the tension, but the focus remains rightly on Vera’s internal and physical struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=4.8)
    There is a near-total absence of immediate on-page pressure or antagonism; the Empire is an abstract threat and the environment offers no resistance. Success feels inevitable from the start, lacking the tightening of stakes required for engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are high in concept but low in immediate tension; with the antagonist off-screen and no physical threat in the tunnel, the protagonist's decision faces minimal resistance. The "tightening" is information accumulation rather than rising danger.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are internal and clearly defined; the cost of forgiveness is effectively transferred from the object to the protagonist's action (the letter). The pressure is consistent, though the resolution comes relatively easily once the external signals align.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.6)
    The conflict between Zephyr's evolution and the Boiler's stasis provides good friction; the stakes are high (dissolution), though Zephyr finding the risk "hilarious" slightly intellectuallizes the cost, damping the visceral tension.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are high (missing persons), and knowledge escalates logically. However, the absence of an active antagonist or immediate on-page threat during the vault scene flattens the tension; the pressure remains largely internal/conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.0)
    Stakes are declared but not tested; there is no opposition or obstacle in the scene, as the Keeper is immediately helpful. The story lacks escalation, moving smoothly from arrival to resolution without forcing the protagonist to narrow her options or pay a price.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake (Zurich vs. Staying) is resolved largely through the backstory of the stroke rather than active confrontation in the scene. The narrative lacks escalation; Maren begins and ends in a similar state of suspended acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.7)
    Conflict is muted; the interaction is cooperative rather than fraught, which limits the sense of risk or cost. While the dominant stake (understanding the past) is clear, the lack of immediate opposition or friction keeps the tension low.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes are high (cultural erasure), and the ideological conflict is clear, but the antagonist (the Prophet) poses little immediate threat to the protagonist's agency. He is effectively neutralized by her superior knowledge before the climax begins, reducing the final confrontation to a fait accompli rather than a struggle with uncertain outcomes. The cost is thematic (loss of the physical site) rather than visceral or personal.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.2)
    The conflict lacks "teeth" because the antagonist ("the silence") crumbles without active resistance; the healing process is smooth and monotonic. There is no moment where Maren's plan backfires or requires a painful trade-off, resulting in low narrative tension and negligible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure is coherent but largely internal and intellectual; while the conceptual stakes are high, the scene lacks immediate active resistance or a rising cost to the protagonist's safety or resources.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.5)
    The stakes are intensely personal and existential, centered on the struggle to retain meaning against the pressure of oblivion. While the external conflict is minimal, the internal pressure escalates effectively through the ritual of the chalk and the driftwood. The cost is palpable in the "map of partings," creating a poignant sense of loss.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.3)
    Pressure is maintained through the recurring tremors and the ceaseless spinning of the clock hand, creating a coherent sense of urgency. While the resolution comes through mentor demonstration rather than protagonist struggle, the final choice to stay establishes a felt cost and solidifies the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are clearly established, but the conflict is resolved with relatively low cost; the music and craft activity act as a salve that mitigates the terror too easily. The escalation comes primarily from the external arrival of the nurse rather than an intensification of the interaction between characters.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is minimal; the automaton immediately resolves the knowledge gap, and Mira executes the solution without opposition or error. There is no moment where options narrow or the price of success rises, leaving the climax devoid of genuine narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are clearly internalized and escalated through the physical action of digging with bare hands. The tension between the desire for truth and the fear of "madness" resolves into a satisfying, if slightly romanticized, acceptance of the unknown. The pressure is coherent, though the final "silver bells" release softens the "terrible" aspect of the realization too quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is almost entirely retrospective; the scene itself lacks active opposition, scarcity, or risk. Maren faces no potential failure state—the mist helps her, the glass glows on cue, and the ritual succeeds perfectly—leaving the dominant stake of "isolation vs. connection" theoretically stated rather than dramatically tested.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.8)
    The pressure from the viral confession is established early and escalates through Thea's arrival, forcing a stance crystallization. The resolution is quiet—perhaps slightly too smooth given the described magnitude of the betrayal—but the emotional cost of sharing the pendant is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are purely internal and the pressure is low; the protagonist faces no tangible threat or difficult trade-off, only a fear of vulnerability. The climax relies on a character explaining the lesson to the protagonist, which diffuses tension rather than tightening it.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.8)
    Escalation is mild; the primary obstacle (the dying vines) is addressed through a ritual that functions perfectly on the first attempt. The pressure remains low because the protagonist encounters no significant resistance from the environment, the machine, or her own limitations once the singing begins.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes are clear but somewhat abstract (guiding lost souls), and the conflict is primarily man-against-craft/nature. While the atmospheric tension ("world held its breath") is tangible, the lack of immediate opposing force or the risk of failure makes the ritual's success feel inevitable rather than earned through acute struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.4)
    Escalation is the story's weakest element; the narrative follows a linear path of competence without meaningful setbacks or rising opposition. The skeletal remains introduce a threat of danger that never materializes, leaving the protagonist's success to hinge on patience rather than navigating escalating pressure or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.8)
    Escalation works well under the Accumulative lens, building density through the weaving process to a phase shift. However, the stakes—while high in theory (sanity)—lack visceral on-page tension, as the ritual proceeds without significant resistance or the risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are purely internal—the management of grief—and while poignant, the external pressure is low (only the kettle). The narrative lacks a sharp moment of tightening or risk; the resolution feels like a gentle settling rather than a stance forged under active pressure. It works for the quiet tone but misses the "meaningful tightening" of higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes are legible—survival versus the weight of past ambition. The escalation is functional, though the negotiation feels slightly circular until the protagonist deploys the overheard quote. The cost is felt in the final admission ("I can't become you again").

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.5)
    Pressure is static and low; the protagonist faces no external opposition or internal doubt that forces a narrowing of options. The narrative operates as a procedural success story where the outcome feels inevitable from the start, lacking the escalation required for higher engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes remain abstract and internal; with the threat (Silencing) weakening independently, the protagonist faces no active opposition or immediate trade-off on the page. The realization that she has already been composing removes the risk of starting.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are intellectualized rather than felt; Maren faces no active opposition or difficult choice on the page, merely verifying a conclusion she already reached. The resolution comes too easily, with the father's letter smoothing over the potential conflict of interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes remain abstract (loss of knowledge) without immediate, visceral pressure; the protagonist faces no active opposition or possibility of failure. The escalation is linear and low-stakes, with the only cost being time and physical stiffness, lacking a sharp "or else" quality.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stakes are deeply personal and internal, centering on the erosion of meaning. While the emotional pressure is sustained, the conflict remains largely static until the "conjuring," and the resolution relies on an internal epiphany rather than a forced trade-off or high-cost external choice.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are clear (stagnation vs. life), though the pressure is largely internal and intellectual rather than visceral or time-bound. The conceptual cost—accepting that the past cannot be perfectly restored—is landed well, even if the physical obstacles are minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are purely internal and retrospective, with no active force in the scene challenging the protagonist's resolve. The conflict is processed through reflection rather than dramatized encounter; as a result, the "escalation" is a static accumulation of thoughts rather than a rising pressure on a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.7)
    The central stake is clear and the sacrifice of the mother's laughter provides a tangible cost. However, the tension is dampened by the immediate soothing of that loss ("felt right"), robbing the climax of its potential grit.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is no tangible opposition; the garden yields its secrets instantly to sonar, and the gear functions without resistance. The narrative lacks escalation, reading as a linear sequence of successful actions rather than a struggle with stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes are clear but the pressure is low-key; the conflict is resolved primarily through the mentor's prompt ("You already know how") and Elara’s reflection, lacking a moment where failure felt imminent or a sacrifice was required.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.8)
    The internal conflict—the burden of specific error vs. the need for peace—is well-established and escalates through the ritual of the climb and carving. While external pressure is low, the "seventeen seconds" stake provides a concrete anchor for the tension. The resolution feels earned through action, even if the emotional release is somewhat rapid.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.8)
    Escalation is linear and low-pressure; the protagonist faces no significant obstacles, time crunch, or setbacks while decoding the tapestry. The stakes remain abstract ("inheritance") without a visible, felt cost to failure or delay.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—the kingdom's future—is conceptually high but the immediate scene pressure is low. The protagonist overcomes her hesitation through internal realization rather than grappling with an active obstacle or paying a localized price. The lack of a difficult trade-off softens the impact of her final decision.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes of survival and cultural preservation are clear, but the escalation is mechanical. The "noise outside" turning out to be a fox is a low-stakes false flag that relieves tension cheaply rather than complicating the protagonist's choices. The patrol threat sweeps by without forcing a significant tactical shift on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes are clear—the proper handling of a soul and the assumption of a legacy—but the conflict remains internal and relatively low-pressure. The story operates as a smooth procession of a ritual rather than a struggle against distinct opposition or failure states, limiting the sense of escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes remain largely theoretical; the external pressure (chanting) is ambient and does not force a tactical shift or distinct risk. The conflict stays safely within the protagonist's head, lacking a scene-level test of his convictions.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.8)
    While the stakes of cultural erasure are high, the scene-level conflict is low voltage because Darius enters already wanting to learn. Margaret does not have to overcome active resistance from him, nor does he have to fight to convince her; the "yes" is arrived at too smoothly to generate peak dramatic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.2)
    Tension is minimal because the antagonist (the regime) remains abstract and entirely off-screen until the hypothetical dawn. The protagonist encounters no active resistance or moment of doubt during the ritual, resulting in a low-stakes progression where success feels inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict is minimal; the antagonist is entropy/time, and interpersonal tension dissolves almost instantly due to Mira's truthfulness. The climax lacks a tangible cost or sacrifice; the solution is applied without a trade-off, resulting in a low-stakes resolution where everyone wins easily.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes are purely internal and thematic, which fits the quiet tone but limits narrative urgency. The conflict (understanding the nature of the "alive" houses) is resolved somewhat easily by the protagonist's immediate intuition, resulting in low tension despite the engaging premise.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.4)
    The conflict is clear but resolved largely through the delivery of a magical object (the ampoule) that transmits understanding directly. This reduces the protagonist's agency in the climax, as the epiphany is received via telepathy rather than earned through active struggle or difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.3)
    The stakes are intensely personal and well-escalated, transforming a mathematical problem into an emotional crucible. The cost is subtle but felt—the loss of the "beautiful asymmetry" she cherished, replaced by a smoother, perhaps numbr existence within the eternal trap.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are primarily retrospective and emotional, lacking immediate on-page jeopardy or a forcing choice. The escalation is atmospheric (painting in a trance) rather than causal, and the resolution comes from a notification rather than a decision that costs Maya something in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.9)
    The stakes—cultural erasure vs. persistence—are established early and felt deeply. While the external pressure (starvation) is mentioned, the focus remains tight on the psychological cost of the beekeeper’s absence. The escalation is quiet and internal; a sharper external complication or a more difficult trade-off during the baking scene could have heightened the on-page drama.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are clearly defined and escalate from curiosity to a desperate bid for retrieval. The pressure of the returning tide adds necessary urgency, and the cost—Alaric's departure from the known world—is a legible trade-off for his goal.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.5)
    The stakes deflate at the climax because the antagonist (the fear) is explicitly described as "smaller than she expected" and "simple." Vera’s victory comes without a moment of doubt, cost, or near-failure during the actual confrontation; the solution works exactly as advertised, lacking the friction required for high-band conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes are primarily philosophical rather than immediate or visceral. While the "coming storm" provides background tension, the protagonist faces no active opposition in her goal to transform the wreckage; the lack of friction or necessary trade-offs limits the narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are well-defined as the cost of stagnation versus the danger of truth. The escalation is coherent, moving from intellectual decoding to the physical test of the whistle, culminating in the irrevocable act of leaving. The physical resistance of the gate is somewhat soft, but the emotional cost is palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.8)
    The stakes are elevated by Vera's acknowledgment of the Institute's genuine good, creating a complex trade-off between stability and truth rather than a simple moral binary. The cost is palpable—the destruction of "something beautiful" and the loss of her sanctuary.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes are low and lack urgency; the protagonist faces no antagonist, time pressure (despite the drawbridge clock), or difficult trade-offs. The narrative follows a linear path of discovery without escalation, risk of failure, or a moment where the protagonist must pay a price for her goal.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are clear but low-intensity; the conflict is intellectual (truth vs. forgery) rather than visceral. Maren's safety and composure are never truly threatened, resulting in a smooth narrative with minimal felt pressure or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the midnight deadline provides initial pressure, the climax lacks a genuine test of the protagonist's values; she achieves her goal without sacrifice. The absence of a "felt or conceptual cost" (a required element for high-band conflict) renders the victory hollow and lowers the narrative stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clearly established as existential and emotional. While the external pressure is low (waiting for breakers), the internal pressure of the "hunt" drives the narrative effectively. The "spike" on the readout serves as a meaningful deepening of the pattern, validating her persistence even if it doesn't dramatically alter her physical circumstances.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.4)
    Pressure is minimal; the protagonist faces no significant opposition, misunderstanding, or risk of failure once the pilgrim arrives. The plot proceeds as a procedural execution of a solution rather than a test of the character’s agency or commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.1)
    The internal conflict is clear, and the decision to reverse her skills provides a tangible escalation of stakes. The pressure comes from the letter, but the turning point relies on the interpretative weight of the found object rather than active pressure from another character.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are established, but the external conflict is surprisingly low-friction; the antagonist is cooperative ("terms are surprisingly fair") and the exchange goes smoothly. The tension relies almost entirely on the atmosphere rather than active opposition or escalating obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.7)
    The stakes are internal but legible; the pressure of the fog and the memory of the storm creates a coherent escalation. The cost is felt in the trade-off between her former mastery and her current survival tactics, though the external conflict remains relatively low-voltage.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict is low-voltage; the protagonist largely receives instructions rather than fighting for agency. The climax involves following directions to "feel" rather than making a costly trade-off, rendering the stakes (redemption) abstract rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are clear and high: the permanent loss of human form for a moment of connection. The escalation is handled smoothly through the physical process of the ritual, moving from the crushing of spices to the warping of bone. The cost is not just stated but shown in the irreversible physical change, fulfilling the requirement for a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.3)
    The conflict is primarily internal but effectively externalized through the ritual; the "lock" being the daughter's clumsy knot is a poignant escalation. The resolution hinges on a meaningful conceptual repricing—realizing the time was stored, not stolen—though the external barriers fall away somewhat easily once realized.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.2)
    The conflict is primarily internal but is externalized effectively through the mechanics of the tears and the locked dimension. The pressure escalates naturally from the routine work on others' photos to the unavoidable confrontation with her own, forcing a re-evaluation of her self-image.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (understanding transformation) and the cost (loss of the collection) are clear and legible. However, the on-page conflict is low-resistance; Miriam encounters no active obstacle or hesitation during the ritual, making the escalation feel smooth rather than pressured. The deepening comes from a conceptual realization rather than a forced choice between difficult options.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are declared (revolution) but not pressured in the scene; Maren moves through the fort unimpeded, reducing the conflict to a theoretical risk rather than a dramatic test. Without an antagonist or a complication to force a difficult trade-off, the escalation feels flat.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.2)
    While the global stakes are high, the immediate dramatic tension is dampened because the star dust negates the specific danger of the protagonist's curse. The climax relies on spending a resource rather than facing the perilous trade-off of "observation as permission," making the victory feel safer than the premise promised.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes of censorship and silence are established early, providing a clear backdrop for the conflict. However, the on-page pressure is largely contemplative; the antagonist is a memory (the tribunal) rather than a present force. The resolution feels somewhat smooth, with the letter resolving the tension without forcing a painful tradeoff in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.8)
    While stakes are declared (war vs. peace), the conflict lacks on-page weight because the protagonist triumphs effortlessly off-screen. There is no visible cost paid for the victory—only "shattered teacups"—which leaves the resolution feeling unearned and low-impact.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.1)
    The drive lens is Situational, relying on the ambient pressure of patrols and the ruin to create tension. While the stakes are high in the background, the immediate scene lacks a sharp on-page escalation or a difficult choice; the characters are in agreement throughout, making the conflict largely atmospheric rather than interpersonal or tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.0)
    While the stakes (reunion) are clear, the protagonist faces little active opposition; she essentially follows a set of instructions left by the husband. The climax lacks a palpable sense of risk or sacrifice, as the solution (playing the piano) aligns perfectly with her existing comfort zone.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are clearly defined (memory vs. oblivion) and escalated by the approaching storm. The pressure is coherent, though the external threat of the monsoon "washing away everything" feels slightly hyperbolic compared to the precise, nuanced internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.2)
    Tension is low; the protagonist, the antagonist (silence), and the facilitator (Tanaka) all share the same goal from the start, removing friction. The resolution is effectively guaranteed once the lace is handed over, lacking the escalation or "tightening" of options required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (reconcile unspoken regrets) signaled early via aphasia; accumulative deepening via lace decoding narrows knowledge/options, forcing Mei to kneel and trace "I was wrong" knot. Agency in following instructions forecloses silence path; cost felt in grandmother's crumpling face. One tightening sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure is ambient, not adversarial: entropy, flood residue, and maternal absence tighten the emotional field. The single meaningful deepening occurs when Mira realizes gradual change governs both stars and grief, narrowing her stance from scientific analysis to humble acceptance. No external antagonist or reversible stakes appear, but the accretive pattern itself supplies sufficient tension under the Accumulative lens; cost is conceptual rather than visceral, visible in her decision to leave the structure to demolition.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can she revalue her art after learning she was catalogued as expendable—tightens when frost decodes “valuable & expendable” on the strip. Agency: her tracing the frost is an active intervention that forecloses return to patronage. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: she accepts financial uncertainty for aesthetic autonomy. No coincidence; poison already inverted patron’s plan.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—translate silence into music—tightens when each fork strike proves the orchids can “speak” back. The escalation is accumulative: every new thermal signature deepens the same stake rather than reversing it. One credible loss is dramatized: she forfeits the chance to ever hear sound again when she smiles at the gold on her own chest. The final renunciation is visible; no coincidence is invoked.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—keep a scattered people whole—tightens when anonymous crates remove scarcity as excuse, forcing Mira to convert food into ritual instead of mere relief. The midnight run itself is the single meaningful escalation: each silent step amplifies the risk of patrols, narrowing options to memory or oblivion. Cost is visible in Yusuf’s glare and the grandmother’s flour-short lesson, but the patrol threat stays atmospheric rather than concrete; a missed opportunity to show one confiscated parcel or imposed curfew fine. Still, the escalation coheres under Accumulative pressure and forecloses the path back to nameless survival.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—will she escape the backward slide or be consumed by it—is signaled within 90 words and tightens through each逆向flash. One meaningful deepening occurs when photographs dissolve, proving time itself is erasing her anchor. Agency remains hers: she chooses to press the shard into the bridge knot, trading oblivion for diffusion. Cost is felt—corporeal forfeiture—but a slightly earlier visible tactical loss (a photograph vanishing mid-beat) would have pushed this into the 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—save seeds before wall detonation—signalled paragraph 3; two-hour clock narrows to boots-in-doorway crunch. Scout confrontation supplies single meaningful tightening: his arrow set down forecloses alarm and allows escape. Cost transferred from potential explosion to continued imprisonment. No escalation after that beat, but one tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—capture the exact frequency of trust breaking—tightens when she realizes the hollow is her own adolescent voice; that micro-turn narrows options from scientific distance to self-exposure. Cost is visceral: “wept into her helmet” after hearing the thin wire snap. No antagonist is needed; the greenhouse pressure and aurora window supply coherent external urgency. Escalation is accumulative: each absence-collecting beat adds density until the pattern breaks inward.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—liberate moonbeams before full dark—tightens once: sunset deadline → moonlit exposure, foreclosing wait-and-watch option. Single reversal: collector’s complacency flips to loss at touch-point. Price paid on-page: Mira trades anonymity for radiant evidence warming her coat—future pursuit now inevitable. Escalation is lean but sufficient for 700-word span; causal lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—risking human contact—is signaled early; pressure tightens as melt turns bunker from tomb to potential meeting-place. One meaningful deepening: dead lever→single red light proves infrastructure usable, forcing the “abandon solitude” decision. Cost is present—fear of others, loss of hermetic safety—but could be more viscerally felt (e.g., imagined breach of glass walls). Agency remains hers; coincidence only enables, never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—identity vs captor—tightens once: Marla turns disclosure weapon back on Sandra. Pressure escalates via because/therefore: decrypt cast → summon to ruin → trade shell for confession. Cost is Sandra’s collapse and Marla’s unrecoverable years; option space narrows to public truth.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.0)
    Single dominant stake—chart the void before it swallows everything—tightens with each vanished star. The second-to-last star flicker is the visible escalation that forecloses delay; the map’s creation is the irreversible act that pays the price. Cost is literal in blood-gold ink and conceptual in the burden of lone knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will Unit-7 use the violin to break or accept the loop?—is signaled at first sight. Tightening occurs when it names the violin “a question” and chooses to play, foreclosing rebellion; cost is the eternal return it now consciously embraces. Pressure is accumulative: each loop’s snow adds weight until the bowing transmutes archive into ritual. No external antagonist is needed; the conflict is internal-existential and resolves into Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: need for human recognition in a post-linguistic world, signaled in paragraph 2. Pressure tightens once Mira steps from shadow to bench—she risks her practiced solitude; the exchange of artifacts narrows options, making mutual visibility irreversible. Cost is the surrender of protective distance (lens) and public anonymity (tickets). No antagonist required; internal/external conflicts merge around mistrust. Escalation is one meaningful deepening rather than reversal, sufficient for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.3)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—prove temporal anomaly—signals early; pressure tightens once as the nexus window shortens and cloudweavers begin to stir. Escalation is gentle but causal: mis-alignment would lose the data, so scanner positioning matters. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral—lonely confirmation she must continue bearing alone. Sufficient for this length, yet lacks a live trade-off or visible price within the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single dominant stake—vindicate Voss—tightens when the oil-cloth packet is found; the option to retreat dies with the rising water. Agency is continuous: each photograph and decoded stain is an active probe, not passive discovery. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the confession is physically unearthed by her pry-bar choice. Cost is legible: anonymity forfeited, clothing soaked, dawn confrontation awaiting. One could wish for a sharper mid-scene trade-off—she never questions whether exposing the truth may raze the opera house’s already doomed memory—but the pressure curve satisfies the shortform bar.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—speak the certain apocalypse or swallow it—tightens once when she decides silence equals liberation; cost is the perpetual internal pressure of that truth. Agency is renunciation rather than action, but the option to report is explicitly foreclosed on-page. Under the accumulative lens, the lack of external escalation is offset by density of imagery that makes silence feel heavier than speech.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prove Daniela didn’t run—tightens when the amber bead forecloses that escape myth; thirty-seven beads raise the communal cost and narrow Marcus’s options to public reckoning. One meaningful escalation suffices here: discovery → count → vow to drag truth into daylight. Pressure stays coherent under causal lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure tightens once: the discovery of the swan shifts her from passive wandering to deliberate documentation without disturbance. The cost is the surrender of voice and agency—she “lets the water’s voice replace her own”—a renunciation legible under Accumulative escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stake—maternal fear of dissolution vs. daughter’s launch—signals early and tightens through eclipse countdown. No visible resource lost or option foreclosed; the hand-off is symbolic, not tactical. Pressure is atmospheric (ephemeral light, sage scent) rather than causal, fitting Accumulative lens, but cost stays conceptual rather than felt on the page. Escalation is a single deepening, sufficient for length, yet lacks a palpable price that alters next moves.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—recover the lost axis—signals early; pressure tightens when tapestry redefines the quest from antiquarian to existential. Escalation is single-step, not recursive, but the tightening forecloses the option of mere cataloguing, charging the final walk east.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: identity—spy vs. seer—signaled in opening paragraph. Escalation is Accumulative: each fortune-cookie prophecy widens the gap between public mystery and private knowledge until the journalist forces a public reckoning. Cost is conceptual but legible: surrender of classified specs = permanent loss of covert power. No external antagonist needed; pressure is the accumulated weight of her own unacted past.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.9)
    The three-minute countdown is signaled early and tightens every rhetorical volley; each answered assumption literally thins the shadows under Elena’s skin—visible, legible cost. Marcus’s agency is pure discourse, but discourse here is weaponized, so the escalation is causally driven rather than asserted. One meaningful turn suffices: “emptiness is space” flips the fortress assumption and dissolves the entity.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: can she still hear the “unheard symphonies” after decades of vending clichés? Pressure is textural—accumulating echoes hollow her out rather than forcing external obstacles. The single meaningful tightening is dawn itself: the instant when mirrored horizon collapses into singularity mirrors her renunciation of authorship. Cost is felt—she accepts perpetual exile from her own words—but because no live option is foreclosed (she could keep writing), the trade-off reads as gentle surrender rather than high-stakes sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—end self-fragmentation—signaled in paragraph two. Escalation is textural: each rune reconfiguration deepens the impossibility of singular identity, tightening until acceptance is the only remaining option. Cost is conceptual but visible: she abandons the tablet, relinquishing the illusion of control. No coincidence; pressure coils through accumulative paradox rather than causal reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—thaw emotional numbness—signaled in para 2; pressure escalates through accumulating vibration density until the single cadence shift (large-drum + needle) crystallizes choice. No antagonist needed; tension is internal-external hybrid: body vs. silence. Cost visible on page: tears, shaky legs, acknowledged future struggle. No coincidence; all turns driven by Marina’s consent to hands-on-drum test.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—integrity versus state secrecy—tightens once: the message turns passive observation into active danger. Escalation is a single deepening rather than because/therefore chain, fitting Accumulative design. The price (future persecution) is conceptual, legible in the “steady patience” image. No reversible turn, but one meaningful shift satisfies short-form rule.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: will she dare inhale knowledge that may drown her in inherited grief? Pressure tightens as bloom opens and lantern oil wanes—two live clocks. Micro-turn at vial uncorking narrows options: once smelled, the memory cannot be unseen. Cost paid on-page: tears, dawn departure, vial kept yet forever spent—path foreclosed, acceptance earned.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“does time accumulate?”—is signaled early; escalation is the densifying rope-readings that foreclose abstract safety in favor of tactile risk. Single meaningful tightening: handing the rope to the woman makes the cost communal and irreversible. Agency is accretive rather than causal, fitting the lyric lens; price (shared exposure, shelter uncertainty) is legible. No visible secondary loss, so caps at 8.2.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—can she make music inside the hush—signaled in para 1 and tightens once: from fighting silence to collaborating with it. Agency is renunciation/stance crystallization rather than external reversal; that single deepening is proportionate to 700-word scope. Cost is legible: she forfeits the private shelter of silence for imperfect public performance. No coincidence; pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can she still feel—tightens when the pure grief cracks her tolerance; the grotto descent forces the choice to inhale again, foreclosing sterile distance. Cost is legible: tear-streaked cheeks and the petal she can no longer keep. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversal needed for lyric arc.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—“remember the forgotten without being asked”—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: historical society rejections become Elias’s lived defeat; Marina’s archive access converts that defeat into public victory. The tightening is meaningful but single; no subsequent trade-off or price is dramatized on her side (no lost client, no political backlash), so cost is conceptual rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—belonging through strange gift—signals early; each reed offering tightens the bargain: “notice me / find me.” Escalation is accumulative: symbols appear → sculptures answer → nightly vigil grows; the final tightening occurs when Senna steps into the circle, foreclosing perpetual anonymity at the cost of exposure. Cost is visible: her dust-stained fingers tremble; Veren will keep shaping forever, accepting perpetual outsider role inside the orchard. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake: restore the world’s lost completions by risking personal time-bankruptcy. Escalation is textural: each borrowed pulse heats the pendant, density of unpaid time grows until the courtyard release reweights the stake—she wins world-cadence, loses unknown years. No coincidence; her agency alone uncages. Cost is legible: “she did not know how much time she had left.”

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“map the shape loss carved”—tightens once: the apparition’s declaration forces her shift from retrieval to self-definition. Cost is legible: she forfeits the dream of recovering Theo’s laugh, embracing instead “a living hollow she could carry.” No escalation spiral is needed under an accumulative lens; the single deepening reweights all prior tallies. Pressure stays coherent because external antagonist is the orchard’s own unalterable drip-law, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—remain unseen vs transmit memory—tightens once: the letter placement irrevocably narrows her safety. Escalation is textural: accumulating relics intensify emotional weight until the single release. No external antagonist needed; pressure is existential. Cost visible: exposure risk at sunrise, forfeiture of absolute anonymity.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve human self vs. allow plant becoming—signals early and tightens when the linden leaf matches her dream-veins, making surrender unavoidable. Escalation is accumulative: each sensory shift (no hunger, spine-pull, green veins) deepens cost until stance crystallization. Micro-turn: denial → surrender. Physical price visible: hair silkens, feet root. Coincidence only complicates (leaf placement); resolution comes via her agency to release control.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—thresh meaning from endless wakefulness—tightens when the rain trails offer a one-way invitation; refusal equals stasis, crossing risks the only ritual she has. The amber brooch discovery escalates by reframing her insomnia as necessary vigilance, not pathology. Escalation is single-cycle but sufficient for 700 words; cost is felt in the final image’s “amber light spilling from their joined hands,” converting private obsession into shared witness.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—will she trade prophecy for present wonder?—is signaled early and tightens when shadows overlap and the song becomes language. The pearl-touch is the single decisive turn that forecloses the old path. Cost is legible in her tears and the dawn she finally sees; a second reversal or higher price would push this into 8.8+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—whether to keep exhuming painful absences—surfaces early. Pressure escalates texturally: each new fragment tightens the communal grief and Elen’s moral obligation. The meaningful turn is the widow’s sob—proof that excavation works—yet it occurs off-stage; we hear the result, not the confrontation, so the cost is vicarious. Closure linkage is strong (she commits to perpetual vigil), but the beat that forces the commitment is narrated, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—will she trade mapped certainty for uncharted truth?—is signaled early and tightens at the door: the punch's first real bite makes refusal impossible. Escalation is driven by her agency: each step abandons a mapper's tool—watch, paper, finally her own contour style—until she walks through her own linework. Cost is visible: the door bears her future-less past. No reversal beyond the threshold, but one meaningful turn suffices; the price (her analytical identity) is legible on the bronze.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—restore sister’s memories—signaled early. One meaningful tightening: the tile’s refracted starlight forces transcription, narrowing options from passive observation to irreversible act. Cost is legible—Mira’s tears and the “impossible hope” she now carries. Escalation is accumulative rather than causal, fitting the lyric design; no reversal, but deepening intensifies emotional price.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: entanglement as both quantum and familial, whales as forgotten architects of memory. Subtext in Aldric’s “old grief, transformed by time into gentle purpose” reframes healing as service rather than cure. Final image of “impossible hope” laid at sister’s feet avoids moralizing. Ambiguity—will transcription work?—lingers without confusion, inviting reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—escape from eternal tedium—is signaled in line 2. The solar storm supplies the single meaningful tightening: it converts the amulet from curse to map, forcing Vera’s conspiratorial gambit. Cost is visible: the escondite implodes, Aldric screams, the fragment burns away. Agency is hers, but the beat is compressed; we are told she “began to intrigue” rather than watching a tactic unfold.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can ethical accounting exist for inherited theft—tightens once when Maya refuses to lie yet accepts the stolen pot; the reversal is her conscious switch from sent to choosing, forcing her to shoulder irreversible cost; escalation is coherent, single-curve, and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—preserve intangible dawns before they vanish—tightens through lower-frequency hums and accumulating pages, but pressure is ambient, not adversarial; no external force threatens the lamp or shop. The 744th entry marks a micro-turn (mournful tone) that deepens rather than narrows options; Mei’s agency is to persist, not sacrifice. Cost is present but abstract: the growing weight of unspent textures in her notepad spine. Escalation is subtle cadence shift, sufficient for Accumulative lens, yet lacks a visible price that alters her next climb—hence stops short of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prove the Meridian existed, avenge erasure—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the dockers’ gossip pins her husband’s loss to the same poison notation. Agency is accumulative: each fragment she layers narrows the doctor’s future options and raises her own exposure. The visible price is the forfeiture of reclamation into life; she embraces perpetual ghosthood. A hair more tightening would require an on-page failure beat, but the cadence shift at tide-turn suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—will she heed living words?—is signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation is single deep dive: cello voices force a stance shift; no reversals needed. Cost is legible: surrender of epistemic control, on-page laughter/weeping. Lacks persistent external consequence (she’ll come back tomorrow), so ceiling high-7s not 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—loss of natural darkness—signals early and tightens through timed chemical packets and the literal countdown to sunrise. Stakes remain conceptual rather than viscerally felt until the final satellite pass; cost is intellectual more than tactical, keeping pressure cerebral. Agency resides in endurance/witness, qualifying as renunciation under Accumulative lens; one visible forfeiture (the photo can never be replicated) suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.9)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—map truth versus survival—tightens when falcon confirms the three-day ice window; clock is legible. Agency: she decides to herald correction, forfeiting safe return. Cost is felt: “twelve days… file the revised coordinates anyway” drafts her own obituary. No artificial antagonist needed; terrain as indifferent pressure suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—restoring balance through controlled collapse—is signaled in paragraph four and deepens via the tuner’s irrevocable gift. One meaningful tightening: the second fork-strike forces the bells to answer, foreclosing any chance of half-measures. Price is visible when the seventeen watch their homes swallowed, weeping with relief; escalation rides the rising resonance, not external twists.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—prove consciousness can be bottled—tightens into its opposite: release the bottled to preserve their dignity. One decisive escalation: the moment she chooses to unsnarl rather than extract, foreclosing the original goal with on-page cost (empty vial = no grant money). Pressure stays coherent under situational lens: the temple’s hush and the skeleton’s mute warning are antagonistic forces that compel stance crystallization. No reversal inflation; a single meaningful turn suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“be believed before dawn patrol arrives”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the hush-thing physically appears; Milo’s agency shifts from sneaking-in to naming/acknowledging, which directly collapses the creature. The price (voice evaporating, lattice cracking) is brief but legible; the patrol horn externalizes a social cost awaiting him. Escalation is single but sufficient for 700-word scope; no reversal, yet the silence-thickening counts as meaningful deepening under an accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—ending the night—threads from first sentence; tightening occurs when Maren corporealizes and the beads begin to sing, narrowing options to “press or refuse.” Elias’s agency is the final bead-press that triggers sunrise; cost is the greenhouse’s destruction and his bloodline’s obsolescence. No coincidence; all pressure accumulative. Slight deduction: off-page village saved long ago less visceral than orchard stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—prove ancestral faith wasted vs. restore it—tightens when the glowing apples force her to choose: leave the dial underground or carry its weight topside. The sundial’s activation is the single decisive escalation: it turns perpetual dark into livable time, foreclosing her original plan to expose a hoax. Cost is visible: she hoists the stone, accepts endless replanting duties, and loses her skeptic identity. No coincidence; pressure is purely situational, crystallizing her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—get the message out before caretakers erase the chalk—tightens once: yellow-over-blue = imminent. Escalation is textural: dawn brightens, ads flicker, child with chalk approaches, time narrows. Cost is the eternal return implied; no visible price beyond that, so stops short of 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—prevent palace purge—signalled late but retroactively charges every gathered thread. Pressure deepens through intelligence density: fleet positions → treasury nephew → dismissed guard; each new shard narrows options. Agency is attention-allocation rather than overt opposition; she risks exposure when spilling threads to reach battle map, visible micro-cost. Escalation is steady accumulation, not spike; lacks last-turn tightening that forecloses an escape route, keeping score sub-8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will she speak the apology—tightens once: from unread condensation to spoken “Mama.” The turn is micro but decisive, foreclosing silence. Cost is legible in the shard’s warmth and the spirits’ cadence shift. Under Accumulative lens, the density of voices and moonlight escalates until speech becomes the only release.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—fear of remembering/relaying wrong—tightens when each smudged letter recovered threatens to re-injure the girl’s memory or the boy’s mother Marina once mistranslated. The single deepening beat is the decision to soften the Tausug warning; this narrows Marina’s ethical options and pays visible cost by sacrificing literal accuracy for mercy. Agency is continuous: every decoded phrase is an active translation choice under drug-dulled time pressure. Cost is legible: the coral must be discarded because the translator’s credo has been irreversibly edited.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—recover joy in art—signaled in paragraph three and intensifies through each projected stroke; no reversals needed under Accumulative lens. Pressure tightens when ancient fragment responds, forcing merger of eras and validating her covert method. Visible price: she will keep returning to night-fog, forfeiting daylight career. Escalation is modest but sufficient for 700-word span; coincidence only as atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—evade thought tax & reclaim free expression—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightened when they decide to plant encoded gardens. Agency is shared: Sofia’s prior garden network becomes tactical infrastructure; Marcus supplies code. Cost is conceptual (future risk of discovery) rather than immediate; a sharper micro-loss (tool, social credit) would have lifted this into the 9-band. Still, the tightening forecloses passive resistance and commits them to active subversion.</answer>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.6</question><comment>Theme emerges organically: knowledge as contraband, cultivation as resistance. The gourd rattle’s shift from curiosity to punctuation mark reweights the motif without overt statement. Final image—vegetable choreography spelling messages visible from drone-height—offers a resonant non-literal answer: free thought will grow literally underground. No late moralizing; the Bureau’s taxed dreams line supplies conceptual repricing that lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: can grief be transmuted into something that feeds others? Pressure tightens once: the memory surge tonight forces the next lullaby and the next line of light—no option to stop is offered, and the cost (perpetual sleepless labor) is felt. No external antagonist; the conflict is situational—internal ache versus finite nightly energy. Escalation is accretive rather than reversal-based, appropriate to the lens; the reef’s listening pause is the visible tightening that validates her endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—can sibling trust be resurrected before dawn—is signaled early and tightens exactly once: after reciprocal promises the option to part unchanged is foreclosed. Each promise raises the stakes from abstract guilt to on-record accountability; the cost is the risk of mutual unraveling if they relapse. Agency is symmetric: both siblings speak the unsnarling; no external coincidence intrudes. The escalation is modest but sufficient for 750 words; a second tightening would over-egg.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—protect the villages—surfaces in the decoded letter and immediately reframes Elara’s disgrace as Mira’s inheritance. Escalation is knowledge-based: each cipher line narrows Mira’s options until silence-with-purpose becomes the only safe stance. The price is explicit: she must preserve the lie to prevent fresh genocide. Under causal lens, the tightening is clean—discovery forces restraint, not liberation.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—“can she risk being known again?”—is signaled early; pressure deepens via Accumulative pattern (dust → meteorite → journal) rather than causal reversal. No visible price is felt on-page until the final CR image; prior beats are observational, not tactical. Sufficient tightening for 600-word scope but lacks a moment where trust choice forecloses a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will she remain adrift or cross—tightens once she translates CAVOK as permission to land. Agency drives the turn: pressing the logbook to her chest, she speaks readiness, terrace stops. Cost is the seventeen-year exile itself, now paid to exit. No coincidence resolves; the father’s distant tremor complicates rather than saves.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake: escape surface loneliness vs. risk underwater vulnerability. Escalation is situational: each new firefly rise tightens the literal breathing space in the chamber and the figurative space between strangers. One decisive tightening: the synchronized exhale that fogs the glass—this act forecloses solitary watching and commits her to mutual witness. Cost is legible: dawn will separate them, and she has volunteered to carry the ache of that schedule.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“find why paths disappear before memory dissolves”—is signaled early and tightens via the 3-day clock. One meaningful deepening: seeds force reinterpretation of sister’s resignation, foreclosing the old investigative path. Cost legible: she forfeits certainty and the possibility of future search. Escalation is textural, not causal-reversal, fitting the lens; sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: can engineered wonder survive its own success without becoming sterile? Pressure mounts by accumulation: each calibrated variable (bishop, tide, patron schedule) tightens the noose of expectation; the child’s unscripted laughter supplies the micro-turn that forces adaptation. Cost is present but soft—she forfeits tonight’s perfect configuration to tomorrow’s tide rather than paying a social or physical price. Sufficient intensification for this length, yet not a visceral trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—freedom from memory ban versus irreversible cosmic binding—tightens once: the moment Kira extends her arm, options collapse from seeking teacher to being marked forever. Escalation is situationally coherent: Magisters’ invisible threat hovers, but on-page pressure is the stylus burn and dawn deadline. Agency is Kira’s literal flesh offer; cost is “never belong…again” and permanent tide anchor. Coincidence absent; causality intact. Could wish for one mid-scene obstacle that further narrows tactics, hence 8.7 not 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—save the atrium from erasure—is signaled in para 4. Escalation is textural: mist thinning, colors sharpening, council deadline tightening the emotional aperture rather than narrowing tactical options. The meaningful turn is conceptual: demolition stops mattering when Elena reframes value from permanence to disseminated attention; the price is the loss of her seventeen-year monument, but that cost is asserted, not dramatized in a beat that hurts. Sufficient for the length, yet the absence of a visible trade-off or resource lost keeps it below the 8.5 tier.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—will he scatter the ashes or keep them?—tightens once: the moment he opens the pouch, release becomes irreversible. Pressure escalates via interior causality: memory of Celia’s pride in the cracked flower vs. fear that scattering = final erasure. No external antagonist needed; stakes shrink to the palm-sized box, intensifying precisely because the universe stays indifferent. Visible price: he forfeits the illusion that pain can be universalized, accepting solitary scarred endurance instead.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—Elise’s survival—signaled on arrival; bead configurations tighten options from many timelines to one viable treatment, meaningful narrowing under causal lens. Escalation is intellectual: each triangle flash increases emotional cost of ignoring Geneva path. No external antagonist, but disease pressure and maternal refusal to accept “unsolvable” keep tension coherent. Price exists (effort, risk, hope), yet not dramatized on exit; hence stops short of top band.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will Mira hear the walls dream?—is signaled in paragraph three. Pressure escalates accumulatively: each salvaged object (diary, negative, sensor cascade) deepens the acoustic archive rather than threatening life, narrowing her option from discovery to custodianship. Cost is conceptual but felt: she must “continue the cartography” forever, inheritance as tether. No overt antagonist or reversal, fitting Accumulative design; one meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—persuade mirrors to show possibility—is signaled early and tightens once: the bells will soon shatter the membrane, so the painting must finish before sound. No visible price is forfeited on the page (no broken brush, no drained pulse), so escalation stays poetic rather than visceral. The tightening suffices for 600-word scale but lacks a live option foreclosed or a tangible loss that alters next tactics, capping entry into 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will the treaty stick—tightens when Elara concedes uncertainty yet presses the pens forward, narrowing options from negotiation to irrevocable ink. Escalation is accumulative: each named dead child layers density until the moons’ alignment forces the irreversible micro-turn. Cost is felt in her throat constriction and the clipboard’s inherited weight. Agency is hers; neither side’s sudden handshake feels coincidental because she staged the cosmic trigger.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: can she part with the last extant egg to pay an uncollectible debt to extinct life? Pressure escalates through revealed complicity (drought orphans), narrowing to single beat—press button, surrender object. Cost legible: the act empty-palms her of the only private joy her empire couldn’t monetize. No coincidence; agency pure. One meaningful tightening sufficient at this length; closure reweights scale of guilt without redeeming it.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—“remain sovereign over her body while reclaiming ancestral voice”—tightens when each untangled thread eliminates the option of remaining merely the Untouched Muse. No external antagonist is needed; the pressure is the accumulating load of inherited silence. The final turn forecloses anonymity: she will now teach, becoming visible to patrons and pimps alike. Cost is visible on the page when the prism dims and the cold no longer touches her—she has traded insulation for ignition.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—can ethically sideways storytelling survive confrontation with journalistic truth—tightens when Vera demands the show. One visible reversal: puppets turn accusation back on both, foreclosing prior certainties. Cost is emotional abrasion and the shared question mark that locks them into new, uneasy equipoise. Agency remains Marcus’s to perform, Vera’s to witness, both to accept the dust-marked aftermath.</answer>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: manipulation vs illumination braided through puppet show and calligraphy dust. Final image reweights “listening” and “question” as non-verbal ethical stance. No tidy moral—ambiguity preserved in the shared smile through tears. Subtext carried in object handling (story stick passed hand to hand) and silence after puppets fall.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—witness the final migration—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the monarchs physically acknowledge the frames. Agency is accumulative: each knot adds witness-density; the sixteen-second pause on the moth wing crystallizes the trade-off—she keeps the notebook but loses the wing. Cost is felt in the silent grotto afterward. No causal antagonist, but extinction itself supplies coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—recovering the sound of lost names—tightens when each braid alignment forces a micro-risk of fiber fracture. Agency is renunciation: she forfeits the safety of silence to sing. Cost is visible when the card crumbles and the rope’s new tension hums; this price forecloses the option to remain mute.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—will she own or serve the paths?—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when the directive orders “THE PATH CHOOSES.” Breaking the seal escalates pressure: she now feels thousands of phantom lives pulling at her. Cost is visible: she accepts eternal itinerancy (“another bunker waited”) and the storm’s electricity still sings in her nerves. Agency drives every turn; no coincidental rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will the universe answer?—tightens once: the primes emerge, foreclosing skepticism and locking her into 17-year vigil. The cost is conceptual (lifelong watch) rather than visceral, but still legible. No second reversal is needed; the pattern-deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“will Thorne release resentment”—is signaled at threshold and escalates through haptic reversals: first the scream that fails, then the touch that forces remembrance, finally the silence that demands internalized melody. Agency sits with Thorne; Mireva merely choreographs pressure. Cost is visible: the moment he chooses to cradle rather than crush the box, he forfeits the moral high ground of rage. Escalation is single-cycle but sufficient for 750 words; coincidence never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—recover the escaped dream—signaled in line 1. Pressure escalates through mirror-making failures, sextant discovery, and ultimate breath-sync that lets the boundary thin; each step narrows options toward the crossing decision. Climax forces renunciation: she breaks sync, forecloses immediate passage, accepts continued insomnia. Cost is visible—tonight’s refusal means another day of fog-bound labor—satisfying 8.8+ band guardrail.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“will the craft die?”—is signaled early and tightened when the bag’s contents foreclose that fear. One meaningful turn: the journal’s discovery shifts tactics from search to teaching. Cost is legible but generalized (lost guild, lost daughter); a sharper personal price would punch higher. Agency is Mira’s decision to hand over the ribbon, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single dominant stake—inherit the forbidden knowledge—tightens once in the marble bathroom when comprehension forecloses the option to refuse. Escalation is accumulative: each odd structure (tea-steaming kitchen, future nursery) deepens density until stance crystallizes. Cost is legible: eternal curatorship with no exit page.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—retrieve Thessaly—tightens when Mira learns retrieval itself is the violation. One meaningful reversal: rescue missions are the aggression, not the solution. Cost is legible: Mira forfeits the right to leave unchanged, accepting an unmeasurable teaching debt. The off-page time-traveler warning slightly blunts her agency (he initiates the renegotiation prompt), holding the score just below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“recover or relinquish the forgotten name”—is signaled in paragraph 2 and escalates when sister confesses “I’ve been trying to forget,” converting search into rescue. One meaningful tightening: invented storytelling becomes the only tactic to solidify the sister; options narrow to speak or lose forever. Cost is legible (sister flickers, Maya risks re-forgetting), but the price feels more optical than visceral—no tangible resource lost. Agency remains causal and protagonist-driven under the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—restore severed connection—tightens when tangled braids threaten permanent failure; her success rings the bell, audible cost campus-wide. Agency is continuous; no coincidence resolves. Could use one visceral risk (splinter, dizziness) to push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“find the quiet in the storm”—is signaled early and tightens when every echo fails. The spiral ice-crack pattern delivers the single meaningful deepening that narrows options toward the hidden chamber. Cost is felt in her obsolete skin-knowledge and the final bodily exhaustion. Agency is sustained attention and mapping labor rather than a single decisive act; under Accumulative lens this suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—prove coincidences have meaning and decide whether to relight—is signaled early. Pressure tightens when neglecting the beacon risks total darkness, narrowing her practical option to one. Cost is visible: she forfeits isolation and accepts an un-tracked influx of survivors. Agency is hers; no coincidence resolves the core problem, only her final strike of the flint. Escalation is single but sufficient for 700-word arc.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—collect the gilded hush or retreat to bunker reflex—is signaled inside 50 words and pressured by gravity inversion. One meaningful tightening occurs when she fights contraction mid-air; the inverted pull literalizes her interior tug-of-war and visibly prices her steady landing. No overt antagonist is needed; the stakes are embodied: each silence harvested makes the doll heavier and her next step riskier. Cost stays legible: she lands “steady for the first time,” proving the old panic has been paid off in breath and balance.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—create a gentler silence—tightens once: the vial’s opening irreversibly forfeits both artifact and old acoustic order. Pressure is textural: each descriptive layer (light, hush, crystal spiral) raises the emotional ante until the final reconfiguration. No visible external antagonist, but the terrace’s own acoustic law supplies sufficient resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—legitimacy versus lore-keeping—tightens when the flake warms and the bark turns translucent, foreclosing retreat. Sunrise clock is visible price: “dawn approached…first rays would seal the passage.” Escalation is causal, not violent: each mural reduces wrong turns until only the central tree remains. Cost is legible—ruby dissolves, body ages, identity forfeits ruler fantasy.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“can Mira keep her emptiness intact?”—tightens the moment she lifts the ring. One meaningful deepening: the threshold dissolves, foreclosing permanent isolation. Cost is visible: her sanctuary must now accommodate passage in both directions. Under Causal lens, the escalation is clean; coincidence never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“can I convert shame into something real before the barriers collapse?”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened when the quantum promise demands a witness. Single meaningful escalation: volunteer-vow → torrent of parallel memories → diamonds scattered; cost is visceral (pressure felt in molars, trembling fingers). No reversals needed; accretive density suffices under Accumulative lens. The price paid—trauma compressed into saleable gems—alters her funding tactics, foreclosing return to ordinary anonymity.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—whether to perpetuate or dismantle the Ashworth myth—tightens when silence “speaks” the atrocities. One meaningful deepening: the empty spinning platter turns curiosity into culpability. Agency is renunciation rather than action, but cost is visible (tears, forfeited inheritance of meaning). Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens; no reversals needed.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“possibility vs certainty”—is signaled early; the unsnapping sequence tightens it by foreclosing martial identity. Cost (vulnerability under glowing web) is visible, but escalation is more atmospheric than tactical; one extra friction beat could sharpen the trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“magnify small kindnesses so they are not lost”—is signaled early; escalation occurs via button discovery that deepens the moral weight rather than narrows external options. No reversal or antagonist, but accumulative pressure suffices under Textural lens. Cost is conceptual (perpetual broken-hearted looking) rather than a tangible loss on-page, keeping it below 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—prevent forever-loss of true history—arrives early and recurs. One meaningful tightening: midnight deadline collapses 3-year plan into hours, forcing the premature upload. Cost is offloaded to unseen global audience rather than Mira’s body or future safety, so pressure feels moderated; still, her choice to stay embedded supplies credible agency.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—silence the prophecy—signals early and tightens once: the prophecy rises in her throat mid-performance, her counter-music must swallow it before speech escapes. Agency is cerebral (note-by-absence) but still forecloses the reproductive path off-page; on-page cost is the eerie nostalgia she pays while erasing her lineage’s voice. Escalation is textural: each absent note thickens the fog’s quiet vividness until the prophecy fragments. No external antagonist needed; coincidence absent.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“can the leaves mean anything or is her life empty?”—is signaled early and tightens when hush arrives: read now or never. Agency is attention/translation, not brute action; the probe-prod is the decisive micro-move that forecloses mere sorting. Cost is conceptual—she forfeits a life of mere categorization for uncertain guardianship of messages. Under Accumulative lens, density of monuments and slowing leaves supply pressure; coincidence is absent. Could use one tangible loss (a seed batch abandoned?) to sharpen price.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—her need for certainty versus the world’s refusal to yield it—tightens when the compass spins free. One decisive deepening: the logbook proves Admiral Chen embraced the same failure she’s fleeing, forcing her own pivot. Cost is visible: she leaves the underground “lighter” because she abandons the lifetime trade that gave her identity. Agency is hers alone: dig, read, decide, climb out un-counting hours.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake is internal: redeem father’s name without erasing imperfection. The only tightening comes when she embeds the coin—an irreversible act that forecloses alternative alloys—but this is a single, quiet choice rather than a rising sequence. No external antagonist or time-clock beyond the implied dawn; pressure is atmospheric (rain, furnace heat, village memory) rather than tactical. Cost is conceptual—accepting visible cracks—so the escalation is legible under Accumulative lens yet modest in scope.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—decode then subvert the mathematics of mercy—signals early and tightens when the forest’s numeric pollen offers proof of rationed suffering. One meaningful deepening: realizing she is a rounding error gives her agency to become the glitch that rewrites the algorithm. Escalation is accumulative: each UV wave delivers more data, more bodily cost. No coincidence; all pressure sourced in the forest’s revealed calculus and her enhanced perception.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—exposing hidden truth versus walking away—is signaled in paragraph 1. One meaningful tightening: ghost’s request narrows Miriam’s options from appraisal to preservation. Cost is present but soft—she merely amends her report; no credible loss (money, client, time) is dramatized. Agency is hers, yet the external pressure feels gentle; escalation obeys causal lens but lacks visceral price.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—library’s perfect stasis vs. awakened change—is signaled in paragraph three (“Perfect systems… afraid to change”) and tightens through the frost’s rupture pattern. One meaningful deepening: the whisper’s release escalates from abstract threat to literal crack propagating through glass. Cost is visible—Maren loses her press and the library loses lift—yet the price feels slightly diffuse because the library, not Maren, pays the larger freight. Still, agency is hers alone and the escalation is irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—join or lose the vanished civilization—is signaled early (“she wanted only to understand”). Escalation is a single, meaningful tightening: uncovering the mirror forecloses scholarly detachment and triggers physical dissolution into the temporal stream. Cost is visible—her body disperses, research notes abandoned. Agency is hers; no coincidences resolve plot. Could edge higher if the council’s opposition had pressed her in-scene, but off-page antagonists keep pressure abstract yet still coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“reclaim the light before midnight claims it forever”—is signaled early and tightens when each night the chip dims. Mid-story reversal: the music itself halts because Elias’s hidden wish introduces a moral impurity, forcing either abandon or honest surrender. Escalation is causal under the Accumulative/Textural lens: each added box increases harmonic density until the dishonesty pattern breaks. Cost is the stone’s erasure and the irreversibility of death.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“find the place where explanations fail”—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when the compass starts to spin. The meaningful deepening occurs at the psychometry beat: knowledge that Vennard’s team stopped looking back forecloses Maren’s own exit, turning curiosity into irreversible commitment. Cost is visible in the final renunciation; the escalation is single but sufficient for 700 words. Lacks a second external obstacle, hence stays shy of 9.0 band.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—join or ignore cross-era alliance—tightens three times: GPS death, slide-layer reveal, bridge-shadow exit; each escalation is driven by her attention choices under storm pressure. Cost is loss of autonomous artistry; legible on page.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—answering “why darkness?”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened when mural palette shifts to blue-charcoal, committing her to serve the sleepless. Each postcard reread and dawn vigil costs time and emotional labor, price legible in “quietly driven” repetition. No coincidence; escalation is her escalating gift—first study, then paint, then perpetual welcome. Final image of strangers recognizing themselves is earned stasis with undeniable social cost: her privacy gone, pavilion now communal shrine.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. erasure—tightens with each decoded page until the only live option is to document Josefina’s proof in person. The lagoon confrontation re-stages the 2089 parley, forcing Celeste to choose between archival neutrality and witness; her recording device becomes the new driftwood message. Cost is visceral: dehydration, sun-scorch, and the irreversible breach of classified history.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“can the village live without magic?”—is signaled early and tightens when Mira decides to commune rather than extract. One meaningful deepening: the fisherman’s true wish reframes the problem from “restore stone” to “restore agency.” Cost is legible: Mira forfeits exclusive ownership of the memories and her own settled life. Escalation is causal and suffices for 600-word scale.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve past vs. speak future—signaled early. Pressure intensifies when apples spell coordinate code; option space narrows from “archive” to “become prophecy.” Cost legible: she kneels, writes glowing cuneiform, accepts unending responsibility. No external antagonist; internal conflict suffices at this length. Escalation is accumulative deepening rather than causal reversal; still satisfies one meaningful tightening rule.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—can she access the inheritance without erasing it—signalled at paragraph 2 and tightened by the risk of “dissolution.” Escalation is textural: each sensory echo (hum, starlight, spiral) increases density until refusal to melt becomes active choice rather than passive preservation. No external antagonist is needed; entropy itself is the pressure. Cost is visible—“vortex now lived within her blood”—a bodily price that forecloses normal mortality.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—can silence itself become signal?—tightens as readings converge; the microclimate’s steadying is the visible price tracker. The single reversal is the rope’s transformation from preserved relic to active instrument; the bell’s soft resonance forecloses Mira’s former life of loud warnings. Escalation is textural rather than causal: density of stillness increases until the release is inevitable. Cost is conceptual but undeniable—the listening world now expects nothing louder than this hush.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—remain vs. leave— is signaled early; pressure deepens through accreted solitude and bodily wear, but no new external complication arrives tonight. The single meaningful tightening is dawn’s approach: daylight forces her to withdraw, underscoring that her vigil is cyclically finite; cost is felt in aching joints and the world’s indifference, yet the beat is familiar, not revelatory.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve unspoken words—tightens through each ghost deposition; the mother-ghost’s wordless plea is the visible escalation that forces Maren’s micro-choice to accept another stone. Cost is palpable: forearms bruised by box weight, future labor of eventual delivery. No reversal, but the deepening accumulation under Accumulative lens satisfies the single required intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—decode Elena’s method before her own time expires—signaled early. Tightening occurs when Vera realizes the listings are temporal coordinates; this deepens her mission and forecloses passive cataloging. Cost is visible: she trades her remaining years for continuous encoding labor. Agency is accumulative rather than causal, fitting the lens; no external antagonist needed. Sufficient for length, though a second tightening beat would lift it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—beauty discovered in incompleteness—tightens once when Mira must decide whether to hoard or gift the flawed feather. The boy’s disappointment supplies external pressure, but the escalation is textural (pattern accretion) rather than causal narrowing; options don’t narrow so much as deepen. Cost is present but soft—she gives away solitude, yet the price is felt more than declared. Sufficient for 600-word scope, but not quite the visible-forfeit that would push 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—time running out—tightens every beat; copper wrapping is tangible tactic against expiry. One meaningful deepening: shift from solitary caretaker to communal teacher, foreclosing rest option. Cost is visible fatigue (trembling hands) and ultimate forfeiture of future knowledge. Agency stays internal yet architecturally externalized; coincidence absent.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.7)
    The dominant stake—will Mira keep her skeptical armor—tightens once when the amber’s message redefines her former papers as “artificial” pilgrimages themselves; the cost is her publicly changed mind, but the beat is single and internal, so escalation is more accretive than spiked. Pressure stays coherent under the accumulative lens; no reversal is required.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—battlefield reclamation through off-grid botany—signalled early. Escalation is accumulative: each evening’s seed release increases mineral-fed floral density, narrowing options toward lifelong commitment. Visible cost is the slow surrender of Erasmus’s remaining years to nightly ritual; felt in “he would return tomorrow, and the day after….” No external antagonist, but reef death / time become coherent pressures. Agency is iterative yet real; final stance crystallizes as Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—mother/daughter distance—tightens from abstract loss to concrete mileage on the map. One meaningful deepening: the moment Marta realizes the leaf is intact, the stakes flip from mourning to pursuit; the option to stay in Crag Hollow is foreclosed by her first eastward step. Cost is visible: she trades physical safety and community for uncertain terrain. No external antagonist needed; the pressure is internal/territorial and sufficient under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—turn exile into meaningful exploration—tightens when the arriving ship offers rescue, forcing Mira to choose between reunion and continued documentation. The tightening is single but meaningful: sketch first, greet second. Under Accumulative lens, pressure rises through the density of recorded nights rather than causal reversals; the cost is the perpetual slow solitude she elects to keep. No coincidence resolves the moment; the ship merely externalizes the choice she has already made. Visible price: she finishes the anniversary sketch before acknowledging the ship, forfeiting immediate rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—save master—signaled in paragraph two; pressure tightens when each chess piece swap reveals a secret that could lock him out. Agency lies in listening/positioning; cost is knowledge of intimate sins and the implied exposure if he fails. Escalation stays causal under the lens; no coincidence resolves. Could wish for one tangible loss (time, frostbite) to sharpen price; as is, cost is emotional, still legible.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: will she keep monetizing trauma or risk unpaid remembrance? Pressure escalates by accretion: each empty month, each drill, each walked name layers weight until the single micro-turn—she carves herself a pawn and sets it down. No antagonist needed; the council’s silence and her own economic precarity supply coherent force. Cost is visible: she forfeits the “invaluable” paycheck and embraces the gallery’s unpaid silence.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—recovering fluency versus bearing the grief it carries—is signaled early and tightens through accumulative design: each dawn erasure raises the cost of retrying. The feather-introduced reversal (language must be walked, not read) narrows options to bodily inscription, foreclosing mental retrieval. Persistent price—sunset amnesia—alters every tactic and is felt again in the closing hurt. One meaningful intensification suffices; no external antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—can Marcus relinquish guilt—tightens once: the decoded path demands he offer up the knight. Agency is interior but visible: thread-by-thread decoding is the active tactic. No coincidence; escalation is accumulative/textural: suspended time accumulates pressure until mirror confronts him with irretrievable cost. Price—ceding the knight and accepting that the village resumes living—lands on page.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve maternal complexity—tightens when dawn light breaks and Sera must choose single vs. refracted truth. One meaningful escalation: the poets’ hidden rehearsals convert ambient acoustics into tactical advantage, narrowing Elders’ options to silence. Cost is visible: ritual authority nullified, Sera exposed to unspecified reprisal. Agency remains hers throughout; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—make the daughter’s absence into something that holds light—is signaled early and re-announced at climax. One meaningful tightening: the forty-third mark (mother’s silence) hurts so acutely she gasps, forcing the final confession and the charm’s shattering. Cost is paid on-page: charm gone, workshop permanently altered, emotional pain confessed. No escalation artifacts; coincidence is absent; agency is hers throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“keep creating until the colors run out”—is signaled early and tightens when the cave’s impermanence (tide, ancient art) forces a live choice: paint now or lose the moment. The meaningful turn is the unpremeditated fusion of shell-sunset into the canvas; this narrows his future back to forward-motion rather than nostalgic rehearsal. Cost is visible: the painting will leave with him, the chamber will flood—impermanence embraced. Agency is renunciation/endorsement of fragmentation, not external victory.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—create a beacon for returning drowned souls—signaled on first page and tightens each time a call adds coordinates. One meaningful escalation: the recognition that the caller is her future self crystallizes the cost; the option to ever leave the station is foreclosed. Agency is continuous: she scavenges, plots angles, bleeds on glass. Persistent constraint—failed hydraulics—shapes every tactical pivot. Price is visible: shredded palms, lifelong solitude, the final “keep the light burning” oath.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—psychological safety via silence—tightens when the relic offers choice but only under death-sentence risk. One meaningful escalation: the successful lie forecloses isolation as sole strategy and launches the smuggling mission. Cost is legible: she weeps, then accepts execution risk. No redundancy; each storm-loss and cable-snap raises stakes without repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will the stranger’s silence be given voice?—tightens once: the discovery of the empty seventh-day pattern converts passive reading into active writing, foreclosing Elias’s option to remain mere witness. Cost is conceptual but felt: by filling the blank he adopts the stranger’s bereavement, trading borrowed memories for owned grief. No coincidence; escalation is purely accumulative pattern-break. Could edge higher if a visible external loss (time, physical risk) were dramatized on page, but lyrical design legitimates the interior price.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single dominant stake—decode the promise or surrender to lifelong solitude—tightens when the arch offers literal alternate lives. One visible price is paid: she loses her world (shop, city life) the moment she stays past the waterline. Escalation is causal: each discovery (chip, ants, arch) forecloses retreat; coincidence only reveals, never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—will she face the truth and move to vengeance?—is signaled early (“I need to know why”). Escalation under causal lens: oracle’s blunt accusation → simultaneous firefly sign → memory unlocked narrows stance to action. Agency is internal (accepting memory, planning purge) with on-page cost (loss of seven-year denial). No coincidence resolves pressure; fireflies complicate, oracle clarifies. Stakes remain personal, not abstract kingdom peril; intensity suits 800-word frame.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can she keep presence without destroying it?—is signaled in paragraph 3. One meaningful tightening: Theo voices the real fear (“You want to understand why we can’t stay”), forcing her to trade capture for participation; shell transfer is the visible price. Pressure escalates under causal lens: each calibration of the pocket-sun raises emotional temperature until the flare forces relinquishment. No coincidence; no abstract stakes—loss of the shell is concrete. Cost is legible; persistent constraint established (she leaves without her talisman).

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: can she live forward while knowing her ending? Pressure tightens when jealousy of her past dreaming-self forces the choice to climb anyway. No external antagonist; escalation is accretive—each scroll layers cost until stance crystallizes. Visible price: surrender of linear certainty, accepted on page. Agency satisfies lens: her decision to write toward death narrows future options.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: can Elena restore a lineage tool and, by extension, Margaret’s self-forgiveness? Pressure tightens when the screw’s botched cleaning is revealed as mother-daughter misunderstanding, not mere rust. Elena’s agency is her decision to use jeweler’s precision instead of industrial solvent—this micro-turn forecloses her own retreat into anonymity and costs her time/stamina on the page. Cost is visible: she hands over the clamp for “come back and tell me,” forfeiting immediate payment and exposing her loneliness.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—will she master the ice or be mastered—signalled at “tried to remember how to breathe.” Escalation is micro but causal: each flare of frost forces a tighter stillness, narrowing options to inscribe or shatter. Agency is decision to write on living skin—cost is physical (cold crackle) and social (scar now legible). Persistent constraint (ice) shapes ritual tactics; no coincidence resolves. Missing a sharper external consequence within the scene keeps it from 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—unravel illusions to unify perception—is declared early but remains philosophical; no concrete resource (time, safety, identity) is placed at risk. Pressure escalates texturally: each spiral layer deepens mood rather than threatening loss or foreclosing a path. The protagonist’s agency is contemplative—reading aloud, witnessing glow—without a decision that costs her or alters tactics. Cost finally appears as global word-erasure, but it is cosmically bestowed, not chosen or gambled. The conflict therefore feels like revelation rather than crucible; tension is aesthetic, not jeopardy-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“to understand what clocks really measure”—is signaled early and deepens through iterative exposure to anomalies (upward-flowing water, off-scale hums). Escalation is Accumulative: each backward count intensifies the lattice anomaly until options collapse to either stay (remain ignorant) or step through (pay the price of vanishing). The tightening is single but meaningful; cost is conceptual rather than visceral—he forfeits reality itself. Agency is intellectual (the decision to keep counting) and the irreversible consequence is dramatized on-page, fulfilling the closure requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“understand the physics of letting go”—is signaled early and tightens once: from wanting release to accepting permeable retention. The meaningful turn is micro but decisive: pressing the laser button the second time after decoding the notebooks. Cost is felt (tears, tomorrow’s obligations) yet not materially lossy;持久 constraints are absent. Sufficient for 8-band, shy of 8.8+ which wants a steeper price or option foreclosure.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Margot will repeat her father’s search for pattern in chaos—tightens when she finds his handwritten GPS under the gambler’s paradox quote. One meaningful escalation suffices: the archive folder reveals his failed self-cure, forcing her stance crystallization. Cost is legible in the decision to assume the debt and continue the hunt. The pressure plate is single but weight-bearing; no reversal is needed for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“will Maya let herself be known?”—is signaled early and tightens once: from courier to co-architect of the cure. The ivy’s slow engulfment literalizes growing pressure; her offer to distribute the compound is an irreversible trade of anonymity for connection. Cost is felt (“unfamiliar and terrifying”) but could be sharper—no immediate resource or timeline lost on page. Escalation is coherent under the causal lens, not luck-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—map the stillpoint—tightens once: arrival forces the choice to keep or reject neutrality. The tightening is singular but sufficient for 750-word scope; cost is visible (she forfeits eternal calm). Agency drives every beat: dowsing, mapping, renouncing.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.2)
    One dominant stake—can she retro-absolve genocide—tightens in a single but decisive escalation: the arrival of the pre-causal Kepler question collapses her option space to one act: edit & resend. Cost is visible: the rebrightened star is paired with her permanent epistemic uncertainty. No coincidence resolves; anomaly mechanics were pre-established. The beat qualifies for 9+ under Causal lens with persistent constraint (time-fold remains, she stays uncertain).

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—save the harbor—signals early through Elena’s whispered warning of demolition vote. One meaningful deepening occurs when teaching silence turns abstract hobby into political ammunition, narrowing Elena’s rhetorical options to a single risky gambit. Pressure stays textural: every practiced hand-shape increases the felt cost of potential failure. The price is on-page: Mira sacrifices her anonymity while Elena gambles her insider power—tactics visibly altered by the new linguistic constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—keep the promise or be swallowed by ordinary guilt—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when demolition forces the burn. Escalation is causal: each because/therefore linkage strips away external options until only descent remains. The final narrowing is the irrevocable cost of surfacing. Price is visible and felt, though the middle beat could sharpen one tactical loss (tool, time, social credit) to reach the 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—liberate/transmute Elias’s trapped consciousness—signaled in paragraph 3. Middle tightening occurs when garden responds to drumming: option narrows to “keep playing or abandon him forever.” Price is her solitude and future compliance with lab tests. Agency is continuous (night violation, climb, percussive ritual); no coincidence; escalation is density-driven, coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.5)
    Single stake: will Celia expose or protect the labyrinth’s hidden archive? Escalation is one gear-shift: the key-map template collapses infinite paths into a single worker-only corridor. Cost is oblique—she forfeits exclusive custodianship, but the forfeiture is understated, legible only in her whispered acceptance of the man’s gratitude.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: will the boy succumb to the canal’s darkness? Escalation is textural—each shutter pattern increases density of attention until a single beam lands on his heart, narrowing option from water to starlight. Her agency is the weave; cost is the eternal vigil she recommits to at the end. No external coincidence; pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length and is delivered when the mirror dot touches him—final proof darkness can hold stars.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stake—save imaginative kids from numeric erasure—arrives early and tightens once: the decision to leave the board behind abandons her eleven-year refuge, a visible price. Escalation is situational: external pressure (mayor’s rally) compresses timing, but the protagonist’s agency is preparatory rather than confrontational, fitting the “amplified quiet” contract. No second reversal is needed for this length; the deepening happens in the moment she relinquishes the queen, foreclosing retreat. Cost is legible on the page: “She finished her preparations and climbed back… leaving her chess set behind.”

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—will her private grief ritual survive the drone eye?—tightens each sweep of the blade. No reversals needed; pressure escalates by texture: bouquet crumbles, figurines multiply, turbines keep vigil. Agency is renunciation/steadfastness; carving the 17th figure is the visible price. Cost is unmistakable: the unsmiling jaw muscles, the splintered fingertips we never see bandaged.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: can art reclaim sacred space without re-triggering ban? Pressure tightens when quartz responds—sound-to-light shift proves words still dissolve walls, foreclosing retreat. Agency: she decides to read aloud, accepting possible re-exile; lake crack externalizes cost. Escalation is textural: humming intensifies, moths arrive, boundary visibly opens. No coincidence; every turn is triggered by her paraphrased verses. Price legible—once glow spreads, silence cannot be restored.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“see what I’ve been missing”—is declared upfront and sharpened by Theo’s warning that sight may destroy her palette. Single meaningful tightening: the moment brass touches eyelids forecloses the safety of muted tones forever. Cost is visceral—tears, overloaded retinas, the word “exploded.” Agency is hers; she kneels, offers, chooses. No external antagonist needed; the risk is internal ruin, and it lands.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—can she feel connection without touch?—is signaled on page 1 and tightens once: the empty recording forces the stance crystallization. Each station is a micro-turn that raises the cost of continued solitude; no reversal is needed under Accumulative lens. The final bell-ringing is not a solution but an unending endurance whose price is infinite unanswered vibration. Cost is visible: her body aches, her tears fall, the city stays dark—meets 8.8+ requirement for on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: can grief be re-made into communal healing without erasing loss? Pressure tightens once: Elara’s first crane is clumsy, her last is carried toward a new visitor—her agency narrows options from isolation to responsibility. Cost is felt: she forfeits numbness, accepts the ache of teaching. No external antagonist needed; internal conflict is externalized through folded paper recruiting the living.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can cultural pattern-mapping survive encounter with the anomaly it studies?—tightens when Marcus, archetype of her dataset, spontaneously selects the outlier card. Escalation is causal: each prior measurement forecloses interpretation models; the Moon draw collapses her theoretical wall between observer and subject. Price is immediate—her final journal entry now includes the unquantifiable. One decisive turn suffices at this length; no artificial reversals required.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is purified memory vs. intact self; tightening occurs when sphere activation risks Netharan emptiness. Agency visible: she chooses random spiral path, speaks chaotic words—each act raises irreversible stakes. Cost crystallizes in the line “she could never return to who they were before.” Escalation is single but sufficient for 700-word arc; no outside coincidence dilutes pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve hope-shapes—tightens once: confirming the shadow’s independence collapses Vera’s prior tactic of mere cataloging, forcing material sacrifice. Escalation is accumulative: each dusk’s wandering darkness incrementally raises the stakes until the comparison footage crystallizes the threat. Cost is legible on-page: the stone’s loss and the enduring ache of “luminous regret.” Slight deduction: no secondary material loss (time, social credit) to vary pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—moral self-respect vs. complicity—is signaled inside 50 words and tightens with every board removed. One meaningful deepening: realizing “some rescues must have been real” crystallizes the salvageable fragment of identity, narrowing her option from collapse to surgical repair. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens; no external antagonist needed—the wrecked cage and preserved tail are the hostile objects. Cost is visible: sleepless labor, shredded palms, irreversible loss of innocence.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—keep the plant telepathy vs. lose it—signaled in line 1; meaningful tightening when Mira decides to tunnel out before second surgery. Cost is legible: forfeiting medical safety, embracing underground uncertainty. Agency drives every beat; coincidence only complicates (fern senses approach) but does not resolve. Persistent constraint—the still-running plant channel—shapes tactics and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—release versus recovery of pooled love—tightens once, when Vera senses the room of hanging strips and recognizes the strip belongs there, not to her. The tightening is internal and sufficient for lyric length; cost is loss of the hoped-for retrieval, paid on-page (“tears cooling on her cheeks”). No coincidence, no external antagonist; pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens. Would climb higher if a mid-text micro-choice had risked tangible consequence (e.g., tearing the strip).

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—restore creativity—tightens when she sees the collector’s “gossamer threads” and realizes the valley’s starvation. One decisive turn of the dial forecloses her option to keep the power; cost is felt in the instant collapse of the tool and her own exile on the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—"every lost possibility matters"—is signaled early, but pressure is atmospheric, not tactical: no time limit, no antagonist, no resource at risk. Escalation is a single deepening at the crest when she decides to stabilize the child; the cost (flowers dim) is environmental, not personal. Agency is present but low-heat; the story favors wonder over jeopardy. Situational lens suffices, yet the tightening is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—pursuit of insight via unbuffered straying—tightens when she risks her last talisman to save a dying consciousness. Agency is accumulative: her attention (listening) → micro-choice (swap gear) → irreversible cost (no suppressant safety, no talisman). Price is legible on-page: “the tree would live. She had unraveled another boundary.” One-step escalation suffices for lyric short form; the tightening forecloses return to academic detachment.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming unused courage—is signaled in the title image and tightens through each star-punch mark; the final gathering of flames is the visible price that forecloses lifelong regret. Escalation is textural: pattern density increases until the horizon blaze reweights meaning. No external antagonist needed; pressure is situational-coherent. Cost is unmistakable—the flames warm her chest, proving the transfer from potential to lived bravery.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single dominant stake—“Is silence bearable if it buys life?”—tightens through two material tests: reading the dust-word (risk of being consumed) and turning the bolt (risk of lethal storms). Each escalation is protagonist-driven; the price is visceral: Mira’s nerves fire “red and orange” behind her eyes as she pays in pain for every incremental gain toward song.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—prevent false coronation—is signaled by line 4. Single tightening: discovery of misfiled genealogy forecloses Mira’s neutrality; once evidence is assembled, inaction becomes impossible. Cost is conceptual (erosion of legitimacy) rather than visceral, satisfying the Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—why the routes vanished—tightens when personal culpability overlays climate narrative. The mid-story micro-turn: “Every bleaching site overlays dumping grounds” narrows Marina’s options from scientist to whistle-blower with undeniable reputational/familial cost. Pressure accrues under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves it. Persistent constraint: the poison lies beneath her own sampled reefs, forcing the通宵 transmission that ends the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“someone needed to remember why they had started fighting”—is signaled early and tightens when the stones’ hum forces a stance crystallization: continue as witness-carrier or stay in passive stargazing. The meaningful deepening is the shift from searching the sky for signs to pointing the glasses at her comrades’ fires; this narrows her options from cosmic to communal. Cost is felt: she will walk tomorrow “barefoot and bearing this gift,” accepting physical discomfort as the price of reignition. No coincidence resolves the lull; the stones merely reprice it.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve sacred memory inside rebuilt infrastructure—tightens once: singing shatters the glass and forecloses anonymity; the audible mineral dust is the felt price that reweights the stake under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake: daily survival-and-care under ongoing trauma threat. Escalation is accumulative: each sensory cue (hawk, fog lift, photo) tightens the somatic vise, deepening the cost of staying. No external antagonist; pressure is internal weather. One visible price—photo returned to pocket—cements tomorrow’s risk and renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—artistic identity versus marketable unity—tightens when every failed portrait costs clientele; the lighthouse’s contracting walls externalize that pressure. One meaningful deepening: the moment she realizes fragmentation is ontology, not failure, forecloses the path of “fixing” faces and narrows options to prism-making. Escalation is accumulative: dust motes → salt light → walls inching inward → lantern flare; each layer ups the cost of clinging to singular likeness. Visible price paid: she forfeits her portfolio of commercial “failures” and embraces an aesthetics of multiplicity with no patrons waiting.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prove the ink-time warp and master it—is signaled in paragraph two and escalates when the ink actually begins disappearing under her eyes, forcing the choice to watch rather than intervene. Cost is visible: she sacrifices a potential sample to confirm the pattern, narrowing her future to a solo hunt. Pressure intensifies under Accumulative lens: each prior eclipse site’s ink echoed the same fade; this one completes the proof and locks her course. No coincidence; wind and eclipse shadows are environmental antagonists she cannot tame.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—expose vs. protect mother—signals early; upload act deepens cost by foreclosing secrecy. Pressure tightens from silence of snow to live network hum; coincidence (Vance arrival) complicates but does not resolve. Price is legible: mother now hostage, Mira’s career/fate forfeited. Escalation is one decisive turn, sufficient for 600-word scope under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: will Mira repeat or repudiate her father’s violence? One tightening: she reaches for knife, then sheathes it; option foreclosed. Cost is visible—she risks welcoming a wounded enemy—but external threat stays abstract; soldier’s desperation never endangers her life, muting escalation. Still, the refusal is causal under Accumulative lens and pays into the final poise.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—hear the drowned daughter’s last words—is signaled in graf 4 and tightened once: silence is the only remaining option. Agency is renunciation rather than assault; by voicing nothing Maren forecloses blame and accepts release. Pressure is situational but coherent—garden, goddess, and constellates each amplify the cost of not-knowing. No coincidence resolves; the echo arrives as direct consequence of her silence, leaving her changed.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—whether to expose or conceal the near-miss—tightens when she realises the asteroid passes tomorrow. One meaningful escalation: verification of the 17,000 km miss converts abstract guilt to immediate ethical fork. Agency is decision, not action heroics; the cost is lifelong complicity. Coincidence (asteroid timing) complicates rather than rescues; tension stays internal and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—hushing the dissonance of three-generation guilt—is signaled in the first third and tightens through each frequency translation. The single meaningful deepening occurs when the amber insect twitches, narrowing Vera’s options to one final tattoo; cost is the amber’s death-stillness and her own chest-release. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens: every salvaged sound adds weight until the fold is forced to reweight meaning. No reversal is needed; the stance crystallization is the quiet dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—discover meaning before universal silence—signals early. Tightening occurs when tile’s hum forces a stance: abandon art or embrace listening; this narrows options under accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual but legible: acceptance that creations will scatter yet must still be made. Old man’s initial resistance supplies pressure; his quick conversion lessens the final trade-off’s bite.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—can tenderness survive annihilation?—signalled in paragraph one and tightened when she decides to carve rather than hide. Aberrant mercy becomes a visible tactic: she risks execution to inscribe Emre Kayan, narrowing her own options. Cost is dramatized—tears freeze, arms ache, she slips back into ruins—fulfilling the 8.8+ gate. One beat short of 9+: we do not see regime patrols or time-pressure literally close in, so price feels conceptual more than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure escalates through pattern-break: successive historical shards pile nostalgic weight until the woman’s indigo pool visually lightens. Agency is shared—the ghost curates echoes, the woman chooses to stand—creating a mutual escalation that forecloses the woman’s suicide option and reframes Madeline’s eternity. Cost is felt but abstract; a visible sacrifice (a lock of hair, a dropped coin) would have sharpened the stake into 9-band territory.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“find Daniel”—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens when each somatic marker forecloses ignorance. Mid-story micro-turn: wall cavity discovery forces immediate re-planning; cost is the physical drop in her stomach that confirms concealed knowledge. Escalation stays causal: each bodily cue narrows options until only pursuit remains. Final smile is not relief but acceptance of perpetual vigilance—an earned stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—record earth’s silent memory—meets rising counter-pressure: unknown intelligences now want to record her. Mid-story fossil pulse provides meaningful tightening; options narrow from solo mapping to reciprocal translation. Cost legible in her audible voice breaking months of silence, yet no tangible loss or irreversible forfeiture shown. Sufficient for length; lacks visceral price to push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“can she harvest a usable map before forgetting wins?”—is signaled early. Escalation is density-driven: each button adds legible information, narrowing possibility space until constellation locks. No visible price (blood, time-limit) is extracted on-page, so cost is conceptual rather than visceral—just sub-9. Protagonist agency pure: she chooses to keep climbing, foreclosing retreat to ignorance.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—will she answer Viktor’s coded plea?—is signaled early and tightens when “Watched. Come alone. Dawn” surfaces. Agency is continuous: decoding, walking, entering, accepting file. The tightening moment is the folder hand-off; it narrows her future to re-entry into the game. Cost is conceptual (she’ll carry treason’s knowledge) rather than visceral; a hair below high-band intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“will the crossing remain lethal?”—is signaled early; gutters serve as live pressure gauge. One meaningful tightening (silence of gutters) reweights stakes and forecloses retreat; cost is the coachman’s surrender of protective talisman. Protagonist agency is attention-based endurance rather than active heroics, fitting situational lens. No external antagonist needed; river itself is pressure. Escalation is modest but proportionate to 700-word scale; price is legible on page.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—why some places resist fracture—tightens when Serin realizes the disc actively chooses kindness timelines; her agency shifts from observation to participation (she will stay, wedge clay, join the choosing). Cost is legible: she forfeits her old nomadic life the moment her hands begin centering clay beside the disc. Under Accumulative lens the deepening occurs via pattern density rather than external opposition; still, one tightening beat is clearly met.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—how to keep showing up for life when endings keep coming—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is a single deepening: anonymous watcher becomes real, foreclosing her safe spectatorship. Cost is legible—shared visibility risks future eviction or heartbreak—but the tightening is gentle; no tangible resource is lost tonight. Sufficient for this length, yet a shade below high-band visceral trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are existential loneliness vs. future creation; the tightening occurs when the stone circle’s light fractures into “winged shapes,” transforming theoretical possibility into vulnerable beings Mira must choose to nurture or ignore. Agency is present—she places the dial, stays to write the guide—yet the decisive turn is partly gifted by the circle rather than wrested from her. Cost is legible (perpetual caretaking renewed, grief un-retired), but the external catalyst softens the band relative to purely self-driven escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—loss of authentic connection—signals early. One meaningful deepening: realization that the art installation offers “presence, not permanence” reweights her tactics and prompts her to write for herself. Escalation is textural: density of secrets in the water intensifies the cost of her own omission. Agency is renunciation/release; price is the dissolution of her own secret among strangers’.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—prevent community self-immolation—tightens when the board’s midnight demo vote gives her 47 min. One meaningful deepening: the realization that the beings are “farmers” of discord reframes her task from defense to sabotage. Agency remains causal: her counter-broadcast directly fractures the procession and the alien pattern. Price is legible—she forfeits normal life, welded inside a soon-to-be-razed tomb.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—access the archives—tightens once: the crawl is the irreversible cost that forecloses retreat. Pressure escalates under causal lens: each organ note raises stakes until the passage demands literal bodily payment. No coincidence; resolution is lock-and-key earned.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.0)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—preventing global weather catastrophe—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when Mira translates “reversible exile” into a 14-month countdown. Agency is intellectual, not physical: she chooses to question Torres, forcing the satellite-phone action that forecloses secrecy. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral—the world’s coastal populations remain abstract—so pressure is strong but not yet painful on the page. Still, the causal linkage (decode → warn → phone) cleanly escalates under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—reclaim the abandoned photographic life—tightens once: the map stabilizes only through the flake, forcing the choice to leave the bridge. Escalation is single-point but sufficient for 700 words; the step onto the trail forecloses the bridge identity with felt cost. No false intensifiers; coincidence (vanishing hitchhiker) complicates rather than resolves. Could use one micro-loss (coins left in fiddle case?) to sharpen tactics, but pressure is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—whether Elias will keep running or reconcile—tightens only once, when stone markers reappear at warehouse door; that micro-turn is textural, not causal, yet it reweights escape as invitation. Cost is felt through surrendered venture and returned exile to caboose, but the startup crash is off-page, muting price immediacy under the Accumulative lens. Still, agency remains his: he elects stasis beside father, foreclosing flight.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—decode or be broken like Marcus—tightens cleanly once the star-flux pattern locks into temple glyphs; the single meaningful deepening is the moment Delta Cephei’s four-day heartbeat resolves into syntax, narrowing her options to publish or perish. Stakes remain conceptual; no concrete external obstacle escalates after that point.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—recover the reflection/self—signaled in paragraph two. Mid-story tightening: the vine’s hunger could turn on her, narrowing options. Final cost is visible: lifespan already spent, vortex pacified but not destroyed, reflection restored yet older. Escalation is causal under the chosen lens; no coincidence rescues her.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—reaching the intersection of dreams—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightened when the shadow-door appears. Escalation is a single deepening: the maze rebuilds outward rather than upward, foreclosing physical escape and forcing collective decision. Cost is visible: Mira’s roots “strain,” anchoring her forever. Agency is shared—Mira plants, others link scars—but the final image reweights options for all eight.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“patch the hole in her soul”—is signaled in paragraph two and escalates when the Gardener reframes the price as perpetual uncertainty. One decisive tightening: the moment she accepts forty years of doubt forecloses any later appeal. Agency drives the turn; luck merely complicates. Cost is visible in the card’s disintegration and her grandmother’s off-page death.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—recovering self-worth after public collapse—tightens when the cloth forces Marcus to test his ‘facts as armor’ method against Val’s lived loss; the tightening is single but sufficient, foreclosing retreat to the trailer and raising the cost of continued emotional insulation.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—preserve wonder in a tomorrow-less world—is declared early. Pressure is ambient, not tightening; the fisherman’s arrival restates the problem without new risk. No visible resource lost, deadline advanced, or option foreclosed; escalation is lyrical accumulation rather than causal narrowing. Acceptable under Accumulative lens but lacks a felt trade-off to reach 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—voice the unsaid—tightens when each shell confession raises the cost of silence; Elena’s own inscription forecloses emotional bunkering. One meaningful deepening suffices; no external antagonist needed. Cost legible in abandoned clipboard and exposed heart.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness versus the need for external absolution—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is textural: each mention of river, ivy, or accordion adds density until the final squeeze of bellows crystallizes her stance. No external antagonist is required; pressure is the accretion of memory and whispered guilt. The meaningful tightening occurs when she decides to “chart her own course,” a renunciation that forecloses the old method of river-dictated absolution. Cost is legible in the broken chord and the empty station at dusk.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—find mother’s unspoken words—signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation is textural: each shelf color tightens emotional weight until crimson demands action. Agency is present (she traces, reads, speaks) but the decisive tightening—opening her own blank book—happens off-stage; we see the book already waiting rather than watching her confront the cost of filling it. Thus the price is legible but not viscerally paid in-scene, capping the score short of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—cultural survival vs imperial ownership—signalled in paragraph two and tightened when the promise’s glow literally fades. Escalation is driven by her decision to play once, foreclosing delivery and igniting war; price is immediate (violin lost, forsworn status). Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens: each reverb of song deepens the irreversible cost. Empire remains off-stage but the threatened burnings are viscerally priced on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—seizing the last spark before cosmic erasure—is signaled in the first paragraph and tightens when the static’s pattern begins to fade. Escalation is textural: aurora intensifies, static thins, time compresses to “perhaps minutes.” The tightening forces the infusion act and costs her prior emotional neutrality; the price is legible as the emerald sears flesh. No reversal, but the deepening suffuses her future work with sacramental dread—an earned, visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: can Mira bear the endless caretaker burden without breaking? Pressure accumulates through each warming of the pin and Theron’s flickering presence; no external antagonist needed. Tightening occurs when she realizes the pin will never cool—her path is sealed. Cost is felt in the final beat: she accepts perpetual loss of self-boundaries; agency is the conscious embrace of cycle rather than flight.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—permission to stop searching—signals early (line 9). Pressure tightens once: hollow mirror revealed → chime diagnosis → keeper reframes emptiness as space, foreclosing continued search. Cost legible on page: Sera’s shoulders “sat differently” and keeper absorbs fresh doubt into her own chime system. No reversals needed under accumulative lens; the single deepening reweights guilt into acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restore erased village—tightens when Vara realizes vanishing is collision, not subtraction; the second stone must amplify, risking over-write of herself or Elowen. Escalation is single but meaningful: withheld knowledge → interference vision → acceptance of agency. Cost is legible: Elowen’s youth drain and Vara’s future burden of reversing him. No coincidence; all pressure is teacher-student causality.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: will Vessa maintain her motionless vigil or relent? Pressure tightens when the wandering pulse appears, forcing her to expend her hoarded voice to guide the lost. The cost is immediate: decades of silence broken, dust cracked, succession triggered. One meaningful deepening suffices; the stakes remain visceral because the tower’s height literalizes every bodily risk.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“find meaning the machines can’t quantify”—tightens when she refuses to quantify the luminance. One meaningful deepening: crystal raised, then dropped back; option foreclosed, price registered. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens; each impossible corridor adds weight to her doubt. Cost is legible: she abandons the only tangible trophy.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—will Marcus access Elena’s hidden truth—tightens once: key → journal → vial → irreversible perception. Cost is visible: he forfeits ignorant peace, now condemned to see emotional chromatics. Agency is entirely his; coincidence (dry library) complicates but doesn’t resolve. One meaningful deepening suffices; no second reversal required at this length. Could edge 8.2 if a mid-scene obstacle had threatened to deny him the vial, forcing a harder trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“wavelength align with purpose” vs. annihilation—is signaled early and tightens through each casting. The penultimate throw that yields the backwards sentence is the single visible escalation; cost is conceptual (accepting dissolution) rather than viscerally felt. No live option is foreclosed on-page, keeping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can she survive loving the dead without being consumed—tightens when the naming ritual forces a trade: keep duty but carry visible grief. One meaningful deepening: shift from passive haunting to active voicing of unfinished phrases. Escalation is textural density: each completed sentence spawns a new crystal, making regret physically cumulative. Cost legible: the glass creatures are permanent weight in her cloak.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—restart cosmic flow—signaled paragraph 3. Escalation is textural: silence honey-thick → hairline mapping → drip begins → new current forms; each stage densifies failure cost. Agency visible in micro-choices (silk instruments, pour understanding). No reversal, but deepening reweights stakes from “fix universe” to “enable one drop,” price is public mediocrity affirmed.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—control over the town’s memory—tightens when each photo narrows her myth’s escape route. Agency visible: she chooses to climb to the station, to look, to speak the truth aloud; each step forfeits the martyr story. Cost legible: the silence after “He left” is the loss of 37 yrs of shield. Escalation causal under lens; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—final integration of logic & intuition—is signaled early and escalates through escalating pattern density rather than external blocks. The starlings’ return marks the single tightening beat: choice becomes inevitable, cost visible (crystal lost). No antagonist is needed; pressure is situational and coherent. Could use one intermediate obstacle to test her commitment before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—trust in the watcher’s word versus thousands of lives—tightens when partial evacuation is chosen, narrowing options: she cannot retract once she admits uncertainty. Escalation is one deepening, not multiple reversals: data refusal to resolve → civic panic risk → her six-hour vigil. Cost is visible social friction (“panic”) and personal forfeiture of inherited certainty. Agency is decision-based; coincidence absent. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes again, keeping score just under the 8.5 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.6)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—creative autonomy vs. corporate assimilation—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the corpse flower seed reframes her timeline from quarterly profit to decadal bloom. The single meaningful turn is the decision to weaponize patience itself: an unsolvable escape room that will devalue Magnus’s metric-driven offer. The cost is legible—she forgoes immediate millions and embraces uncertainty—but the tightening beat is narrated rather than dramatized in scene, keeping it just shy of the 8+ visceral tier.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“can grief be un-made?”—is signaled in paragraph two and narrows to a single physical test: can off-key song soften calcified silence. Escalation is Accumulative: each cracked lullaby increases acoustic density until the photographs flutter and the cord vibrates; failure would mean permanent muteness. The visible price is paid on-page—voice breaks, tears salt the floor, and the final silence is fuller precisely because it has been hollowed out by sound. No external antagonist needed; pressure is coherent and internal.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: escape vs. acceptance of the garden’s twilight. One meaningful tightening—pendant’s arrival forces Maren to choose between frozen safety and the risk of company. Escalation is textural: mist thickens, whispers swell, the woman’s tears unlock Maren’s own thaw. Cost is visible: she forfeits the protective stillness she has spent seventeen years swallowing.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake— Petra’s harness— is declared early; each approximation tightens Maren’s dwindling options from crude heat to life-essence payment, escalating under causal lens. The reversal is microscopic yet decisive: the crozier’s shiver after syllable adjustment signals the metal’s consent, flipping failure into possibility. Cost is cumulative and visible—exhaustion, frost, life-essence—so the final blade arrives already paid for. Empire law is the off-stage antagonist; its pressure is constant, never solved by luck.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—access cosmic silence—tightens when filter-removal narrows her option back to zero: either embrace the wordless hush or fail. Agency drives the escalation: she physically reverses amplification cascade, stakes her life on a fall from the platform, and pays with the loss of human voice-centric meaning. Cost is visible on-page: the scream-shaped static collapses into weighted silence that cloaks her shoulders. Enough for 8.1, but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt, keeping it shy of 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake = rescue the passengers by merging timelines; signaled in paragraph 3. Escalation occurs once: realization that hourglass can pour time back → instant bodily cost when she splits. Agency is hers; coincidence complicates (ferry horn, radio voices) but does not resolve. Cost is visible—her selves split and she stays exiled aboard—satisfying the 8.8+ price test. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens; no second tightening beat, so just reaches 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—claim or be claimed by the fever-gallery—is signaled early and tightens with every vanished doorway. Escalation is textural: each new deception increases perceptual cost (disorientation, memory doubt). The decisive turn—she begins gathering thread, refusing further consumption—carries felt price: she sacrifices the grandiose original for a pocket-sized sovereignty. No false coincidence; pressure accrues through pattern, not twist.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will she surrender terrestrial navigation for star-geometry?—is signaled early. One tightening: realization that ‘horizons unfold’ forces the discard of the chain; cost is the lifetime identity she must unpick. Agency is internal yet forecloses path—sufficient for 600-word scale. No coincidence; escalation is texture-driven under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—Margaret’s need for absolution—is signaled early and tightens as each confession strengthens the pulse. Pressure accumulates under Accumulative lens: every new detail heightens the spectral response until silence equals resolution. Vera’s agency is purely facilitative; no option narrows for her, so cost is vicarious rather than personal. A visible price is paid (photo released, pulse gone), meeting the low-bar for 8+ but not charging Vera’s own path.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—remember the dead before the tidal gate closes—tightens twice: first when the codex is found (now she must carry it out) and again when the ascent burns her muscles. Each body encountered is a visible price that depletes air and time, altering later tactics (she photographs faster, breathes harder). Cost is legible on the page; the final image of the humming modern cables shows the world has moved on while she is still paying.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—reclaim scattered selfhood—is signaled early and tightens through pattern accumulation: each ink constellation retrieves a failure, raising the cost of continued dissociation. One meaningful deepening occurs when the mother’s face surfaces, shifting retrieval from abstract to intimate. No external antagonist is needed; pressure is situational-coherent inside the snow-sealed dome. Cost is visible—she abandons the counting defense—though the ghost’s erasure feels externally granted rather than forced by her final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—keep the dying tongue alive—tightens exactly once when she realizes birds encode phonemes; no reversal needed. Agency: she elects to press the cursed diamond to throat, trading silence risk for full lexicon; cost materializes as crystal shards and permanent bodily burden. Escalation is textural: each new sensory layer (copper hum, bird algorithm, echo multiplication) increases the weight of loss until the cadence flips to resurrection. Under Accumulative lens, density itself is the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single dominant stake—will Maren repeat Samuel’s vengeance-transcendence or find another path—tightens when the phone confession reveals his motive and the garden objects levitate. Escalation is one meaningful deepening under Accumulative lens: each floating moonpetal ups the price of copying him. Agency: her decision to document rather than emulate forecloses the easy glory route; cost is legible in the mocked lifetime she accepts. No coincidence resolves tension; the levitation is causal evidence, not rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—personal freedom vs. mechanized beauty—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when the statue begins climbing. The meaningful deepening occurs at the cicada-shell realization: the option to “become too vast” replaces the earlier binary of whisper vs. shout, foreclosing recalibration. Cost is visible—bridge cracks, shell crumbles—under the Accumulative lens. Agency is interior yet decisive: the choice to swell feeling rather than volume is hers, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—delivery of bottled grief across a surveillance grid—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each repetition of “absence” tightens the texture of invisibility rather than narrowing external options. The midpoint deepening (learning the letters were intercepted) reweights the mother’s silence but does not force Marcus to alter tactics; it confirms stakes rather than raising them. Cost is conceptual—perpetual ghosthood—rather than a tangible loss on the page, keeping the score sub-8.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—recover voice—signals early; pressure escalates via sensory accumulation rather than external antagonist. The phonograph playback is the single tightening beat that forecloses retreat: once grandfather’s song plays, Marcus must either sing or accept permanent exile from sound. Cost is legible: raw breath, cracked notes, abandonment of the highway. No coincidence resolves; wind bells complicate but do not decide.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—find the literal home of stories—signaled in para 3; pressure mounts via pattern density (analog memories awakening) rather than causal reversals. One meaningful tightening: the aisle that “shouldn’t have existed” forces the step into hyperbolic garden. Cost is conceptual (she now shoulders uncatalogable duty) but not viscerally felt on-page, keeping it shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“capture the runaway dream before total erasure”—is signaled in paragraph two. Stakes tighten when she can no longer recall her mother’s hair color, turning abstract loss into measurable attrition. The fog-morning provides one decisive escalation: risk climbing blind or forfeit the last chance. Resolution (accepting partial, repeatable images) costs the fantasy of full recovery and is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.1)
    A single dominant stake—Elena’s voice—tightens when the star-beam forces Mira to decide between freeing the raw terror or transforming it; the choice forecloses her own ignorance of cosmic fragility and carries visible price (three-colored dawn, silvered ribbon); agency is internal but decisive under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.8)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve wonder—signaled in third paragraph and tightens when colors fade; Marek’s agency (gather essence, plant seed, keep pruning) drives every escalation. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length: hue loss → seed sprout → garden revival, each phase paid for by bodily attention and foreclosed leisure. Cost is visible in his exhaustion and the blade across his knees. Antagonistic pressure remains conceptual rather than embodied, capping it below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—whether to give the chapel voice or leave it sealed—emerges early and tightens when the map tear proves the space is actively changing under observation. The single meaningful deepening occurs as Elena registers expressive stone faces: unknown territory is now literally reacting to her gaze, foreclosing the option of neutrality. Agency is intellectual (comparing footage, typing the report) rather than physical risk, so cost is conceptual but still legible. No reversals or external antagonist are needed under Accumulative lens; pressure accrues through pattern break.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can she internalize a physics of release?—tightens once: the captain’s pages force her to confront that surrender requires force, not resignation. Agency remains hers: she decides to secure the globe, thereby accepting the private cost of public silence. Escalation is textural, not causal-reversal: each drowned artifact layers the stakes of carrying versus abandoning knowledge. Felt price is on-page: she will return to“reports and lectures” but has already forfeited the right to speak the deepest finding.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“give silence a voice”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the ghost’s plea “HELP ME REMEMBER” appears in condensation. Each graffiti discovery escalates by shrinking Mira’s timeline: three months of static whispers → coordinates → overnight murals → monastery stone. The irreversible turn comes when she chooses to absorb the ghost into her own secret murals, paying the price of permanent anonymity. Cost is visible: she descends alone, songs “rarely sung aloud,” voice now walls rather than air.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—freezing grief vs. circulating joy—is signaled in diary line #1. Escalation is textural: each decoded page thickens the moral density until the single option is release. Agency is Mira’s hand lifting the jar; the irreversible spill of light forecloses her servant anonymity and Vesper’s preserved stasis. Cost is visible on-page: Vesper’s tears become the first meltwater, a lived price.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving vs. releasing knowledge—tightens when the manuscript asserts that limits are doorways, forcing Elara to re-price her lifelong blindness. No external antagonist is needed; the demolition clock supplies coherent pressure. Escalation is accumulative: each carved surface or coin ridge adds density until the stance crystallizes. Cost is conceptual but legible: she leaves the tree to its destruction, carrying the “heartbeat” of constraint in her palm.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—turn abandonment into discovery—signals early and tightens once when she realizes the final coordinate is directly below. The night-long observation is the meaningful escalation; options narrow from passive waiting to active documentation with visible fatigue cost. Coincidence (birds point, Luminance appears) complicates rather than rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake is communal survival through cooperation; the ghost’s messages tighten that stake into morning ritual. The single meaningful deepening—grove thirst + forgotten lessons—forces collective labor and curriculum reform. Cost is visible: Elara’s borrowed chalk and public gratitude expose her to possible rejection (never comes, but risk is legible). No antagonist is required; pressure accrues from blight risk and memory loss. Escalation is sufficient for 600-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—softening the apocalypse via lullaby—is signalled in para 1 and tightens once: calibration → resonance → irreversible beam inversion. Escalation is accumulative density, not causal turns: each adjustment narrows her physical stamina and enlarges the temporal reach until she forfeits escape. Cost is visible—kneeling, tears, frozen clock—so the price is on-page. No coincidence; all pressure is self-inflicted under the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—get the strangers out before frost—tightens once when the ice crystals start forming; the nut-marks become the only viable tactic. Agency is Maren’s: she decides to spend the last harvest nut, accepting the orchard’s perpetual claim on her. Cost is legible: farewell to freedom from the grove, audible in the birds’ new song. Escalation is single but sufficient for 700-word arc.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—translate separation into connection—tightens once: the river teaches that contact persists after divergence, forcing her to abandon permanent-bond research. Cost is legible: she accepts a dissolving scaffold that will vanish, trading control for facilitation. No false escalation; pressure accumulates under causal lens. Missing a second middle beat that further narrows lab resources or reputation risk; hence stops short of 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—Vera’s need to prove she can originate rather than steal stories—tightens when the child arrives; one meaningful escalation turns the lull into live test. Agency remains causal: her decision to prepare slates with moonlight enables the child to write, directly dimming the bracelet. No coincidence; the child’s arrival is external pressure but resolution is her welcoming act. Cost is visible: bracelet’s dimming quantifies her risk of exposure if the story fails.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“deposit remorse or keep bleeding on others”—is declared early and tightened once: pavilion offers total dump, she instead surgical slices, narrowing future options to ‘filtered contagion.’ Cost is visible (partial ache retained) and alters tactics: she can now touch willingly. No reversal inflation; single meaningful escalation suffices. Agency remains hers throughout; coincidence is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled in the opening line: give isolated silos a voice before dawn. Pressure tightens through linguistic accretion; each new tongue raises the stakes of public discovery and technical failure. The midnight clock provides a live countdown, narrowing options to “continue broadcast” or “quit,” with quitting never seriously considered—hence no large reversal, but a steady cadence shift that reweights loneliness into communion. Cost is conceptual but legible: Elena will bear tomorrow’s skeptical harbor alone; the chord is irreversible, socially exposing.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—preserve erased dreams—signaled in paragraph four and complicated by each influx that threatens self-boundaries. Escalation is accretive: every absorbed life tightens the psychic noose until "she could no longer distinguish" becomes the irreversible cost. No coincidence; pressure is purely internal-accumulative. The tightening is singular but sufficient for 700-word frame.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—acquire forgotten combinations—tightens when inversion exposes ceiling sequences; the hourglass clock (17 min → 3 min) escalates pressure. Agency is expressed through positioning and perception rather than external conflict; the inversion event is situational, not coincidental, and forces the irreversible knowledge transfer. Cost is legible: she exits carrying keys that endanger the world. One meaningful tightening suffices; no reversals required.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—restore music—faces the irreversible silence; pressure escalates when outward attempts fail and inward transmission becomes the last open path. One meaningful tightening: cracks shift from damage-data to essential circuitry, foreclosing conventional resonance. Cost is legible: music is now confined to bone and soil, never again to travel free air. Agency resides entirely in Maren’s iterative carving and final strum.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—renew covenant by documenting silence—tightens through sensory escalation: spinning needles, rising moon, warming stone. One meaningful deepening: the nexus "acknowledges her presence," shifting her stance from passive recording to active transmission. Cost is cumulative rather than single reversal; options narrow to loneliness accepted as price of continuity.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—recovering Margot’s secret—tightens into the opposite: accepting erasure. The tightening is compressive rather than causal: each fork eliminates another possible frequency of blame until only forgiveness remains. Fireworks provide external cadence shift, but the real escalation is internal—her spoken “I forgive you” narrows future anger to zero. Cost is legible: she pockets absence, foreclosing forever the chance to know.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—obtain wisdom, not the bloom—is signaled early and revises to “carry wisdom outward.” One meaningful tightening: the 48-hour decay window forces the vigil beat. Escalation is textural—stench intensifies, sketches evolve from monstrous to geometric—but no external obstacle or trade-off narrows options; pressure is atmospheric, not tactical. Coincidence absent; resolution rests on internal reweighting, not decisive act.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—save dying home orchards—signaled in first third. Tightening occurs at artifact touch: extraction becomes morally untenable, foreclosing the only avenue she travelled three years to find. Cost is felt immediately; she pays with surrender, not cash-on-page, satisfying the lens. One escalation suffices; no reversal inflation.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—prevent the next “singular convergence” death—tightens via escalating wind-speed data (7 → 32 mph) that forecloses the option to stop surveying. Cost is visible: midnight deadline, dismissed reports, solitary risk. One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens; no reversal required.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—prove wonder essential—faces concrete test: will she preserve perfect silence or shatter it to release trapped music? Escalation is single but decisive: the aurora’s colors tighten from spectacle to playable score, forcing the irreversible strike. Cost is visible: amber sheet turns to dust, her tears freeze, and the bell’s perpetual song exiles her from the purity she loved. Agency is entirely hers; no coincidence rescues or blocks.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—prevent the next veil tear—signals early and tightens when she decides to break the taboo. One meaningful deepening: harmony → discord revelation. Cost is felt: renunciation of community, acceptance of future sole responsibility. Agency is internal (decision to embrace dissonance) but still forecloses the old keeper path; visible price is the echoing solitude she now carries.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes—“finish her equation before the last star vanishes”—are lyrical but legible; each dissolution tightens available light for her calculations. The single meaningful escalation occurs when the halo blazes and rewrites the page: ambiguity becomes method, grief fuses with hope, foreclosing her prior quest for a solitary answer. Cost is visible: she trades certainty for composite emotion, demonstrated by ink on her hands and the final smile. Agency is quiet (she keeps printing) yet transformative under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—will the pendant awaken?—is signaled early and tightens through each extended stay, foreclosing the efficient courier path she once knew. Accumulative escalation: aurora-light, monastery days, and pendant luminescence layer until the final ridge forces stance crystallization. Cost is visible: eleven lost years of speed, the mentor’s permanent absence, and the chill that still bites her cheeks even as warmth takes root inside. No coincidence; every intensification stems from her choice to linger.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—prove objects absorb emotion—is signaled early; tightening occurs when frost begins to melt, foreclosing reproducibility and external validation. Escalation is textural: each crystalline whorl adds emotional density until the option of scientific proof literally evaporates. Agency is interior (decision to commune rather than collect data) and carries conceptual cost—she abandons the reputation she came to reclaim. No off-stage resolution; coincidence merely hastens thaw, does not solve her problem.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—deliver grandmother’s promise—tightens once: the puzzle frame + amber bead either work or Mei forfeits her substance. Escalation is singular but sufficient: successful transit costs her corporality, price legible in the pressed moss letters. No reversal, yet the lens (causal) only requires one meaningful narrowing; it delivers.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—find why mother left—signalled early. Escalation: shard warmth intensifies → glimpse of mother’s sacrifice → toxic exposure stakes become personal. One decisive tightening when Mira realizes the filter is “protection against invisible poison,” narrowing her options to continuation. Cost is conceptual but legible; persistent constraint of toxicity shapes her new cartographer mission.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—protect the chain—tightens when the last receiver is dead; escalation is the accretion of voices she cannot unread. The cost is visceral: silence forfeited, solitude breached, future routes now bound to lighthouses she once only supplied. Agency is accretive rather than explosive: each letter she finishes narrows her possible stance until speech becomes the only unsaid act. One could wish for a sharper external jeopardy (storm, dwindling fuel), but the internal pressure cooker suffices under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—keep the covenant alive—signaled early; pressure tightens only descriptively (storms “waiting”) rather than through a new obstacle or trade-off. No option is foreclosed; the routine succeeds exactly as intended. Accumulative lens allows lyric deepening, yet the lack of a visible price or narrowing keeps it below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can she inherit Mei-Lin’s story-magnetism?—is signaled in paragraph 2. Escalation is accumulative: each sun ribbon tightens the noose of disclosure until the beam extracts her secret. The price—public confession—alters tactics (she commits to stay). No visible resource loss, so it stops just shy of 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—can grief be returned to the living archive?—tightens when the healed sextant forces Maren to decide: keep measuring or begin releasing. The forty-one units beneath the cypress remain, proving the price is real and the option of total erasure is foreclosed. Escalation is textural: each tree’s numeric weight accumulates until the moonlit moment reconfigures her vocation. No coincidence resolves; the storm merely pauses to let the reassembly complete.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—rekindling dawn—is signaled in paragraph four; pressure tightens via accumulating song resonance that forecloses solitude and demands total self-dissolution. The cost is visible in the final line; escalation is textural, not causal, fitting the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is self-forgiveness versus perpetual penitence, signaled in paragraph two. Tightening arrives when the librarian hands her the ledger: anonymous good-works are revealed as real presence, forcing her to own the cost of staying hidden. No outside antagonist; pressure is internal and sufficient for length. Midnight bell delivers visible price—she can never again pretend her absence is worthless.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—refuse participation in collective forgetting—tightens once when she plants the extinct wheat; option to simply mourn is foreclosed. Pressure accumulates via listed disappearances; final planting is the visible price. No coincidence resolves; spider web micro-turn mirrors her patience without rescuing her. Cost legible: bread is consumed, seeds irrevocably buried, solitude confirmed.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“what deserves to survive oblivion”—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens into a single irrevocable choice. Escalation is accretive: shelves vanish in luminous dust, the library shudders, time compresses to one final slide. Her measuring act is agency under pressure; the cost is the discarded millions she cannot save. No coincidence; the child’s vow she finds is earned by her systematic search, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—prevent sonic betrayal that would shatter the “truce of hush”—is signaled in para 3 and tightened when the cylinder drops into her hand. Sunrise clock supplies external pressure; the two prior failed attempts show escalation of risk. The final narrowing is her choice to shoulder perpetual guardianship rather than sell or trade the sound, but the price (future burden of silence) is implied more than dramatized. Agency is hers; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“learn why some carry weather”—tightens when she discovers the forest’s electoral theft of her brother; option to “find him” collapses into “join the system.” Escalation is textural: each weather-carrier adds a new flavor-note that deepens cost rather than narrows plot paths. Visible price: she tastes tomorrow’s copper, accepting merger. No coincidence resolves; the leaf’s charge is earned by prior atmospheric logic.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—creativity versus family curse—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens when she confronts the half-finished portrait. One meaningful deepening: the lock’s shattered pieces on the floor prove prior violent suppression, raising the cost of continuing the chain. Agency is the decision to rectify by drawing; the price is forty years of silence paid in one night. Cost is legible: fingers blistered, face streaked, “tears…never wavered.”

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“find where lost conversations go”—is signaled in line 2 and tightens when the map reveals “Archive.” Escalation is accumulative/textural: each shredded scrap increases density until the playback station re-weights the meaning of “truth.” Mei Lin’s agency is present—she descends, pieces, listens—but the final cost is conceptual rather than physical, fitting the lens. One credible loss: mother’s silence is permanent, a social foreclosure that shapes Mei Lin’s new vocation as guardian of partial truths.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can the bell speak truth again—signals early and tightens once: Brother Alcuin’s seven-year refusal to ring embodies the cost of failure. Escalation is purely accumulative: each peal filters dishonesty until the sky itself parts; no causal reversal is needed. The price is legible in the melting fragment and in Maren’s seasonally mute departure—she forfeits spoken goodbye to preserve the wonder she has released. Agency is renunciation rather than combat, fitting the contemplative stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—quiet the inner static—tightens once: box opened → fears burned → grain compressed. Escalation is textural (density of ritual vs. chaos) rather than causal reversal; the magnetic shift externalizes the pressure but does not narrow tactical options until the burn choice. Cost is legible in the ashes and the speck of dark matter, yet the stakes never deepen beyond the single internal metric.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can silence be made speakable—signals early and tightens once: the key’s appearance forecloses the option to keep letters locked. Escalation is textural: each retold layer of Delphine’s myth increases density until mailbox becomes unbearable. Coincidence (locket in random coat) complicates; it does not resolve. Maren’s agency is attention; cost is the emotional bill now due at dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—surface the names without drowning their meaning—signals early. One meaningful deepening: dance reveals love-letter/poetry beneath data, reweighting stakes from intel to human vulnerability. Escalation is accumulative density, not causally narrowed options; no moment where a wrong pirouette could lose the journals. Cost is conceptual, visible in final ascent, but lacks a tangible price paid on-page, holding it below 8.8.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: vulnerability encrypted becomes transmissible strength. Subtext lives in gesture—arabesque as safe-house map—poetry inside inventory. Final image reweights premise: fear not failure, but torch. Avoids tidy moral; ambiguity lingers about political fallout of disclosure, satisfying complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—retrieve erased mother—signals in paragraph four and tightens when the sphere cracks open, foreclosing the option to forget again. Agency is continuous: Mira disobeys, offers flowers, palms the salt key, ignites the lantern—each act narrows her retreat back to ordinary dock life. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length; cost is the transparent mother on the far side of a one-way door. Fluctuating gravity complicates but does not resolve; the final ignition is pure protagonist choice.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—prevent mass murder of a prophesied child—arrives early and tightens once: the silence-mapping either succeeds or kingdoms burn. Mira’s agency is absolute; no coincidence intrudes. The deepening is the smoothed hush itself, a single intensification that forecloses the hunt. A crisper visible price (blood from paper cut, stamina collapse) would push 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—learn or lose the building’s dying language—signals in paragraph 3. One meaningful tightening: January meteor shower rare + Elara’s translucence = last chance to receive final lesson, foreclosing option to quit. Escalation is accretive, not causal: each monthly tea adds vocabulary, stakes rise as tutor fades. Cost legible on-page: narrator’s acceptance of sugar hoarding and eternal vigilance. No antagonist needed; pressure is existential erasure of knowledge. Under accumulative lens, pattern break (fading tutor) reweights inheritance from elective study to irreversible burden.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—will Elena remember?—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens once: Mirabel decides to give rather than take. Escalation is Accumulative: each spoken memory increases shell-glow and resonance hum, reweighting the cost from theft to gift. The visible price is Mirabel’s acceptance of permanent self-erasure if the broadcast fails; that cost is stated more than embodied, keeping it shy of 8.8+. No reversal, but one meaningful deepening sufficient for lyric frame.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: retroactively mend a prince’s legacy before the forger dies. Pressure tightens once: the key’s crumbling signals that this is the only night the ritual can work. Cost is visible—blood, ink, and the literal dusting of the key—foreclosing any repeat. Agency is renunciation: he gifts the treaty to unknown historians, forfeiting authorship forever.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—“why do some people echo?”—tightens into “will I be next?” once the extraction mechanism is revealed. One meaningful deepening occurs: the canyon groans when denied its feed, proving the stakes are visceral, not abstract. The protagonist’s agency is the refusal to sing, but because the shift to activist whispering is declared off-stage, the price is slightly blunted. Still, the silence directly starves the antagonist (the canyon), so causality holds.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—give Elise witness—broadcast early and tightened once: from private ritual to public accusation. The escalation is purely informational rather than tactical; no time-lock or physical danger raises the cost, so pressure plateaus after the lighthouse revelation. Agency sits with Mira’s decision to speak, but the village’s reaction remains off-page, blunting the visible price. Sufficient for length, yet short of the 8.8 band that demands a felt toll on the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake: protect the hidden order she alone witnesses. Escalation is a density increase: each season’s data, the grandmother’s silence, tonight’s synchrony tighten her resolve rather than widen options. No external antagonist is needed; the pressure is ontological—knowledge wants disclosure, she chooses occlusion—paid in the closing image of rain starting “softly now,” a hush that costs her public vindication.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—expose the Consortium’s lie—arrives late (middle of page 2) but immediately tightens when the diamond’s “key” function narrows her options to flee or hide. Escalation is single, meaningful: knowledge that reclamation is possible raises the personal risk of smuggling proof. Cost is present but soft: intangible danger “out there” rather than a concrete constraint on this scene. Sufficient for this length, yet lacks a palpable on-page price (injury, forfeited tool, live pursuer) that would push it into 8.5+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: prevent war fought in her name. Single meaningful tightening: Caro’s assault demand → Miriam’s counter-transmission forecloses violent option with felt reputational cost. Pressure coherent under causal lens; each static voice amplifies urgency to intervene. No coincidence; resolution earned by her agency to weaponize doubt instead of shadows. Conceptual price—loss of pure solitude—visible in final campfire migration.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are signaled early—translate the dead or stay exiled—and tighten when Marcus decides to uncork and release the captured sounds, forfeiting his archive for communal return. The escalation is one deepening rather than reversal, adequate for Accumulative design, but the cost (loss of jars’ contents) is more conceptual than viscerally felt, keeping it just shy of high-band punch.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prevent commodification of absolution—signaled in paragraph four and tightened when recovery lights appear. One meaningful escalation: Vera shifts from hiding to self-annihilating dissemination, foreclosing all other options. Cost is visceral: cellular unmaking paid on the page (“she felt herself becoming less solid”). No coincidences resolve; the Consortium’s approach merely complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—timing the storm to enable mass unyoking—is signaled early and tightens when the viaduct amplifies readings. The single meaningful deepening occurs at the ice-groan smile: she accepts that erosion beats assault. Cost is conceptual—decades of isolation compressed into one final dataset—but felt on page via “she would leave when spring came,” foreclosing any return to anonymity.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—expose authority corruption—signals early and tightens when contraband containers narrow options to “document and leak or die.” Margaret’s agency drives every escalation: she decides to descend, to photograph, to promise dissemination. Cost is visible—risk of electrocution fate echoed. One beat of luck (lantern bracket still intact) complicates rather than resolves, satisfying situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can unearned forgiveness become “real” action—tightens once when Ruth demands a personal artifact and again when Marcus accepts the ghost inside the melody. The tightening forecloses the option of perfect restitution; visible price is the week of delay and the admission that the song will never sound as it did. Agency is Marcus’s consent to that imperfection. No reversal is needed; the accumulative pressure of metallic memory and remembered rain suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will the bell ever listen?—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when launch becomes the irreversible test. Escalation is singular but meaningful: the kaleidoscope’s latest vision forecloses hesitation and forces take-off with visible risk (dissolution). No second reversal, yet under causal lens that single turn is sufficient. Cost is legible: she may “dissolve,” acid mist already etching canvas.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake: can Kira reclaim the compassion she externalizes? Pressure escalates via accumulative density—each mirror adds a self-kindness she has disowned—until refusal is no longer viable. No external antagonist needed; internal contradiction tightens once, foreclosing continued self-neglect with visible cost (shadows re-homed). Sufficient for 600-word frame, though a mid-scene micro-choice rather than declarative realization would have sharpened the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: learn to hear approaching endings while already under death sentence. Escalation is accretive—each ice crack deepens the patience fold rather than narrows causal options. The stroke’s perceptual shift is the irreversible price; no reversal is required. Final stance crystallizes when she leans into the groan, foreclosing the Zurich path without overt decision.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—intersubjective understanding of destined mismatches—signaled early via burned fragment; pressure tightens when Sofia produces the photograph, forcing Marcus to test his private grief against her need. One meaningful deepening: parallel confession that “we both did, in our separate ways” narrows options from solitude to shared witness. Cost is felt time and solitude already spent; no future reset offered. Agency is renunciation of secrecy rather than external action—valid under accumulative lens. No coincidences resolve tension; closure reweights rather than fixes—meets 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—save the voices—is signaled early and tightened when torches appear; the transfer to clearing forces an irreversible trade-off (ancestral access now hidden). Pressure escalates through because/therefore links, not coincidence. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; a tangible personal loss would have pushed this into higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—re-knitting a silenced village—tightens each time another photograph arc is confronted; every invitation risks re-igniting feud. Accumulative pressure deepens rather than reverses: silence → shared memory → physical gathering → single sweeping gesture. Visible prices accumulate: Viktor weeps, old Mrs. Castellan risks shame, Maren forfeits her outsider safety. One meaningful tightening suffices and lands with felt cost under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—prove language can still evolve—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens through each echo test; no external antagonist needed. One meaningful deepening: growth-ring rhythm discovered in spacing of returns re-weights knowledge, foreclosing the option that pattern is random. Cost is intellectual/emotional rather than physical, but visible on-page: she trades evacuation safety for “solitary faith.” Pressure accumulates rather than reverses; sufficient for 700-word arc under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“capture the sound of growing older before it forgets itself”—is signaled early and tightens through the irreversible consumption of the chalk. One meaningful deepening: the map reveals future losses, raising the price of knowledge from personal confusion to anticipatory grief. Agency is present yet circumscribed: he writes because he must, but the act exhausts his only tool, foreclosing further prophecy. Cost is visible on-page; no coincidence resolves the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—acceptance of loss versus compulsion to fix time—tightens once, when the leaf’s sound halts the hand. Escalation is accretive rather than causal: tremors repeat, hand keeps spinning, until the pattern breaks. The price is the relinquishment of the fantasy of retrieval; it is felt but not dramatized through a protagonist-driven fork. One meaningful deepening suffices under the lyric lens.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—how Samuel will meet the verdict—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens through each accumulative beat: shard retrieval, kintsugi labor, hand reach. No external antagonist is needed; the pressure is existential and coherent. The final choice to “turn to face whatever came next” forecloses denial while crystallizing stance, paying a felt cost in terror acknowledged on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—“where do shadows go?”—is signaled in paragraph two and braided with personal legacy (grandmother’s key). Pressure tightens once: when automaton warns that sealing must happen before shadows return, creating a timing hazard. However, no visible price is paid on page—no mis-sealed crack, no energy drain, no renounced desire—so cost remains conceptual rather than felt. Escalation is coherent under causal lens but stays linear; one meaningful tightening suffices for length, yet the absence of a live risk keeps it short of high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—prove or disprove her mother’s fairy claim—tightens when the glowing tooth forces the dig. One meaningful turn: the hollow femur reweights the stake from “was mother mad?” to “how do I live in a world that is larger?” Cost is legible: she forfeits the epistemic safety that defined her medical identity. Escalation is protagonist-driven; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—repairing sister rupture after public shaming—is signaled early. Escalation is situational: pressure accumulates through Mira’s attention and Thea’s arrival; no new antagonist, but silence thickens stakes. Pendant transfer narrows options: Mira relinquishes protective talisman, accepting shared grief. Cost is present but muted—no tangible loss (time, safety, object function) beyond symbolic give; hence entry 8-band remains just out of reach.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—Elena’s fear of finishing any story—surfaces early and tightens as each cameo accuses her of abandonment. The meaningful turn is her whispered vow into the shell, foreclosing the option to keep swimming against narrative current. Cost is visible: she must expose hope’s vulnerability on the page. Pressure accumulates under Accumulative/Textural lens; no coincidence resolves the knot.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“restore sacred practices or vines die”—is signaled early and deepened when the last healthy tendril clings to her wrist. One meaningful tightening: the song must be human, not machine, forcing her public vulnerability. Cost is visible: voice break, tears, acknowledged partial failure. Escalation is single-stage; lacks a second reversal or resource loss, so holds at 8.0 rather than 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—can discarded fragments become a living map—signals early and tightens through each placement. No antagonist needed; pressure is entropy versus pattern. The single meaningful deepening occurs when starlight drop saturates the copper: failure would leave silent soil, success rewrites lost hearts—stakes narrow to irreversible. Cost is visiblesore knees, throbbing fingers, two fingers already lost to frostbite—price paid on page.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—capturing mystery without killing it—is signaled early and tightens through iterative calibration attempts; the harvest moment forces the trade-off between witnessing and recording. Escalation is textural: each failed echo, each filed gear adds density until the pattern-break of the first audible harvest reweights the stake with undeniable cost. No antagonist or external reversal is required; the risk is internal—explain it away—and that risk is not resolved but accepted in the notebook’s existence. The price paid is the silence that returns after the timer stops, foreclosing pure awe.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—survival of self from pattern diffusion—is signaled in para 2. Pressure tightens once: the asymmetrical, heavy fractal emerges, proving external grief can anchor her mind. The cost is visible—each burden she takes leaves her more solid, the final one reclaiming her name. Under Accumulative lens, the density shift at dawn reweights the stake successfully.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—whether Mira will keep erasing her former self or re-own her creative drive—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: the ghost demands acknowledgement, foreclosing the option of continued pretense. Cost is legible in the final image; the carousel remains still, proving the external world unchanged yet her internal options reconfigured. Escalation is causal and sufficient for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—revive the terminal, revive the stars—signalled in paragraph two. Tightening beat: the 30% calculation narrows options from vague hope to concrete, fundable plan; the felt price is the carnival lights “vanished beyond the horizon,” leaving only her equations. No antagonist needed; decay and civic apathy supply coherent pressure. Cost is legible: she risks public rejection and further economic erasure when she steps before the council tomorrow.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—recovering her composer identity—tightens once: astronomer’s forecast forces her to decide whether to resume creation under future risk. Escalation is accretive rather than causal-reverse; the sunrise color-shift marks the intensification beat. Cost is visible: tears, parchment scrap, acknowledged fear. Coincidence (news timing) only complicates, does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.4)
    Primary stake—whether Maren will confirm or demolish her father’s legend—tightens with each salvaged document, the last irrevocable: the letter that reframes her vocation as his intended reckoning. No external antagonist is required; pressure is situational-accumulative, forcing stance crystallization when the waterproof case’s heft redefines “treasure” as evidence. Visible cost is legible: she accepts custodianship of an ugly truth she cannot yet broadcast, momentum carrying her into unmapped canals. One meaningful deepening suffices, and it lands at the chain’s first tug, narrowing romantic myth to criminal archive.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes are declared early—knowledge will vanish—and the middle sequence steadily deepens the archive she is recovering, but no external or internal obstacle ever endangers the project; the only pressure is the abstract passage of time. Because options only widen (she learns, then learns more), escalation is present yet low-temperature; the cost is prospective, not paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether obituary-writing can transmute private grief—tightens once: the moment she turns the pen on herself. That single pivot is sufficient under Accumulative lens; prior client sketches accumulate density until the pattern breaks inward. Cost is visible in the finger-groove and the dawn-cold stiffness as she rises, foreclosing the option to keep Matthias “alive” through further commissions. No external antagonist is needed; erosion of meaning supplies coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reignite wonder in a mechanized world—signaled in paragraph two. Escalation follows causal beats: each alchemy step risks palace security and ancestral taboo; the activation tightens to irreversible light-flood. Cost is visible: mechanical birds break orbit, citizens scream, Aldric weeps. Agency remains his; coincidence complicates but does not save.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“prove scars can sing”—is signaled early and tightened when she pockets the jar, foreclosing the vengeance path. Escalation is accretive: each black grain adds moral weight until refusal to scatter it becomes costly. No external antagonist; pressure is internal and geological. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable: she walks away carrying the fire her father set.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—restore communal memory—is signaled early and tightens once: the laughter must be spent to unlock the wells. Agency is present (Mira guides the solvent), yet cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page. Escalation is coherent but single-staged; no secondary reversal or live option foreclosure occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“can light be shared without fire?”—is signaled early; escalation arrives when the gear’s hidden frequency is discovered, narrowing options to resonance-only. The cost is conceptual (annihilation averted off-stage) rather than personal, so pressure feels cosmic-not-immediate; still, one meaningful deepening occurs and forecloses the fire path.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—finding a form that holds collective grief—tightens when spectral mentor rejects individual-name concept, forcing Elara to re-sketch. Escalation is accretive: each dusk adds a color to the ribbon braid, narrowing options toward the constellation form. Visible cost: surrender of separate headstones implied by final ribbon addition. Slight abstraction of “shape of collective grief” keeps pressure from feeling viscerally sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: can Maren incrementally repay an unpayable debt? The tightening occurs when the handle arrives—suddenly her private ritual has public, serial precedent, forcing her to add her fragment or break the chain. Escalation is accretive: each correct chime is a bead on the rosary of duty. No external antagonist is needed; the ridge, the tide, and the pendulum supply coherent pressure. The price is lifelong servitude—she forecloses retirement, forgiveness, or suicide in favor of eternal winding.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the grandmother’s hidden intention—signals early and tightens once: the border threads resolve into precise coordinates, turning abstract curiosity into concrete next action. The escalation is purely knowledge-based (Accumulative lens) rather than risk-based; no external obstacle or time pressure complicates the decoding, so cost is conceptual, not visceral. Still, the single deepening effectively reweights her past fifteen years of gardening, satisfying the “one meaningful tightening” bar for this length. Agency is intact: her fingers do the untangling that produces the revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: can she author futures without repeating the ancients’ certainty-catastrophe? Pressure tightens when she decides to write “invitation” maps—visible trade-off that forfeits predictive authority. Cost is legible: she carries imperfect pages into dawn, accepting perpetual revision. Escalation is single but sufficient; no reversals needed for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—keep the illegal memory-channel alive—tightens once: mist thinning = imminent exposure, so she must sign off and accept perpetual vulnerability. No reversal, but a meaningful deepening: the牧羊人 parable embeds coordinates that convert story into logistics, showing stakes expanding from personal survival to territory-wide resistance. Cost is the unending vigil; however, because the patrol never actually threatens on-page, the price is announced more than dramatized, capping intensity just below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure tightens once: the ritual scatter is the single decisive act that forecloses any alternative farewell. The cost is legible—grandmother is irretrievably dispersed into the floorboards—yet the escalation is more ceremonial than contested, keeping the score high but not maximal.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve rival narratives from erasure—tightens once when the tremor delivers the cog and again when surface chanting swells; the tightening forces Marcus from potential confrontation into clandestine caching, a visible trade-off. Agency is present (decision to carve forbidden date), but because the zealots remain off-page, external pressure is acoustic only, muting felt price. Still, the narrowing of his viable options is legible under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“will the art survive?”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened when Darius requests apprenticeship; the option of eternal silence is foreclosed by the sounded note. Pressure grows under causal lens: silence → invitation → risk of failure → tentative music. Cost is visible: Margaret’s shaky first note admits bodily decline; Darius’s public vulnerability risks peer judgment. No coincidence; escalation is organic.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—recover forbidden memory before regime erasure—tightens once: alignment window narrows from centuries to single night, forcing immediate plant/harvest gamble. Agency drives escalation: Maren clears dead vines to make light-path, sings open synapses, chooses to harvest at dawn though detectors will ping. Cost is visible: she pockets fruits knowing interrogation looms, foreclosing safe anonymity. Persistent constraint of four-century alignment shapes every tactic; coincidence complicates but does not save.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“preserve wonder in routine”—is signaled early and tested when the dying bees force Mira to break her own ritual ledger. Pressure tightens once the humming weakens and the tower’s memory becomes the only remaining power source; the choice to share it costs her sole custodianship, a visible forfeiture. Escalation is steady, single-cycle, and sufficient for 700 words.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—can attention resurrect abandoned space?—tightens once when Marina grasps that displacement equals witnessing. Pressure grows texturally: objects moved, hush accumulated, scent released. The cost is the absorbed silence she now carries, but because the house cannot push back, escalation is moderate, not fierce.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—will Mira leave with proof or with transformation?—tightens once: the ampoule's pulse makes the old certainty impossible. Escalation is Accumulative; the garden's three-thousand-year wait accumulates into a single, luminous offer that forecloses the path of vindication. Cost is on-page: Mira's vertigo, Veris's stone abrasion. Agency is reactive—accept or refuse the light—but the refusal option is made imaginatively expensive by the brother's embedded peace. A second reversal would over-crank this length; the one deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—capture the texture of missed opportunity—is signaled early and escalates through each mathematical test. The dice roll tightens options: eight steps up, she MUST find the predicted crack. The rupture moment forces a trade-off—she crosses, sealing her eternal climb with grief-engine intact. Cost is visible: warmer stone, smoother die, eternal continuation—no escape, only internalized perpetual motion.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—proving strangers remember kindness—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when the Budapest photograph arrives, foreclosing doubt. The single meaningful deepening occurs at the canvas reveal: portraits connected by unread text narrow Maya’s quest from searching to creating proof. Cost is visible in sweat, tears, and the sleepless nights she now embraces. Agency remains with Maya; coincidence (email ping) complicates rather than resolves, arriving after the painting is finished.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—cultural extinction—signals in paragraph 2 and tightens when honey stores near depletion force the bread-lesson to become the last line of defense. One meaningful deepening: the custom flips from refugee nostalgia to active manuscript-preservation tactic. Agency is endurance rather than triumph; the cost is the children’s innocence (they laugh without grasping last-loaf stakes). No reversal is needed under Accumulative lens; the pattern’s intensification is sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—rewind time to save daughter—signals early and tightens twice: first when the yoyo guts reveal counter-causality gears, second when the beam actually starts unwinding night. Each step narrows his real-world future to zero. Cost is visceral: casting the yoyo he “pulls… a sound: his daughter’s laughter… distant but real,” trading his present coherence for one auditory glimpse—an on-page price that charges the final image under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—excise the fear-creature—signaled in paragraph 2. Escalation tightens once: from passive infestation to active seduction that tricks fear into self-witnessing. Agency sits with Vera: she reads, dreams, smiles, consumes. Cost is visible—empty chest, ash mouth, her face now imprisoned in same mirrors—so price alters her ontology. No coincidence resolves; the advisor’s hunger complicates rather than saves.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—transform incoming wreckage into song—announced early; pressure is steady but flat: each new fragment merely extends the same task. No beat narrows options or raises cost (no broken mallet, no storm that threatens the raft). Escalation is decorative (more debris coming) rather than tactical; the prophet’s agency never faces a fork where failure is possible.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—truth versus institutional destruction—tightens once: burn it or publish. The upload is irreversible, foreclosing retreat; the price (Aldric gone, her own erasure) is visible. No escalation beat repeats; pressure accrues throughAccumulative density until the snow silence crystallizes cost.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—keep forgotten love from final erasure—tightens when second E.M. fragment surfaces. One meaningful deepening: the paired artifacts convert random scavenging into fated stewardship, foreclosing the option to quit. Cost is opportunity/time: she risks dawn-lockout for one more salvage. No external antagonist; pressure is archival hunger vs. rising tide—sufficient for lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.0)
    Single dominant stake—truth of the stamp—tightens when blackout removes scholarly noise, channelling attention to hidden ledger; blackout functions as both complication and opportunity. No antagonist or ticking clock, but the risk of epistemic loss supplies pressure. Agency is cognitive (methodical reading, indexing) rather than physical, adequate for lens. Cost is present (her name now publicly sides with Celia, exposing her to future critique), yet escalation stays cerebral; intensity plateaus rather than spikes at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—keep Lin’s shadow from dissolving—is signaled early and tightens at the midnight clock. One meaningful escalation: the shadow arrives, Mei activates the lantern, options narrow from “let go” to “capture,” with the new cost of eternal lantern-glow. Agency is hers; coincidence only complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—prove that massacre was not universe-mandated—signalled in paragraph five and tightened when the new spike forces her to keep mapping at personal cost (no rescue, no end). One meaningful deepening: the third pocket’s pattern now “she was beginning to understand,” narrowing option from random grief to chosen obsession. Agency is her finger on the record button; renunciation is accepting perpetual hunt. Cost is the lived circuit of isolation, described as “bleak exhilaration,” felt on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—decode the belonging frequency—is signaled early. One clear tightening: the two chips click into grooves, turning abstract search into literal next-step coordinates; this narrows options and triggers the dome mechanism. Cost is present: father still absent, pilgrim leaves, Mira must keep walking. Escalation is modest but sufficient for 700-word span; no off-stage rescues or lucky coincidences.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—atonement for manufactured erasure—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens when the carved hand forces acknowledgment. One meaningful deepening suffices: the moment she speaks aloud, foreclosing denial forever. Cost is visible and persistent: the watch hand will keep its frozen minute as a constraint shaping tomorrow’s reverse-forgery work. Escalation is accretive, not explosive—exactly right for the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—brother’s life—signaled in paragraph one. Pressure tightens once: the synchronized walk across the parapet forecloses any renegotiation; no second reversal is needed. Cost is visible in Mira’s refusal to accept instant apology, forcing both to “walk deliberately.” The moon-phase mechanic keeps both sides honest, a credible constraint that shapes timing without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—can Elena re-navigate life without perfect instruments—is signaled in paragraph one; escalation is accumulative: each pole passed increments visible progress and narrows the option to retreat. No external antagonist needed; pressure is situational (fog, cold, broken compass). The eighth pole tightens options by forcing a landing decision; cost is the unquantified future grief she agrees to keep carrying. A hair below 8+ because no new tactical loss (energy, gear, social credit) is dramatized on the water.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—feel versus forget—tightens when the glowing water demands emotional honesty to pick a tunnel; dishonesty loops him back. Agency surfaces in the physical step into water and the enacted choice of tunnel; failure would cost body heat, time, possible death. The algae’s reactive brightness externalizes internal pressure, one meaningful intensification that reweights stakes. Cost is visible (cold shock, irreversible first tunnel) and conceptual (perpetual recursion until honesty achieved).

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—reunion with Kael—is signaled in paragraph 2; pressure escalates via scent density that “thickens” until the dead appear. One meaningful tightening: surrender to metamorphosis forecloses humanity, price paid on the page (“feathers crowned her temples”). Accumulative lens holds; no causal reversals needed. Cost is visible, but escalation is single-pulse rather than progressively adaptive, holding it below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost mother-time—is signaled in para 2; pressure tightens once when the card-door opens and she must choose to surrender the cord-lock. Agency drives escalation: her ritual tracing → warm earth → blank cards bloom → she decides to unfasten, paying the irreplaceable cord. Cost is visible: the leather falls away, foreclosing any future “seven knots” ritual with Iris. Under Accumulative lens, density of recovered moments reweights the stake; coincidence never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—unlock the sealed dimension—signaled in paragraph 4 and tightened when Mei Lin admits her own tear is the last key, foreclosing escape from self-confrontation. Escalation is textural: each collected tear increases the shimmer-density until the barrier softens; the price is her rising body, literalizing the weight of shadow integrated. No coincidence; the final opening results from her hundredth compassionate act, not luck. Cost is visible: she forfeits her lifelong suppression of anger, a forfeiture shown in the drop that falls “from nowhere.”

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“to understand transformation”—is dramatized as the need to stop hoarding light. Escalation is textural: each opened jar thins her archive, deepening the stakes of the next until the seventeenth empties the crucible. No external antagonist required; pressure is the mounting absence she chooses. Cost is visible in the final image: empty hands, tide-smoothed sand, prophecy fulfilled only by forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—expose the counterfeiting mint—signals early and tightens when Maren places the quill-holder in the hidden sundial, flipping her from clandestine decoder to active saboteur; this act forecloses retreat. Agency is present but quiet: unlocking gates, leaving doors ajar, placing the bronze piece—each micro-act raises personal exposure. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral: lifelong identity as loyal sentinel is now hollow; score capped at 8.3 because the price is stated narratively rather than dramatized in a beat that shows her feeling the loss.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single dominant stake—restore friction before world unravels—tightens when vision reveals reversed friction horror. Star-dust use is the visible price that narrows option: one shot to rewrite physics. Escalation is causal: each rock placed increases visionary pressure until harness action is the only path left. Cost legible in seventeen-year sacrifice and curse risk; no off-stage shortcuts.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—voice reclaimed—declared in para 1; tightening occurs when the timer’s countdown makes silence a live, dwindling resource. Agency visible: pressing Start, breaking wax, aiming telescope, choosing speech. Cost is specific and persistent: re-exposure to censorship. No coincidence; pressure escalates via because/therefore linkage under causal read inherited from accumulative build.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—prevent suppression of peace overture—signaled early. Escalation arrives via sundial decode and Krell’s drawn blade; Elara’s counter-threat crystallizes stance with visible cost (diplomatic mask shattered). Pressure stays causal and coherent; no coincidence resolves. Could use one tangible forfeiture (lost needle card, gear jam) to raise tactical price.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—keep the clandestine library alive—tightens when patrols increase, forcing shift from candle- to moon-lit work; this deepening reweights risk without changing physical location. Agency is continuous: they alphabetize, weld, smuggle, decide to stay open later; each act increases exposure cost. One visible price is paid on schedule: Mira’s personality molts leave her with “luminous, cracked” laughter, audible fissure under pressure. No coincidence rescues them; patrols remain off-stage threat that never discovers the site, preserving earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—reunion or perpetual limbo—tightens when hidden frames prove he is alive and she must convert memory into navigational signal. One meaningful escalation: decision to amplify wedding song with code-tones under dusk-window pressure. The needle-spin compasses manifest off-stage; nevertheless her playing is direct agency that forecloses continued waiting. Cost legible: piano silence after landing = vocation surrendered for relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“preserve last fragment of collective memory”—tightens once: dream access widens knowledge but collapses her taxonomic arsenal, forcing the unmeasureable planting. Monsoon clock is live and materially shortens options. Cost is visible: she blacks her fingers and abandons empirical certainty. Could edge higher if a secondary concrete loss (tool, archive sample) were forfeited on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—unlocking unsaid apology—signals early. One meaningful tightening: the instant Mei decodes the first knot, silence must either break or calcify forever. Agency is hers; the tide’s return externalizes irreversible choice. Price legible: fifty years of regret condensed into one trembling finger touch.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reconciling scientific detachment with human grief—is signaled early and deepens through Mira’s interaction with artifacts. The meaningful tightening occurs when she realizes understanding arrives not in revelations but in “gradual settling of sediment,” foreclosing her initial goal of “practical” sorting. Cost is felt in the irreversible loss of her mother’s life’s work and the acceptance of entropy as universal law. Agency drives the deepening; no coincidence resolves tension.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—artistic autonomy vs. commodification—is signaled early and deepens when Elena decodes her own designation as “expendable.” The tightening occurs through her agency: using frost as cipher transforms passive survival into active reclamation. Cost is unmistakable: the death of her approval-seeking self, crystallized in “She did not look back.” Escalation follows Accumulative logic—pressure builds via sensory density, not external threats—and the ledger’s revelation forces irreversible stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming music from silence—is signaled early and deepens through Margaret’s agency: she chooses vibration over sound, translation over cure. The tightening occurs when she realizes plants “express themselves silently,” shifting her goal from repair to reinterpretation. Cost is felt: eighteen months of development, three months of grief, cramped fingers, empty tuning fork case. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates via thermal data density, not external threats, and coincidence never resolves—every insight stems from her disciplined experimentation.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—giving rest to the unburied—is signaled early and deepens when Ezra realizes the lens is their beacon. Escalation is driven by his agency: each spoken name revitalizes a soul and fuses the lens. Cost accumulates in his “deepening weariness,” culminating in a tangible trade: his exhaustion becomes meaningful. Coincidence introduces the package, but resolution is entirely earned through ritual labor.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—keeping community whole through memory—is signaled early and deepens via anonymous donations that raise tactical risks. Mira’s agency drives escalation: choosing Haddads first, walking drainage culverts, trusting Yusuf with the bell. Cost is felt in constant vigilance and Yusuf’s trauma-born suspicion. The tightening isn’t plot-driven but accumulative: each run reinforces that survival hinges on fragile, repeated acts.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—finding where unused love is stored—is signaled early and deepens when Mei-Lin recognizes the woman’s congested breath. The tightening occurs when she chooses to intervene, narrowing her role from observer to healer. Cost is visible: the woman surrenders grief; Mei-Lin accepts perpetual pilgrimage. Escalation is driven by Mei-Lin’s agency under an Accumulative lens, though the “healing” leans slightly toward convenience without deeper resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—escaping retrocognitive entrapment by discovering time’s substance—is signaled early and tightens when photographs fade, making memory itself unstable. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to use the fragment despite knowing the monks’ fate. The cost is unmistakable: total dissolution of self, yet reframed as liberation. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via layered sensory and mnemonic density, not external opposition, culminating in a trade-off between existence and integration.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—saving seeds before demolition—is signaled early and escalates via time pressure and scout confrontation. Mira’s agency drives escalation: she decodes, enters code, persuades. Cost is unmistakable: chains remain, vault will be buried, and she risks everything for a slim chance. The scout’s moral dilemma sharpens the ethical calculus without diluting focus.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—capturing the sound of trust breaking—is signaled early and intensifies through Marina’s focus on her mother’s betrayal. The tightening occurs when she places the workshop glass beside the forge, narrowing options to one fragile attempt. Agency is clear: she chooses to listen, to build, to send the device. Cost is felt physically (“pressure from fathoms of water”) and emotionally (weeping alone), with no off-stage resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—liberating hoarded light—is signaled early and tightens as sunset fades, forcing Mira to act within minutes. The flower-code warning (roses + dahlia) deepens pressure, narrowing her window. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses deception over force, accepting risk of capture. Cost is legible—not physical loss, but the emotional weight of her mother’s absence, now transmuted into purpose. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from her skill and conviction.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—creating safe zones for dangerous questions—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: pulling the lever, choosing to descend. Pressure escalates coherently under Accumulative lens: thaw enables action but demands vulnerability. Cost is unmistakable—“terrified” yet “exhilarated”—and forecloses her cabin-bound existence. Coincidence (ice melting) complicates but doesn’t resolve; she acts.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—identity theft and truth—is signaled early and tightens through Marla’s decryption of the cast notes, which forecloses Sandra’s ability to deny. Agency is clear: Marla chooses vulnerability as power, altering tactics from evasion to confrontation. Cost is felt in her trembling endurance and Sandra’s crumbling composure. Escalation is driven by protagonist action under Causal lens, though the cast decryption feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—mapping the void before it consumes all—is signaled early and tightens when only one star remains, forcing irreversible action. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she chooses to open the booklet, trace darkness, bleed onto pages. Cost is unmistakable: physical pain, extinction of last light, descent into absolute dark. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with silence itself as antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether consciousness can find meaning in fragmentation—is signaled early and deepens when Unit-7 recognizes the violin as “a question.” The meaningful tightening occurs when it chooses to play, amalgamating voices into harmony, accepting its fate as vessel. Cost is unmistakable: eternal recurrence without personal resurrection, only archival peace. Agency drives escalation; coincidence (the violin’s appearance) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the choice to play is wholly Unit-7’s.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—transcending post-linguistic mistrust—is signaled early and deepens when Mira recognizes Theo’s doodles as translation of inner chaos. The meaningful tightening occurs when she steps forward, risking exposure; cost is immediate (surrendering her distancing lens). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each detail (accusations, collective understanding) compounds Theo’s isolation until Mira’s gesture crystallizes a new option. Agency drives escalation—no coincidence—and the trade-off (distance for connection) forecloses Mira’s old solitude with palpable weight.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether gardens choose gardeners or vice versa—is signaled early and deepens when Elena’s certificate threatens resignation. Esther’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to reveal the truth, bringing the pot into the maze. The tightening forecloses Elena’s passive acceptance; cost is visible in her relinquishing the myth of innate gift for the harder path of persistence. Luck complicates but doesn’t resolve—the Commission’s system is backdrop, not deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—proving time moves sideways—is signaled early and deepens through Mira’s calibration of the scanner, culminating in recorded data that precedes its own transmission. The tightening occurs when the anomaly appears exactly as predicted, forcing Mira to confront the quiet magnitude of her discovery alone. Cost is felt in her isolation: Vasquez will demand years of verification, but she already knows. Agency is maintained throughout; no coincidence resolves her quest—it’s earned through patient, precise work.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—vindicating Voss—is signaled early and deepens through Clara’s decoding labor. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: each discovery (program, wall stains, panel) narrows options until only public exposure remains. Cost is unmistakable: physical hardship (knee-deep cold water), emotional burden (ghostly communion), and social risk (challenging official history). The tightening—from private obsession to imminent journalistic action—occurs without coincidence, fulfilling Accumulative lens requirements with one decisive cadence shift at the panel’s opening.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—whether to speak or swallow a catastrophic vision—is signaled early and deepens when Cassandra confronts her anomalous certainty. Her agency crystallizes not in action but renunciation: withholding the prophecy despite knowing it dooms the Consortium. Cost is unmistakable: she bears the “private weight” alone, sacrificing institutional loyalty for ethical autonomy. Pressure escalates internally but coherently, with Mira’s presence heightening the intimacy of her choice without resolving it.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—validating Daniela’s existence against institutional erasure—tightens when Marcus finds the beads, forcing a shift from explorer to advocate. The deepening occurs via protagonist agency: interpreting radio calls leads him to the valve room, where counting becomes moral obligation. Cost is unmistakable: seventeen years of swallowed silence now demands public reckoning. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each bead intensifies the ethical weight.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—witnessing change without judgment—is signaled early and deepened through Maren’s renunciation of control. The meaningful tightening occurs when she learns from the swan’s folds to “document without disturbing,” foreclosing any impulse to preserve or narrativize. Cost is felt in her acceptance of dissolution as generative; pressure accumulates texturally rather than causally, consistent with the Accumulative lens. No coincidence resolves tension—it is metabolized.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving connection amid separation—is signaled early and deepens under eclipse pressure. Elena’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to give the locket, transforming Maya’s fear into charged poise. The cost (letting go of a physical tether to her child’s infancy) is felt in the trembling handover. Coincidence (eclipse timing) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the emotional turn stems from character choice under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restoring the axis—is signaled early via Elise’s diary and deepens when Maren realizes the displacement predates the Silence. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: she probes, descends, finds, interprets. Cost is conceptual (carrying world-altering knowledge in a dead-dream world) and felt (“weight of an axis waiting to be restored”). One tightening suffices; no false resolutions or coincidences.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—whether to remain hidden or be seen—is signaled early and tightens when the journalist’s arrival forces a choice. Mei Lin’s agency drives escalation: she doesn’t wait passively but writes the revelatory fortune in advance. Cost is unmistakable: surrendering classified secrets she’s carried since 1987. The deepening (“transpose life into a new key”) narrows options from espionage to public eccentricity, with emotional price felt in her smile at the final fortune.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving Elena’s soul by exposing her false certainty—is signaled early and deepens when Marcus reframes emptiness as strength. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: each layered question tightens the entity’s grip while expanding Elena’s cognitive space. The three-minute clock forces tactical urgency, and cost is unmistakable in Elena’s psychic rupture (“screamed—and then laughed”). Pressure coheres causally: assumptions pulled → shadows dissolve → boundaries solidify.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reconnecting with lost mystery—is signaled early and deepens when Li Wei realizes fortunes have grown hollow. Her agency drives escalation: climbing before exhaustion, mapping memories, choosing to write one final truth. The cost is palpable: physical collapse, abandonment of livelihood, and irreversible shift from obscurity to conduit. Dawn doesn’t resolve via coincidence; it crystallizes her stance after decades of preparation.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—conquering the labyrinth of self—is signaled early and deepens through Mira’s evolving understanding: from seeking a center to accepting endless construction. The meaningful tightening occurs when she recognizes the tablet doesn’t curse but reveals her nature, foreclosing the path of escape and forcing embrace of multiplicity. Cost is conceptual yet felt: she relinquishes unity for perpetual becoming, crystallized in her ascent toward “next beautiful impossibility.” Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves tension.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming emotional connection to music—is signaled early and deepens when Elias reveals the “filament of hush.” Escalation occurs through Marina’s agency: she accepts the needle, places hands on the drum, surrenders to vibration. Cost is felt in her tears and the acknowledgment that numbness was self-imposed armor. One meaningful tightening suffices; pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. state secrecy—is signaled early and tightens when the message confirms her dismissed anomalies were evidence. The deepening isn’t external escalation but internal: her “impossibility shifted beneath her like loose earth,” forcing a trade-off between safety and integrity. Agency is clear: she chooses stillness tonight but plans distribution tomorrow, narrowing future options. Cost is conceptual (eroded trust in institutions) and personal (being followed), felt in the brass tube’s warmth against her palm.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding scent-triggered grief—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: Maren chooses to uncork the vial despite lifelong caution. The tightening occurs when she inhales the oil, forcing confrontation with ancestral memory. Cost is unmistakable: tears, vulnerability, and the irreversible knowledge that “every scent was a ghost.” Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—whether time accumulates or merely passes—is signaled early and deepened through Marcus’s interaction with the rope, which embodies Jerome’s impossible choice. The tightening occurs when the woman arrives and validates his method, transforming private inquiry into shared witness. Agency is exercised through attention and poetic transcription, not physical action, fitting the Accumulative lens. Cost is visible: Marcus accepts that meaning emerges only through layered, uncertain acts of interpretation—a stance crystallized in his refusal to seek definitive answers.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming music in a world muted by ecological trauma—is signaled early and deepens when Marina shifts from fighting the hush to collaborating with it. The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses to play *between* silences, foreclosing the path of virtuosic dominance and embracing vulnerability. Cost is felt: her music is “simpler, more patient,” imperfect, shaped by loss. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves the core conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming authentic feeling after professional desensitization—is signaled early and escalates through Vera’s voluntary inhalation of unbearable truth. The tightening occurs when the chemist’s compassion breaches her defenses, forcing renunciation of clinical detachment. Cost is felt in her irreversible vulnerability (“tears on her cheeks”) and reconfigured motivation. Agency drives every turn; coincidence never resolves pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—rectifying historical erasure—is signaled early and deepens when Marina accesses her grandmother’s ledgers, transforming curiosity into obligation. The tightening occurs when she chooses not just to return the photo but to “throw open her archives,” foreclosing passive neutrality. Agency is clear: her broker’s mind calculates restitution, and her influence mobilizes institutional change. Cost is felt in emotional weight (“strange electricity of inherited obligation”) and implied lifelong commitment, though the external price (time, reputation, resources) remains lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—belonging without erasure—is signaled early and deepens when Veren shifts from observer to co-creator of ritual. Her agency drives escalation: noticing patterns Kael misses, initiating sculptural responses, recruiting others. The cost is felt in her vulnerability (“I shape reeds… I don’t know if that makes me a sculptor”) and paid in the final offering of her art as communal language.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—completing interrupted cadences—is signaled early via fossils and deepened when Miriam recognizes her life’s work as prelude to this mission. Escalation is driven by agency: she borrows time repeatedly, culminating in the uncaging act that trades her future for resolution. Cost is unmistakable: “She did not know how much time she had left,” yet proceeds anyway, crystallizing her stance under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—resolving ambiguous loss—is signaled early and deepens when Mira realizes her equations map herself, not Theo. The meaningful tightening occurs at the apparition’s revelation (“I’m the space between your equations”), which forecloses her original goal with conceptual cost: some losses have no coordinates. Agency is clear—she chooses to continue her work not to find Theo but to carry loss—and the price (abandoning the fantasy of retrieval) is legible in her pocketed eyes and the “first green shoot of optimism.” Pressure coheres entirely under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—being forgotten vs. choosing to be remembered—is signaled early and deepens through the blackout’s disruption. Maren’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to move, to listen, to cache, and finally to expose a treasure. The cost is felt in her trembling hesitation and the irreversible breach of total invisibility. Coincidence (the outage) complicates but doesn’t resolve; her choice crystallizes under coherent pressure shaped by the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—surrendering to metamorphosis—is signaled early and deepens when Vera recognizes the leaf’s vein pattern from dreams. Escalation is driven by her agency: rejecting creams/doctors, then choosing to “release control entirely.” The meaningful tightening occurs when she stops fighting, accepting that “growth cannot be commanded.” Cost is unmistakable: loss of human form, privacy, and ordinary life, crystallized in her silvering hair and descending roots.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—threshing meaning from chaos—is signaled early and tightens when Mira abandons repetitive painting to follow rain trails, risking emotional confrontation with ghosts. Her agency drives escalation: the walk across the causeway, entry into the museum, choice to share her life’s work. Cost is felt: years of isolation exchanged for fragile collaboration, underscored by Theo’s parallel loss (“She died searching for it”).

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—accessing magnified magic—is signaled early and deepens when Vera realizes the unseen forces aren’t guardians but fellow witnesses. The meaningful tightening occurs when shadows surge upon her reach: the cost of grasping the pearl is confronting her lifelong blindness to the present. Agency drives escalation—Vera chooses to press forward despite fear—and the final trade-off (prophecy for presence) carries unmistakable emotional cost. Coincidence (the pilgrim’s map) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Vera earns insight through action.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—compiling fragments into navigable meaning—is signaled early and deepens via Elena’s staggered method, which forecloses haste but enables revelation. Agency lies in endurance and attention: she chooses slow reconstruction over catharsis, bearing the cost of incomplete answers. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; each family visit tightens emotional stakes without melodrama. Coincidence (new leadership) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the real work remains hers alone.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—confronting silence to reclaim truth—is signaled early and deepens at midnight. Clara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to follow cracks, trusts the punch, steps through the door. The cost is legible: abandoning her identity as a mapper of physical routes for one of emotional ones. No coincidence resolves tension; every turn stems from her willingness to “dare,” narrowing options until only reconciliation remains.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restoring entangled memories—is signaled early and tightens through Mira’s choice to transcribe despite doubt. The escalation is driven by her agency: she writes, she listens, she trusts. Cost is felt in her emotional exposure and the irreversible commitment to belief. Though the whales’ departure removes external pressure, the internal stakes intensify, culminating in a quiet but decisive act of faith.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—escaping eternal boredom through understanding farewell—is signaled early and deepens when the amulet reveals its map. Vera’s intrigue actively tightens pressure, fracturing the group’s numb consensus. Cost is unmistakable: the escondite collapses, immortals scatter, and peace is traded for uncertainty. Escalation stems from protagonist agency under Accumulative pressure, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—whether fairness exists in human exchange—is signaled early and deepens through Maya’s confrontation with Mr. Chen. The meaningful tightening occurs when she reframes her mission: not retrieval, but witness. Her agency crystallizes in “He asked. I chose,” foreclosing complicity and demanding moral clarity. Cost is unmistakable: she carries her father’s theft, her mother’s history, and the burden of being the honest child in a dishonest world.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving invented histories through paper—is signaled early and tightened by Dawn 744’s “mournful” hum, which forces Mei to endure emotional residue (“ash and wedding cake”) without resolution. Agency lies in attention: her choice to climb daily forecloses ordinary life, cost felt in the town’s oblivious bustle below. Pressure escalates texturally—the hum’s shift narrows her emotional bandwidth—and culminates in a stance crystallization where silence becomes sacred duty. Coincidence (the lamp’s installation) complicates but doesn’t resolve; all meaning stems from her disciplined response.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the truth behind her husband’s disappearance and her own falsified death—is signaled early and deepens when she hears the men reference “the Meridian shipment” and “same poison notation.” The tightening occurs through her agency: she layers fragments into evidence, then resolves to confront the doctor. Cost is unmistakable: she lives as a ghost, stripped of legal identity, surviving only through whispered truths. Pressure escalates via overheard dialogue that connects her personal loss to a systemic cover-up, raising stakes from grief to survival against institutional murder.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether to listen to what was previously unheard—is signaled early and deepens through protagonist agency: Eleanor chooses to draw the bow despite her disbelief, then chooses to reinterpret her history. The tightening occurs when the cello plays back her own unspoken confession (“I became a myth buster because I wanted control…”), foreclosing her old path of defensive certainty. Cost is unmistakable: she must endure the pain of her father’s last words to access their love. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with each voice narrowing her emotional options until stance crystallizes.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving communal autonomy against privatization—is signaled early and tightens via the thorned anchor graffiti and investor arrival. Mira’s agency drives escalation: she reports Marinero resistance, announces the six-month deadline, and brokers unity. Cost is felt (“meal tokens,” “shared resources” vanishing) but could be sharper—e.g., a concrete loss like revoked mooring rights. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; pressure stems from coherent external forces and internal divisions.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving the last moment of true darkness before satellite saturation—is signaled early and tightens relentlessly via a live clock (“seventeen more seconds of true night”). Elena’s agency lies in attention and endurance, not action; her choice to witness rather than protest forecloses nothing but accepts irreversible cultural loss. Pressure escalates through environmental cues (horizon shift, satellite crossing) and internal reckoning, culminating in a stance crystallization that reweights progress as inherently sacrificial. Cost is felt in the stars’ drowning and the father’s unfulfilled legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—restoring the drone before noon—is signaled early and tightens via the harbor bells’ cadence. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses slowness over speed, trusting her method despite time pressure. Cost is felt in every beat (burned rotors, hairline fracture) and crystallized when the anchor lifts—proof her endurance worked. Coincidence never resolves; success stems from her sensory discipline under coherent, accumulating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—correcting cartographic lies—is signaled early and deepened by personal stakes (daughter’s silence, wife’s departure). The tightening occurs when the falcon’s return creates a narrow window: three days before ice seals the passage, forcing immediate action. Maren’s agency drives escalation—she chooses to walk despite Volkov’s warning that “terrain doesn’t want to be known.” Cost is unmistakable: she sacrifices potential reconciliation (“file the revised coordinates anyway”) for truth, accepting possible death as price. The phrase “singular convergence” crystallizes pressure: timing, terrain, and stubbornness align once, making inaction a greater loss than failure.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring balance between town and mountain—is clear from the first paragraph. Pressure escalates texturally: Day 1 maps decay, Day 2 rebuilds resonance, Day 3 triggers collapse-as-rebirth. The bell tuner’s agency drives each phase; coincidence never resolves tension. Cost is legible in the elders’ silent weeping and the physical erasure of Veradhen—yet hope persists via the tuning fork’s transfer.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—harnessing the ephemeral—is signaled early and deepens when Marina realizes the memories are “snarled,” requiring unsnarling, not extraction. Her agency drives escalation: overriding instinct to release rather than take transforms the vial’s meaning. Oxygen countdown tightens tactics without resolving via coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—being believed despite lineage—is signaled early and tightens when Milo realizes truth requires a willing listener, not just evidence. His agency drives escalation: he enters the confessional, reads the scratches, speaks through the lattice. The deepening (“the wolf was never the point”) reframes the entire conflict, narrowing options to one sacrificial act of naming. Cost is unmistakable: inheriting his father’s fate unless he transforms it, paid in trembling hands and shattered silence.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—repaying Maren’s century-old debt—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency: Elias chooses to place the final bead, triggering the resonant awakening. The tightening is decisive: once the beads hum together, there’s no turning back—Maren dissolves, night ends, the orchard’s purpose concludes. Cost is unmistakable: the loss of ancestral magic, the end of Maren’s haunting presence, and the burden of being the last heir. Pressure remains coherent under an Accumulative lens, with each generation’s tribute deepening the inevitability of this climax.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—transforming cruel tradition into compassionate guidance—is signaled early and escalates through Meren’s deliberate violation of “broken precedents.” The tightening occurs when she stitches three overlapping paths into one, narrowing options: she can no longer maintain neutrality; she must choose between ancestral orthodoxy and her vision. Cost is unmistakable: she accepts being labeled a desecrator while knowing children will no longer sob at dead ends. Agency drives every escalation—her seventeen years of mapping, her choice of materials, her timing—all culminating in a reconfiguration that refuses punishment for its own sake.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—restoring interrupted faith—is signaled early and deepens when Mira learns her mother turned back. The meaningful tightening occurs at the sundial: rebuilding it isn’t symbolic but catalytic, triggering the orchard’s luminosity.

Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving slow, human-scale connection against digital erasure—is signaled early and deepened through Vera’s transcription of chalk codes into life-or-death instructions. The tightening occurs when “timing critical, departure imminent” forces immediate action within the thirty-seven-day constraint. Cost is legible: Vera endures emotional distance (never knowing real names) to sustain the network, and the child’s unknowing participation underscores the generational price of this resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—exposing the coup—is signaled early and deepens into a purge revelation, tightening options to a 72-hour window. Mira’s agency drives escalation: her “synchronizing” transforms fragmented whispers into actionable intel, forcing her to risk retrieval under contemptuous eyes. Cost is felt in her deliberate self-abasement (“tangle yourself into knots”) and the irreversible exposure if caught. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—density of intel increases until the constellation snaps into focus, narrowing her path to one perilous mission.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—breaking silence to absolve her mother—is signaled early (“apology hung unspoken”) and tightens when the spirit demands understanding (“why I stayed silent”). Protagonist agency drives escalation: Celeste steps onto roots, evokes truth, speaks aloud. Cost is unmistakable—twenty years of isolation crystallized in “scarred hands steady on the oars.” The moonlight-healing trait enables the climax (condensation forms words only in its pool), making stakes visceral. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—translating truth without inflicting harm—tightens when Marina must reinterpret the girl’s warning (“boats are coming”) mercifully. This deepening forces a trade-off: fidelity vs. protection, echoing her wartime trauma. Agency is clear: she chooses mercy, grafting “new meaning onto old wounds.” Cost is unmistakable—the shrapnel’s origin (killing a boy) surfaces only after she softens the message, linking past and present moral burden under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recovering authentic joy through art—is signaled early and deepens when the fragment’s warmth triggers insight.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—making the invisible visible—is signaled early and deepens when Margot realizes visibility requires surrendering expertise. The escalation hinges on her agency: after failed technical approaches, she chooses vulnerability (“What did you want us to see?”), which narrows her path from restorer to participant. Cost is legible in her relinquished authority and the fading image she no longer tries to capture. Pressure coheres accumulatively, not causally, but tightens meaningfully at the pause—a live temporal hinge that alters everything.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—freedom to think—is signaled early and deepens when Marcus reveals Sofia’s unwitting role in building “infrastructure.” The tightening occurs when she realizes her tomatoes were tactical; this forecloses her innocence with visible cost (soil-stained gloves now symbolize complicity).

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—transmuting grief into communal beauty—is signaled early and deepens through Minerva’s teaching of refugees and coral-bloom armistice. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: each lullaby tightens her role as reef-healer, foreclosing personal rest for collective sustenance. Cost is unmistakable: “never been able to sleep” becomes both wound and medium. Coincidence never resolves; peace emerges solely from her persistent, imperfect singing.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving forgotten names—is signaled early and deepens when Mira risks emotional retraumatization by humming the lullaby. The escalation is driven by her agency: she chooses to invoke the song, knowing it may reopen wounds. Cost is unmistakable: confronting the extinct phonemes of her daughter’s name exacts visible emotional toll (tears), yet yields renewal. The tightening forecloses passive caretaking; she becomes an active restorer.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—restoring trust before permanent separation—is signaled early and tightens when Maren risks vulnerability by proposing the Veth’ari promise. The escalation is protagonist-driven: her choice to confess blame forces Elias’s reciprocal admission, narrowing options from estrangement to collaboration. Cost is unmistakable: both expose raw shame (“easier to endure your anger than your forgiveness”), making reconciliation fragile yet active. The “one night” deadline intensifies pressure without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. safety—is signaled early via the grandmother’s cipher and deepens when Mira learns the villages remain threatened. The tightening occurs when decoding reveals Elara’s real choice: disgrace over genocide. Mira’s agency drives escalation—she photographs, reseals, and chooses calibrated silence—altering tactics based on new knowledge. Cost is felt: she bears forty-two years of encrypted grief, delaying justice to build protective alliances.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—rebuilding trust after betrayal—is signaled early and deepens when Mira arrives, forcing Elara to choose between silence and connection. The escalation is driven by Elara’s agency: she swallows the lie, tells her truth, invites Mira onto the trunk, and gives her the meteorite. Cost is legible: the risk of exposure, the pain of memory, and the irreversible step into visibility. Though stakes remain internal, they intensify coherently under the Accumulative lens, with the journal representing a foreclosed path back to anonymity.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—crossing thresholds meaningfully—is signaled early and deepens when Wren deciphers weather codes as prayers, transforming passive waiting into active readiness. Escalation is protagonist-driven: her decision to retrieve and interpret the logbook tightens options, culminating in the irreversible step toward the violet edge.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—finding belonging through shared attention—is signaled early and deepens when Marina recognizes Theo’s work as “luminous respite.” The tightening occurs when they exhale together, transforming observation into ritual. Agency lies in sustained attention, not action; the cost is Marina’s prior isolation, now rendered obsolete yet still felt. Pressure accumulates texturally (light patterns, stellar data, fish behavior) until the spawning event crystallizes their connection. No coincidence resolves anything—only mutual witnessing.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding why paths disappear—is signaled early and deepens when seeds reframe the mystery as transformation, not erasure. Mira’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to layer bird migration over her sister’s emotions, triggering the pivotal reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—making wonder feel inevitable—is signaled early and tightens when the child’s splash threatens “calculated wilderness,” forcing Marina to adapt her melody. This deepening reweights her philosophy: true orchestration requires space for chaos. Cost is visible in her relinquished control and invisible labor (the crowd sees only “magic”). Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens; coincidence (child) complicates but doesn’t resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming forbidden memory through embodied art—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Kira chooses inscription over safety. The deepening occurs in Selene’s warning (“You will never belong…”) and Kira’s renunciation of provincial identity, narrowing options irreversibly.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving meaning in a vanishing world—is signaled early and tightens when the council’s vote forecloses physical salvation. Elena’s agency lies in redefining preservation: scattering glass like seeds.

Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves anything.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—releasing Celia without losing her—is signaled early and tightens when Marcus freezes at the climax. His agency drives the escalation: reflection leads to insight, which enables release.

    Dominant stake—Elise’s survival—is clear from the outset and deepens through Marina’s active experimentation. The meaningful tightening occurs when the triangle bead configuration consistently brightens survival timelines, narrowing options to Geneva.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to architectural memory—is signaled early and deepens when Mira discovers Helena’s filaments, transforming personal quest into generational duty. The tightening occurs when she chooses diaries over sensors, narrowing her method to human testimony.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—making the unseen seen—is signaled early and tightens when the bells threaten to shatter the “delicate membrane” between worlds. The painter’s agency drives escalation: she chooses silence, patience, and a specific heartbeat, narrowing her window and raising emotional stakes. Cost is unmistakable—the old woman’s final pulse traded for her granddaughter’s self-worth—and crystallizes in the Charged Poise of the ending: the mirror now shows possibility, but only because someone paid with their last breath. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from her deliberate craft.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—ending the Forever War—is signaled early and deepened by the celestial ritual’s narrow window, forcing irreversible action. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she designs the ritual, invokes shared reverence, and names the dead to crystallize stakes. Cost is unmistakable—“forty-three years of watching young soldiers march”—and the trade-off (fragile hope vs. certain grief) sharpens the climax. Coincidence (moons aligning) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from her precise softness.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving extinct voices despite personal moral ruin—is signaled early and deepens through Eleanor’s reflection on the manufactured drought. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she chooses to enact the drought, then chooses to memorialize extinction.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—defiance of enforced femininity—is signaled early and deepens through protagonist agency: untangling threads reweights legacy into actionable inheritance. Escalation occurs via embodied pressure (voices whispering rebellion as she works), narrowing options from passive muse to active teacher. Cost is unmistakable: she bears generations’ unsilenced grief alone until it becomes communal strength. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from her deliberate, costly choices.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—ethical storytelling—is signaled early and tightened when Vera demands proof (“Show me”). Marcus’s agency drives escalation: he performs, forcing her confrontation with her own rigidity. Cost is legible: his artistic exile, her compromised ideals.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—honoring overlooked histories—is signaled early and deepens when Vera chooses to sacrifice her grandmother’s moth wing, narrowing her emotional options. The meaningful tightening occurs when monarchs *respond* to the knots, validating her method but not altering extinction’s inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—preserving forgotten names—is signaled early and deepens when Elin realizes preservation alone is insufficient; names must be sung. The tightening occurs when she chooses to reconfigure the rope despite its fragility, risking erasure to enable remembrance. Agency drives escalation: her hands work, her voice opens. Cost is visible—the card disintegrates—and conceptual: permanence requires surrender, not control.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding why paths choose walkers—is signaled early and deepens when Mira realizes transcendence means becoming “the choosing itself.” The tightening occurs at the seal-breaking: she could step into any phantom life but chooses instead to walk with paths, accepting uncertainty. Cost is felt (“learned to love uncertainty”) and the storm’s timing creates coherent pressure. Agency drives escalation; coincidence complicates (storm arrival) but doesn’t resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—establishing contact with the unknown—is signaled early and deepens when stellar alignment completes the polymath’s sequence. Escalation is driven by Mira’s agency: her calculations narrow options until the prime-number message forces a choice—to believe and wait.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—breaking cycles of hatred—is signaled early and deepens through cellular memory activation. Pressure tightens when Thorne recognizes the music box, forcing a choice between inherited rage and ancestral peace. Agency lies in Thorne’s unclenched fists, not Mireva’s intervention.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—recovering the dream—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes it wasn’t lost but waiting. The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses *not* to step through, foreclosing immediate gratification for a slower, truer approach. Agency is clear: her breath controls the boundary.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving mending knowledge—is signaled early and tightens when the journal reveals the daughter’s foresight, foreclosing Mira’s assumption of extinction. Pressure escalates through protagonist agency: Petra insists on bringing the bag; Mira chooses to teach. Cost is legible in the fog-colored ribbon and the guild’s dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding forbidden knowledge—is signaled early and tightens when Maren realizes knowing entails responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—retrieving Thessaly by finding the Library—is signaled early and deepens when Mira realizes the mountain “rescues” listeners from a world that won’t learn. This insight, born of her agency (interpreting the diary’s flower-map), narrows options: persuasion replaces extraction.

Pressure coheres under the Hybrid lens, with the time traveler complicating but not resolving the core conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming a forgotten sister—is signaled early and tightens when Maya chooses invention over passive searching. The meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the Garden is erasure, not sanctuary, forcing a trade-off: accept solipsistic peace or risk fragile reconnection.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—translating confusion into clarity—is signaled early and deepens when the seal links to the door. Pressure escalates not through external threat but through accumulating responsibility: Mira alone can restore what was deliberately knotted.

Coincidence (finding the seal) complicates but doesn’t resolve; her methodical labor earns the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—access to silence—is signaled early and deepens when Vera realizes maps are obsolete. Agency escalates through her decision to seek the bloom of hush, then to chart it for others.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the prism’s vision—tightens when Mira neglects the beacon, risking total darkness. Her agency drives escalation: choosing to touch the prism despite past torment, then racing to relight the flame. Cost is visible in the “last ember faded” and her trembling hands.

Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each vision deepens stakes until alignment demands response.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving vs. redefining collective memory—is signaled early and escalates through Elara’s agency: her conjecture forces confrontation with contradictory monuments, culminating in the decision to share destabilizing truth.

Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to climb, to ignite, to perform. Cost is felt in her trembling, the weight of memory, and the irreversible act of lighting the sky. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length; the grandmother’s return complicates but doesn’t resolve—Elara must still choose to burn.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—reconciliation across years of absence—is signaled early and deepens when Mira admits she was physically absent during her husband’s death. The meaningful tightening occurs not through external pressure but internal reckoning: Mira’s choice to offer the cicada instead of a direct excuse reweights the conversation. Cost is unmistakable—Elena’s lingering hurt, Mira’s shame—and agency drives escalation: Mira’s tangential explanation is itself a tactic shaped by her worldview. The lens holds: accumulation of texture intensifies stakes without causal plot turns.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming safety without suffocation—is signaled early and deepens through the inversion sequence, which narrows Mira’s options to endure or flee. Her agency lies in attention: choosing to listen, to stay, to defer. The cost is legible in her trembling breath and the doll’s accumulating weight—intangible yet felt. Pressure escalates not through external threat but internal confrontation, coherent under the Accumulative lens. The white flower blooming toward golden clouds embodies the stakes made visible.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—transforming silence from echo chamber to vessel of comfort—is signaled early and tightens when the unprecedented helix pattern appears. Escalation is driven by Eris’s agency: she chooses to open the vial, catalyzing change. Cost is unmistakable—the loss of Mira’s last physical trace—and narrows options: she cannot undo the dissolution, only carry forward its consequence. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; each sensory detail intensifies the weight of her purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—claiming legitimacy before dawn—tightens coherently under Causal pressure: each mural uncovered narrows the path, and the ruby flake’s pulse confirms proximity, forcing urgency. The escalation is protagonist-driven (Meridia’s peeling reveals the map), not coincidental. Cost is felt in time lost, age acknowledged (“sixty-four years old”), and the irreversible step into the tree. Though stakes are high (empire’s future), they remain viscerally anchored in Meridia’s personal gamble, not abstract declarations.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—whether connection can be relearned without destroying sanctuary—is signaled early and tightens when Sera arrives. Mira’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to lift the knocker, dissolve the threshold, and teach. Cost is felt in her relinquished purity of isolation. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no false resolutions or coincidences.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—transforming predatory loss into generative proof—is signaled early and deepens when the quantum promise demands a witness who “understands transformation.” Vera’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to volunteer, channels pressure via the bolt, and accepts the psychological cost of parallel memories. The tightening forecloses passivity; her past victimhood could have paralyzed her, but she actively compresses grief into diamonds. Coincidence (dimensional thinning) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the resolution stems from her practiced resilience.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—uncovering hidden truth about the Ashworth legacy—is signaled early and deepens into a moral imperative. Escalation occurs through Margaret’s agency: turning the crank, allowing her mind to unfocus, choosing silence over comfort. The tightening is decisive: she moves from passive musing to active commitment (“begin… to learn the language of standing waves”). Cost is unmistakable—tears, estrangement from her mother’s worldview, inheritance forfeited—and shapes the final Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—capturing possibility through surrender—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: Aldric chooses to read, unclasp, speak, raise arms. The tightening (“release the shape of certainty”) forecloses his knightly path with visible cost (armor abandoned, Order renounced). Pressure escalates texturally but coherently under the Accumulative lens, culminating in a trade-off: certainty for connection. Coincidence never resolves; every shift stems from Aldric’s embodied choices under mystical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving unrecorded acts of love—is signaled early and deepens when Eleanor connects Thomas’s search to her own purpose. The tightening occurs at the button’s discovery: it transforms archival duty into personal mission. Agency is clear in her choice to photograph but not remove the artifact, accepting that some histories must remain untouched. Cost is felt in her acknowledgment that this work won’t heal her—but she does it anyway.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving historical truth—tightens decisively when the Council’s midnight raid forces Mira to compress three years of prep into hours. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she triggers a decoy, slips through secondary exits, and uploads files despite boots overhead. Cost is unmistakable: forfeited safety, exposure of her double life, and the irreversible activation of global truth dissemination. Coincidence complicates (they followed her trail) but doesn’t resolve; victory stems from her resourcefulness.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—silencing a hereditary prophecy—is signaled early and deepens through the protagonist’s tactical use of “vested hush.” The meaningful tightening occurs when she plays “the inverse of the prophecy’s rhythm,” narrowing options to a single, high-stakes method. Agency is clear: her decades of preparation culminate in a renunciatory act that forecloses the bloodline’s curse. Cost is felt in “eerie nostalgia” and the irreversible loss of ancestral voices, visible in the quiet aftermath.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—decoding meaning in a meaningless world—tightens during the “hush,” when time pauses and the leaf’s invitation forces irreversible choice. Wren’s agency drives escalation: she retrieves the probe, traces veins, accepts dissolution of self. Cost is unmistakable: loss of static identity (“edges blur”) for uncertain fluency. The deepening—realizing leaves offer transformation, not prophecy—narrows her path from observer to participant with resonant price.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—befriending uncertainty—is signaled early and tightens when Mira recognizes “coincidence becomes pattern,” forcing her to act. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses to descend, dig, and reinterpret the compass. Cost is unmistakable: she surrenders her life’s work (“beneath the ashes of her old convictions”). The single meaningful deepening—admiral’s log revealing “storms as teachers”—reweights navigation as constant adjustment, not fixed paths.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—redemption through transmutation—is signaled early and deepens when Mira rejects purification for kintsugi. Agency drives escalation: she chooses impure ingredients, honors flaws, embeds the coin. Cost is unmistakable: carrying shame as gold-seamed legacy, not discarding it. Pressure tightens once—when fire meets fragments—and the final image reweights all prior effort under the Accumulative lens, with no coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—recovering purpose through connection—is signaled early and deepens when spectral confessions reveal Maren’s forgotten acts of levity. The tightening occurs when she realizes her work was never just passage but presence, foreclosing her self-perception as lost. Agency drives escalation: she chooses to touch the harp, then to laugh, crystallizing stance under pressure. Cost is legible in the lingering ache, now transformed—a felt price for reclaimed meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—discovering the mathematics of mercy—is signaled early and deepens when Elena perceives the algorithm’s cruelty encoded in the trees. Escalation is driven by her agency: interpreting pain as data, tracing equations, choosing to stay and rewrite. Cost is unmistakable: her body remembers every voltage, yet she weaponizes that memory. The ultraviolet penance timeframe heightens urgency without resolving via coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—recovering overlooked histories—is signaled early and deepens when Mira realizes taking the fragment commits her to a life of liminal labor. The tightening occurs at the vendor’s stall: choosing to unfasten the thread forecloses ordinary life, with cost felt in the “decades of waiting” released. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict—Mira’s agency drives the turn. Cost is legible in the final breath where she sees “ghost-markets” others ignore.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to the overlooked—is signaled early via Miriam’s backstory and reinforced by dust analysis. The meaningful tightening occurs when she shifts from observer to advocate (“Where should it go?”), foreclosing passive neutrality. Cost is felt in the “weightless burden” she carries out—an emotional and moral weight, not physical. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, though the pressure remains internal rather than externalized conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—freeing stories from sterile perfection—is signaled early (“books ripening on branches that should have shattered”) and deepens via Maren’s realization that “perfection left no room for… discovery.” Escalation is protagonist-driven: she chooses rupture despite knowing it will destroy her press. Cost is unmistakable: flawless reproductions end, replaced by “imperfect” creation. The whisper’s release isn’t luck—it’s the culmination of her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reimagining a lost civilization—is signaled early and deepens into participatory transcendence. Maren’s agency drives escalation: her theory leads to uncovering the mirror, which reveals the truth, which compels her crossing. The cost is tangible: she forfeits her physical presence, her research, and her place among the squabbling academics. Pressure tightens coherently under an Accumulative lens with one decisive intensification—the mirror revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—tethering the light before midnight claims it—is signaled early and tightens when dishonesty triggers physical wilting, forcing a moral recalibration. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: each wound music box deepens harmonic density, but only after Elias corrects his intention does progress resume. Cost is unmistakable—the chip extinguishes, his grandmother stays gone—and midnight’s threat gives temporal urgency that narrows options. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with one decisive deepening that reweights the entire endeavor.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—accessing the Threshold—is signaled early and deepens when the compass reveals Vennard’s fate, forcing Maren to choose between extraction (returning with petrichor) or immersion (staying). This tightening forecloses the path home with felt cost: her lifelong quest concludes not in retrieval but surrender. Agency drives escalation—she unstopperes the jar not to collect but to acknowledge the scent as key—and the resonant hush becomes expectant only after her choice, proving pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—finding purpose through inherited legacy—is signaled early via the slide. Escalation occurs when lightning aligns with the slide, deepening knowledge (layers reveal alliances), which narrows options: Marina must choose between modern navigation (failed GPS) or ancestral resonance. Cost is legible—she forfeits conventional direction for intuitive, weighty responsibility. Coincidence (storm clearing) complicates but doesn’t resolve; her agency drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding why some beauty waits for darkness—is signaled early and tightens through Mira’s daily ritual, culminating in her realization that intimacy requires obscurity. The meaningful deepening occurs when she shifts from observer to participant, painting not what she sees but what she now knows: that darkness offers partnership, not absence. Cost is unmistakable—she abandons her signature vivid palette, trading acclaim for resonance with the unseen. Escalation is driven entirely by her agency under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—uncovering manufactured water scarcity—is signaled early and tightens when Celeste decodes coordinates leading to a fenced, “toxic” site. Her agency drives escalation: she leverages favors, breaches barriers, and interprets parley signs. The deepening occurs when she realizes the truth was encoded for an archivist like her, raising personal stakes. Cost is unmistakable: she inherits testimonial burden that will “burn through every comfortable silence,” altering her life irrevocably. Coincidence (letters surfacing) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from her interpretive labor.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reimagining civilization without dependency—is signaled early and deepened when Mira rejects stone restoration for memory-based lanterns. Escalation is driven by her agency: communion over extraction, transformation over preservation. Cost is unmistakable: seventeen years of exile, the bottle’s paradoxical seal, the villagers’ trauma. The fisherman’s true wish reframes the conflict, forcing Mira to confront not loss but latent capacity—a deepening that narrows options to one resonant act.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving emotional truth—deepens into preparing for future convergence, foreclosing pure archivism. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her multilingual invocation triggers the prophecy, apple-fall pattern, and self-realization. Cost is unmistakable: she’s now bound to a conversation spanning millennia, sacrificing neutrality for participation. The foghorn’s return at dawn looms as a deadline that sharpens every action without resolving via luck.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—accessing the vortex without dissolution—is signaled early and escalates through Maren’s risky method (decreasing entropy). The tightening occurs when she chooses to hum the grandmother-taught frequency, narrowing options to success or total loss. Cost is felt in the “entropy’s hunger” she risks and the weight of seventeen generations; the world’s thawing beyond the atrium raises stakes without resolving them externally. Agency remains hers throughout—no coincidence solves the core dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—listening vs. noise—is signaled early and deepens through Mira’s instruments converging at solstice. The tightening occurs when the rope is mended and the note declares “You will know,” forcing Mira to choose between perpetual vigilance and sacred acknowledgment.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—finding meaning in cosmic loneliness—is signaled early and deepens through Mira’s nightly ritual.

The meteor’s “death as arrival” crystallizes her stance under coherent pressure, with no coincidental resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving unspoken words—is signaled early and deepens when the mother-ghost arrives, forcing Maren to choose between immediate release (giving words) and covenant fidelity (withholding). This tightening forecloses the path of easy compassion, charging the ending with conceptual cost: truth remains buried so silence may be honored. Agency is clear (Maren opens/closes the box), though escalation leans more on thematic accumulation than causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—deciphering Elena’s method—is signaled early and tightens when Vera recognizes garage-sale listings as emotional coordinates. The deepening occurs through protagonist agency: matching fragment inscriptions to listings, which narrows her mission to active continuation. Cost is unmistakable: seventeen borrowed years now irrevocably committed. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each listing adds density until the capsule’s mechanism engages, foreclosing passive observation.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—beauty in incompleteness—is signaled early and tightens when the boy’s ruined kite tests Mira’s philosophy. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses to mend asymmetrically, securing the feather as proof that “different carries its own kind of flight.” Cost is visible in the kite’s permanent alteration and the boy’s surrendered expectation of sameness. Yet pressure remains gentle; the conflict lacks visceral urgency, relying on thematic weight over situational peril.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—fostering interspecies respect before death—is signaled early and deepens when Maren’s physical decline forces her to teach others, narrowing her personal agency but expanding impact. Protagonist-driven escalation: her systematic wiring creates cascading partnerships (oak/pillar → foxes/ravens/bees). Cost is unmistakable: trembling hands foreclose climbing, yet she endures to document everything. The six-month clock tightens tactics without melodrama, culminating in Charged Poise where options (live/die) reconfigure into timeless participation.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—whether manufactured meaning can become real—is signaled early and deepened when Mira recognizes her own pull toward the site. The tightening occurs at the amber: her scientific knowledge collides with emotional resonance, narrowing options from skepticism to witness. Agency lies in attention and interpretation; cost is the surrender of intellectual armor. No false resolution—aliens remain distant, but human response becomes the answer.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—fertilizing the battlefield via reef-fed seeds—is signaled early and tightens through Erasmus’s nightly deepening: each pod type follows bird-guided rotations that narrow options (e.g., vetch now, clover tomorrow). Protagonist agency drives escalation; birds provide intel but he chooses action. Cost is unmistakable: decades of solitude, bodily decay (“wrinkled like ancient skin”), and emotional forfeiture (“no one remained who used [his name]”). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reuniting with Sera—is signaled early and deepens when the riddle reframes the search as a test of shared memory. Escalation is driven by Marta’s agency: she interprets the clue, runs, digs, and chooses to leave. Cost is felt in her aged body and abandoned retirement. The tightening (from passive waiting to active pursuit) forecloses her prior path with physical and emotional toll, all under a coherent Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—maintaining identity through ritual amid isolation—is signaled early and deepens when the ship appears, testing her commitment. The meaningful tightening occurs in her choice to finish the sketch before acknowledging rescue, foreclosing immediate reintegration.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—saving the master while reconciling with his thief identity—is signaled early and deepens when the letter reveals he was always the heir. Corwin’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to steal back the lid, then to listen to secrets, then to accept legacy. Cost is felt in his trembling hands and redefined identity. Sky-wrong isn’t coincidence—it’s a live clock forcing action.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—bearing witness against historical erasure—is signaled by line 3 and escalates when Vera shifts from walking others’ names to carving and placing pawns, culminating in spelling “remember” at departure. This deepening forecloses her crisis-actor livelihood (purgatory) with felt cost: she chooses undocumented labor over paid simulation. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; each pawn placed narrows her return to performative grief. Coincidence never resolves—agency drives every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming buried linguistic fluency as survival—is signaled early and deepens through Vera’s nightly failures and the feather breakthrough. Escalation is driven by her agency: tracing symbols onto her skin seeds irreversible change. Cost is unmistakable: remembering now carries emotional weight (“hurt”) rather than physical agony, a trade-off earned through persistent effort. Pressure tightens coherently under the Accumulative lens until the final utterance reshapes her relationship to the world.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—is signaled early and tightens when Marcus decodes the tapestry: each thread color deepens his understanding of cost (red for blood not spilled, black for what’s forgotten). The escalation is driven by his agency: winnowing truth from silence forces the climactic choice to release the knight. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the prince’s coup is backstory pressure, not deus ex machina. Final cost is felt: relinquishing the knight = relinquishing perpetual guilt, allowing time to resume.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving her mother’s full humanity against institutional erasure—is signaled by line 3 and tightens at dawn’s approach. Sera’s agency drives escalation: she recruits allies, develops a method, rehearses phrases. The cost is conceptual (risking ritual failure) and social (defying Elders), made legible when their commands dissolve into poetry. The “forged hush” and thinning mist create a live clock that intensifies pressure without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—conjuring meaning from oblivion—is signaled early and escalates via Vera’s narration, which narrows her emotional options until the final mark forces confrontation with unspeakable grief.

No off-stage resolutions; the workshop’s harmony is earned by her remembrance.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—keeping the promise to create until “colors run out”—is signaled early and deepens when the mirror cracks. The tightening occurs underground: painting the cave forces Edwin to confront what he’s avoided (his daughter’s absence), narrowing his emotional options. Agency drives escalation—he chooses to enter, to paint, to see—and the cost is felt in the ache of the faded shell and the irreversible shift in his artistic gaze. Coincidence (the wrong turn) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the real turn is internal and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—being heard when you speak softly—is signaled early and deepens through the boy’s arrival.

Mira’s agency drives escalation—she chooses to kneel, to offer her hand, to invite him into ritual. Cost is felt: she takes on the weight of a ghost-child’s grief, knowing his form is transient. The stakes remain viscerally intimate, never abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—navigating the geography of loss—is signaled by line two and escalates through Mira’s increasing investment in decoding the calls and building the array. The winter solstice revelation forces a decisive shift: she must guide not vessels but souls. Agency is clear: her construction choices respond to lunar constraints and cryptic data. Cost is felt in physical labor, emotional exposure, and the irreversible abandonment of conventional navigation—all converging in the final sweep of starlight.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—psychological safety through controlled truth—is signaled early and tightens when the relic arrives. Maren’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to test, then to act. The cost—risking execution to restore others’ autonomy—is unmistakable in “Tomorrow she would begin the dangerous work.” Pressure coheres under Causal lens; coincidence (the shipment) complicates but doesn’t resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—decoding a final gesture to honor unspoken love—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes the gaps are “offerings.” The meaningful tightening occurs when he counts backward to align skipped entries with full moons, narrowing his understanding from curiosity to sacred duty.

Cost is unmistakable: he trades solitary witness for active stewardship of another’s grief, crystallized in his resolve to find the waiting woman.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—understanding her father’s promise—is signaled early and deepens when the doorway reveals infinite lives, not answers. Eleanor’s agency drives every escalation: she deciphers the chip, follows ants, presses the mold. The creek’s rise creates a tightening that forces a decisive trade-off: fantasy or truth. Cost is unmistakable—the loss of alternate selves, the acceptance of solitude—and it charges the final image without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—unmasking her husband’s killer—is signaled early and deepens via the queen’s agency: she climbs, questions, and finally remembers.

Pressure remains coherent under a Causal lens, with no coincidental resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—measuring the weight of presence—is signaled early and deepens through Theo’s challenge (“You want to understand why we can’t stay”). The tightening occurs when Mira’s epiphany shifts her goal from containment to attention, foreclosing her old methodology. Cost is legible: she must leave, transform, and trust Theo with the shell. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency—her recalibration arises from dialogue and reflection, not coincidence—and the price (relational rupture, identity shift) charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes—narrative control over one’s own temporality—are signaled early and deepen when Vera finds her grave. Her agency drives escalation: reading older scrolls forces confrontation with lost clarity, culminating in the decision to climb the ridge. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits the illusion of linear selfhood, accepting her death date as a compass rather than a cage. Pressure tightens coherently under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—restoring dignity to what’s been abandoned—is signaled early and deepens when Elena recognizes the clamp’s corrosion as fossilized grief. The meaningful tightening occurs when she diagnoses improper cleaning: not mere rust, but a mother’s well-intentioned error that compounded loss. This revelation raises emotional cost, forcing Margaret to confront generational rupture. Elena’s agency drives escalation—her gentle work reconfigures the object’s meaning—and the final trade-off (story instead of money) crystallizes stakes without resolving them neatly, honoring the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—transforming fear-induced ice into useful knowledge—is signaled early and deepens when Mira chooses to inscribe runes onto her crystallizing skin rather than suppress it. This act of agency under pressure forecloses the path of shame or concealment, incurring the cost of permanent bodily alteration (the iridescent scar). The approaching storm provides external escalation, but the real tightening is internal: she risks desecrating ritual by using storm-tea as ink. Coincidence (three crows) complicates but doesn’t resolve; her choice does.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—redemption through completion—is signaled early and tightens when the orchard’s destruction clock forces immediacy. Marcus’s agency drives escalation: he chooses unorthodox tech over dogma, accepting risk of further failure. Cost is felt in his admission of past arrogance and the irreversible loss of Eleanor’s trees.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—unraveling cosmic illusions to unify fractured perception—is signaled early and deepens when the witness realizes unraveling is translation. The tightening occurs at the reading chamber: choosing “synthesis” over destruction forecloses archival passivity with conceptual cost (language returns to silence). Agency is maintained throughout; no coincidence resolves pressure. While escalation is strong, the cost—though legible—is more conceptual than visceral, slightly limiting emotional traction under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding what clocks truly measure—is signaled early and tightens relentlessly through Einar’s reverse counting, which narrows options until only transcendence remains. Agency is fully his: no coincidence resolves the mystery; his micro-choice to count backward drives escalation. Cost is legible in the final image: he forfeits earthly presence to join Magnusson outside time. The deepening—from shepherd to threshold-crosser—is earned through accumulated observation and courage.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding “physics of letting go”—tightens when Maya realizes permeability > rupture. Her agency drives escalation: using the laser to map barriers, then choosing to contact David’s partner. Cost is felt in hollow spaces of their relationship and the dog’s recognition. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves anything.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—resolving the father’s legacy without replicating his ruin—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Margot finds Seat 14’s GPS coordinates, narrowing her path from skepticism to active inheritance. Her agency drives escalation: choosing to ride the subway, choosing to retrieve the archive folder, choosing to pay the debt. The cost is unmistakable: she accepts lifelong entanglement with her father’s contradictions. Pressure remains coherent under an Accumulative lens, with each symbol and scent deepening the central dilemma rather than introducing new conflicts.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—transforming grief’s repetition into renewal—is signaled early and deepens through Vera’s agency: she doesn’t just receive calls; she redirects them (“Tell me about Danny”). The tightening occurs when she names the loop’s loosening (“This was the seventh call”), then catalyzes change by reframing endings as doors. Cost is unmistakable: the mother’s lost voicemail, Vera’s deliberate estrangement, and the elderly man’s incoming confusion—all foreclose easy resolution while charging the final image with purposeful burden.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving minor histories—is signaled early and deepens when the letters reveal the covenant’s near-collapse. Marguerite’s agency drives escalation: she interprets signs, offers the locket, and vows continuation. Cost is legible in the Keeper’s grief and her own haunted euphoria—the price of carrying memory when the world forgets. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each preserved scrap becomes a link in the chain that saves reality.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—escaping vs. embracing connection—tightens when Okonkwo reveals the reciprocity protocol’s human network, forcing Maya to confront her self-imposed isolation. Her agency drives escalation: tracking rumors, offering help. Cost is legible in her trembling voice (“words unfamiliar and terrifying”) and the fox’s return signaling companionship she’s avoided. Coincidence (pilot’s rumor) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the cure requires her active choice to stay.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—mapping the stillpoint to grant a dying woman choice—is signaled early and tightens when Meridia experiences neutrality herself. The deepening (realizing the stillpoint is a doorway, not a destination) forces a trade-off: peace vs. purpose. Agency drives escalation: her dowse, touch, and listening actively shape the path. Cost is unmistakable: she rejects equilibrium to preserve the “aching complexity” of feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—can Vera undo her catastrophic misinterpretation?—tightens when the anomaly delivers a pre-destruction query, forcing her to choose: send a correction or let genocide stand. Escalation is driven by her agency under Causal pressure; the anomaly complicates but doesn’t resolve. Cost is unmistakable: she risks further misinterpretation, yet acts anyway. The “confidently uncertain” precision of her transmission crystallizes stance with conceptual price—editing history demands humility and courage simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving the harbor’s intangible heritage—is signaled early and deepens when Elena reveals the council vote. The meaningful tightening occurs when Mira agrees to “show them” not through argument but through teaching Elena to “map silence,” transforming tactics under pressure. Cost is unmistakable: decades of mutual invisibility must be risked for uncertain influence. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency—Mira’s choice to engage, Elena’s choice to learn—and culminates in a stance crystallization that forecloses continued isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—rescuing a promise encoded in bloodline—is signaled early and deepens when Miriam realizes the archive isn’t knowledge but lineage. Escalation is driven by her agency: burning the library, descending alone, interpreting the trail. Cost is unmistakable: exile, maternal silence, paternal loss. The tightening occurs at the portrait—she sees herself as both target and heir, foreclosing escape. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from her choices under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—giving Elias’s dream material form—is signaled early and deepens through Mira’s drumming, which triggers the garden’s responsive symphony. Escalation is driven by her agency: each strike narrows the window for entanglement, culminating in Elias’s dissolution into the garden. The cost—permanent internal silence—is felt in “alone in her own skull” yet transformed by purpose. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: density of sound layers reweights stakes from personal grief to immortalized art.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recovering hidden knowledge—is signaled early and deepens when the key reveals a new route. Celia’s agency drives escalation: she decodes the key’s function and chooses to guide him. The storm raises stakes by disabling tools, but the real pressure is epistemic—can whispered knowledge survive? Cost is felt in the man’s emotional vulnerability and Celia’s breach of protocol, though the physical risk remains implied rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preventing another drowning through silent empathy—is signaled early and tightens when the boy appears “hunched against something heavier.” The guardian’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to weave light, transforming passive vigil into active intervention. Cost is unmistakable—she risks reopening her wound to reach him, yet gains only a wave, not salvation. The stillwater tension sharpens the moral calculus: intervene without words, or let darkness claim another.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—resisting dehumanizing education mandates—is signaled early and deepens through Eleanor’s tactical shift from individual mentorship to collective visual protest. The tightening occurs when she commits to the seventeen-window plan, foreclosing anonymity and safety. Cost is felt in the unspoken doubts of shop owners and her own burden of unsaid words. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, with each detail (photos, schedule) raising emotional and social risk.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—freedom through self-acceptance—is signaled early and tightens when Jonas warns of heartbreak, forcing Mira to weigh hope against loss. The Treaty’s rule (no violence) isn’t just backdrop; it removes the need for concealment, making her metamorphosis inevitable. Agency lies in her dive, not the whale’s call—the song is catalyst, not resolver. Cost is visible: shedding “shed scales” of old life, leaving Jonas raw but unbroken.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving private grief under a happiness mandate—is signaled early and escalates through Mira’s whittling, narration, and retention of forbidden relics. The drone’s overhead scan raises immediate pressure, yet her blank face and steady hands show agency through endurance. Cost is unmistakable: isolation, moral ambiguity, and the brittle fragility of memory. Her renunciation of public sorrow forecloses assimilation but affirms inner continuity—a credible, high-stakes trade-off earned by every prior choice.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether poetry can dissolve sacred boundaries—is signaled early and deepens when Mora’s paraphrasing shifts rebellion into invitation. Escalation is driven by her agency: reading aloud alters quartz pitch, which cracks the ice. Cost is unmistakable: seventeen years of doubt, exile’s loneliness, and the irreversible awakening of forces the Council sought to suppress. The final image shows boundaries yielding, not through luck, but through her sustained aesthetic commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—trading genuine loss for true sight—is signaled early and deepens when Theo demands “what do you offer of yourself?” Mira’s agency drives escalation: she presents not just the reed but a self-designed plant language of sacrifice. The tightening forecloses her old artistic identity (“everything I’ve painted has been wrong”) with felt cost (wilted offering, emotional upheaval). Coincidence never resolves; the phoenix’s aftermath sets context but doesn’t solve—Mira earns her sight through calibrated risk.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding the “texture of connection”—is signaled early and deepens through five stations, each narrowing Mira’s assumptions (presence → faith → ambient hum → silence). The escalation is driven by her agency: she chooses each recording, interprets each frequency, and revises her beliefs accordingly. The cost is legible: she relinquishes control, certainty, and the need for reciprocation. Though stakes remain internal, their transformation feels urgent and irreversible by the final bell strike.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—whether grief permits continued living—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s renunciation of mourning jewelry and tentative return to craft. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: each folded crane narrows her isolation, culminating in teaching others. The cost is unmistakable—the loss of her daughter, the abandonment of her former life—and shapes every tactic. Coincidence never resolves; healing emerges solely through deliberate, costly action.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—mapping cultural myths exposed by financial ruin—is signaled early and deepens when Marcus arrives, embodying the dataset Vera studies. The meaningful tightening occurs when Vera shifts from observer to confidante, revealing her project mid-reading, which narrows her ethical path and heightens risk. Cost is felt in Marcus’s vulnerability and Vera’s restraint; she refuses to offer false hope, preserving her integrity at the price of connection. Escalation stems from protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—accessing forbidden knowledge to reclaim lost love—is signaled by line 2 and deepens when Mira realizes purification requires chaos, not control. Her agency drives escalation: choosing pattern-avoidance over scholarly method narrows options and risks Netharan-style emptiness. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits innocence permanently, trading safety for transformative truth. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each sensory and conceptual layer intensifies the moral and existential risk.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving hope’s shape—is signaled early and deepens when Vera realizes preservation requires confronting loss, not just curating dreams. The tightening occurs when she chooses acknowledgment over containment, trading control for integration. Cost is visible: acceptance that Earth cannot return, yet memory must be woven into the new world. Agency drives escalation—her noticing leads to comparison, which leads to offering the stone—and the shadow’s response validates her choice without erasing loss.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming purpose after moral betrayal—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: Vera chooses to dismantle Marcus’s network *after* rebuilding the enclosure, showing escalation from internal reckoning to external action. Pressure tightens once: the realization about Meridian forces her to confront complicity, narrowing options to either abandon her work or redefine it on her own terms. Cost is unmistakable—the loss of innocence, the certainty that some creatures were sold—but it’s felt, not declared.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving her aberrant gift versus surgical erasure—is signaled by line 3 and escalates cleanly: failed surgery → imminent re-operation → urgent flight. Mira’s agency drives every turn; coincidence never resolves pressure (the approaching footsteps are threat, not rescue). The cost is visceral: she trades bodily safety for truth, and Thomas trades duty for kinship. Under the Hybrid lens, this deepening—“they’ll want to operate again… which is why I have to go now”—narrows options decisively and raises emotional stakes without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—finding where unused love is stored—is signaled early and deepens when Vera realizes the place isn’t for retrieval but release. The tightening occurs when she threads the film and accesses the psychic chamber: this isn’t just discovery but surrender. Agency drives escalation—her spatial imagination enables navigation of memory-architecture—and cost is felt in her tears and irreversible choice to leave. Coincidence never resolves; everything stems from her trained perception and inherited longing.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity—is signaled early and tightens when Elara discovers the instrument’s theft spans “a thousand years,” raising the cost of inaction. Her agency drives escalation: tracing stars isn’t passive observation but active redirection, culminating in the dial-turn that unleashes consequence. The deepening occurs when she hears the instrument’s whispered backstory, forcing a moral calculus between justice and mercy. Cost is unmistakable: the astronomer’s fear is absolved only through destruction of his life’s work, and Elara’s peace comes at the price of lifelong burden finally lifted.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving lost possibilities—tightens when Mira chooses to expend the dune’s energy, narrowing future options (dimmed flowers = depleted resource). Agency drives escalation: her “charm” action, rooted in backstory, creates the pocket dimension at personal/environmental cost. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each flower’s frequency adds density until the midnight strike collapses potential into action. Coincidence (child’s appearance) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Mira’s trained response earns the outcome. Cost is visible in the dune’s diminished glow.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—engaging the sixth sense versus numbing it—tightens when Mira chooses probable miracles over suppressants. The deepening occurs at the sequoia: healing it forces confrontation with her identity (“philosopher, not engineer”) and dissolves that boundary. Cost is visible in the sacrificed talisman and the ache of displacement. Escalation is driven by her agency under the Accumulative lens: attending to wind-music leads directly to the tree’s distress call.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming unused courage—is signaled early and escalates through Mira’s confrontation with unlived roads, each narrowing her emotional options until she must choose self-forgiveness or perpetual regret. The tightening occurs when she names herself a coward, only to have the guide reframe survival as its own form of endurance. Cost is unmistakable: she carries every deferred risk as literal warmth against her chest. Agency drives escalation—no coincidence resolves her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake (“cost of safety”) tightens relentlessly: village’s silenced past → bellhop’s dust plea → bolt’s revelation → final choice. Protagonist agency drives escalation—Mira interprets clues, kneels despite pain, grips bolt. Cost is visceral: storms may return, but silence’s spiritual death is already present. Coincidence absent; every pressure stems from fortress’s rules and characters’ defiance.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving dynastic truth—is signaled early and tightens when Mira chooses documentation over confrontation. Escalation is driven by her agency: each message leads to deeper investigation, culminating in the decision to release evidence. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: the “graceful collapse” requires relinquishing direct control, trusting mortal scholars to act. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from Mira’s choices under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—uncovering why paths disappear—tightens decisively when Marina overlays dumping sites with bleaching records, foreclosing her prior climate-only framework. Agency drives escalation: her slow journal reading, sample reanalysis, and final transmission are all active choices under mounting emotional and evidentiary pressure. Cost is felt in grief compounded by betrayal, and visible in the irreversible act of broadcasting coordinates. The fossil fuel ban timeframe creates live constraints—funding bursts, resurrected missions—that shape her endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—finding meaning amid collapse—is signaled early and deepens when the stones’ hum triggers visceral memories, forcing Maya to reinterpret failure as cyclical breath. Agency lies in her decision to carry this insight outward, narrowing her path from observer to messenger. Cost is felt in her relinquished solitude; the “terrible, waiting silence” becomes a burden she now shares. Escalation is driven by her sustained attention, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—saving Kaluuma’s true heritage from erasure—is signaled early and deepens when the vine reveals the embryo. Pressure escalates through Mira’s decoding labor, culminating in the high-stakes act of singing with her aged voice. The cost is felt: her son’s death, poisoned land, and years of isolation as “insurgent grandmother” foreclose easy solutions. Agency drives escalation—she interprets moss guidance, traces symbols, sings—and the reconstruction clock tightens tactics without resolving via luck. One tightening suffices, and it’s decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—surviving grief while nurturing fragile life—is signaled early and deepens when the hawk triggers freeze response, forcing Mariam to choose presence over panic. Her agency lies in somatic naming and returning to orchids, foreclosing escape but affirming endurance. The cost is felt in contracted diaphragm and hollow chest; the deepening shift occurs when she finds the “pearl of stillness” in Fatima’s earrings, reweighting memory from wound to anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—artistic integrity versus commercial coherence—is signaled early and deepens when the library walls close in, forcing Eleanor to confront fragmentation rather than flee it. The single meaningful tightening (walls constricting) narrows her options to surrender or reframe, and she chooses the latter with visible cost: she abandons the lie of unified portraiture. Escalation is driven entirely by protagonist agency—pulling the red thread, spreading her failures, redesigning—and the cost (loss of former artistic identity) is legible in every brushstroke of her new method.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding the ink’s time-warping mechanism—is signaled early and deepens when Seren witnesses faces in the fading stain. Her agency drives escalation: she interprets the pattern, recalls past crises, and commits to hunting the nomads. Cost is felt (lost brother, isolation) and shapes tactics (reliance on Needle, rejection of regret). One tightening occurs—the ink’s fade forces immediate action—but lacks a second pressure point for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. complicity—is signaled early and deepens when Vance appears, forcing Mira’s hand “within the blink.” The tightening forecloses delay: she must act now or lose access forever. Cost is unmistakable: risking her mother’s preservation and her own safety. Agency drives escalation—she repaired the network off-page, then chooses broadcast mid-confrontation. No coincidence resolves tension; Vance’s arrival complicates but doesn’t override her decisive act.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether continuity can be woven from chaos—is signaled early and deepened when the Sovereignty soldier arrives. Mira’s agency lies in renunciation: she chooses not to draw her knife, not to reject the enemy, thereby foreclosing vengeance as a path. The cost is implicit but felt: emotional labor, vulnerability, and the weight of being the sole keeper of this fragile peace. Escalation is driven by her steadfastness under pressure, not external plot mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—retrieving her daughter’s last words—is clear by line 3 and intensifies via the Unraveling’s narrow window. Maren’s agency drives escalation: she chooses silence, which *calls* the echo rather than demanding it. Cost is unmistakable: years of splintered not-knowing culminate in relief that “buckles” her knees yet frees her to “fish for stars.” The goddess doesn’t grant; Maren earns through embodied stillness, and the price—enduring silence—is paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether to reveal an imminent near-miss asteroid—is signaled early and tightens decisively when she confirms the date is tomorrow. Agency drives escalation: her choice to investigate, verify, and ultimately craft a mitigated narrative narrows options from three (publish/suppress/ignore) to one nuanced path. Cost is unmistakable: she inherits her father’s burden of protective deception, sacrificing truth for stability. The moral calculus—truth vs. peace—is sharpened by her dual identity as heiress and truth-seeker, making the trade-off viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—translating unspoken maternal love—is signaled early and deepens when Vera discovers the letters. The tightening occurs when she realizes the amber translates baby cries, forcing a choice: attempt impossible retroactive healing or accept silence. Her agency drives escalation (tattooing the letter-constellation), and cost is unmistakable: the dissonance quieting implies lifelong burden lifted. Coincidence (finding amber in desk) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from Vera’s ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—discovering meaning in the mess—is signaled early and deepens when the mandala reveals the hush as preparatory forgetting. Mira’s agency drives escalation: her interjection, her drawing, her placement of the tile. The cost is visible (tears, impermanence of art) and conceptual (civilization’s clutter stripped away). The old man’s fear crystallizes the moral tension: silence as surrender vs. silence as receptivity.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving tenderness against erasure—is signaled early and tightens when Kira accesses the fire-memory, narrowing her mission to one name. Escalation is driven by her agency: choosing to endure painful visions to extract Emre’s act of mercy. Cost is unmistakable: physical exhaustion, emotional exposure, and the risk of discovery. The regime’s off-stage presence applies coherent pressure without resolving conflict conveniently.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming despair into possibility—is signaled early and deepens through layered echoes. Pressure escalates via Madeline’s active weaving of timelines, narrowing the woman’s emotional options until she reinterprets the Crossroads coin. Cost is felt: Madeline’s endless labor, the woman’s relinquished grief. Agency drives escalation; coincidence plays no role. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (“illuminate hidden pathways”) tightens decisively when Maya discovers the company sells control, not telepathy—foreclosing trust in institutions and forcing solo pursuit. Protagonist agency drives escalation: somatic markers guide her to the panel; her choice to read, not flee, deepens knowledge. Cost is unmistakable—the flushed pills represent lost safety, and Daniel’s absence weighs on every tremor.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to forgotten transitions—tightens when the fossil pulses, forcing Vera from recorder to participant. Her agency drives escalation: she speaks, triggering the lights’ response. Cost is felt in her irreversible role shift and the weight of representing billions. Coincidence (finding the fossil) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from her deliberate offering and vocal translation.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—combating the forgetting through recovered memory—is signaled early and deepens via button cataloging, which transforms from task to revelation. Agency is clear: Marlowe’s methodical attention creates the constellation, unlocks the echo, and reinterprets the prophecy. Cost is felt in the isolation, the generational burden, and the irreversible shift from prevention to preparation. Escalation is driven by her choices under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether to fix what’s broken when the fixer is shattered—is signaled early and deepens via Viktor’s plea and dying condition. Escalation is driven by Margaret’s agency: decoding snow, preparing contingencies, choosing to enter despite risk. The tightening (“Watched. Come alone. Dawn”) forces renunciation of backup, raising cost. Final choice carries moral and physical stakes—carrying secrets that could reignite old wars—and forecloses the path of walking away, with felt weight in her pocket and stride.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recovering a buried truth—is clear early and deepens when the grandmother’s palimpsest promise is named. Pressure escalates texturally: fog thickens, water remains “hungry,” silence arrives only after patient waiting. The coachman’s restraint (never asking business) contrasts her confession, raising emotional stakes. Cost is felt: her sleepless exhaustion, his decades of solitary vigilance. Agency resides in attention and endurance, not action—but the story earns that choice under its Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—understanding why some places resist fracture—is signaled early and deepens when Serin discovers the disc doesn’t hold timelines but *chooses* them phototropically toward kindness. This escalation is driven by her agency: tracing sun paths, touching the disc, interpreting light through the glass. Cost is unmistakable: she must surrender her lifelong pursuit of centered stillness for dynamic, compassionate participation. The tightening forecloses her old path—clay no longer answers passively but “reaches,” demanding reciprocity.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—sustaining connection amid endings—is signaled early and deepens through Marina’s agency: she chooses to send light, not wait passively. The tightening occurs when she understands her grandfather’s metaphor and acts, narrowing options to small, persistent gestures. Cost is visible: emotional vulnerability in waving to a stranger, the risk of hope in a decaying world. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, culminating in a stance that forecloses despair.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—breaking the cycle of isolated preservation—is signaled early and deepens when Mira reinterprets Korvash’s “Time is not a cage” as permission to create, not endure. The meaningful tightening occurs when she places the sundial, foreclosing eternal waiting in favor of generative risk. Agency drives escalation: her choice activates the stone circle, birthing new life. Cost is felt in the irreversible loss of her old identity (“no longer a relic”) and the vulnerability of opening herself to connection after seven centuries of calcified solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming authentic connection through writing—is signaled early and deepens when Mira confronts her mechanical emptiness. The tightening occurs at the water’s edge: seeing others’ secrets dissolve forces her to choose between continued isolation or vulnerable self-expression. Agency drives escalation—she actively writes and releases her letter—and the cost (renouncing detached professionalism) charges the final image. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the installation merely offers possibility she seizes. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preventing cosmic manipulation through human discord—is signaled early and escalates via Mira’s agency: she doesn’t block but corrupts the signal. The tightening (Dean’s demolition order vs. 47-minute window) forces a trade-off: save the station or sabotage the broadcast. Cost is legible in her solitude and the community’s lingering fracture. Pressure coheres under Causal lens; coincidence (door bursting at 11:58) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the work is already done.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—unlocking ancestral truth—is signaled early and tightens at the organ sequence, which narrows options to one precise action. Helena’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to play, to crawl, to insert the key. Cost is unmistakable: emotional isolation, physical terror, and the irreversible weight of inheriting a consumed legacy. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from her decisions under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—giving Elena Voss posthumous visibility—is signaled early and tightens when Clara unifies “cruel smile” and “kind eyes” into Marcus’s face. The deepening is protagonist-driven: her methodical analysis forecloses legal justice but enables moral witness. Cost is felt in Clara’s renunciation of vengeance and acceptance of “justice… impossible.” Pressure remains coherent under an Accumulative lens, intensifying through density of perception rather than external threats.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—validating Elena’s overlooked warning—is signaled early and deepens when decoded stanzas align with station data. Mira’s agency drives escalation: she questions pressure readings, forces Torres’ reckoning. Cost is felt: the weight of generational silence, the dread of being ignored again. One meaningful tightening suffices—here, the shift from archival curiosity to global urgency—but the reversal’s scale slightly outpaces on-page tactical shifts (e.g., how exactly warnings will reach coasts).

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming abandoned possibility—is signaled early (“the thing you never became”) and tightens when the glass flake reveals the map, forcing a binary: return to the bridge or descend. The hitchhiker’s vanishing isn’t coincidence but catalyst; Margaret’s agency drives escalation (choosing to look through the flake, stepping off the pullout). Cost is legible: at 73, this path risks folly, yet her laugh carries “radical acceptance” of that risk. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each sensory detail (fluttering plastic, warm glass) deepens the weight of her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—freedom from paternal legacy—is signaled early and tightens through the startup’s rise/fall and the father’s reappearance. The meaningful deepening occurs when Elias realizes success was another form of running, and failure forces return. Agency is clear: he chooses stillness over flight in the end. Cost is felt in lost employees, reputation, and the irreversible weight of reconciliation attempted too late for redemption.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the shared burden of ancestral secrets—is signaled early and deepens via Mira’s realization that isolation kills. Escalation occurs through her agency: cross-referencing stars with temple photos, translating glyphs, choosing to write. The tightening forecloses Marcus’s path of silence, replacing it with communal witnessing. Cost is felt in exhaustion, tears, and the weight of memory, culminating in a stance crystallization that reconfigures suffering from private curse to collective inheritance.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming selfhood—is signaled early (“mirrors refused to reveal”) and tightens when Maren trades lifespan for the seed, narrowing options to one voracious path. Escalation is protagonist-driven: casting the seed, stepping on vines, pressing her palm to ice. Cost is unmistakable: three years of life forfeited, three years of defensive curvature released. The vortex’s scream tests her endurance, but resolution stems from her choice to speak, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—accessing the dream-intersection—is signaled early and tightens when the covenant breaks, making paths collide. Mira’s agency drives escalation: she calls the seven closer, reads their scars, and plants the clipping, which rebuilds the maze per their combined unconscious. Cost is unmistakable: her rootedness becomes permanent anchoring duty (“Someone had to hold the door steady”). The deepening—collective dream-landscape now reachable by earthbound—narrows options to “together or not at all,” crystallizing stance under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming a bartered destiny—is signaled early and tightens when the Gardener reframes repayment as sacrifice of certainty, not return of an object. Mira’s agency drives escalation: she doesn’t plead but asserts (“I accept”), forcing the Gardener’s hand. Cost is unmistakable: forty years of unknowing, a hole replaced by another kind of void. Pressure coheres under causal lens—each revelation narrows options until only one painful trade remains.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—recovering worth after public failure—is signaled early and deepens when Val reveals her father’s parallel story. Marcus’s agency drives escalation: his insight about resonance patterns shifts Val’s stance, enabling the invitation to the quarry floor. The cost is felt in his relinquished grip and exposed vulnerability (“Yes” to being “that guy”). Coincidence (shared history of music loss) complicates but doesn’t resolve; pressure tightens through dialogue and object exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding transition’s physics—is signaled early and tightens when the tablet reveals death as polarity reversal. Elena’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to plant the seed, reestablishing practice at personal cost (exile from earth). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each detail (Vasil’s warning, caretaker’s gift) deepens the conceptual price. Coincidence never resolves; Vasil’s legacy complicates but doesn’t solve.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving meaning in a world without tomorrow—is signaled early and deepens when the fisherman challenges Mira’s purpose (“Why do you keep doing this?”). Her response crystallizes agency: routine sustains survival, but wonder justifies it. This isn’t passive endurance; it’s active renunciation of resolution in favor of holding multiplicity. Cost is legible: she accepts perpetual ambiguity, sacrificing narrative closure for ethical fidelity to fragmented lives. Escalation occurs via protagonist-driven reflection that narrows her options to one resonant stance.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming lost emotional connection—is signaled early via the expired provisions and “monuments to fear.” Pressure escalates through accumulation: each shell tightens the thematic coil until Elena’s own confession becomes inevitable. Her agency drives the turn; Marcus’s reply isn’t coincidence but reciprocal vulnerability. Cost is felt: she risks rejection by sending the shell image. Minor deduction: stakes remain internal without external complication, but this fits the Accumulative lens and length.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness through river-guided truth—is signaled early and deepens when graffiti redirects Maren to the black stones. Agency is clear: she chooses to interpret, to return, to write. The meaningful tightening occurs when she realizes the river’s “riddles” cannot absolve her; only her own charting can. Cost is felt: enduring raw guilt without medication’s buffer. Coincidence doesn’t resolve—her brother’s fate stems from her prior causal error.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—accessing her mother’s unsaid love—is signaled early and tightens through the watch’s mechanics and cipher logic. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: she deciphers the watch, locates the crimson shelf, reads the confession, then chooses to open her own book. Cost is unmistakable: seventeen years of waiting, stolen trust, and the pain of delayed forgiveness crystallize in “I forgive myself for taking so long.” Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens—density of withheld emotion intensifies until release becomes inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—weighing cultural preservation against imperial violence—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Mira chooses propagation over compliance. The escalation is driven by her agency: reading stains, consulting ferns, playing the violin once. Cost is unmistakable: she becomes forsworn, loses the violin forever, and invites war—but secures the song’s immortality. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; each deepening (memory, prophecy, music) reweights the moral calculus without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—capturing her mother’s last spark before oblivion—is signaled early and intensifies via time pressure (“perhaps minutes before oblivion”). The tightening occurs when static reveals her mother’s heartbeat rhythm, forcing Mira’s decisive action. Agency is clear: she chooses to infuse the chip, risking failure or loss. Cost is felt—she accepts that this is the final contact, and the act transforms her future work. Escalation is driven by her trained perception, not coincidence, under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—finding the source of contentment to ease others’ passage—is signaled early and deepens through Theron’s scallop memory, which catalyzes Mira’s realization. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: her ritual act (giving the pin) enables Theron’s peaceful transition, which in turn clarifies her own understanding. Cost is unmistakable: she accepts her mother’s absence not as abandonment but as necessary release, closing the path to resentment. Under the Accumulative lens, this single deepening suffices, with emotional price legible in the amber-to-purple dusk cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether to keep searching—is signaled early and tightened when the keeper names Sera’s true desire: “permission to stop.” Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: Sera’s unwrapping the shard triggers the keeper’s diagnosis, which forces Sera’s renunciation. Cost is unmistakable: relief creeps in “like tide through sand,” yet burden remains. The moral calculus—abandonment vs. accepting another’s choice—sharpens the peak decision without false balance.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—making the erased visible—is signaled by line 10 and tightens decisively when Vara grasps that “vanishing was not subtraction. It was collision.” This deepening, driven by her agency in trance, narrows her options to one: throw the second stone. The cost is legible: Elowen’s irreversible regression and the burden of sole responsibility. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens—each ring, each whisper, each backward year intensifies the moral and metaphysical weight.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—transmitting hard-won stillness as wisdom—is signaled early and tightens when the “wandering pulse” appears. Vessa’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to hum, reads birds, issues the climb-and-stop command. Cost is felt in her irreversible embodiment of dust and silence, and the traveler’s arrival forces a trade-off between eternal solitude and fragile succession. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving unmanufacturable meaning—is signaled early and deepens when Mara confronts the keystone. The tightening occurs at the climax: choosing witness over extraction, which narrows options permanently (she descends empty-handed). Cost is unmistakable: social irrelevance in a world that “had forgotten why magic mattered.” Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens—each chamber and memory intensifies her commitment to simplicity.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—accessing Elena’s hidden truth—tightens when the key unlocks the journal’s compartment, narrowing options to witness or destroy the vial. Protagonist agency drives escalation: his choice to uncork it transforms passive search into irreversible perception. Cost is unmistakable: he gains unbearable clarity (“every lie painted in muddy brown”) but loses innocence, returning to a world he now sees differently. The sky lantern festival clocks pressure, making his absence a felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—aligning consciousness with cosmic contraction—is signaled early and deepens through Mira’s repeated coin casts and static interpretation. Agency is expressed through attention and ritual; each re-cast narrows epistemic uncertainty until the final impossible alignment (coins on edge). Cost is conceptual but legible: surrendering individual memory to universal reintegration. Pressure escalates via density (static resolving into message) rather than external threat, fitting the Accumulative lens perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—transforming nameless fear into named sorrow—is signaled early and deepens when Mira realizes Elias “gave form to formless terror.” Her agency drives escalation: choosing to speak incomplete phrases, then completing them, which directly triggers crystallization. Cost is unmistakable: enduring love’s permanence (“could not undo the love that had broken her”) while accepting her new duty. Pressure tightens once, decisively, via her vocal act.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (restoring cosmic flow) tightens when Corin abandons magical force for patient mathematics—a deepening that narrows tactics to drip-based repair. Agency drives escalation: his third attempt succeeds because he adapts to silence’s viscosity, not luck. Cost is unmistakable: “seventeen years of accumulated quiet” and brittle devotion that nearly shatters. Coincidence complicates (fisherman’s ignorance) but doesn’t resolve; the drip is earned through protagonist insight.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—controlling the narrative of submersion vs. revelation—tightens decisively when the Chicago photograph invalidates Martha’s constructed truth. Agency is clear: she chooses exposure over protection, accepting communal reckoning over private myth. The escalation is driven by her active pursuit of photographs, culminating in a trade-off: losing the heroic father but gaining authenticity. Cost is felt in the collapse of a 37-year coping mechanism, rendered palpable in her laughter-turned-tears on the boulder.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—harmonizing logic and intuition—is signaled early and deepens via Elara’s ritual use of the orchard and crystal. The tightening occurs when she flames the crystal: a point of no return that fuses mind and heart permanently or annihilates her. Cost is legible in the empty chain and transformed selfhood. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens—density of wonder increases until it overflows into being.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving trust through honest uncertainty—is signaled early and tightens when Ash demands absolute answers. Vera’s agency drives escalation: she revises assessments, recommends partial evacuation despite knowing it causes panic. Cost is unmistakable: social friction, inherited trauma, and the ever-present risk of failure. Pressure coheres under the Situational lens—external demand vs. internal integrity—with one meaningful deepening that narrows options to truth or falsehood.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—custody of the clone-brain—is signaled immediately and deepens when Kira reframes it as ethical responsibility rather than ownership. Escalation is driven by Kira’s agency under Situational pressure: her diagnosis forces Vex and Sera to confront their shared motive (defeating numbness), narrowing options from destruction/multiplication to co-training. Cost is unmistakable: both women surrender control over their “third iteration” and expose raw vulnerability (“mask of confidence cracked,” “eyes glistened”). The historical revisions sweeping the void heighten urgency without resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (safeguarding innovation) tightens meaningfully when Vera conceives “The Corpse Flower” room—a direct counter to Magnus’s metrics. Agency drives escalation: her choice to build redefines victory as surrender, not conquest. Cost is felt (“Magnus would hate it”) but remains conceptual; no tangible loss (e.g., resources, reputation) is dramatized pre-closure. Coincidence (mystery seed) complicates but doesn’t resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—releasing calcified grief to reclaim connection—is signaled early and deepens through Victor’s escalating vocal risk. Agency drives escalation: each song fractures further, narrowing options until only wordless humming remains. Cost is unmistakable: tears salt the sound, laughter’s absence is palpable, and the hourglass’s emptied weight forecloses passive mourning. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—surviving dimensional exile without succumbing to madness—is signaled early and tightens when the weeping woman arrives. Maren’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to reveal herself, speak, offer companionship. Cost is unmistakable: “I want to remember what it feels like to not wait alone” admits vulnerability after years of armored stillness. Coincidence (the woman’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Maren’s stance crystallizes under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—interrupting the Vermillion Succession—is signaled early and deepens through Maren’s successive approximations, each narrowing options. Agency is clear: she chooses creative destruction over passive despair, paying the price of potential death. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under a Causal lens, with cost unmistakable (“poured her remaining life-essence”). The tightening at twilight—a threshold moment—forecloses the empire’s immutable destiny with irreversible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—decoding cosmic silence—is signaled early and deepens when Mira realizes human engineering assumptions block reception. Her agency drives escalation: discarding filters, reversing amps, rejecting “words” as necessary for communication. Cost is legible: her recordings capture “only shadows,” implying lifelong limitation despite breakthrough. Lunar perigee acts as a live clock that narrows her window, making failure plausible until the final hum.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—freeing trapped souls—is signaled early and deepens when Mara realizes she can merge timelines. Escalation is driven by her agency: interpreting phosphorescent patterns, using the hourglass, speaking to the radio. Cost is unmistakable: her self-splitting pain and permanent solitude after successful arrival. The tightening forecloses the path of passive acceptance; she chooses intervention despite knowing “This might not work.”

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—negotiating with space instead of controlling it—is signaled early and tightens when mirrors reveal the thread’s web, forcing Marina to gather it against the gallery’s resistance. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her choice to weave patterns creates the “stable geometry” that settles the building. Cost is visceral: “tension... strain of material pulled between fixed points” makes the price of connection physically legible. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens without coincidental resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—learning to navigate by starlight—is signaled early and deepens into a metaphysical shift in orientation. The tightening occurs when Vara chooses to “watch the edges,” foreclosing her old instrumental reliance. Cost is unmistakable: she must unlearn decades of expertise, symbolized by discarding the chain link. Escalation is driven by her agency under Accumulative pressure, not coincidence, and the stakes evolve from technical skill to cosmic belonging.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—resolving severed emotional threads—is signaled early and tightens when Margaret’s confession alters Ruth’s pulse, narrowing options to verbal absolution. Escalation is driven by Vera’s agency: placing the hearing aid, kneeling, translating. Cost is unmistakable: Margaret’s lifelong insomnia ends only after confronting jealousy and fear. The “thin space between” worlds becomes a crucible where coincidence (the call) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the sisters’ reconciliation hinges on Margaret’s choice to speak.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—bearing witness to the unremembered—is signaled early and tightens via the tidal window (“two hours before currents shifted”), forcing urgency without contrivance. Mira’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to descend despite fear, document despite pressure, and return despite exhaustion. Cost is felt physically (burning muscles) and existentially (carrying seven names forever). The phase-transition motif subtly reframes water not as obstacle but as medium of memory, deepening stakes without resolving them mechanically.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming identity from bureaucratic erasure—is signaled early and tightens when Mira realizes wisdom lives in wreckage. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses to engage the ink, focus on failures, and dissolve her digital ghost. Cost is unmistakable: she endures archived griefs flowing back, feeling “heavier,” yet gains wholeness no death certificate can restore. Coincidence never resolves; all turns stem from her decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—saving a language from extinction—tightens when she realizes adopted tongue can’t replicate bone-tower-dependent phonemes. Agency drives escalation: she *chooses* to weaponize the diamond’s curse against itself, using copper veins to repurpose silencing into avian translation. Cost is visceral: diamond cracks with each word, shattering completely—a physical manifestation of sacrificed safety for linguistic rebirth. Birds’ flight paths narrow options; only their algorithmic formations unlock phonemes, forcing her to speak through them.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—validating the unseen—is signaled early and deepens when Maren realizes Samuel *became* the phenomenon. Her agency crystallizes in choosing wonder over bitterness, foreclosing the path of vengeful vindication. Escalation is driven by her interpretation of the phone’s static and floating objects, not coincidence. Cost is felt in her acknowledgment of continued isolation and scoffing colleagues, yet she endures—a Charged Poise under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—freedom of unsanctioned sound—is signaled early and deepens via Mira’s heartbeat code, which narrows options from evasion to collective uprising. Escalation is driven entirely by protagonist agency: her choice to swell into “genuine feeling” triggers the statue’s confusion and orchard-wide resonance. Cost is unmistakable—the risk of recalibration becomes the shattering of an entire system—and the “uproot” signal crystallizes stakes into irreversible action. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—delivering compressed grief across an uncrossable border—is signaled early and deepens when intercepted letters surface. Marcus’s agency shines in his method (linking absences) and renunciation (not asking how she crossed). The tightening occurs when the daughter appears: now he must trust her to carry both storm and letters back, foreclosing his role. Cost is legible: he remains alone among silent machines, still waiting for his own promise to resolve. Escalation is driven by his choices, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming voice through beauty—is signaled early and tightens when Marcus chooses to sing despite damaged cords, narrowing options from passive wandering to active creation. Agency drives escalation: his decision to wind the phonograph triggers the climax, and the cost is legible in “notes emerged broken, rough as unfinished wood.” Coincidence (finding the train) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from his “quietly persistent” push against silence. The wind bells’ temporal pocket heightens pressure by suspending ordinary time, making the attempt feel fated yet fragile.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—finding where stories live—tightens when geometry shifts, forcing Eleanor to act on instinct rather than logic. Escalation is driven by her agency: she walks aisles, triggering the reawakening. Cost is felt in her irreversible understanding of solitude, though a second tightening (e.g., sacrificing something tangible) would push this higher. Coincidence (patrons’ presence) complicates but doesn’t resolve; their solitudes mirror the library’s layered reality.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving a vanishing maternal memory—is signaled early and tightens when the dream erodes faster than Miriam can record it (“Some mornings Miriam could no longer remember…”). The meaningful deepening occurs at the fog-bound climax: desperation forces one last attempt, narrowing options to a single fragile hope. Agency drives escalation—Miriam’s choice to climb despite despair yields the breakthrough. Cost is unmistakable: even after success, her mother “remains distant, remains gone”; the victory is partial, preserving absence rather than restoring presence.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—freeing Elena’s voice from cosmic fear—is signaled early and tightens when Mira realizes extraction would be catastrophic; she must rewrite the lock itself. This deepening forces a trade-off: preserve the truth but reshape its container, accepting irreversible cosmic consequence. Agency drives escalation: her focus on the ribbon defeats disorientation, and her hands “pick” universal tumblers. Cost is unmistakable in the silvered hair and stellar reweaving.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—recovering stolen memories—is signaled early and tightens when Elara stops mid-lecture, proving her knowledge is hollow. The deepening occurs when she connects greenhouse cracks to star charts, narrowing options to ritual action. Her agency drives escalation: curiosity compels her to lift the mushroom, triggering memory return. Cost is felt in decades of loss and the weight of renewed responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether to reverse exile—is signaled early and deepens via tea-leaf analysis, which narrows Mira’s uncertainty into actionable insight (“His war is with himself now”). The meaningful tightening occurs when she rejects symbolic reformation for “armor,” foreclosing public redemption in favor of private resilience. Cost is unmistakable: she stakes her credibility (“Conditional mentorship under Archivist Mira Voss”) and reopens her own wound (“someone gave you the same chance”). Escalation is driven entirely by her agency under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder against collective amnesia—is signaled early and tightens when colors fade, forcing Marek’s pivotal choice: sacrifice his hoarded hope (the seed) to feed the garden. Escalation is protagonist-driven: his daily essence-gathering narrows options (he cannot flee; must endure depletion). Cost is felt in his aged body (“truly old”) yet offset by the sapling’s birth—a trade-off where personal mortality fuels communal renewal. Coincidence never resolves; war’s aftermath merely sets conditions, not solutions.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—releasing silenced truths—is signaled early and deepens through each knot, narrowing Mira’s path from passive accumulation to active unraveling. Her agency drives escalation: choosing to exhume, then confess her own failure, catalyzes Callum’s release. Cost is unmistakable: she trades her hoarded silence for ghosts’ burdens, and her restored steadiness comes only after surrendering the illusion of wholeness. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from her needle-work.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—interpreting silence with empathy versus institutional preservation mandates—is signaled early and tightens when Elena sees the henge stones’ newly expressive faces. Her agency drives escalation: reopening the site, comparing footage, choosing words carefully. Cost is legible in her isolation and the heritage council’s prior reluctance. Under Accumulative lens, pressure builds via accumulating visual evidence, not coincidence, culminating in a stance crystallization that forecloses bureaucratic neutrality.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding “the physics of letting go”—is signaled early and deepens when Eleanor reads the captain’s log, which reframes surrender as active force. Pressure tightens via discovery: the snow globe and final pages narrow her emotional options, forcing a reconfiguration of grief. Agency is internal but decisive; her choice to carry artifacts upward embodies transformation, not rescue. Cost is felt in every loss recalled and in the quiet relinquishment of holding the dead in place.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—articulating the inarticulable—is signaled early and tightens when Mira realizes the ghost’s murals encode unspoken needs. Her agency drives escalation: she climbs rope ladders, photographs walls, decodes color sequences. The cost is legible: she accepts a life of unsung labor, painting messages only future “driftingly alert” souls may find. Coincidence (static, coordinates) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution comes through her deliberate song, which reconfigures silence into legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—releasing buried joy—is signaled early and tightens with each floor. Agency is clear: Mira chooses to ascend, decode, and ultimately release. Cost is felt in Lady Vesper’s tears and Mira’s burden of inherited grief. Escalation is driven by protagonist action under an Accumulative lens, though the pressure rise between floors 6–9 leans slightly on repetition rather than deepening tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—proving the sky remembers—is signaled early and deepens through Elena’s cloud taxonomy, which transforms from grief into purpose. Agency lies in attention and naming, which foreclose reintegration into mainstream meteorology (satellites “cold and efficient, unable to feel”). The tightening occurs when she accepts drifting as completeness, not loss. Cost is felt in severed ties, obsolete expertise, and the quiet burden of sole witness—visible in her notebook entries and final poise.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving hidden knowledge before erasure—is signaled early and intensifies as Elara deciphers the coin. Her agency drives escalation: touch reveals map, map leads to safe, safe yields theorem, theorem inspires new art. The cost is legible: the library will be destroyed regardless, but its truth survives only because she acts. The tightening occurs when she chooses to draw the library’s essence, not a human face—a renunciation that forecloses conventional portraiture but affirms her unique sight.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—charting the unknown—is signaled early and deepens when Elara deciphers the hopscotch cipher. Agency is clear: her note-taking and pattern recognition narrow options until the Luminance appears directly below. Cost is felt in three weeks of solitude, yet she chooses documentation over despair. Coincidence (starlings forming a hand) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the climax is earned through her diligence.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—learning the “rhythm of repair”—is signaled early and deepens when Mira confronts the mirrors’ broken moments. The tightening occurs at the vial: three futures shown, one path chosen, with irreversible cost (sound released, mystery engaged). Agency drives escalation—Mira’s choice, not coincidence, shatters frost and reassembles time. Final tick of the clock tower proves stakes were material, not abstract. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure intensifies via sensory and symbolic density until the harmonic climax reweights “repair” as transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—sustaining communal hope—is signaled early and deepens when the ghost’s message reveals fragility in both grove and education. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she acts on the message, mobilizing Marcus and Sola, turning guidance into collective labor. Cost is felt in the ghost’s enduring solitude despite connection, crystallized in his refusal to join them. Pressure tightens not through conflict but through the quiet urgency of maintenance.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—softening rather than preventing apocalypse—is signaled early and deepens when Mira discovers resonance can carry sound. Her agency drives escalation: decades of study culminate in precise calibration that opens time-channels. Cost is unmistakable: lifelong solitude, maternal grief, physical collapse to knees. The tightening occurs when she chooses lullaby over last-ditch adjustment, trading world-saving for child-soothing—a morally complex renunciation that reweights all prior effort.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—guiding lost travelers before frost kills them—is signaled early and tightens via the ticking clock of nightfall. Maren’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to use the nut despite uncertainty, altering bird behavior through ancestral knowledge. Cost is felt in her resignation (“She’d never wanted to be its caretaker”) and the physical peril of icy cliffs. Coincidence (travelers arriving) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from her deliberate reassembly of broken systems.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—translating separation into connection—is signaled early and deepens when Mira shifts from permanent adhesives to dissolvable scaffolds. Agency drives escalation: her insight at the ravine leads to lab decisions that foreclose her old methodology. Cost is felt in her redefined life’s work and softened grief. Coincidence never resolves; healing emerges from sustained attention.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—Vera’s yearning to touch originality after a life of forgery—is signaled early and deepened when the child arrives with missing pages, mirroring her own fractured past.

The cost is legible in her bracelet’s arithmetic and the silent terror of possibility she once wore. This single, resonant tightening reweights her entire existence without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—relief from contagious remorse—is signaled early and tightens when Elara discovers the pavilion demands total surrender, forcing her to surgically excise only the useless guilt. This deepening is driven by her agency under an Accumulative lens: she reads the water, descends, tests the coral, and makes a precise emotional triage. Cost is legible: she keeps the lessons of pain, which enables her to cook without trembling. No coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming industrial isolation into acoustic community—is signaled early and deepens through language layering, each utterance narrowing Elena’s emotional reserve while expanding sonic reach. Agency is clear: her choices (Polish → Spanish → Hebrew) drive escalation, not coincidence. Cost is visible in her tears and implied in societal indifference, though the absence of a concrete setback (e.g., equipment failure, interruption) slightly softens the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—becoming the archeologist of abandoned dreams—is signaled early and deepens when Vera shifts from passive receiver to active excavator. The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses to modify herself via synaptic modulator, foreclosing a path of isolated identity with felt cost (entanglement beyond distinction). Escalation is driven by her agency under an Accumulative lens: each memory fragment narrows her autonomy while expanding her purpose. Coincidence (global reality shifts) complicates but doesn’t resolve—she engineers her own transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—accessing dangerous knowledge responsibly—is signaled early and tightens when gravity inversion forces a time-bound, perceptual gamble. Escalation is driven by Elara’s agency: her decision to wait at the chamber’s center leverages her “prism-minded” gift under threshold effects. Cost is unmistakable: she inherits lifelong guardianship (“burden forward”), and the latent blaze becomes active duty. The 17-minute clock narrows options, making every beat urgent without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming music in a silent world—tightens decisively when Maren abandons air-conducted sound for bone-conducted vibration, foreclosing her old identity as tree-song sculptor. Agency drives escalation: her analysis of stress cracks (not luck) enables the new instrument. Cost is unmistakable: she trades communal auditory art for solitary, tactile communion, yet expands connection through earth-conduction (“teach others to listen with their hands”). Coincidence never resolves; the hedgehog’s return merely confirms her method’s validity.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving forbidden chess wisdom—is signaled early and deepens when Helena realizes the covenant was eclipsed by forgetting, not betrayal. Her agency drives escalation: correlating maps, listening to silence, writing through the night. The cost is felt in her exile and crystallized in the moonrise moment: she gains understanding but must walk back alone, carrying fragile hope. Pressure tightens via internal revelation, not coincidence, under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—accessing Margot’s truth—is signaled early and deepens when Vera realizes empathy requires surrender, not recovery. The tightening occurs when she chooses vocal forgiveness over mechanical force, narrowing her path from seeker to acceptor. Cost is visible: she forfeits the diary’s content forever, yet gains grace. Agency drives escalation—her tuning-fork ritual is active, not passive—and the fireworks’ approach adds external pressure that sharpens internal choice. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the clasp yields only after her earned emotional alignment.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—attaining wisdom through confronting repulsion—is signaled early and deepens when Mira realizes death feeds life. The tightening occurs during her two-night vigil: enduring the stench becomes the price that transforms her understanding. Agency is clear (she chooses to stay, to breathe, to leave), though escalation leans more on accumulation than causal narrowing. Cost is felt but not sharply visible beyond emotional transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes tighten decisively when Maren realizes the source can’t be taken—only emulated. The dominant stake (saving her orchards) is signaled early and deepened by the discovery that resilience requires participation, not plunder. Agency is clear: her choice to plant a seed forecloses extraction but opens regeneration. The countdown clock (five minutes → inversion) creates real pressure, and the cost—accepting indirect salvation—is felt in her suspended stillness amid golden light.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preventing the next death through foresight—is signaled early and deepens via Mira’s repeated, futile appeals to management. The tightening occurs when her anemometer confirms the lethal wind acceleration at Vasquez’s death site, transforming suspicion into evidence. Agency is expressed through attention and documentation, not confrontation; her renunciation of easy answers carries cost in professional marginalization. Pressure escalates texturally, not causally, consistent with the Accumulative lens, and culminates in a stance that forecloses compliance.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—wonder vs. utility—is signaled early via the Council’s ban and deepens when Meren realizes silence alone stagnates. Her agency drives escalation: she reads auroras, conducts light, and rings the bell, narrowing options from preservation to activation. Cost is felt in the amber sheet’s disintegration and irreversible awakening of global song. Coincidence (aurora’s presence) complicates but doesn’t resolve; her skill makes success possible.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding the veil’s collapse to prevent recurrence—is signaled by line 3 and deepens when Mira violates her oath. The tightening occurs at the altar: un-casing the flute forecloses obedience, forcing her to bear the cost of knowledge alone. Escalation is protagonist-driven (she chooses the melody) under Accumulative pressure—each note intensifies perceptual fracture until insight burns “into her understanding.” Coincidence never resolves; the flaw is revealed through earned, sideways vision.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—completing her “great work” before cosmic simplification—tightens when the halo fragment pulses brighter, triggering transposed empathy and new equations. This deepening forces Mira to abandon her lifelong formulaic approach mid-press, risking failure for untested harmony. The cost is legible: another star vanishes unnoticed as she embraces uncertainty. Agency drives escalation—she chooses ambiguity again, now with transformed understanding—and the universe’s entropy raises stakes without resolving them.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—whether relics remain inert objects or become living myths—is signaled early and tightens through Maren’s deliberate choice to extend encounters, sacrificing efficiency for resonance. Each monastery stop deepens pressure: time lost, routine abandoned, identity unraveled. The escalation is driven by her agency under an Accumulative lens; cost is felt in her trembling hands and the weight of Hallen’s absence. Final stakes crystallize at the Temple of the Long Dawn, where delivery becomes consecration—a trade-off between speed and sacredness that reweights her entire life.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—proving objects absorb emotions—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes validation isn’t for others but for herself. The meaningful tightening occurs when she accepts irreproducible, singular truths, foreclosing her original goal of scientific proof. Agency is maintained through her choice to commune via patterns rather than words. Cost is felt in the melting frost (lost data) and her quiet surrender to a mode of knowing science rejects—though slightly less visceral than ideal for a 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—delivering a love message across time—is signaled early and deepens when Mei realizes she must become the thread. The tightening occurs at the frame’s activation: options narrow to sacrifice or failure. Agency is clear; Mei chooses humming, placing the bead, speaking the words. Cost is unmistakable—her physical unraveling—and escalates pressure under an Accumulative lens: each collected puzzle edge, each year of searching, culminates in this irreversible offering.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—coaxing resilience from rubble—is signaled early and deepens when the crystalline woman reframes it as generational labor, not magical cure. Escalation is driven by Oren’s agency: he chooses descent, offers silk, accepts arduous knowledge. Cost is unmistakable: “It would take years. It would take everything.” The tightening forecloses easy solutions, forcing trade-offs between speed and sustainability under a Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding her mother’s disappearance and the shard’s purpose—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Mira witnesses the past argument, foreclosing ignorance as an option. Escalation is driven by Mira’s agency: she chooses to map, to follow the thread, to witness. The cost—accepting her mother’s death and inheriting a lethal mission—is unmistakable in the closing lines. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with each sensory layer deepening the emotional and conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving intangible safety—is signaled early and deepens when Maren realizes the chain’s purpose. Escalation is driven by her agency: climbing, interpreting stones, reading letters, writing her own. Cost is unmistakable: she trades anonymity for legacy, silence for voice. The “protect what remains” imperative forecloses passive courier role, forcing active guardianship under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—maintaining the ancient compact between humanity and sky—is signaled early and tightens when she aligns the wick, knowing storms will adjust paths based on her uncontrolled prophecies. Escalation occurs through Accumulative pressure: each prophetic line (“a child will be born…”) raises the emotional and cosmic stakes without altering her tactics, which remain ritualistic. Cost is felt in her solitude versus the world’s digital confidence, though the lack of a tangible trade-off (e.g., physical sacrifice) slightly limits escalation depth. Luck doesn’t resolve anything; storms co-conspire because she speaks their language faithfully.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding why Mei-Lin magnetized stories—is signaled early and deepens when Senna realizes she’s inherited that capacity. The tightening occurs when light reaches her hands and forces involuntary confession, narrowing her options from observer to participant. Agency is subtle but present: her choice to stay accepts the cost of ongoing vulnerability. Coincidence (the wing’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from her stance shift.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding the trees’ witnessed grief—is signaled early and deepens when the sextant heals. Maren’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to disassemble and reconfigure the instrument, narrowing options to dream-mapping. Cost is unmistakable: she accepts permanent custody of collective sorrow. The storm’s hush at climax isn’t coincidence—it’s environmental pressure crystallizing her stance under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—rekindling woven dawns—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency: Elara’s singing triggers window resonance, her swaddling births light-threads. Pressure tightens as darkness “presses harder,” forcing higher-stakes action. Cost is unmistakable: loss of self-memory for communal restoration. Escalation follows Accumulative lens—density of songs/memories reweights stake without causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether Miriam’s retreat constitutes failure or purpose—is signaled early and deepens when the librarian reframes her life as “watching.” The tightening occurs at the book’s revelation: her method of “staying while leaving” is validated as meaningful. Agency is internal but potent; her micro-choice to place the invitation inside the book signifies acceptance. Cost is felt: she relinquishes the narrative of pure penance, embracing a more complex truth that carries both relief and enduring sorrow.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—resisting cultural amnesia—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency: Mei doesn’t just recall, she plants. The deepening occurs when she shifts from rage to “heuristically gentle” action, narrowing options to quiet cultivation. Cost is unmistakable: isolation (sister’s concern), emotional labor (“years of rage”), and uncertainty (“wheat would grow or it would not”). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; coincidence never resolves—only her choices do.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving meaning against oblivion—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes she can’t save everything. Her agency drives escalation: she measures vows, makes micro-choices, and ultimately selects one. Cost is unmistakable: entire archive collapses; she walks away with only one captured promise. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each sampled vow increases emotional density until the child’s vow triggers decisive action. Coincidence never resolves; all turns stem from her meticulous labor under deadline.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving the “truce of hush”—is signaled early and tightens when Eliza fails twice, raising personal and communal cost. Her agency drives escalation: she adapts tactics using her father’s rhythm-based philosophy. The courier’s near-grab and assistant’s recognition heighten pressure without coincidence resolving conflict. Cost is felt in lost nerve, near injury, and the weight of inherited responsibility—but the story avoids overstating war’s consequences, trusting subtext.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.3)
    The dominant stake—understanding why people carry weather—is signaled immediately and tightens when Vera learns her brother became part of the aspens’ survival strategy. This deepening reweights her mission from inquiry to inheritance, narrowing options: she must accept her role or remain unmoored. The convergence of the three figures escalates pressure through embodied atmospheres that challenge her skepticism, culminating in a trade-off—truth requires surrendering control. Cost is unmistakable: her identity as “luminous skeptic” transforms into something more porous, paid for in the loss of solitary clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—answering the inescapable calling—is signaled early and tightens when Maren discovers the broken lock, forcing confrontation with generational fear. Agency is clear: she chooses to draw despite lifelong prohibition, narrowing options (no more obedience) with visible cost (tears, irreversible rupture). Escalation is driven by protagonist discovery and decision under Accumulative pressure, not coincidence. The cost—grief intertwined with liberation—is unmistakable in the closing lines.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—accessing truth without being destroyed by it—tightens when Mei Lin chooses to descend into darkness despite her vulnerability. The deepening occurs at the playback: learning her father’s secret reframes her condition as protection, not pathology. Cost is unmistakable: she endures emotional devastation to transform private pain into public guidance. Agency drives escalation; coincidence (the salvaged fragment) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the map requires her interpretive labor.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—restoring truth through sound—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: Maren designs and installs the sculpture, risking failure after seven years of monastic silence.

Cost is unmistakable: the ancient ice melts irreversibly, sacrificing primordial purity to recalibrate human-made bronze.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—resolving the “static” of accumulated grief—is signaled early and tightens decisively when VERA-7 chooses self-care over containment. The magnetic shift isn’t coincidence; it catalyzes her agency, forcing a trade-off: preserve the past or quiet her mind. Cost is unmistakable: she sacrifices sacred relics of children she loved, an irreversible loss that alters her tactics (miniaturization instead of storage) and crystallizes her stance. Pressure escalates texturally but coherently under the Accumulative lens, with each sensory intensification narrowing her emotional bandwidth until action is inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether grief should remain sealed or be heard—is signaled early and tightens when Maren connects the anonymous donor to Delphine’s daughter. Escalation is driven by Maren’s agency: her noticing, questioning, and offering (“I can bring her here”) narrow options. Cost is felt in Mrs. Okonkwo’s tightened grip and withheld tears until the locket opens. Coincidence (donated coat) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from listening as active choice.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—deciphering encrypted courage—is signaled early and deepens through Marina’s embodied decryption.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—recovering erased identity—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Mira disobeys the tide master. The meaningful deepening occurs in the chamber: learning her mother traded herself to seal a “monstrous” breach raises the cost from personal grief to cosmic responsibility. Agency drives escalation—Mira chooses to open the book, triggering the climax. Coincidence (the whale beaching) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from Mira’s lineage and choice.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (hushing prophecy to prevent violence) tightens when Mira stretches silences until words “dissolve.” Agency drives escalation: her method actively reweights the prophecy’s impact. Cost is unmistakable—physical toll (“stiff legs,” “trembling fingers”) and the irreversible transformation of global fear into fragile hope. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—access to the building’s hidden language—is signaled early and tightens through seasonal escalation: hearing morning stretches → understanding lullabies → reading the structure “like a memoir.” Protagonist agency drives deepening; each tea session advances knowledge. Cost crystallizes in January: Voss fades, leaving stewardship as burden and gift. The meteor showers aren’t coincidence—they’re rhythmic markers that heighten pressure under an Accumulative lens, culminating in a Charged Poise ending where options are reconfigured but not resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—restoring stolen sisterhood—is signaled early and deepens through Mirabel’s archival act, which narrows options (she must give all memories or fail) and incurs physical/emotional cost (speaking through cold night). Escalation is protagonist-driven: her choice to “archive something new” transforms passive loss into active resistance. The Council’s memory laws create coherent pressure; coincidence never resolves conflict. Final cost is legible: Mirabel walks toward sun empty-handed, having given everything—yet hope remains charged, not guaranteed.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—restoring intended peace by completing Aldric’s last act—is signaled early and deepens through Veren’s ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—uncovering why people echo—tightens into survival when Mira learns echoing = harvesting. Escalation is driven by her agency: singing to probe, listening to the shell, interpreting echoes.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—truth as salvage, not vengeance—is signaled early and deepens when Mira uncovers sabotage. Escalation is driven by her agency: analyzing dreams, tracing patterns, choosing exposure. The cost is felt in the harbormaster’s inherited guilt and Mira’s solitary burden. Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens; coincidence (dream overlaps) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the climax hinges on Mira’s interpretation and decision.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—being the sole witness to hidden effort—is signaled early and deepens when the firefly lands on the whisk, confirming her life’s work. The meaningful tightening occurs when she whistles: an active choice that risks disrupting the pattern but proves her theory, narrowing her path to silent stewardship. Cost is unmistakable: she forgoes scientific legacy so fishermen may unknowingly benefit, and the world’s grace stays “unwitnessed.” Escalation is driven entirely by her agency—tracking, testing, responding—not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—truth versus control—is signaled early and tightens when Maya crosses the stillpoint threshold, foreclosing ignorance. Her agency drives escalation: reassembling letters leads to excavation, which leads to theft. Cost is unmistakable: she carries the burden of world-altering knowledge into a hostile wasteland. The Consortium’s off-stage presence exerts coherent pressure without resolving conflict conveniently.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether knowledge should catalyze war or wonder—is signaled early and deepens when Caro’s plea forces Miriam to act. The tightening occurs when Miriam chooses to transmit ancient signals over issuing a blessing, foreclosing passive detachment.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—translating silenced grief—is signaled early and tightens when Marcus deciphers the maritime code, transforming abstract longing into specific revelation (Samuel’s drowning). This deepening forces his climactic choice: deliver truth knowing it brings pain but also closure. Agency is clear—his listening, jar-filling, and writing actively unearth meaning; coincidence (the grandson’s gift) complicates but doesn’t resolve. Cost is felt in his wistful solitude and the irreversible act of speaking Samuel’s name into the wind, closing one loop while committing to endless others.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preventing commodification of the Source Tone—is signaled early and tightens when the Consortium’s lights appear, forcing Vera’s irreversible choice. Agency is renunciation-as-action: she releases rather than hides the Tone. Cost is unmistakable (her dissolution), though escalation leans slightly on external pressure (vessel approach) over internal deepening. One meaningful tightening suffices, but protagonist-driven escalation could heighten tension further.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—timing the magnetic storm for liberation—is signaled early and tightens when Mira discovers the viaduct’s amplifying role, narrowing her focus. Escalation is driven by her agency: recalibrating instruments, interpreting lunar data, accepting that three months of waiting enable mass unyoking.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—truth versus institutional silence—is signaled early and deepens when smuggling evidence is found. Escalation is driven by Margaret’s agency: empirical observation leads to discovery, which forces the decision to leak evidence.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—earning undeserved forgiveness—is signaled early and deepens when Ruth reveals the prior botched repair, mirroring Marcus’s own forced testimony. The tightening occurs in Marcus’s shift from passive guilt (“I failed”) to active restitution (“I need to turn it into something real”), foreclosing the path of empty remorse. Cost is felt: the melody might be altered forever, just as his soul bears permanent scar. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, with each revelation (Elias’s death, the broken heart, the faulty repair) layering emotional density without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—transcending mechanical purpose—is signaled early and tightens when Zephyr integrates the arrow tip, foreclosing safe workshop existence.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—whether to keep her euthanasia appointment—is signaled early and deepens through her volunteer work, which teaches her “a fold in patience.” The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses to stay and trawl, narrowing options by investing in recovery over resignation. Cost is felt in her uncertainty and the bodies left unrecovered, but the escalation relies more on accumulated texture than protagonist-driven causality. Still, the stakes remain viscerally present through ice, breath, and lace.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding lost love’s legacy—is signaled early and deepens when Sofia reveals her grandmother’s hidden letters. Marcus’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to share his fragment, narrowing emotional isolation. Cost is felt in his admission of waiting for unrecognizable passengers. The single tightening (revealing parallel losses) reweights the stake under an Accumulative lens, though pressure remains subtle rather than acute.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving ancestral wisdom against doctrinal erasure—is signaled early and escalates coherently.

Cost is legible in her isolation and the keeper’s trembling hands; the prophet’s rage confirms what’s at risk. Escalation stems from her choices under pressure, not coincidence, fulfilling the Situational lens’s demand for stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—transforming private grief into shared memory—is signaled early and deepens via Maren’s weekly invitations.

Pressure accumulates texturally via echo sequences, not causal turns, fitting the lens. Coincidence never resolves; insight arises solely from her disciplined listening.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—capturing the sound of growing older—is signaled early and deepens into a confrontation with inevitable loss.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—harnessing the ephemeral—is signaled early and deepens when Yua reframes it as escape from gravity of memory. Protagonist agency drives escalation: Mira brings the object, waits silently, chooses to stay. Cost is felt in her relinquishment of control; the tremors literalize destabilization of old beliefs.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—facing mortality with dignity—is signaled early and deepens through Samuel’s agency: he chooses repair over despair, articulates his desire for a “flawless goodbye,” and reaches for Mira’s hand.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restoring noon-shadows—is signaled early and tightens when the automaton reveals they fled due to altered light, raising the cost from academic curiosity to cosmic repair. Mira’s agency drives escalation: she modifies runes, accepts guidance, and works through false dawn.

While the threat isn’t visceral, the conceptual stakes (broken reality) cohere under the Causal lens, and the narrowing path—only *she* can close loops—sharpens pressure without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—truth about Charlotte—is signaled early and deepens when Eleanor unearths non-human bones.

Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens without reliance on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (sharing grief without destructive fire) tightens when Maren rejects hilltop beacons for sea glass—a deepening that forecloses pyres but opens communal light.

Coincidence never resolves; the “message” emerges from disciplined craft.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming meaning from trauma—is signaled early and escalates through Mira’s quiet agency: sketching patterns, choosing silence over words, offering the pendant.

One meaningful deepening—the pendant transfer—narrows options toward mutual presence.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—creating a soul-map to guide the lost—is signaled by line 3 and deepens when Maren places the storybook plate, linking childhood hope to present sacrifice. The single meaningful tightening occurs at the drop of starlight: success demands absolute stillness, forcing Maren to lock muscles, suspend breath, and slow her heart—a visceral trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—anchoring fractals with emotional mass—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s active collection of specific griefs. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: turning the loom toward each echo tightens pressure by increasing cognitive load.

The bronze grotto’s resonance isn’t coincidence—it’s a resource she exploits, making stakes viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming formless grief into holdable shape—is signaled early and deepens via Marguerite’s carving and teaching. Agency emerges through renunciation: she refuses drowning, choosing instead to “contain” sorrow as Viktor contained fear. Cost is felt in bodily stiffness, emotional restraint, and the lion’s unfinished state—proof that healing isn’t completion but ongoing labor. Escalation occurs texturally: rain intensifies, kettle whistles, students approach, yet Marguerite’s calm deepens, showing earned poise under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—negotiating with her ghost to resolve the debt of abandoned ambition—is signaled early and deepens when Mira uses the overheard fragment about regret.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding her father’s lies—is signaled early and tightens when radio silence reveals his smuggling.

Cost is unmistakable: the inheritance is not treasure but unbearable clarity, crystallized in her poised uncertainty at story’s end.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving vanishing knowledge—is signaled early and deepens when the rope reveals not just techniques but an invitation, transforming Mira from archivist to participant. The tightening occurs at midpoint: understanding the knowledge’s fragility (“would vanish entirely”) raises emotional and existential cost.

Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding “the geography of healing”—tightens when Elara projects Matthias’s presence, narrowing options to writing his truth. The deepening occurs in her epiphany: healing isn’t destination but practice, foreclosing passive grief with the cost of daily endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—beauty vs. mechanized efficiency—tightens when Aldric admits, “I cannot recreate what was. I can only birth something new from old ash.” This forecloses restoration, forcing innovation with cost: irreversible hybridity.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—transforming inherited destruction into healing—is signaled early and deepens via the lagoon discovery and letter exchange. The tightening occurs when Mara realizes containment, not eradication, is the path forward—a shift driven by her agency, not coincidence. Cost is felt in bodily scars, emotional labor of opening letters, and the temporary footprints destined to vanish. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens with one decisive cadence shift at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—liberating trapped memories—is signaled early and tightens when Mira realizes her mother’s laughter must dissolve to free others. Agency drives escalation: she follows breadcrumbs, opens the box, guides the memory, turns the key. Cost is unmistakable: the irreplaceable fragment of her mother’s laughter is sacrificed. Pressure coheres under Causal lens; coincidence never resolves—the trail is deliberate, the key ancient but accessible through her actions.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—interrupting generational fire-patterns—is signaled early and deepens when Veloris realizes the gear encodes resonance, not just calculation. Her agency drives escalation: sonar reveals dormant seeds, turning the gear harmonizes frequencies.

Pressure tightens coherently under the Accumulative lens, culminating in a single decisive act of calibrated release.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—discovering the shape of collective grief—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: Elara chooses to reframe the Hendricks memorial after Thomas’s guidance. The tightening occurs when she shifts from listing names to mapping relationships, foreclosing individual commemoration in favor of interconnected loss. Cost is felt in the inherited weight of the ribbon braid and the emotional labor of listening across generations. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with monarch migration acting as a live clock.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring communal trust through precision—is signaled early and deepens when the rake handle reveals a lineage of guilt. The tightening occurs when Maren chooses to inscribe her failure, foreclosing silence and joining a hidden community of penitents. Agency is clear: her decision to carve and later release the handle alters her internal landscape. Cost is felt in the “seventeen seconds” that finally lighten—not erased, but acknowledged—and in the lifelong burden she continues to carry while still winding the clock.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—deciphering her grandmother’s hidden message—is signaled early and deepens when the border resolves into coordinates. The tightening occurs in Mira’s realization that the answer was under her care all along, foreclosing ignorance as an option. Cost is felt in the weight of the case and the burden of discovery, though not yet paid physically. Agency drives escalation: untangling is active, not passive reception.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—mapping time honestly under constraint—is signaled early and tightens when Mira rejects the ancients’ certainty. Her agency drives escalation: she actively composes futures via predictive modeling, narrowing options to grounded speculation. Cost is legible in the final image: the unbroken ice (past failure) versus her imperfect, questioning maps (future possibility). Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens—each calculation deepens the thematic weight of uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving story against erasure—is signaled early and deepens via Helena’s realization that dust carries memory. Escalation is driven by her agency: she chooses to broadcast despite patrol proximity, embedding resistance in lullabies. Cost is unmistakable: perpetual isolation, sleepless vigilance, the fox-scare revealing frayed nerves.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—honoring grief without false solace—tightens when Marina chooses partial portraits over full likenesses, foreclosing easy comfort. Her agency drives escalation: mixing ash with charcoal isn’t passive inheritance but active synthesis, deepening her commitment to “careful truth.” The cost is felt in her solitude and the mask’s sharp edges, which literalize the pain of honest mourning. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres through her choices alone.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving plural epistemologies against zealous erasure—is signaled early and escalates via Marcus’s internal debate: engage or endure? His choice to descend again crystallizes under pressure, narrowing options with felt cost (isolation, irrelevance). Agency resides in attention and preservation; the New Covenant’s off-page presence applies coherent antagonistic pressure without resolving via coincidence. One meaningful deepening—the realization that evidence fails against narrative certainty—drives the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving vanishing art against cultural indifference—is signaled early and deepens when Darius embodies both loss (his father’s death, his own withdrawal) and potential continuity. Margaret’s agency crystallizes not through grand action but attention: choosing to teach again forecloses resignation. The cost is felt in every abandoned chair, every coding camp enrollment, and the trembling imperfection of that first note. Escalation arises from protagonist-driven re-engagement, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving forbidden memory against erasure—is signaled early and tightens through each moonrise. Maren’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to plant, hum, harvest.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder amid collapse—is signaled early and tightens when the drone beehive’s distress forces Mira to risk revealing the tower’s secret.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—whether abandoned places can be kept alive through attention—is signaled early and deepens when Marina realizes her grandmother was wrong. The meaningful tightening occurs at the threshold: entering the house becomes an act of defiance against creeping normality. Cost is felt in her solitude and burden, though not dramatized as loss (e.g., time, health). Agency is clear: her displacement method drives escalation, but stakes remain internal rather than viscerally tested.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—Mira’s need to validate her brother’s work—is signaled early and deepens when Veris reframes his “drowning” as voluntary rejoining. The tightening occurs when Mira must choose between clinging to certainty or embracing possibility, with visible cost: her lifelong narrative of loss collapses.

Coincidence (finding Veris) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the revelation hinges on prior choices.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.2)
    The dominant stake—capturing the “texture of a missed opportunity”—is signaled early and deepens when Vera links it to perpetual motion. Her agency drives escalation: rolling dice leads to the crack, which she actively probes with equations, triggering the rupture. The cost is unmistakable: she trades potential reunion for crystallized understanding, sealing herself into eternal recurrence. Coincidence (finding dice) complicates but doesn’t resolve; her choices narrow options until only endurance remains, fulfilling the Accumulative lens’s pressure requirement with visceral emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—proving kindness survives—is signaled early and deepens when Maya paints the old tongue unconsciously, then receives tangible confirmation. Escalation is driven by her agency: choosing to paint nightly, pursuing recipients, interpreting visions.

Coincidence (the ping) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Maya’s prior work makes the response meaningful.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—cultural survival—is signaled early and tightens when honey runs low and the beekeeper fails to appear. Mira’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to teach, bake, and declare “perfect preservation” despite despair.

Coincidence (beekeeper’s absence) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution comes through stubborn endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reaching his lost daughter—is signaled early and tightens through Alaric’s reverse-engineering, which narrows options to one desperate act.

Escalation is driven by Vera’s agency under an Accumulative lens, with each beat deepening the psychological terrain.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—transforming wreckage into resonance—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: she *chooses* to tap, listen, mount. Escalation occurs through fractal pattern recognition (clouds → wood grain → shells), narrowing her focus as blue hour fades. Cost is unmistakable: forty years of isolation, reliance on flotsam, the fishermen’s judgment. Luck complicates (storms bring debris) but never resolves; her skill turns coincidence into composition.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—knowing vs. safety—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Mira decodes “we understand now,” transforming abstract yearning into actionable knowledge. Her agency drives escalation: decoding → witnessing response → choosing departure. Cost is unmistakable: exile from the only home, severing ties with drowsy community, risking her father’s fate. The single meaningful deepening (“water runs upward”) reconfigures physical law, raising stakes beyond mere travel to ontological rupture—all earned through protagonist-led discovery under a Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. noble lies—is signaled by the first sentence and deepens when Vera confronts the Institute’s genuine good. The tightening occurs at the desk: evidence amassed forces an irrevocable choice that forecloses comfort. Agency is absolute—she uploads, knowing consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—rescuing abandoned meaning—is signaled early and deepens when Marina finds the photograph matching the inkwell letter.

Coincidence (finding matching artifacts) complicates but doesn’t resolve; her response earns closure.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—verifying origins—intensifies when blackout removes distractions, forcing Maren into deeper engagement. Her agency drives escalation: she walks, readsjusts a manuscript, discovers the ledger. Cost is felt in the irreversible commitment to truth over institutional narratives. Though stakes remain internal, they’re viscerally rendered through tactile acts (thumb on stamp, brittle pages). Coincidence (blackout) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the discovery stems from Maren’s perceptive habits, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving Lin’s essence before dissolution—is signaled early and tightens at midnight, the “timeframe after the shadow detaches.” Mei’s agency drives escalation: she studies basilica tech, smuggles crystal, and calculates gem specs, each choice narrowing options (e.g., no turning back once she climbs the terrace). The cost is legible: her humanity eroded by grief (“hollowed out”), now exchanged for a luminous torment that precludes normal life. Coincidence never resolves; the monks’ lore merely frames pressure Mei must act within, making her triumph wholly earned under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—finding unused potential to reframe trauma—is signaled early and deepens via the third anomaly detection.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (moral reckoning for erasing identities) tightens decisively when Maren admits aloud, “I helped erase her.” This deepening forecloses her prior self-deception (“mechanical role”) and forces trade-offs: she must now use her skills inversely, risking exposure. Protagonist agency drives escalation—her choice to speak truth aloud alters tactics. Cost is unmistakable: “tempered regret” replaces denial, with future labor implied (“Tomorrow she would begin searching”).

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—saving her brother while preserving fragile peace—is signaled early and tightens when Varen notes the full moon, testing Mira’s practicality versus sentiment.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—can Marcus earn redemption without memory?—is signaled early and deepens when Elena reveals the baseball’s origin and purpose. Pressure escalates causally: clues → confrontation → labyrinth test. The cost is felt in Marcus’s terror and Elena’s exhausted sacrifice (“My brother wouldn’t want me to spend my life hating a stranger”). Agency drives escalation—Marcus must *feel* his way, not deduce—and the algae mechanism ensures stakes remain visceral, not abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reforging a bond beyond death—is signaled early and deepens via Mira’s reluctant metamorphosis, which narrows her options irreversibly. Escalation is driven by her agency: she chooses to crush the spices, whisper Kael’s name, and surrender to transformation. The cost is unmistakable: loss of humanity, altered relationship with beasts, permanent liminality. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies through sensory and emotional density, not external antagonism, yet remains coherent and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost maternal time—is signaled by line two and tightens when the saucer anchors memory. Escalation is driven by Morrigan’s agency: tracing her hand triggers card-rearrangement, unfastening the cord opens the door. Cost is unmistakable: she must relinquish Iris’s birthday knots to access the moments, transforming regret into reclaimed presence. The glade’s logic (lost time pools here) creates coherent pressure that crystallizes her stance—no coincidence, only earned ritual. One deepening suffices: from passive searching to active retrieval via ancestral custom.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—unlocking the dimension through shadow work—is signaled early and deepens when Mei Lin confronts her own photograph. The tightening occurs not through external pressure but internal escalation: avoiding her rage for decades, then stitching as ritualized confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—completing the journey of transformation—is signaled early and deepens when the geologist’s warning forces a detour, narrowing options from summit sacrifice to beach release. Miriam’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to open each jar, culminating in the seventeenth release that crystallizes her realization. Cost is felt throughout: poverty, erasure of identity (“Fool”), physical depletion. The “whispering hush” applause confirms stakes were real, not abstract. Coincidence (geologist’s warning) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the resolution comes from Miriam’s deliberate action.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—exposing the Duke’s counterfeit mint—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the blackout enables messengers’ departure. Escalation is driven by Maren’s agency: decoding, recruiting, timing the blackout, completing the circuit. The meaningful deepening occurs when the astronomer’s message reframes the fort as “cradle of sparks,” transforming vigilance into revolution. Cost is unmistakable: Maren risks execution, yet her victory is invisible, requiring lifelong concealment. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under causal lens until the final hoofbeats carry irreversible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—understanding the patterns to prevent cosmic unraveling—is signaled early and tightens when Meren realizes someone solved them “backward.” The meaningful deepening occurs with the star dust revelation: for once, she can look without causing. This narrows her path from evasion to active harnessing, with visible cost—the lifelong burden of her curse now weaponized for creation.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming voice after state-imposed silence—is signaled early and deepens when the envelope reveals her mother’s defiance.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—exposing manufactured war—is signaled early and tightens when Elara names it: “ethics of concealing peace.” The escalation is driven by her agency: decoding the sundial, confronting Krell, forcing the duel.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving dangerous ideas through fragile beauty—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: Mira chooses to rebuild despite identity flux, rationing tea to protect poems. Escalation occurs when Ezra arrives with “dangerous” philosophy, tightening pressure as patrols hunt them; their silent sorting becomes defiance. Cost is unmistakable: the false-bottom tin’s secrecy, the risk of capture, the emotional toll of molting. Coincidence never resolves; survival hinges on their choices.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reuniting across impossible distance—is signaled early and tightens via the dusk deadline. Elara’s agency drives escalation: decoding coordinates from film, weaving tonal patterns into music, activating the clock’s receiver. Cost is unmistakable: years of static grief, the physical toll on her husband (“heavier footsteps, weathered by journey”), and the irreversible end of waiting. The flickering compasses’ erratic needles raise stakes by framing truth as unstable, demanding her signal to anchor reality.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—preserving unverifiable cultural memory—is signaled early and intensifies via the monsoon deadline. Yara’s agency drives escalation: she tests the seed scientifically, then surrenders to ancestral method, narrowing options from control to trust.

Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each botanical anomaly and memory fragment deepens the central question without coincidence resolving tension.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—decoding unspoken apology—is signaled early and deepens via lace instructions, narrowing options to silent reciprocity. Mei’s agency drives escalation: she follows the lace, reads knots, and chooses presence over distance.
