  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Vera's survival and uncovering the conspiracy—is signaled early. The tightening from observation (charred ledger strip) to discovery (gunpowder cache) to confrontation follows a coherent arc. However, the peak conflict deflates: Galloway's gun and his regret are introduced, then Vera delivers a thematic monologue, and the resolution is summarized. No visible trade-off or on-page cost at the confrontation; the "clemency" deal happens off-stage, undercutting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—translating silence into meaning after catastrophic loss—is signaled early and tightens through the collaborative installation process. One meaningful deepening occurs when private thermal experiments become public exhibition, raising the cost of exposure. The final night's leather-bound book reveals transformation chronologically, showing "jagged reds" incorporating "softer hues." Agency reads as acceptance and endurance rather than decision; Mara's collaboration with Chen and the choice to exhibit are narrated more than dramatized as turning points with visible tradeoffs in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—giving the drowned scholars rest—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through Marcel's dreams and his decision to descend, but the middle sequence lacks meaningful resistance or cost that narrows his options; he works "for days or hours" restoring the library without obstacle, and the ghosts cooperate immediately. The climax (lens installation, acknowledgment, release) provides a tightening that reweights the vigil as devotion rather than foolishness, but this reframing happens through declaration ("You can rest now") rather than a choice that forecloses a live alternative. No visible price paid during the work itself—his exhaustion is mentioned but never constrains tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—cultural continuity versus dissolution through exile—is signaled early and sustained. Mara's decision to declare the network is a meaningful tightening that forecloses anonymity and exposes the structure to risk, and the young woman's pledge provides an on-page answer. However, the escalation is more thematic accumulation than tactical pressure: no antagonist tests the midnight runs, no donor threatens withdrawal, no internal faction resists transparency. The cost of declaration (exposure, potential sanctions violations) is implied but not dramatized in a beat where Mara or a donor faces a concrete price.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—finding where unused love is stored—is signaled early but pursued through meditation and vision rather than narrowing tactical choices. One meaningful deepening occurs (seeing golden threads in the camera obscura), yet it arrives as revelation rather than a turn earned by prior friction. The pilgrim's spark-show and Mei's decision to release the tear lack a legible trade-off that forecloses a live path; she departs enriched, not changed by sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Lyra's quest to "discover the texture of time"—is signaled early and sustained through her interaction with the halo fragment. One meaningful deepening occurs when she touches the fragment to the photograph and the maze designs unfold into hyperbolic structures, reweighting her understanding of her condition. However, the escalation operates primarily through revelation and interior realization rather than a choice that forecloses options or forces a trade-off. The disintegration of the photographs provides a visible loss, but Lyra's stance toward that loss ("she didn't need them anymore") feels like relief rather than a price paid under pressure, softening the stakes at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: escape with evidence to expose the regime's engineered famine. The wall's demolition provides external pressure and a ticking clock that creates one meaningful tightening. However, Mira's competence nullifies most opposition—the guards never materialize as a threat, the key arrangement solves itself, chains unlock conveniently. The arrow discovery lacks complication; it simply rests where promised. The final choice to plant seeds rather than immediately distribute evidence introduces a new priority without showing what tactical options it forecloses or what urgent cost she accepts.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: capturing the sound of trust breaking to reverse-engineer connection with her daughter. The story tightens through one meaningful turn: Mira finds the sound, realizes it is unbearable, and must choose whether to preserve or destroy it. Agency is decision with visible cost—dropping the crystal forecloses the path of technological recovery and forces acceptance of loss. The escalation is driven by protagonist choice under the Accumulative lens, and the cost is legible on the page ("she could accept that some sounds weren't meant to be preserved").

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (understanding her compulsion vs. creating her own illuminated moments) is signaled early. One meaningful deepening occurs when the moonbeams reveal her future as painter, narrowing options. However, the resolution lacks visible cost: Maya simply walks away, already seeing golden hour differently, with no on-page trade-off or forfeited path. The jar's return is a gesture, not a price that alters tactics or forecloses a live alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: emotional reconciliation versus protective isolation. One meaningful tightening occurs when Marcus recognizes his own metaphor and picks up the bookmark, narrowing options from indefinite solitude to tomorrow's visit. The escalation is accumulative rather than causal-turn driven, which fits the inferred lens. Agency is clear—the decision to visit his sister forecloses years of avoidance with visible cost (vulnerability, potential rejection). No antagonist is required under this lens; pressure coheres through layered imagery and internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—expose the consortium's crimes—is clear early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Reeves's call reframes the cast as evidence against the consortium rather than simple betrayal, narrowing Maya's decision to involve authorities. However, that reversal arrives via phone exposition rather than Maya's action under pressure, and the final choice (call Emma, then authorities) proceeds without visible trade-off or cost; no credible loss (time, safety, relationship) alters her tactics on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (mapping the endless night) is signaled early and drives the oracle's gift. However, the story lacks a meaningful tightening or reversal that narrows options; the oracle arrives competent and remains so. The commander's transition from doubt to understanding is told ("beginning to understand") rather than dramatized through a visible cost or foreclosed alternative. Pressure accumulates texturally but does not escalate causally.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding thought-origins—is signaled in paragraph three and remains coherent throughout. Escalation operates through the Accumulative lens: fear (loop one) → silence (loop two) → destruction (loop three) → comprehension (loop four), each iteration tightening J-7's approach with visible progression. Agency is present in his decision to play the violin "this time" with understanding, and the cost is legible: accepting that thoughts come "from everywhere and nowhere" forecloses the search for a single origin point. The iterative structure provides meaningful pressure without requiring traditional reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.2)
    One dominant stake: Mira's emotional isolation and longing for connection. The eavesdropping reversal narrows her options (passive observer → active participant) and the final gesture with the ticket tightens pressure. However, the escalation feels compressed—Dmitri's door opens immediately, and the resolution arrives without visible trade-off or cost on the page. The piece deepens understanding but does not force a choice between competing goods or show a price paid. Agency is present but the cost clarity required for high bands is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: Marcus seeks understanding of his negative-seven score and what it means for the damned. Pressure tightens when the vine dresser's ritual reveals an alternate measurement system (the garden's response to her presence) that cannot be quantified, forcing Marcus to choose between the Institute's authority and lived proof. The garden's impossible blooming/withering operates as both complication and evidence, raising conceptual cost. One meaningful deepening: the marbles shift from curiosity to proof that "some truths can't be quantified, only cultivated." The vine dresser's agency (polishing, arranging, walking into the maze) drives escalation. Cost is visible in Marcus's stance among the marbles as hierarchies crumble around him.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—proving the temporal anomaly—is signaled early and drives Kael's actions through the nexus calibration. One meaningful tightening occurs when the Ephemera settle and magnetic fields align, creating the brief window for detection. The holographic display provides a reversal (lateral time visualization) that changes knowledge. However, Kael's agency at closure is muted; the return to calibrations feels more like thematic bookending than a choice with visible cost. The vindication moment lacks a felt trade-off or foreclosed path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: decode the ghost's message and expose the truth. Escalation occurs through the Accumulative lens: clues deepen (floating program → stain patterns → conductor's name → water-written "TELL THEM"), and each discovery narrows options until Marta commits to disruption. The tightening when "Moretti" emerges forecloses doubt about the ghost's claim. Agency is present: Marta chooses to photograph evidence and promise public revelation, with visible cost (her credibility and the seventy-year wait). However, no on-page opposition complicates her progress—lanterns always affirm, water always cooperates—so pressure remains unidirectional. The lack of a second reversal or friction point keeps this strong but shy of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake signaled early: Mira needs to understand why the oracle failed and prevent future loss. The discovery of marginalized data is a meaningful tightening that narrows options toward redesign. The escalation is driven by Mira's agency (her choice to rewrite the weighting algorithms) under the accumulative lens; the cost is conceptual and relational (acceptance of fallibility, Reeves's death as irreversible). One point of friction: the redesign proceeds smoothly without encountering resistance from the system's architecture or Chen's skepticism, which would have added visible trade-offs during the revision process itself.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—finding the weight of swallowed truth—is signaled early and pursued consistently through mapping confessions to architecture. Pressure accumulates via the caller's breaking confession and Marcus's deepening interpretation. The valve-turning produces a tightening when "the shadows paused," narrowing options toward documentation and departure. Cost is conceptually legible in the unfinished work ("until every family found the courage"). However, the protagonist's agency at closure is primarily observational; he documents rather than risks or renounces, which keeps the felt price modest for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—whether to preserve or witness dissolution—is signaled early but never tested by a concrete on-page dilemma that forces a trade-off. The chronicle keeper's shift from preservation to acceptance is recounted across seasons rather than dramatized in a single pressured moment where she must choose what to save or release. The descent and discovery deepen atmosphere but do not escalate pressure; no reversal narrows her options or raises cost. The origami swan's message ("Everything that knows itself completely stops growing") arrives as thematic statement rather than a problem that alters her tactics or forecloses a path with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: helping Thomas find his voice. The eclipse session provides one meaningful tightening—the liminal moment creates pressure that enables the breakthrough. Mara's agency is visible in her therapeutic choices (melody "softly adaptive," not overwhelming his humming), and Thomas's three words carry weight. The cost, however, is more implied than visceral; Mara's "cautious exuberance" and tear-holding signal fragility, but we don't see what she must now sacrifice or risk to build on this moment. The resolution feels clean rather than purchased with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving stories that walls have heard—is signaled early and remains consistent. The discovery of the tapestry-diary link tightens meaning but does not narrow options or force a trade-off; Miren simply mounts the tapestry as intended. No reversal tests her resolve, and the ending celebrates success without visible friction. The accumulative lens allows for deepening without causal conflict, yet the lack of a credible loss or complication keeps pressure modest.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—safe passage of the microdot without electronic communication—is signaled early, but escalation is minimal because Maya's plan unfolds without meaningful resistance or adaptation. No on-page reversal tests her commitment; the fortunate cookies are written, packed, and shipped in a single uninterrupted sequence. The confirmation signal ("three lighthouse lamp blinks, then two, then five") arrives to resolve the problem off-page. The piece offers logistical texture but no moment where Maya's agency narrows options or pays a visible price scaled to espionage stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—saving Marcus before possession completes—is signaled early with a ticking clock ("perhaps another hour"). Escalation occurs through accumulation (hum, breathing, voice loops, blue marks) rather than reversals, fitting an accumulative lens, but the priest faces no meaningful obstacles or trade-offs; each layer adds smoothly without forcing a difficult choice. The entity's dissolution feels conceptual rather than hard-won; we don't see Marcus struggle toward stillness or the priest risk anything tangible. The tightening is more thematic than tactical, and while the ending reweights assumptions, the cost to either character remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (escape hollow fortune-writing) is signaled early. Mira's agency is attention and transcription—she shifts method from predicting to translating—but the escalation is primarily internal realization rather than a choice that narrows live options or imposes visible trade-off. The story delivers one meaningful deepening (grandfather's method reinterpreted), yet the final act lacks a decision that forecloses a competing path with on-page cost; she simply writes thirty pages and descends "ready," with exhaustion arriving as backdrop rather than forcing a sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake signaled early: gather fragmented selves to escape the labyrinth. One meaningful tightening: the runes align into a timeline map, she retraces deliberately, and each choice rejoins a fragment. Agency is renunciation (choosing harder paths over running away) with visible cost (gravity reasserts, singularity replaces infinite scatter). The escalation reads more as accumulative deepening than causal pressure—fragments rejoin as she retraces, but the mechanics of "choosing the harder path" remain somewhat abstract. The final image reweights her condition (scattered → whole) with felt cost (weight, ache, chill) that fits the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—defeating emotional numbness—is signaled early and tightens when Marie's report cracks Oskar's numbness, then deepens when his reputation spreads and she gains conservatory acceptance. One clear pressure point: the method's success forces Oskar to confront whether his deafness has value rather than only loss. The resolution is Oskar's acceptance (Earned Stasis with visible cost: thirty years in isolation, performing abandoned). However, the escalation is gentle; no on-page moment dramatizes a choice between competing goods or a tactical constraint that narrows options under immediate pressure, keeping this in the mid-7s rather than 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (truth-recording vs. professional erasure) is signaled early and tightens when the woman offers the satchel, forcing Marianne to choose between solitude and collective resistance. Agency is clear: her decision to map the coordinates forecloses safer inaction with visible cost (she joins a network the government has "pushed out"). Coincidence (the woman's arrival) complicates but does not resolve; Marianne's choice to act closes the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—Marcus's quest to discover meaning in post-arrival fragments—is signaled early but never tightens into a dilemma. Sarah's appearance offers revelation rather than complication; no reversal or tightening narrows options. The rope reading deepens understanding but imposes no cost or trade-off. Under Accumulative logic escalation reads as density increase, yet the final shrine choice feels ordained rather than pressured; no live option is foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: perform unfinished pieces to honor tradition and find beauty amid the chronic hush. The escalation under the Accumulative lens is the gradual retreat of the hush and Maya's realization that incompleteness invites participation. Agency is present in her choice to play fragments and her recognition of their purpose. The cost is legible: accepting incompleteness means forsaking closure and accepting ongoing fragility. One tightening occurs at piece twenty-seven when the hush retreats; the final fruit-drop crystallizes the risk of beauty in a world still vulnerable.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether to deliver authentic emotion or professionally useful lies—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens through three moves: Therese's request establishes the ethical problem, the amber's transformation offers a reframing lens, and Mara's remake decision narrows options (she delivers a less effective product with professional consequences hinted in "already knowing what would come next"). The cost is legible: she forfeits professional thoroughness for moral honesty. Under the Accumulative lens, the pressure deepens rather than reverses, and the final choice forecloses the path of pure counterfeit.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—uplifting silent contributors—is signaled by midpoint and pursued without opposition or cost. The project unfolds through summary ("Over the following weeks") rather than on-page reversals; no resistance from the workers, no logistical friction, no competing demand tests Marianne's commitment. The lighthouse keeper's gratitude arrives as affirmation, not complication. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening would suffice, but the "shift in her chest" is declared, not earned by a choice that forecloses an option or pays a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—Kael's need to belong—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when she must reveal herself as the artist. The shared search creates escalating intimacy that raises the cost of exposure. Agency is clear: Kael's choice to create the tags and sculpture, then to confess, forecloses her previous isolation with visible cost (vulnerability, tears, "I didn't know how"). The seven-day structure provides a clear intensification arc. One micro-turn when Kael speaks up at the arbor gathering shifts her from observer to participant.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—finding the birthplace of echoes—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates under the Accumulative lens: Vera detects temporal scars, stretches time, locates the echo, then must choose whether to keep it caged or free it. The uncaging decision narrows options (she releases borrowed time, accepts fading scars) with on-page cost, though the choice feels more philosophical than agonized. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the echo must be liberated to be understood, altering her approach from capture to release.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding ambiguous loss through mathematical conjuring—is signaled early and coherent. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens is minimal: Elara performs one ritual (places eyes, whispers theorems, sees double vision) without a second complicating beat or tactical shift. The double vision offers a glimpse of her brother but no decision or renunciation follows; she "didn't call out" and simply "continued her work." Cost is claimed in the final reflection ("accepting that some systems remained unsolvable") but never tested on the page through a visible trade-off or foreclosed option.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—Miriam's need to matter—is signaled early but never tightens into a choice that forecloses options. The power outage triggers discovery, but coincidence initiates rather than complicates. The weeks-long donation sequence summarizes rather than dramatizes escalation. No visible trade-off or risk accompanies her decision to surface the tapes; the resolution grants her exactly what she wants without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—whether to control or surrender in plant care—is clear and tested through storm season's repeated pressure. Escalation reads as deepening rather than multiple reversals: each storm and each small act of releasing control (leaving weeds, keeping moss, stopping scheduled pruning) narrows her options until the final leaf-release forecloses her old identity. The cost is present but somewhat abstract ("dissolution of her old identity," "losing herself"), and the piece would benefit from a sharper on-page trade-off in the closing beat—what specific research path or academic credential does she give up by staying?

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: threshing meaning from chaos. The painter's insomnia and obsessive rain-trail painting establish early pressure. One meaningful deepening occurs when she follows trails by moonlight to the cave, driven by the brooch's recognition-tingle. The convergence reweights her purpose from singular to continuous (humans always sought patterns). The cost—four sleepless nights, isolation—is present but lightly sketched; the deepening feels more contemplative than an urgent tightening that forecloses a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (Mara's clairvoyant mastery vs. essential mystery) signals early and tightens when the pearl shows "nothing," forcing her from knower to wonderer. The pilgrim's revelation—"every prophecy...prevented...genuine wonder"—reweights the cost of her gift, and her whispered "Teach me" forecloses the oracle path with visible consequence. Agency is clear: she chooses transformation. One meaningful deepening (her doubt → the pearl's negation → her request) suffices under the Accumulative lens. No multiple reversals required. Cost is legible: she loses foresight and gains unknowing beauty.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—whether Marina's cataloging of absences will matter when the exiled return—is signaled early and tightens when she spots Thomas and realizes "why she'd kept the valve." Her choice to approach him and offer the fragment forecloses her solitary observer role with visible cost: she must now engage directly, teach the returned to see themselves in preserved fragments. The staggered-interval viewing method shows her managing overwhelming presence after years of absence, adding tactical texture. One meaningful deepening: the valve transaction transforms her understanding of her own work from monument to empty spaces into a bridge for the returned.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding the hidden city beneath the visible one—is signaled early and tightens when Mara descends into the tunnel. Her "dare" is a meaningful choice that forecloses retreat, and the conductor's warning deepens risk. However, the fortress revelation (her own name carved in stone) arrives without prior on-page resistance or tactical cost; she walks, finds, and begins to draw. The final mapmaking is agency, but the intervening journey lacks a visible obstacle or trade-off that narrows her options under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding her grandmother's cryptic inheritance and deciding whether to accept its terms—is signaled early. One meaningful deepening occurs when the entangled memories reveal the guardianship purpose, narrowing Elena's options to either continue or abandon the lineage. However, the escalation is primarily internal revelation rather than a choice under competing pressures; no live option is visibly foreclosed (she never considers refusing the inheritance on-page). The cost is felt but not dramatized through a tactical tradeoff or renunciation that closes a door. Accumulative pressure coheres under the chosen lens but lacks a second tightening beat.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (Cassius's drive to solve the mystery vs. Naia's need to escape half-life) is signaled early and tightens when Naia reveals she brought the fragment. The storm's peak creates a time-bound pressure point that forecloses intervention. Naia's agency—pressing the fragment to her chest and stepping into the gap—drives the climax; Cassius's reactive position ("Tell me what you find") and subsequent plotting show earned transformation under pressure. Cost is visible: Naia vanishes, Cassius loses her permanently, and his final choice to repeat the cycle demonstrates a felt price. One meaningful deepening: "maybe some goodbyes are meant to be final" reweights the dominant mystery-chase with relational cost.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Mara's refusal to profit from lies versus her father's active con. The breach tightens pressure when she reveals her hour-old confession to Jacobson, foreclosing Vincent's escape. Agency is clear—Mara's documentation and timing force the trade (his freedom for treatment). Visible cost: Vincent loses his con, Mrs. Kowalski's money is implicitly returned, and Mara risks their relationship. One strong reversal (the ink pot discovery leading to preemptive exposure) drives the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—collecting temporal textures before they homogenize—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful deepening occurs: moving from lamp-charting compression/expansion zones to discovering the honest oak requires choosing fabrication over documentation. However, escalation is textural accumulation rather than protagonist-driven tightening; she encounters rather than pursues each grove, and the climax oak appears by探索 rather than tactical choice. The final renunciation (recording falsely at the truth node) carries conceptual cost but lacks visible trade-off on the page—no prior scene showed her wrestling with fidelity versus beauty. Agency reads as attention and stance crystallization (valid under Accumulative lens) but the pressure never forces a live decision between competing goods until the ending assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—Maya's existential erasure and her need to reconstruct identity outside official record—is signaled early and maintained. The poison label discovery functions as the tightening that shifts her from passive collecting to active reconstruction of histories. The harbormaster encounter narrows options by forcing her to choose between remaining in the labyrinth and rejoining official existence. However, the escalation feels more like revelation than pressure; Maya faces no meaningful opposition or cost in her collecting, and her decision to "fix the paperwork" arrives without dramatized internal resistance or visible trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Mira's need to disprove her grandmother's mysticism one final time. The turn occurs when she hears reimagined conversations through the shell/cello and realizes "the riddle wasn't about proof. It was about connection." This shift is more epiphany than tightening; no live option is foreclosed with visible resistance. The cost—accepting incompleteness, abandoning certainty—is thematic rather than action-driven. Under an Accumulative lens, the deepening is present but gentle; no sharp reversal tests commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—survival of the carnival against privatization—is signaled early and persists. Marina's graffiti campaign tightens community resistance, but the escalation occurs largely in summary ("Within weeks, the community began to shift"). The final beat reweights her teaching role under threat, yet the pressure reads as thematic reconfiguration rather than a narrowed tactical choice with visible cost in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—documenting the mountain's soul before implosion—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, the story lacks meaningful tightening; Chen faces no reversals or trade-offs, only a methodical execution of his plan. The ninety-minute window creates structural urgency but doesn't alter tactics or force dilemmas. The grain discovery deepens thematic understanding without narrowing options or raising cost. One meaningful pressure point is present (the timed chemical system) but it unfolds without complication.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—fixing the drone before Voss's launch—is signaled early and tracked through ship horns and Voss's rising tension. One tightening occurs: "I'm out of time" followed by Mara's refusal and her real-time testing. However, the escalation is external (the clock) rather than driven by Mara's agency; she never faces a meaningful tradeoff or complication in the repair itself. The resolution is earned by her skill but not by a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. Pressure is coherent under the Situational lens but lacks a harder turn that would force a deeper choice.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—finding the singular convergence point—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure is primarily accumulative rather than escalatory: condensation → falcon data → departure. The falcon's three-day return provides one tightening moment, but Mira's subtly confident posture means no live option is foreclosed with visible struggle. Her choice to drill is presented as inevitable confirmation rather than a trade-off. The piece lacks a second pressure point or complication that would test her commitment with on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—prevent the town's collapse—is signaled early but remains abstract; no on-page obstacle threatens to derail the bell tuner's work. She walks, listens, walks more; residents join without resistance. The text asserts "balance had been lost" and "the frequency of hope" has grown faint, yet no beat dramatizes what would happen if she failed or what specific cost she pays to succeed. The bell sealing reads as a result of accumulated effort rather than a choice under pressure. Agency is present in her method (footsteps, tuning fork), but no reversal or tightening forces her to choose between competing goods or accept a visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (Chen's survival vs. vial's allure) is signaled early and tightens when Mara must override her own desire to save him. The oxygen alarm provides a live countdown. One clear reversal: Mara pockets the vial and breaks its pull, forcing Chen toward the submersible. Cost is visible in the final decision to lock it away, foreclosing study. Pressure coherence holds under the causal lens. Slight gap: Chen's resistance dissolves quickly once Mara asserts duty, reducing the friction at the pivotal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—finding the vanished prisoners and understanding his father's truth—is signaled early but never tightens into a forcing choice. The Warden's deadline ("before they find the bodies") creates no tactical pressure; Matthias explores at leisure, and the searchers arrive off-stage without altering his options. The final "decision" to stay is declared without a visible cost, live option foreclosed, or on-page consequence that tests his commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—releasing Eleanora and ending the family debt—is signaled early and tightens when Eleanora names the cost: freely given forgiveness to complete the transmutation. One meaningful pressure point occurs when Marcus realizes the bead is the alchemical vessel, reweighting his inheritance as a key rather than a curse. The final act (planting the bead, speaking forgiveness) is protagonist-driven and forecloses the debt cycle with on-page consequence (dawn, Eleanora's release). However, no competing want or fear complicates Marcus's assent—he agrees immediately once instructed, which lowers escalation tension. The price paid (the bead, the debt) is legible but feels predetermined rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—transforming the labyrinth from ruin to reverence—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through nightly iteration and the gradual correspondence with the storybook map, culminating in the completed circuit. Yet the weaver faces no meaningful opposition, resource scarcity, or internal conflict; each night's work succeeds without friction. The resolution is inevitable rather than earned through agency under duress. Coincidence (her sleeping paths matching the idealized map "eerily") shapes outcome without dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—restoring connection between past and present—is signaled early but remains abstract. Miriam's weeks of wandering and clearing generate no on-page resistance, reversal, or competing pressure. The ending declares completion without a visible tradeoff or foreclosed option. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is required; here the work progresses in summary without a turn that narrows her choices or imposes felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—whether to mail the letter and reclaim her true name—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening: Iris checks the chalk codes, cross-references her clipboard, confirms safety, yet still hesitates, narrowing the moment to pure internal cost. The resolution is earned by her accumulated memory (daughter's childhood rituals, her own fifteen-year exile) and the chalk code "trust your heart." Agency is decision with visible cost: "Everything could still be taken back" makes the foreclosed path explicit. No antagonist is present; pressure is situational and internal, which fits the lens. Entering 8.0+ typically requires a trade-off that forecloses a live option with felt price—here the price is legible but the escalation is modest (one check-and-release beat).

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: prevent conspirators from rewriting astronomical history by warning the right person before the coup. The eternal flame's morning flicker provides one meaningful tightening (confirming "today"), and the supply trucks' arrival escalates urgency. Yet Mirelle faces no tactical dilemma or visible tradeoff—she completes her embroidery, walks to the library, and knocks. No option is foreclosed with on-page cost; her prayer of uncertainty feels like atmospheric humility rather than earned doubt from a tested choice. Vas's approach creates momentary tension but dissolves without consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—finding peace with unspoken words—is signaled early and remains coherent. The piece tightens once when the woman closes her eyes and "remembers" the moment, a shift in understanding rather than a narrowing of options. The woman's agency is limited to symbolic gesture (pressing the shard to her chest), and no visible trade-off or foreclosed path appears on the page; the resolution feels granted rather than earned through a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—whether to pursue dangerous truth or maintain survival silence—is signaled early and tightens when Maricel decrypts the message. Accumulative pressure: the child's encrypted warning + recognition of the teacher's sacrifice + understanding that "truth was dangerous here" narrows options to a binary with visible cost. The resolution ("Tomorrow, when she woke, she would go") is protagonist-driven renunciation of safety, earned by her translator's ethos and three weeks of prior witness. One meaningful deepening (coral's channels = hidden truth) sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake: rediscovering authentic joy to create a meaningful central-square mural. Pressure tightens when Mara notices the ancient artist "hadn't painted the dancer's joy directly" but captured light and negative space, forcing a method shift. Agency is clear: she paints patterns of light rather than a figure, a decision that narrows options and commits her to a new aesthetic. The cost is legible—abandoning performative happiness and embracing fog itself—though the escalation is more conceptual than urgently physical.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: epistemological—to know versus to question, certainty versus curiosity. One meaningful tightening when Lena taps the wall and discovers the hollow, then escalates by removing plaster and confronting the nested images. Her final choice (clean rather than report/seal) is protagonist-driven and forecloses the institutional path with visible professional cost. The garden's reflected voice complicates but does not resolve; Lena's brush-touch decision closes the sequence. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens through discoveries that reweight her relationship to the work.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake (evading thought taxation through dead languages) is signaled early and pressure coheres through the "sanctuary compromised" alert and convergence. Yet the escalation lacks a meaningful tightening or trade-off: seventeen members arrive without friction, and the final "begin" does not foreclose a live option or impose a visible price. No on-page cost—emotional, tactical, or relational—lands at closure. The piece reads as setup for resistance rather than a moment where resistance incurs a legible consequence, capping Q4 below 6.0.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—sustaining her vigil to transform suffering into beauty—is signaled early and coherent. However, no on-page reversal, tightening choice, or live friction tests her commitment; she writes, reads aloud, and begins again without a forfeited path or visible cost. The postcard and wind arrive as observations, not obstacles. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is required; here the final beat restates the established pattern with no reweighting of options or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether to repair or preserve the chime's broken voice—emerges clearly in the middle and drives the ending choice. The tightening is modest: Miren pauses, listens, hesitates, then decides. No external pressure tests her decision; the conflict is entirely internal contemplation of preservation versus transformation. Under the Accumulative lens this works, but the lack of a competing force or visible price (institutional consequences, personal sacrifice beyond sentiment) keeps the escalation in the mid-band. The foxglove regret moment deepens emotional texture but doesn't narrow options with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: restore trust before permanent separation. The timeframe ("within the hour," "tomorrow we each leave") tightens urgency. One clear escalation: Mira moves from silent cowardice to public confession via a mechanism that will expose any lie, raising the cost of the attempt. Marcus's spoken validation tests the Varesh script's truth-structure in real time, and his acceptance ("paths can remain connected") forecloses the easier option of permanent estrangement. The rival Chen and the data fabrication provide external pressure but remain off-page; the on-page conflict centers on relational repair, which lands with visible if quiet cost.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—save villages or preserve irreplaceable frescoes—is signaled early and clear. Mira's agency drives the resolution: she redesigns the system to harmonize both. However, the escalation reads more as procedural summary than pressure-driven tightening. The letter's tampering adds backstory context but does not create an on-page reversal or force a trade-off; Mira arrives with the answer already forming. The cost of her solution (requiring collaboration, political uncertainty) is conceptual and told rather than felt on the page—no moment where she must forfeit a concrete option or face immediate resistance. One meaningful deepening occurs when she sees the redesign possibility, but it lacks the friction or visible price that would lift stakes into higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Clara will stay or flee this reinvention—is signaled early and tightens through her reflection on Marcus's dinner invitations and the instinct to flee. The decision to place the meteorite as an anchor and continue cataloging is a meaningful turn driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible: staying forecloses the flight option and requires her to "trust herself to write" an honest history. One deepening (from impulse to flee → anchoring and staying) is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding why her father vanished and what "necessary distances" mean—is signaled early and deepens when Mara realizes he was measuring rather than lost. The piece offers one meaningful tightening: her realization that "sacred thresholds aren't about the crossing" but about standing at the edge. However, escalation operates primarily through reflection rather than on-page choice under rising pressure. The cost is conceptual (accepting her father as "distributed" rather than retrievable) but not viscerally tested through a live fork or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding the city's pattern before shutdown—is clear and urgent. The discovery of gravitational-wave anticipation and then living residents provides two escalating turns that narrow Senna's options from academic study to participatory immersion. The "until sunrise" clock tightens pressure. However, the final decision to descend is prepared but not executed on the page; the cost (leaving behind documentation, risking transformation like the predecessor) is strongly implied but not yet paid in visible consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—discovering why some paths disappear—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening occurs when Marina drops the vials and sees unmade choices dissolve, reweighting her conjecture. However, the escalation lacks a live trade-off: she collects the answer without sacrifice, and the returning tide functions as scenery rather than a pressure that forces a choice between staying to learn more and leaving with incomplete knowledge. Agency is observational; she witnesses and records but does not face a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: Mara's need to engineer magic versus allowing genuine surprise. One meaningful tightening occurs when Rebecca's unexpected checkmate exposes Mara's vulnerability ("You're good at reading people, terrible at protecting yourself"), forcing her to reconsider her control method. The job offer raises stakes by offering what she does professionally but requiring she surrender her solo orchestration. Agency is present—Mara's choice to reset the board and say "Tell me more" forecloses her purely calculated approach. The cost is visible: accepting help means admitting her method has limits.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake: to embody forbidden memory through dance and "pen a cosmic verse." The moonstone discovery (paragraph five) provides a tightening—Kaleth recognizes it as "the key"—but the escalation is instant empowerment rather than narrowing options or forcing a trade-off. No on-page reversal; the dance succeeds without friction or visible cost paid during the act. The caretaker's arrival names the outcome but does not dramatize consequence or foreclose a path. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is sufficient, but here the middle lacks a complication that tests commitment or alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—Martin's search for meaning in his craft—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening occurs when the stone-throw and resulting rings crystallize his understanding, narrowing his future stance (he cannot return to unreflective work). However, the escalation operates almost entirely through internal realization rather than external opposition or a choice that forecloses a live option with visible cost. The absence of a tested decision or renunciation under pressure keeps the stakes more cerebral than visceral. Under the Accumulative lens the tightening is present but the price paid (returning to work "different") remains somewhat abstract rather than a dramatized trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—Marcus reconciling his firefighting obsession with his absence from his daughter—is signaled early and sustained. The decision to take leave and return the box constitutes one meaningful tightening (a renunciation with felt cost). However, the escalation is entirely internal and retrospective; no on-page obstacle or reversal complicates his choice. The Riverside incident and marriage collapse are recounted, not dramatized, so the pressure remains abstract. The final act (descending with the box, planning to give it back) is a stance crystallization rather than a live conflict turn, fitting an accumulative/reflective lens but offering minimal agency under immediate duress.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—reconciling timeline divergence through equation work—is signaled early and maintained. Pressure accumulates through parallel selves converging and the gauge's needle spinning, but the escalation is atmospheric rather than driven by protagonist agency facing a dilemma. The synchronization moment (all three Miras placing amber glass simultaneously) deepens the pattern but does not narrow options or force a trade-off. The resolution (timelines collapse into one) arrives as inevitable discovery rather than a choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is clear: understanding what walls dream about. The film negative discovery is a meaningful turn that deepens her knowledge, but no option is narrowed—Maya simply gains confirmation and continues the work. No visible cost: she doesn't sacrifice safety, resources, or a competing path. The accumulative lens tolerates this, but escalation reads as information gain without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is clear: persuade mirrors to show possibilities before full morning arrives. Pressure accumulates through the bell timeframe and the spreading lullaby, with one meaningful tightening when the first bell tolls and Vesper paints faster. Agency is present in her method (coded song, mirage brushstrokes) but the escalation is environmental (bells tolling, daylight approaching) rather than driven by protagonist choice that narrows live options. The resolution—mirages disperse, children sing—lands with conceptual cost (the city's imagination must now shift) but no visible personal price or trade-off that Vesper enacts on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—ending the cycle of names—is signaled early and tested when talks collapse twice. The ritual's gravity provides the tightening mechanism: each reading increases cost, and retrieval of the clipboard after shouting matches narrows options back to naming the dead. The price is visible: commanders' voices crack, delegates weep, and the final treaty is "imperfect, compromised, vulnerable." One meaningful deepening: from abstract diplomacy to embodied loss to negotiation constrained by that loss. The "space between one violence and the next" makes the ongoing cost unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is Marcus's unexamined guilt versus his sentimental inheritance, braided with the monopoly he's built. The footprint discovery (yesterday's helicopter view) tightens pressure into the kneeling choice. The egg release is pure agency—decision that narrows all prior options, costing seven figures and board comprehension. The rain's arrival immediately reweights the manufactured drought. One escalation beat is sufficient at this length, and the cost is undeniable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.2)
    One dominant stake—breaking the palace's enchantment of enforced silence—is signaled early and pursued to completion. The story offers one meaningful tightening (the web must be untangled with precision or collapse inward), but the work proceeds without on-page complication or reversal. Celestine's agency drives the outcome, yet the resolution arrives through her skill rather than a forced trade-off or foreclosed path. The ending's cost ("guards arrived") is declared but not dramatized, leaving the stakes legible but the price abstract rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—Marcus's need to reverse his exploitative storytelling—is signaled early and tightens through the night's puppet work. The argument with his collaborator provides inciting pressure ("She'd accused him of using ethics as entertainment"), and his puppet exploration serves as a meaningful deepening that narrows his options from weaponized provocation to dimensional humanity. Agency is clear (he chooses to work differently), and the renunciation of his former method forecloses a path. The cost is conceptual and relational (losing the applause, accepting ambiguity) but could be more viscerally felt on the page to reach higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—honoring the last monarch migration through temporary witness—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when the monarchs arrive and cluster on her structure, validating her architectural philosophy in real time. The final image (touching the moth wing) forecloses the option of permanent monuments with visible emotional cost (knot easing). Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, this deepening is sufficient, though protagonist agency is more passive observation than active choice. No reversal or antagonistic pressure tests her commitment; the monarchs simply arrive and she crystallizes her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving forgotten names—is signaled early and tightens when Mira weaves the punched card into the rope, then narrows further when the rope illuminates and voices emerge. The escalation is primarily textural (density increase, pattern convergence) rather than decision-driven conflict, but the final act of casting bells and hanging them forecloses the prior silence with visible cost. Agency is present in the act of braiding and pouring bronze, though the path feels more inexorable than fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—discovering why paths choose walkers—is signaled early but remains abstract and never tested by a live on-page dilemma or reversal. She walks, finds the bunker as foreseen, reads dreams, and concludes with affirmed understanding; no escalation narrows her options or imposes a trade-off. The storm's approach is mentioned four times but never forces a tactical choice or time-constrained decision. Accumulative pressure would require density increase or pattern break that reweights the stake with cost; instead, the ending delivers declarative insight without visible sacrifice or path foreclosure.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—honoring the ancient astronomer's message—is clear and consistent. One meaningful tightening occurs when shadows reveal terrestrial coordinates, forcing a new tactical choice. However, the alignment and buried treatise arrive without opposition or cost; no resource is visibly spent, no alternate path foreclosed. The protagonist's agency is observational rather than decisional at closure: she witnesses the resonance and digs, but no on-page trade-off or renunciation charges the final image with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—Kale's vengeance versus Mira's teaching—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the cellular-memory reveal and music-box motif, but escalation is passive: Kale experiences visions rather than making choices that narrow options. The resolution (touching the box, requesting teaching) carries no visible cost; no path is foreclosed, no tactical shift earned by her agency. The brother's sacrifice is recounted exposition, not an on-page reversal that tests Kale's commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: retrieve the brother by repairing the sextant. One meaningful tightening occurs when Aria's hands tremble but she persists, narrowing the path to success. The synchronized breathing imposes a procedural constraint that raises difficulty. Agency is clear: Aria's craft decision and her opening the door at the correct moment drive the resolution. Cost is present but muted—"translucent at the edges" and the brother's need for her anchor are noted, yet the reunion feels nearly frictionless compared to seven years lost. A stronger visible forfeit or complication would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—bridging the generational rift and reclaiming craft wisdom—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when Marta finds the grandmother's stone, forcing a values choice. The reversal (Lena invites her, revealing she's been trying to learn alone) narrows options and raises relational cost. Agency is clear: Marta's choice to teach again forecloses the corporate path with on-page economic consequence ("No contracts, just the work"). Pressure coheres under the Causal lens; the breach's penalty clause creates concrete loss that the ending decision accepts rather than solves.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: understanding the inheritance and finding the cameo blank. Pressure accumulates through bewilderment → cataloging → breakthrough → discovery. One meaningful deepening occurs when Maya realizes "first and last page" are temporal, narrowing her search to the spiral center. However, the escalation is primarily cognitive; no external opposition or internal want-versus-fear friction sharpens the choice. The resolution (accepting the blank shell) is contemplative rather than a decision that forecloses options with immediate on-page cost. Entering 8.0+ typically requires a live trade-off; here the cost is deferred ("during her tenure").

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake (rescue the seventeen) is clear and announced early. The piece tightens once—Marin finds them transformed, then negotiates—but the escalation lacks agency-driven causality: Marin does not attempt a failed rescue tactic that then forces her to pivot to negotiation. The bookstore's pause and consideration reads as coincidental rather than a response to pressure Marin applied through prior moves. The cost of the resolution (the bookstore "makes space," the seventeen carry fragments of knowledge) is conceptual but not felt on the page; no visible sacrifice or foreclosed path is shown.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (holding contradictory memories, finding solace in Soren's absence) is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the emerald card's color shifts, the narrative threads, and the mirror variations, tightening Mira's understanding of the garden. The choice to "pull" a thread narrows options and the carousel restarting signals consequence. Cost is present (selecting a version of history, stepping into永久 drift) but the pull itself lacks on-page resistance or tradeoff dialogue in the moment—she decides and acts without visible friction at that beat, weakening immediacy of the price.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—making the impossible door cohere by rebraiding the rope—is signaled early and pursued methodically. One meaningful deepening occurs as Maren works: the room responds, time becomes "negotiable," and the building reconfigures. However, no live option is foreclosed with visible cost; she succeeds without trade-offs, errors, or tactical shifts. The work "required hours" but no stamina loss, tool failure, or discovered constraint alters her approach. The coincidence of her arrival "precisely three in the morning" when the door appears, and her unique adaptability, resolve the problem without protagonist-driven reversal or felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—finding relief from unbearable sound—is signaled early and tightens when Kael reaches the echo chamber stone and must "listen past" the alien frequencies to activate it. One meaningful deepening occurs when the stone's resonance finds harmonics with the cave itself, expanding the bloom of hush. The piece operates under an Accumulative lens, so escalation reads as density increase and pattern convergence rather than causal reversals. Cost is legible: the lantern's energy is consumed, and Kael endures solitary descent into distorted acoustics. The resolution arises from his action (placing palms on the stone, willing stillness), though the moment of success feels slightly too smooth—no failed attempt or visible trade-off sharpens the final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: rekindle the beacon by proving pattern over coincidence. The discovery that the prism's breakage is a map constitutes one meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. However, the path forward is revealed to Esme via retrocognitive vision rather than forced by a dilemma or trade-off, so agency tilts toward observation. The ending beat ("she descended... carrying the broken prism like a promise") describes intention rather than enacting a choice with visible cost. No live option is foreclosed; the journey ahead is framed as certain.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—archive integrity threatened by future-memories—is signaled early and tightens when Elden discovers recursion. Her agency is present in the examination and the final absorption choice, but the escalation feels more like conceptual unfolding than pressure forcing a trade-off; she doesn't visibly lose an alternative path on the page. The recursion discovery narrows interpretation but doesn't force a costly tactical pivot before the ending leap. One meaningful deepening is present, satisfying the length threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is legible early: Kael seeks relief from hopelessness after professional ruin. Pressure tightens when the woman hands him the knot, forcing embodied confrontation rather than intellectual distance. Agency is present: he chooses to spin, and his chant/motion alters his stance from "I just walk" to active participant. The tightening is meaningful—his hands act "without permission," collapsing internal resistance. Cost is visible in simultaneous crying and laughing, and the realization he won't recover his old identity. No reversals, but the single deepening suffices under Accumulative lens. Coincidence (the mosaic note) complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake: Mira's need for direct paternal presence versus Chen's tangential grief management. The cicada's introduction mid-conflict is a tightening choice that redirects pressure from accusation to shared mourning. Chen's agency is clear in the decision to reveal the object and its backstory, foreclosing his avoidance pattern. The resolution is earned through his acknowledgment of harm ("I know. That wasn't fair to you") and Mira's shift to requesting small, observed memories. Cost is visible in Chen's admission and the trade-off between his self-protection and his daughter's need. One meaningful turn under the Accumulative lens is present.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is Mira's need to breathe outside bunker logic, signaled early and sustained. The gravity inversion provides one meaningful tightening: vessels ascend, forcing immediate choice (chase the doll or let it go). The shattered silence-vessel of maternal sighs escalates cost by releasing the exact frequency she's been avoiding. Her final choice—stay in the sky, welcome herself—is driven by her own agency (catching the doll, understanding her collection's purpose) with visible relational cost (rejecting her mother's survival teachings).

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Elena's need to escape the hospital monitor's flatline and reclaim her daughter's memory—is signaled early and coherent throughout. Pressure accumulates via Marco's layered pedagogy (storm glass, motor reduction, light refraction, silence reframing) rather than a sharp reversal, fitting the accumulative lens. The tightening occurs when Elena names the flatline sound and Marco responds by slowing the gondola "until they were barely moving," narrowing her perceptual field to allow new input. Agency is Marco's, not Elena's; her shift to "possibility" is receptive rather than a choice that forecloses a path, and the cost—her willingness to return—reads more as hope than sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—finding the stairway—is signaled early and tightens through the sunrise deadline. The ruby flake moment narrows Kaida's options by revealing hidden engravings, creating one meaningful escalation. Agency is clear in her choice to descend. The sunrise activating orbital mirrors creates temporal pressure, but the resolution feels slightly frictionless once the palace "opens" for her; a visible cost or trade-off at the threshold would sharpen the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—learning to reclaim breath and set boundaries—is signaled early and coherent. The girl's arrival and Mara's teaching offer one meaningful deepening (from declaration to the handclasp and sealing threshold), but escalation is gentle: no reversal narrows options or forces a visible trade-off on the page. The girl's acceptance is smooth rather than contested; Mara's role as guide encounters no resistance. Cost is asserted ("bridges burned," "suffocating became breathing") but not dramatized as a forfeiture or tactical shift within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake: seal the breach and translate pressure into transformation. The volunteer text and breach discovery provide one tightening. Yet Mira's agency is mostly reactive—messages arrive, the bolt materializes, the breach reveals itself. The sealing moment asserts success without on-page friction or cost: "impossible was just another word" bypasses struggle. The diamonds emerge as reward, not trade-off. No live option is foreclosed; she simply pockets the prize and moves forward.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the complete truth—is signaled early and drives the sequence. Cassian's discovery that the original sin predates his testimony is a meaningful deepening that changes his knowledge and reweights the scope of reparations. However, escalation is knowledge-based rather than forced by agency under pressure; he winds the crank, listens, and concludes without a competing pull or trade-off. The resolution is stated as future intent ("Tomorrow, he would bring this to the tribal council") rather than an on-page choice that narrows options now. The cost is conceptual—carrying heavier guilt, ensuring the dynasty stays ended—but not dramatized as a present-tense forfeiture or stance that forecloses a live alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake (whether to complete the oath and accept visible strings) is signaled early and persists. One meaningful tightening: discovering the program forces the knight to confront the strings he fled. Escalation reads as accumulative deepening—reality shifts intensify, trees form stage, strings attach—but the final choice (dancing with eyes open) lacks a sharp tradeoff or visible price beyond metaphoric armor removal. Under the Accumulative lens the pressure coheres, but agency at closure feels more realization than decision that forecloses a live path with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether unknown histories can be recovered and honored—is signaled early and tightens through the discovery sequence. The filing clerk's arbitrary decision (S vs. P) is a clear constraint that Miriam's cross-referencing choice forecloses, with visible cost: she cannot reunite the living but can prevent future erasure. One meaningful tightening (the adoption record reveals Isaiah lived, yet Samuel never found him) narrows options and forces the archival stance. The price is legible: her personal brokenness persists while she tends others' hopes.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—documenting erased histories to crack consensus reality—is signaled early and sustained. The searchlight intrusion provides one meaningful tightening that forces tactical retreat and forecloses the northern checkpoint plan. Agency is present in Mira's choice to photograph and distribute, but the escalation feels more circumstantial than protagonist-driven; the searchlight arrives rather than being triggered by her prior moves. Cost is legible in the need to vanish more thoroughly, though the price feels operational rather than deeply personal.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake (silencing a prophecy to prevent family ruin) is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when Marcus shifts from playing melody to "the careful architecture of quiet," narrowing his tactical options under the accumulative lens. The cost is somewhat abstract—"the letter in his pocket felt lighter"—but the image of silence "like a song" reweights the opening tension. Agency reads as attention and endurance rather than decision against opposition, which fits the textural mode but limits escalation impact.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—decoding the message—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through observation and the moonstone discovery, but escalation under the Accumulative lens requires a tightening or cadence shift that narrows options. Instead, each discovery grants new ability (sensing seeds, tracing threads) without friction. The ending reaches toward reconciliation but offers no visible trade-off or foreclosed path. One meaningful deepening (moonstone dissolves, grants new perception) is present but the cost remains conceptual and unfelt.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—learning "the pattern beneath randomness"—is signaled early and tightens when the compass points to the greenhouse, forcing Marcus to act. However, the escalation is passive: coincidence delivers the pieces, and the admiral's completed work provides the answer rather than Marcus forging it through choices under pressure. One meaningful tightening occurs (following the compass), but the cost at closure (abandoning precision-based repair) is conceptual rather than viscerally felt with visible tradeoffs on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding and redeeming the weight of names—is signaled early and tightens through the kintsugi act. The turn occurs when Mara moves from solitary work to delivery, foreclosing her own grief-as-vigil and forcing the magistrate to accept loss. Cost is legible: seventeen years of suspended hope end, and Mara's sister's death casts a shadow over the act. Agency is clear in Mara's decision to speak the name and walk through rain. The pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens without requiring multiple reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: transform collection into genuine healing, signaled early through guild heresy. One meaningful tightening occurs when Kael shifts from listening to playing the absurdity, narrowing the shade's options from endless loop to release. The shade's agency drives his own closure, but Kael's tactics (finding the frosting detail, laughing through the harp) enable it. The resolution lacks a trade-off or visible price for Kael—she descends to the next soul without tactical or emotional cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—finding peace versus remaining trapped in compulsive calculation—is signaled early and tightens when Sera asks "why am I still calculating?" The old man's presence and the forest's design create pressure that forces her choice. One clear turn: laying down the mask strap beside his. Agency is visible in "Teach me" and the decision to plant. The cost is somewhat muted; the "terrifying possibility" language tells more than it shows, and the physical act of beginning to plant feels like a threshold rather than a completed sacrifice with full weight.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—honoring overlooked histories before they vanish—is signaled early and tightens when Mira receives the lens fragment, revealing hidden portraits and narrowing her method. The escalation is primarily Accumulative: density of discovered faces and the vendor's instruction reshape Mira's documentary work into a public exhibition. Agency is present (purchase, documentation, exhibition) but much of the transformation happens in summary ("She began to document them…"), reducing the felt immediacy of the escalation. One visible cost exists: Mira returns alone, no longer a child, and the exhibition is her renunciation of passivity, though the price of that stance is more implied than enacted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: Marcus's drive to discover what ceilings hide, primed by his daughter's question and the ghost's urgency. The ghost's increasing agitation narrows his options—he investigates before assessing the elevator. One meaningful tightening occurs when he finds the mainspring and reads the inscription, which reweights his task from mere repair assessment to a promise with relational cost (reuniting object and carousel). Agency is decision and endurance: he commits to the search and the vow. Cost is visible in his acceptance of the burden and the ghost's release, though the price feels modest—no trade-off or foreclosed path beyond his time and effort.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Marina's choice between repetitive safety and risky aliveness—is signaled early and tightens when the operator disrupts the pattern. The bottled whisper crystallizes the cost of her three-hundred-morning loop, and the library's rotation forces her agency (grabbing the branch, reaching for the book). One clear deepening occurs; the final act is protagonist-driven under the Accumulative lens. However, the escalation feels somewhat externally imposed (the operator arrives and acts; Marina reacts more than she drives the pressure herself), and the visible price at closure could be sharper—she reaches for a book, but what specific path does this foreclose?

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (proving the builders memorialized loss vs. Vhen's merchant theory) signals early and tightens when Kasimir photographs sixteen angles, making his counter-argument material. The escalation is accumulative: grandmother's superstition → covering mirrors reinterpreted → baroque excess as "emotional archaeology" → final recognition that "making broken things beautiful" requires "enormous effort." Agency is decision and attention that forecloses his prior revolutionary stance with visible cost: his fervor now serves "patient work" rather than mass mobilization. The price—obsolescence, failed revolution as cautionary tale—charges each turn.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—restore the box without spreading corruption—is signaled early and tightens when Aldric realizes simple removal would fail. The problem escalates through his agency: discovery of philosopher's stone → recognition of covenant → choice to complete rather than extract. One meaningful reversal (can't remove, must transmute) narrows options under causal pressure. Visible cost is present but modest: the transformation requires specialized knowledge and the resonance chamber's unique properties. The "balance restored" phrasing in the final movement slightly abstracts what should remain concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—Mara's drive to capture mystery and decide whether to follow Henrik—is signaled early and tightens when she finds the lagoon. One meaningful deepening occurs when the psychometry reading reveals Henrik chose immersion deliberately, not accident, reweighting her options. Her agency is renunciation: she leaves the compass and steps beyond measurement, foreclosing return. The cost is conceptual and felt in the final image ("something the surface world had no name for"), though a sharper physical or relational price would elevate pressure. Escalation is driven by her choices under the Accumulative lens, satisfying that mode's deepening requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: reimagining her sculptural method to reveal rather than reduce complexity. One meaningful tightening when the slide's layered inscriptions challenge her reductive approach, forcing the conceptual pivot to transparency. The storm and impassable road create situational pressure, though consequences remain primarily internal. Agency is decision-based (venturing back into rain, hauling the root-ball, ignoring GPS) with conceptual cost visible in the final refusal. Under the Accumulative lens, the deepening suffices, but the lack of a second on-page constraint or sacrifice keeps this from higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—understanding why certain flowers bloom at night—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens through the postcard examination and Father Benedict's lens metaphor. One meaningful deepening occurs when the grandmother's note reframes the question from defiance to identity, narrowing Mara's conceptual options and enabling the final mural vision. The tightening forecloses her prior artistic approach with on-page conceptual cost (she must abandon months of stalled work). Agency is decision-based (gathering postcards "with new purpose"), though the protagonist's alteration feels more received-wisdom than hard-won struggle, capping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—bearing witness to mass atrocity—is signaled early and tightens when Malik finds Sarai and learns the cost of witnessing. The parley (one to tell, one to hold) narrows options with visible price. However, the escalation is too smooth: Malik's trembling hands and "Show me" arrive without meaningful resistance, internal conflict, or tactical adjustment. The lagoon's waters "finally moved" only when the protagonist asked, suggesting convenience rather than earned pressure. One meaningful tightening is present but the cost feels conceptual and thematic rather than viscerally dramatized through prior struggle or foreclosed paths.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: reimagining the ghost town without extractive magic. Pressure accumulates through nightly work with the bottle, each session revealing more. The turn arrives when Miranda realizes the bottle is a mirror, not a container to force open—this reweights her methodology and enables spring's arrival. Agency is clear (she conceives, others follow). Cost is present but understated: no live option is dramatized and foreclosed; we infer she's rejected easier paths (opening the bottle, using guild potions) but don't see a moment of temptation tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—Marcus's unclear role in choosing "which voice the city remembers"—is declared in prophecy but never tested through competing options or visible tradeoffs. The story presents two moments of reception (vial as child, ledger as adult) without escalation or tightening between them. The twenty-year preparation is summarized in one sentence, eliding the pressure that would force a difficult choice. No meaningful reversal or cost legibility at closure; acceptance of the ledger feels inevitable rather than earned through renunciation or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—restore the seeds' potential by reversing entropy decrease—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mara steps into the spiral and releases borrowed time, narrowing her options (she spends the inheritance, foreclosing its future use). The cost is conceptual and stated rather than felt in bodily terms: "borrowed time must always be returned." Under the Accumulative lens, pressure accumulates through layered abstractions and the final act reweights the stake. Minor issue: the solution (using grandmother's vortex) is explained to the reader rather than discovered through trial or tactical adjustment under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (valley safety vs. board approval of automated systems) is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: rope vibration → instruments lag → manual override → storm validates her judgment. Agency is decision (she "made the switch") with visible cost (cracked buttresses, board scrutiny deferred but present). The convergence event escalates from sensor failure to horizontal tornado threat, and Mara's sustained ringing through the assault forecloses the path of passive compliance. No coincidental resolution; her earned expertise drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—Kael's commitment to witnessing rather than capturing—is established early but never tested. No reversal, complication, or choice narrows her options; she simply continues her seven-year practice. The meteor shower is brighter than usual, yet this external escalation doesn't force any internal tightening or trade-off. Agency is present (she chooses to log, clean, light the lantern, add the unsanctioned note) but these are affirmations of an existing stance, not decisions under pressure. The story offers deepening texture but not escalation under the Accumulative lens; one meaningful pressure point is missing.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—breaking the cycle of silenced words that trap the spirits—is clear and signaled early. Pressure tightens when Mara finds the letter, understands the covenant's poison, and chooses to read it aloud despite the taboo. The reversal is modest: the spirits' release hinges on Mara's act of witnessing, but no complication arises; the outcome is frictionless. The cost is conceptual (Mara's new burden as keeper of silenced truths) but not viscerally tested on the page. Agency is present but the escalation is linear without a meaningful obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving and transmitting pre-Shift temporal understanding—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure remains steady rather than escalating sharply; the visitor's request, the coded listing, and the group's arrival form a sequence but not a tightening that narrows options. The piece deepens through Mira's articulation at the end, yet no on-page reversal forces a trade-off or forecloses a live alternative. Cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt: the visitors depart "carrying a fragment," but we don't see what they relinquish or risk in exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—discovering beauty in incompleteness—is signaled early and tightens when the boy's grief tests Maren's abstract poetic insight against lived loss. The kite-string snap provides a clear micro-reversal that introduces human cost. Maren's agency is primarily attention and witness; she chooses to "tend" rather than fix, which forecloses comfort and accepts the broken notes. The cost is conceptual (abandoning her months-long pursuit of harmonized resolution) but legible in the final journal entry. One meaningful deepening is present, though escalation relies more on thematic reweighting than tactical narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—completing the architectural network before death—is signaled early and remains coherent throughout. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure tightens through a meaningful deepening: discovering the diary's revelation that the temple is a translation device reweights the task from caretaking to fostering interspecies dialogue. Escalation occurs through density increase (seventeen oak branches, hidden channels, fungi transplantation) and a cadence shift in the final week when transformation becomes visible. The cost is legible: Maren spends her remaining months systematically working and dies having completed the network. Agency is present through systematic choices, though coincidence (the diary discovery) initiates rather than resolves. One reservation: the choices feel inevitable rather than forced through competing pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding homecoming's chemistry through artificial pilgrimage—is signaled early and tightens through Elara's confession: "I've started to feel it." One meaningful deepening occurs when her clinical experiment transforms into genuine emotional experience, narrowing her academic distance. The alien's final agreement to walk alongside her reweights the experiment's stakes from observation to participatory communion. Cost is legible in her identity shift from skeptic to pilgrim, though the alien applies pressure primarily through dialogue rather than independent opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming the jetty as garden—is signaled early and sustained. Yet pressure never escalates; the coachman encounters no resistance, no miscommunication from the birds, no physical difficulty with the planting. He works "through twilight into near-darkness" but no cost or trade-off emerges on the page. The escalation test fails under the Accumulative lens: density increases but never tightens options or forces a renunciation. The "work of reclamation" begins off-page in future spring; present action is preparation without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: decoding the cylinder to find resources and restore connection. The discovery of the bunker (Mercy's nose catches "something old and urgent") is a solid reversal that narrows Calder's options to the riddle. The woman's voice explaining that "the riddle isn't in the words, but in the listening" and the rhythm-between-words encoding deepens the challenge with a meaningful tightening. Calder's seven plays and decoding six locations demonstrate agency under pressure. The settlement's collective movement at dawn closes with visible cost (ending their solitary isolation), though the transition from Calder's solitary decode to mass organization is compressed and the on-page friction or resistance is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Maya's isolation and her project of mapping temporal currents. However, no on-page tightening narrows her options or forces a trade-off—she moves through zones, observes phenomena, and prepares to sketch as she has done before. The approaching anniversary is a ritual repetition, not a pressure point. Agency is present (she chooses to remain, to draw) but does not foreclose a path with visible cost; the claim "she could never truly leave" is told rather than tested. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is expected; the piece offers thematic restatement instead.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—amending broken trust and redefining Kael's relationship to secrets—is signaled early and coheres throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when the guardian names what he broke and offers the sundial lid, reframing his mission from collection to circulation. Agency is present: Kael chooses to return, confess, and accept the role of wonder-giver. Cost is conceptual (foreclosing the collector identity) but the escalation is smooth rather than abrupt; no on-page reversal forces a visible tradeoff between competing goods. The descent image charges the ending, yet the pressure remains thematic rather than situational.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: to preserve "small things" as true history against official narratives. The interregnum provides situational pressure, and Mira's ritual intensifies when she finds the archivist. However, no on-page reversal or tightening forces a trade-off—she simply gains an ally who agrees with her mission. The crisis-actor irony is set up but never tested; no one challenges her testimony on the page. The accumulative lens allows for deepening through partnership, but the absence of friction or visible cost (she loses nothing, risks nothing in the encounter) keeps escalation modest.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding the shape of home versus remaining hidden—is signaled early and tightens through the stone's warming pressure. One meaningful deepening occurs when she chooses not to resist the vision, letting "both exist simultaneously," which narrows her options from evasion to acceptance. The cost is legible in the pain of remembering and the stone embedding itself permanently, though the escalation relies more on internal declaration ("she made her choice") than on a fraught decision between competing goods. The final reconfiguration (bookstore as home rather than hiding place) feels earned by the pattern of suppression established early.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—Petrov seeking escape from shame—is signaled early and tightens when he decodes "FORGIVE" and realizes he was invited to understand. However, the escalation is conceptual rather than tactical; no live option is foreclosed, no price paid on the page. The duchess memory provides context but does not create a present-tense reversal or choice under pressure. The ending reconfigures meaning but lacks a visible cost that alters his options moving forward.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara can earn forgiveness through her refracted truth rather than simple confession—is signaled early and sustained. The elder's arrival provides a clear pressure point that narrows her options, and his ultimatum forces the climb. The cost is visible in her need to choose between surrendering her art or embracing it, though the final moment's ambiguity ("Perhaps that was answer enough") slightly softens what could have been a sharper trade-off. The impromptu poetry sessions escalate her defiance but feel more thematic than tactically risky.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—decoding the statue to transmute the acid sea—is signaled early and tightens when oxygen debt mounts. The 45th pockmark alignment provides a meaningful reversal that narrows Maya's task to patient, generational mapping with visible cost (repeated dangerous dives). Agency is clear: her choice to return despite depleted lungs forecloses retreat. However, the golden-light reveal solves the riddle quickly, and the mechanics of how "intentions" transmute the sea remain abstract, which softens the tangible price of each future dive.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is clear: fulfill the decades-old promise to paint something that matters before forgetting why she started. The mirror-cracking initiates pressure; the wrong turn and cave discovery tighten options by offering material that "resisted representation." The shell-fragmentation solution provides one meaningful turn—from trying to capture wholeness to embracing brokenness. Escalation operates through accumulation (decades of avoidance, the cave's resistance, the intuitive leap to shells) rather than causal reversals. The distributed shells enact a visible choice with cost (no audience, tidal erasure, leaving the easel), but the resolution feels more like acceptance than a trade-off with urgent consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—proving whispers over shouts—is signaled early and sustained. One tightening occurs when the fishing vessel drifts toward rocks, but the resolution lacks genuine escalation: Thomas reaches for the horn, Mira says "Wait," and the captain corrects course with "unhurried precision." No reversal, no cost, no forced trade-off. The captain's compliance feels convenient rather than earned by Mira's agency. Under the accumulative lens, pressure should deepen or reweigh options; here it simply validates Mira's premise without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding why the migration occurs—is signaled early and tightens through Mara's assembly work and midnight conversations. The reversal when patina reveals duration rather than direction narrows her interpretive frame and enables the final insight. The device functions as protagonist-driven escalation, each component choice building pressure toward the dawn realization. Cost is legible: Mara accepts solitude and the "different kind of weight" to serve future returnees, foreclosing the option to follow her family.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: rebuilding human connection after the empathy virus. Mira's opening avoidance of "psychological minefield" sets the problem, and her final choice to host gatherings provides one tightening. However, the decision itself ("I'll make a deal") lacks visible cost or on-page resistance; it's presented as insight rather than a trade-off that forecloses a safer path. Coincidence doesn't resolve, but summarized reconciliations (Henrik's arc) undercut escalation. Pressure is legible but the felt cost at the peak choice is thin.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: decode the stranger's final gesture and honor the old woman's unfinished story. The key discovery and coordinates provide one meaningful tightening, narrowing Magnus's next move. However, Magnus faces no opposition or competing pressure; the police dismiss it, and he encounters no cost in pursuing the investigation. The closure choice—to continue the search tomorrow—defers consequence rather than landing it on the page. The story accumulates clues without a turn that forces Magnus to trade or forfeit something live.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—finding the "doorway of decisions" to escape settled loneliness—is signaled early and drives Martin's entry, examination, and ant-following. The insertion of the chip narrows options: he sees possible lives, must choose whether to act, and the visions force a trade-off between continued solitude and uncertain change. The cost is legible when he removes the chip and turns toward the exit, committing to "the choosing" with the rain erasing old paths. One meaningful tightening occurs when the ants lead him to the incomplete map and the chip clicks into place. However, the escalation is more revelation than pressure—Martin faces no obstacle, only understanding—and the final paragraph's list of possible actions ("perhaps... or... or...") diffuses the price rather than crystallizing it.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—why the dreams claw at her sleep, what the grotto offers—is signaled early and coheres. Pressure accumulates through escalating self-confrontation (father's face, poisoning, calcified heart) until the grotto's pronouncement forces a stance shift. However, the queen's agency at closure is primarily receptive (witnessing, understanding) rather than a decision or renunciation that forecloses a live path with on-page cost; the descent is framed as potential healing, not a trade-off or visible price paid in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—proving light can be testimony rather than commodity—is signaled early and sustained. The piece deepens through Solène's demonstration to Mira, but escalation is conceptual (explaining her revaluation) rather than a live choice under pressure. The sphere-gift in the final beat offers a stance crystallization (accepting heresy risk), yet no on-page event forces the decision; she was always going to complete this work. Under Accumulative lens, the tightening is present but mild—thematic intensification without a trade-off that narrows options. Cost is legible in future consequences but not dramatized as a present forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake: Can Maren impose narrative order on her own fractured timeline, as she does for clients? One meaningful deepening occurs when she names "feral nostalgia" and recognizes she's jealous of, not merely missing, her past self—narrowing her emotional options from nostalgia to predatory envy. The scroll-keeping becomes endurance with cost: she writes knowing the grave awaits, foreclosing hope of escape. Agency is renunciation—she continues despite futility. The final image reweights the stake: "stories could be rewritten until the ink ran dry" charges her persistence with both defiance and exhaustion. No explicit antagonist; pressure accumulates through internal recursion and the inescapable gravesite fact.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Mrs. Kapoor's need for permission to feel joy—is signaled early and tightens when Elena identifies the crack and interprets the screw's meaning. However, the escalation hinges on Elena's diagnosis rather than a choice under pressure that narrows her own options. The tightening is conceptual and interpretive; there is no live trade-off or visible price paid by the protagonist in the moment. The resolution lands through Elena's articulated insight, not through a decision that forecloses a path with on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (transform scars into stories) is signaled early and tested immediately when her hands crystallize. The tightening—must regain control before she can perform the ceremony—forecloses the passive option and forces micro-choices (knock, whisper, trace). Each rune inscribed narrows her relationship to trauma, and the final walk toward home with "steady, warm" hands confirms the trade-off: scars remain but no longer ache. Agency is decision and endurance; the cost (facing each memory) is visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (deliver overdue apology, release the ghost) is signaled early and tightens through the induced-current escalation: papers scatter, vortex forms, bottle opens. Margot's agency—typing the deletion, writing the truth—drives the turn with visible cost (public admission of cruelty, professional pivot). The orchard's pending destruction adds external pressure and forecloses delay. The "frozen river" metaphor narrows Vivienne's anger into understanding, and the final blossoms embody earned forgiveness. One credible tightening and a clear price meet the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—witnessing the universe's final moment without flinching—is signaled early and recurs at the Hiccup. Pressure accumulates through imagery and proximity to the event, but escalation is textural rather than decision-driven: Kael walks, opens the dictionary, walks the spiral, and the Hiccup arrives without her agency forcing a reversal or trade-off. The "spiral arbitration" method is invoked as backstory (ancients resolving conflicts) but Kael faces no on-page conflict to arbitrate, and her transformation into "part of the spiral" carries no dramatized cost—no path is visibly foreclosed, no price paid in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake signaled early: Maren must understand what clocks truly measure after discovering the three-second discrepancy. The countdown sequence (60 to zero) provides escalation under the Accumulative lens, with water defying gravity and the horizon curving differently. Agency is clear—she decides to turn the key and persists despite bleeding fingers. The resolution narrows options with visible cost: she becomes keeper of a secret, must "hold the world's edge steady," and knows the measurements are negotiated fictions. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—how to reconcile love for her father with the destruction he caused—is signaled early and tightens through her library search and symbol interpretation. The mica lantern revelation narrows her options by reframing the symbols as questions rather than answers, forcing her to "widen her view" with visible cost (abandoning her certainty-seeking for acknowledged uncertainty). However, the escalation relies heavily on reflection rather than scene pressure; the tightening happens in her head after the discovery rather than through a sequence of attempts that fail and force adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (maintain cultivated estrangement vs. offer connection) is signaled early and tested in the callback. Sarah's protocol break is a protagonist-driven reversal with visible professional cost ("Her supervisor would terminate her"), and the man's choice to "call your son" narrows his options with emotional cost. The final phone ring adds a second tightening: Sarah converts policy into invitation, foreclosing her prior stance. One friction: the man's offscreen son-call is a resolution Sarah suggests but does not witness, slightly softening the on-page escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—whether the covenant can regenerate—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates gently: locket arrival → recognition → returnees appear. The tightening is one meaningful deepening (the act of preservation enabled return), but no on-page choice by Maren narrows her options or forces a trade-off. Returnees validate her work without testing her commitment. Cost at closure is conceptual (loneliness named) but not viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake (cure for loneliness) is signaled in paragraph two. The arrival of Emil and the other sixteen workers constitutes accumulation rather than a causal reversal—no option is foreclosed, no tactic altered by resistance. The combining of fragments is a non-event ("didn't merge or glow or do anything mystical"), and the shift to "permission to stop moving" is conceptual rather than a choice with on-page cost. Under an Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening or cadence shift is required; here the ending tells us they "chose, finally, to stay found" but summarizes future behavior ("they still disappeared… but they always returned") without a present-tense decision or visible price paid in the closure beat. Agency is asserted, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—navigating uncharted grief—is signaled early and pursued throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when the foreign melody reveals itself as the sister's tune, narrowing the emotional terrain. The protagonist's agency drives the search (following rods, recognizing the melody), and the final understanding forecloses the option of mapping around grief. However, the escalation relies more on revelatory accumulation than forced trade-offs; the platinum ring and melody guide Sera without visible cost paid in the approach, only conceptual acceptance at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—threshing meaning from celestial noise—is signaled in paragraph three and tightens when timestamps precede catalog dates, forcing Mara to choose between filtering or accepting the implications. The reversal is protagonist-driven: she stops fighting and begins cataloging changes, then moves to writing signals herself. Visible cost: she abandons her mentor's cautionary tale and her own "rigid certainty," committing to a reality where history is fluid. The escalation is causal and the final act (filling the pen, writing) forecloses her prior interpretive stance with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—Marina's desire to be heard/remembered in a world that erases her—is signaled early and coheres throughout. The tightening occurs when Theo reveals the program and the harbor crowd responds, narrowing Marina's isolation and validating her method. The final trade-off ("maybe they'll forget, but right now you exist louder than anyone") carries visible cost: she accepts impermanence as the price of presence. However, escalation is largely external (Theo's reveal, crowd reaction) rather than driven by Marina's agency; she remains reactive until the final parameter adjustment, which arrives too late to charge earlier pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—proving cross-cultural love transcends censorship—is signaled early and consistent. However, the entire cave sequence is unopposed: Mara photographs, weeps, and documents without friction, reversal, or a choice that forecloses a path. The escalation is told (she "had become a criminal for this") rather than dramatized on the page. The final walk toward judgment is declared but not enacted, so the cost remains abstract rather than visible.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether to resist or accept the entanglement—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when Marquez articulates the choice explicitly ("that moment between breaths when anything is possible"), followed by Theo's physical joining on the railing. However, pressure feels more contemplative than urgent; the conflict lacks a concrete external cost or obstacle that would force harder trade-offs. The resolution through synchronized drumming and hand-holding crystallizes their stance but doesn't foreclose a path with sharp, dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—proving Marcus's listening-over-shouting philosophy to gain inner circle admission—is signaled early through the zodiac coin challenge and escalates when the woman validates his approach. The storm provides external pressure that forces him to rely on his skills, and the keyhole moment narrows options (sound-rhythm vs. physical insertion). However, the resolution lacks genuine cost: Marcus doesn't forfeit anything or face a meaningful tradeoff. The woman's arrival as deus ex validatrix removes the need for him to discover the answer through error or sacrifice, weakening the earned quality of his success.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake (save the canals vs. protect job) signals early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Marina and the guardian collaborate, narrowing her options from solo testimony to silent co-conspiracy. However, the escalation is cooperative rather than against rising resistance, and the resolution unfolds without visible cost: no guild discovery, no sibling jeopardy dramatized on the page. The final "possibility of light" reads as hopeful assertion rather than a trade-off that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Danny's choice to quit or continue chess, reframed as autonomy versus conformity. The conversation with Miss Chen deepens this to a larger question (joining the rebellion), but the escalation is delivered through exposition rather than on-page pressure testing Danny's commitment. The grotto invitation and window-display plan are prospective; no reversals or tightening choices narrow Danny's options within the scene. The final queen move is a symbolic gesture, not a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. Agency is present in Miss Chen's organizing and Danny's stated intention, but the cost remains conceptual (the risk of questioning) rather than a felt trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—freedom from servitude versus obligation—is signaled early and tightens when the whale calls. The scrimshaw functions as a pressure object, and Kael's confession ("The water calls me, Mira") forces Mira's decision. However, escalation is largely emotional assertion rather than tactical narrowing: Mira's obligations are named but never dramatized as a live counter-pull that she must work against. The final choice feels like mutual permission rather than a trade-off with visible cost. One meaningful tightening is present, but cost clarity is weak.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—whether Marcus and Emma can reclaim genuine emotion after the mandate—is signaled early and tightens through Marcus's narration cracking and Emma's mask shifting. The escalation is driven by Marcus's agency (choosing to break performance, reaching for Emma's hand) under the Accumulative lens, and the cost is legible: years of suppressed grief, the fragility of relearning humanity. No coincidence resolves; the flowers and narration habit pay off the setup. The tightening is meaningful—moving from theatrical distance to silence—and forecloses the option of continued performance.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake is clear: reclaim cloud-shadow poetry after seven years of prohibition. One tightening occurs when Meris begins to compose and the colonnade amplifies, yet no on-page opposition or complication tests her choice. Kael's warning ("they'll try to ban it again") is deflected without visible cost. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure deepens via imagery and presence, but the escalation lacks a felt price that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—awakening Tomás and, by extension, the courtyard—is signaled early and pursued on the page, but pressure remains largely linear rather than escalating with reversals. Maya identifies the need, locates Tomás, negotiates the reed, paints, and succeeds without meaningful complication or risk of failure. The bartering transaction could have tested her values (e.g., Tomás refusing, or the reed proving insufficient) but instead proceeds smoothly. The phoenix's effect functions as premise-pressure rather than active opposition. The ending delivers collective awakening but the cost to Maya (effort, the reed she wanted) is conceptual rather than viscerally felt as a trade-off or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake signaled early: isolating and replicating the sonic fingerprint of intimacy. The piece accumulates pressure through Maren's two-year project and tonight's "most ambitious iteration," then tightens when the volunteer arrives—his hunger for community forces Maren's realization that sharing is the goal, not study. This single meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens is sufficient. Cost is visible (renunciation of pure research, two years of solitary work reweighted), though the final paragraph tells more than it shows. No antagonist required; coincidence (volunteer's arrival) complicates but does not resolve—Maren's stance shift does.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (recovery from grief through craft and mentorship) is signaled early and tightens once when Senna arrives unable to create. The brooch assignment creates meaningful pressure, and Senna's success deepens Mara's own healing by forcing her to trust transmission. The paper crane system introduces a visible cost at closure (sharing coordinates means relinquishing private refuge), though the escalation is gentle rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—decoding the grandmother's inheritance—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, escalation is more additive than pressurized: each circuit pattern Vesper identifies confirms rather than complicates the hypothesis, creating a string of small validations instead of a tightening choice. The collaborative offer at dawn arrives as reward without visible trade-off (does Vesper forfeit her cartomancy income, her solitary research methods?). Agency is present (Vesper chooses to help) but the decision doesn't foreclose a live path with on-page cost; the grandmother's cleverness does the structural work, leaving Vesper more witness than protagonist at the moment of closure.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether to absorb the forbidden archive and what it will cost—is signaled early and tightens through each crystal memory. Pressure accumulates via the Kaen's warning-as-wisdom structure: each absorption reveals both transcendence's allure and its unbearable price. The historian's agency is clear in her decision to return and teach, and the cost is legible: she now carries knowledge that creates hunger yet chooses to prevent others from following. One micro turn (the reveal that the archive is "warning disguised as wisdom") reweights her mission without feeling coincidental. The escalation is steady rather than sharp, fitting the Accumulative lens, and the final choice forecloses the path of personal transcendence with visible restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (preserve authentic hope vs. archive corruption) signals early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Sera compares footage and realizes shared dreams are "killing" hope—this narrows options and drives the copying decision. The escalation is cognitive rather than external, fitting the Accumulative lens. Visible cost is modest: Sera will distribute harder, less comforting dreams, but the on-page price (professional risk, community friction) remains implied rather than dramatized in a confrontation or refusal.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.7)
    The dominant stake—rebuilding credibility while maintaining integrity—is signaled early and tightens through Elena's reflection on what she witnessed versus what she fabricated. Agency is clear: she chooses to strip false data, reframe as qualitative, and submit to alternative journals, foreclosing the mainstream academic path. The pressure is driven by her own agency (her prior choice to fabricate, her present choice to confess), not external coincidence. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes "self-respect...required she admit her methodology was flawed," which narrows her options to honest reconstruction with visible professional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake signaled early: learning Sarah's fate through plant telepathy. One meaningful tightening: the gap in coffee-ring patterns leads to the table's memory of Dr. Venn dragging Sarah, narrowing options from closure to justice. Agency is decision and endurance—Mara asks surgeons to reopen the wound, presses the hourglass to her wrist—forecloses passive grief with visible cost (self-harm, confrontation ahead). Escalation is accumulative and constrained by the meteor hush; coincidence (meteor, plant telepathy) complicates the premise but does not resolve. Cost is legible: blood, reopened scars, shift from witness to accuser.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—finding where unused love collects—is signaled in the opening and pursued through psychometry, search, discovery, and redistribution. One meaningful tightening occurs when the vision shifts from personal history (the projectionist and dancer) to the larger phenomenon of pooled love, narrowing Celeste's mission from individual recovery to citywide dispersal. The decision to scatter the strips incurs an opportunity cost (she cannot return them to their sources) and the final image of love "flowing outward like water breaking through a dam" reweights the premise under the Accumulative lens. However, no on-page obstacle tests her resolve; the booth yields its secret readily and the map appears without friction, keeping escalation in the mid-7s rather than higher.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—freeing the Keeper and thus freeing her own calcified dreams—is signaled early and tightens when she chooses to "deliberately introduce imperfection." One meaningful deepening occurs: her intuition replaces precision, narrowing the Keeper's control-bound loop. However, the tightening lacks on-page friction or visible tradeoff; Celestine's choice succeeds immediately without cost or complication. The escalation reads as accumulative density rather than protagonist struggle, and the astrolabe's cooling feels declared rather than paid. Coincidence does not resolve, but agency remains thin in the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: cultivating new sparks/futures after the last forest burns. The piece deepens rather than escalates—Maren's charm releases the seeds, they take root, and the figure's declaration ("the last forest burns still") crystallizes the cost of persistence. One meaningful tightening occurs when the seeds scatter and "some would become trees; others would become the memory of trees." Agency is present but ritual-bound; the charm feels inevitable rather than a choice under competing pressures, which limits the band.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.1)
    Dominant stake signaled early: understanding the forest's puzzle. One tightening occurs when he finds the clearing and begins placing gears. However, escalation is minimal—no reversal, no competing pressure, no visible tradeoff. He simply completes the task his unconscious prepared, and the mechanism activates without complication. The resolution (hologram revelation) arrives without protagonist struggle at closure; his unconscious did the work off-page. No felt price paid in the final beat; he pockets the gear and plans to continue.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—finding Luna—is signaled immediately, then reweighted: what she's lost is her own unused courage. Pressure accumulates through indirect routes and the confession beat, which narrows her options from rescue-search to self-confrontation. The guides' final directive ("you'll have to walk there without a leash") crystallizes the cost: she must release control to proceed. One meaningful deepening (realizing "also lighter") shifts her stance, sufficient for this length and Accumulative lens, though the antagonistic pressure comes entirely from Mara's own reflection rather than external complication.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake signaled early: Rielle needs to understand what safety cost. Pressure tightens through the accumulation of details (staircase path, Silent-Choir's presence, the wobbling bench, the children's story) until the final choice to play despite pain. Agency is clear: Rielle's decision to sit and play forecloses the option of avoidance, with on-page cost ("her regenerating nerves sparked and ached"). One credible tightening is present. Minor gap: the enemy's discovery of the children is mentioned but not dramatized, slightly softening the stakes' visceral proof.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—unmasking the pretender—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure accumulates through the weeks-or-centuries of rune inscription, and the stakes tighten as each corrupted passage is found. Yet the progression is additive rather than escalating: Ossian's agency is methodical execution, not a choice that narrows options or incurs visible cost. The pretender's web unravels off-page in a "single, graceful collapse," denying us a dramatized turn where cost is legible in Ossian's own experience.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: discover why ghost currents exist. The anomaly manifesting seventeen years early tightens pressure and forces Mara to cross-reference archival data, a tactical shift. Agency is present in her instruction to Mendel and decision to document, though these feel more confirmatory than a trade-off with visible cost. The choice to write the report crystallizes her stance but does not foreclose a competing desire on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs; no persistent constraint (time, tool, stamina) visibly alters her tactics within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—discovering meaning in the rebellion's wreckage—is signaled early and coheres through Kess's search. The stone circle's hum provides one tightening (subsonic vibration to full envelopment), but the escalation is passive: she receives the symbols' message rather than making a trade-off or facing a dilemma. No live option is foreclosed; the decision to gather others is frictionless, without visible cost or competing desire on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake signaled early: Naja seeks "a way to evolve tradition with intent rather than let it fossilize or die," and the plants' whispers escalate urgency by pointing toward "something old, something sealed, something waiting." The kite decoding (four days of cross-reference work) tightens options and her dawn descent under Authority restrictions raises external risk. The unsealing itself is a peak choice with visible consequence (transformation, expanded awareness). However, the resolution unfolds without friction—no painful adaptation, no narrative cost for integrating alien DNA—and Naja's immediate confidence about teaching others flattens what should be a high-stakes biological gamble into a smooth win.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—transforming survival into cultivation while holding grief—is signaled early and deepens through the pregnant couple's visit, which tests Mira's stance. The night-blooming cereus exchange ("that one night makes everything worthwhile") crystallizes her philosophy under gentle pressure. The piece delivers one meaningful tightening when Mira touches then releases the photograph, a micro-renunciation that forecloses retreat. Cost is visible but quiet: she must continue working among reminders of loss, and the final image of transplanting carries felt weight under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (artist seeking purpose after serial rejection) is signaled early and tightens when the walls begin contracting, forcing a decision under physical threat. The escalation is driven by her agency—each card placement accelerates the room's compression—creating a meaningful pressure point. However, the resolution mechanism (completing the spiral stops the walls and grants "authentic sight") feels more symbolic than tactically earned; the stakes shift from survival to epistemological insight without a visible tradeoff. The cost is felt in her empty hands and abandoned medium, meeting the Accumulative lens requirement, though the causal link between spiral completion and wall reversal remains thin.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear early: bring in the fugitive killer. One tightening occurs when Kael confronts Vera and must decide whether to execute the arrest immediately or allow her ink ritual to complete. The drone's weapons activation raises external pressure, but Kael's agency (raising his hand to halt it) drives the turn. The escalation is modest—Vera's dialogue adds philosophical stakes but doesn't materially change Kael's options. Cost is legible in the final image: he yields seconds to witness her truth before proceeding with the arrest, a micro-endurance that reweights his role but leaves the external outcome intact.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to preserve stability by maintaining silence or risk collapse by waking a witness—is signaled early and tightens through Maren's internal escalation. Her agency drives the turn: she chooses to wake one witness rather than all five hundred, a calibrated decision that narrows options. The cost is declared on-page ("ending her own life as she'd known it") and the networks' encrypted confirmation shows immediate consequence. However, the escalation occurs primarily through reflection rather than external pressure testing her resolve, and the price remains somewhat abstract rather than viscerally embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: whether Mira will abandon the farm (and her mother's legacy) under Kael's pressure. The tightening occurs when Mira calls out his lie, forcing him to drop the pretense; her tea offer is a renunciation that forecloses reconciliation on his terms. Agency is clear (her refusal, his blade-sheathing). The cost is mutual: Kael must accept her terms, Mira risks his departure. One meaningful escalation under the Situational lens; no requirement for multiple reversals at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (catch the goddess's echo) is signaled early and pursued throughout. One tightening: the echo's arrival forces Mara to hold perfectly still despite her thundering heart, a visible constraint. The resolution is earned by her shaped silence and patience. The cost is legible—she carries the echo "carefully," knowing it will change her. Under the Accumulative lens, the pressure coheres: rising frequencies, zigzag flowers, then crystallization. No antagonist required; the garden's wildness and the constellations' drift supply situational opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is clear: whether to publish her father's suppressed investigation. One meaningful tightening when she realizes the retraction itself was strategic, narrowing her question from "was he a coward?" to "what was he setting up?" and compelling the publish decision. The cross-referencing beat (developer lawsuit, public filings) provides external validation that shifts her stance. Cost is conceptually present ("orbit of regret finally found its proper ellipse") but not viscerally felt—we don't see competing pressures (board opposition, family reputation, personal danger) that would make the choice agonizing. The "proof by contradiction" method supplies logical escalation but emotional escalation remains muted.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Vera must resolve the haunted firmware and, implicitly, her own guilt. One meaningful tightening occurs when she places the amber against the machine and "understands"—the wasp is tethered, not trapped—which narrows her path to engaging the code directly. Agency is decision and renunciation: she rewrites her constellation rather than merely debugging. The price is visible in the emptied amber and the recognition that she "finally learned to listen," though the physical or social cost remains abstract. No live antagonist opposes her; the machine "weeps" but does not resist.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—finding meaning amid erasure—is signaled in the opening and tightens when the old man gasps at proto-memories in the pattern, then deepens as the crowd forms an "emergent hush" of collective attention. Moth's agency drives escalation: she chooses to draw, to continue layering despite the gathering observers, and her tile-flake use intensifies from individual sensing to catalyzing group resonance. The cost is visible—memories remain unlearned, but a "framework that could hold memory" emerges as earned compensation, not solution.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—breaking the retrocognitive trap through remembrance—is signaled early and tightens once when Layla completes the mosaic and the loop loosens. The escalation is driven by her agency (gathering, arranging, naming) under the Accumulative lens. However, the resolution lacks visible cost at the moment of closure; survivors appear without complication and the regime's threatened return is deferred off-page. The choice to speak names aloud is meaningful but does not narrow options or force a trade-off in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—Margaux seeking an audience to anchor her unraveling consciousness—is signaled early and sustained. The garden performance constitutes a single decisive act, but no on-page reversal tests her commitment: the coin, maze, and audience all cooperate without complication. The three witnesses arrive as granted coincidence rather than earned discovery, and while the applause "rippled across... three distinct moments" reweights the temporal frame, Margaux's agency does not narrow options or face a visible tradeoff before the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake (save eight hundred trapped telepaths) is signaled early and remains coherent. The tightening occurs when Chen grasps the application: "teach them to follow these specific pathways back—through their own somatic markers." Mara's agency is decision and devise-action (mapping the routes tonight), and the cost is her ongoing disorientation plus the deferral of certainty. The escalation reads as deepening understanding rather than a reversal that narrows live options, which keeps the score in the solid but not exceptional range under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—becoming "the voice of the unknown"—is signaled early. The discovery of autonomous cave emotions deepens the premise and narrows Maren's purpose from mapping to communion. However, no on-page reversal tests her commitment; the cave presences respond cooperatively ("they'd been waiting"), and the final act is described as seamless ("the boundary dissolve") rather than a trade-off with visible cost. The hibernation timeframe and isolation are declared but do not force a choice that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: preserving meaning before forgetting erases it. The accelerating hourglasses create urgency, and the button-pattern discovery narrows Mara's tactical options. However, the resolution bypasses on-page protagonist agency—visitors arrive and contribute off-stage, deflating the cost. The line "The hourglasses began to slow" presents outcome without showing Mara's concrete action or sacrifice that forced the change. One meaningful tightening (pattern discovery) is present, but the closure lacks a visible trade-off or price paid by Mara herself.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (preserve Sarah's evidence before spring erases it) is clear and tightens once: three days forces immediate action. Marcus's choice to involve Emma narrows options and raises exposure risk. The snow-code discovery is a meaningful reversal—what seemed lost is recoverable but perishable. However, the final act summarizes systemic payoff ("codes would reach the right people") rather than showing a visible price paid in the closure beat. The trafficking ring opposition remains abstract; no immediate antagonist tests Marcus's rekindled agency.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding which layer of her grandmother's life is true—is signaled when the woman describes the palimpsest journals. Pressure tightens through accumulation: each revelation (daughter given away, joy/regret layered, yarn needle's original use) deepens the complexity the woman seeks to resolve. The coachman's intervention is decisive agency: his reframing ("All of it is true") forecloses her search for singular essence and opens acceptance of multiplicity. The cost is legible in her "soft exhalation" and the fact that she must now carry the needle and all its meanings. No reversal is required under the Accumulative lens; the deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding why some places resist change—is signaled early and frames the journey. The lantern glass provides one meaningful tightening when the potter perceives fractured timelines aligning through acts of kindness, but this deepening is observational rather than forcing a choice with visible cost. The beekeeper's explanation and the potter's departure carry thematic resonance but no on-page reversal that narrows her options or exacts a price; she walks away with the glass and her understanding intact, which reads as arrival rather than escalation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Mira's mission to instill belief that light can reach dark corners—is signaled early and coheres. One tightening occurs when she discovers the neighbor's new plot, affirming her method, but this is affirmation rather than narrowed options or forced trade-off. No reversal or decision point forecloses a live path; the rosebush's death is already complete at the opening, so it cannot serve as an on-page turn. Pressure accumulates gently through the nocturnal rounds but does not escalate under the Accumulative lens sufficiently to reach higher bands. Cost (three years of labor, the father's absence) is present but backgrounded.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Mira seeks to reconcile her fractured dual identity. However, pressure remains static; she catalogs memories and reads a conveniently affirming book without any on-page reversal or cost that narrows options. The "Art of Being Multiple" arrival feels like a prompt-answer rather than an earned turn. No visible price is paid—no choice forecloses a path, no resource is spent—so escalation under the Accumulative lens stalls at descriptive accumulation without tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (Margot's search for pattern connecting her ghostwriting clients' secrets) is signaled early and tightens when the installation reveals those secrets already form a visible spiral. The deepening occurs on-page: her throat tightens, she traces connections with her eyes, then chooses to add her own letter—foreclosing her stance as mere conduit with felt cost ("loneliness and purpose"). One meaningful pressure point (the installation's existence) alters her understanding and tactics. The coincidence of clients visiting this temple complicates without resolving; Margot's agency drives closure.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.2)
    One dominant stake (prevent tricksters from scaling chaos beyond campus) is signaled early and tightens when Mara discovers the convergence pattern. The escalation is driven by her agency: she composes the subsonic puzzle, broadcasts it, and holds steady under scrutiny. The cost is conceptual and relational—she becomes visible to cosmic entities—but the tradeoff is legible when "something vast turn[s] its attention toward her directly" and she must "maintain her broadcast" through their scrutiny. One meaningful deepening occurs when the tricksters shift from chaos-making to pattern-solving, narrowing the danger without eliminating it.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—claiming the Architect's Key—is signaled immediately. One meaningful tightening: the organ's notes cause the disc to rotate, revealing a second layer and reweighting her understanding. Mara's agency is present (she follows the sound, traces with the compass, photographs), yet the escalation is driven by discovery rather than a forced trade-off with visible cost. The claustrophobia "releases its grip" without complication, and no live option is foreclosed at closure. Pressure coheres but does not compel sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—creating a portrait that awakens dormant empathy to unlock witness memory—is signaled early and tightens when Elena displays the portrait at the press conference, triggering three witnesses to come forward with details that reconstruct the night Catherine vanished. The escalation is accumulative rather than causal: testimonies layer, the portrait emerges, witnesses respond. Agency lies in Elena's decision to paint "not a face but an atmosphere," and the cost is visible in her exclusion from the resolution (she can't follow news broadcasts). The piece could sustain more on-page friction during the creation process; the interviews and painting occur in summary, flattening pressure at the story's hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—proving reversible exile and vindicating her great-grandfather—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, the story delivers no meaningful on-page reversal or tightening: Mira begins determined to investigate and ends stepping through the airlock without encountering resistance, misunderstanding, or a choice that forecloses another path. Dr. Kao's shift from skepticism to cooperation occurs off-camera between dialogue beats, deflating potential friction. The cost of descent is prospective rather than paid in the text, leaving pressure legible but unescalated.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—granting passage to trapped figures—is signaled at midpoint but never contested. Mara encounters no resistance, doubt, or trade-off when she plays; the scaffold wrap delivers a clear pattern, her violin translates it successfully, and all figures cross "one by one" without complication. The story offers accumulation of sensory details (photons, quantum vibration) but no tightening of options or deepening of cost. The hitchhiker's vanishing initiates the sequence but does not return to test Mara's choice, and her decision to play carries no visible price beyond fatigue.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Marco can dissuade his father from returning to robbery—is signaled early and tightens through the dialogue. The father's backstory (startup collapse, return to crime) raises external and internal pressure. The climactic offer ("You could stay, help me with the preserve work") forces a choice that forecloses the father's road-life with on-page cost: "Show me your markers tomorrow" is a renunciation with relational and identity stakes. One gap: the father's internal resistance is told ("I'd marked myself too deeply") rather than dramatized through a counter-move or hesitation that Marco must overcome.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: decode the inscriptions and understand Ashwin's fate. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mara realizes the priests designed collaborative decoding to prevent solitary obsession—this reweights her approach and invites Elias in. The escalation is conceptual rather than tactical; no live option is visibly foreclosed. The cost (abandoning solo work, accepting dependence) is implied in the collaborative writing but not dramatized as a difficult trade-off. Under Accumulative lens, the deepening suffices, but the final beat describes rather than enacts the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake: rescue the apprentice before the curse consumes him. The escalation is causal and clear: Maren begins with expanding circles (low-risk search) → discovers the frozen apprentice (raises difficulty) → reads the curse and attempts comfort-song (first tactic) → discovers blood-magic seeds (new information) → shifts to war-song (heightened tactic that forces the scream and cracks the paralysis). The apprentice's fall and wind-working catch provide physical consequence. However, the vortex "satisfied now that its prisoner had been claimed and released" implies the curse was waiting for narrative permission rather than tactical defeat, softening the sense of hard-won victory. Cost is present but muted: the apprentice survives shaken but mobile, and Maren's serenity remains uncracked.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—finding the intersection of their complementary visions—is signaled early. One meaningful turn occurs when they link palms, merging scattered breadth with root-bound depth, but this resolution feels delivered rather than earned through protagonist struggle. The "eclipsed covenant" complication is introduced but never tested; the characters don't attempt and fail under the broken agreement. Coincidence that "the future arrived three weeks ahead" sets the premise but doesn't visibly narrow options or force a trade-off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—Marcus's need to reverse the failed joy-for-sadness trade—is signaled early and tightens when the Oracle reveals that Rebecca also could not wear the foreign grief. The reversal attempt (burned card ritual) creates a meaningful complication: "You can't just swap destinies back and forth like clothes. They change shape in the wearing." Agency is present but muted: Marcus's final choice to take the Oracle's hand and "do the harder thing" is framed as acceptance rather than a decision that forecloses a live option with visible cost on the page. The escalation is driven by revealed consequences (the wasps-in-chest sensation, Rebecca's parallel suffering) more than Marcus's own tactical choices under pressure. Cost is declared ("Will it hurt?" "Yes") but not yet paid in the ending beat, leaving Charged Poise rather than Decisive Change.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: can Marcus trust his judgment again after public failure? One meaningful tightening: the bottles force him to choose between defensive recitation and vulnerable instinct. Agency is decision with visible cost (risking another failure). Sarah's impatience adds time pressure. The escalation is sufficient—Marcus moves from paralyzed self-doubt to active trust—but the reversal is somewhat compressed; the pivot from reciting facts to "I'm just going to trust what I feel" lands quickly without prolonged tactical struggle. Cost is legible (future vulnerability) but the immediacy of consequence is muted since the appraisal's accuracy isn't tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: understanding Harrow's transition physics and the legacy she left. One meaningful tightening: the seed sprouts immediately, forcing Emilia to confront the knowledge fruit's impossible mechanics and internalize the analogical framework. Her final decision to catalog and translate represents agency—she commits to reestablishing Harrow's work, foreclosing a path of passive grief. The escalation is conceptual rather than conflict-driven; pressure accumulates through the unveiling of Harrow's encoded memories. Cost is visible in her solitary commitment ("patient method they'd always shared") but muted; no competing goods or unavoidable harms test her stance. Under the Accumulative lens, the tightening is sufficient, but the lack of a second pressure point or trade-off keeps this from the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: preserving wonder in the endless today. Pressure coheres through the visitor's arrival and her need to remember who she was trying to become, deepening when Maris offers the scroll and the titan-gears reveal navigation/astronomy/architecture texts—a tightening moment that narrows the visitor's confusion into recognition. The visitor's choice to keep the scroll is agency (renunciation of forward-looking habit), though the cost is conceptual rather than a visible trade-off. No explicit antagonist; the temporal loop complicates but does not resolve through luck.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—understanding what people lose when they prepare for catastrophe—emerges clearly through the confession and artifact discoveries. One meaningful tightening: Marcus moves from clinical inspection to emotional witness when he reads "hope doesn't survive in vaults." The pearl warming and caves pulsing provide external confirmation that narrows his path to action. Cost is present but somewhat diffuse: he accepts the burden of finding people and returning artifacts, a commitment that will alter his profession permanently. Agency is clean—his choice to gather and catalog drives closure.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—finding self-forgiveness—is signaled early and pressured through daily wading progression and graffiti wisdom. The twenty-ninth-day wading to river's center offers a tightening (deeper water, held journal, recorded clarity: "Subject remains upright"), but the escalation reads more as symbolic deepening than a choice that forecloses a path with visible consequence. The graffiti exchange and accordion reframing provide textural intensification under the Accumulative lens, yet the final "current you learn to swim in" realization feels reflective rather than enacted through a decision with on-page cost. Agency is present (wading, writing, positioning the accordion) but the price paid remains conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (finding the library of unspoken words) is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the cipher's coordinates and the propagation-delay navigation, providing one meaningful tightening. However, escalation lacks a visible trade-off: the protagonist reaches her goal without forfeiting a live option or paying an on-page cost. The climax grants discovery and expanded access ("new pathways") rather than forcing a choice between competing goods. Under the Accumulative lens, the ending should reweight prior material with felt cost; here it delivers satisfaction without sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake is clear and urgent: authenticate the violin's provenance before dawn or the proof melts and the monks' claim dies. The coffee-reading scene tightens options by showing two mutually exclusive futures, each with legible costs (truth buried in appeals vs. career destroyed for a hidden win). Elena's final move—encrypt and scatter evidence while submitting a sanitized official report—is driven by her agency and reflects the plant-propagation lesson as tactical model. The violin's physical melting at dawn ensures the price is visible and irreversible. The only soft point: the Empire's lawyers and monks remain off-stage abstractions rather than embodied forces that adapt or resist.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—capture the spark before dawn erases it—is signaled early ("before that threshold, before the crossing back") and tightens through escalation: oils warming, emerald pulsing in sync with aurora, mirrors angled to multiply radiance. The tightening is textural (density and tempo increase) rather than causal reversal, fitting the Accumulative lens. Agency is Lyra's practiced precision under the ritual's time pressure; the cost is legible in "beauty that would fade with the dawn but existed, undeniable, now"—ephemerality accepted as inherent price. One minor gap: we never see a moment where Lyra risks failure or adjusts tactics when something resists, which would have elevated tension further, but the single meaningful deepening (emerald lighting, mirrors positioned, face shifting "not alive, but not quite gone") is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: understanding why forgiveness didn't bring peace—signaled in paragraph four and held to closure. The hairpin removal reverses Keiko's relationship to the woman and reveals her mother's face, narrowing her options (she must accept the cyclical practice versus a single source). The final transfer forecloses the quest for a fixed answer with visible cost: she descends holding the promise of endless practice. Escalation is textural: density increases from memory ("spooning soup," "wasted limbs") to mythic synthesis (mother/mountain/mist) and the closing triad ("heartbeat/promise/breath") reweights all prior material under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Mara's need to recover her professional certainty or transform it—is signaled in paragraph three and deepens when the keeper reframes the hollow mirror as refraction rather than emptiness. This tightening narrows her options from "see clearly again" to "welcome nuance into certainty," a visible trade-off that forecloses her old business model with stated cost ("frightened and free"). The Vincent case provides backstory pressure but the lighthouse confrontation itself lacks a second reversal or escalation beat; the keeper's wisdom lands without resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake—teaching vanishing—signals early but remains abstract throughout. The trance elongates perception, but no live reversal or cost-bearing choice emerges; the student's readiness is asserted ("he understood now") rather than tested on the page. Escalation reads as deepening metaphor density (ripples → still points → vanishing) without narrowing options or raising price. The platform's descent serves as transit marker, not a turn that forecloses a path. No visible cost charges the ending; the researcher's impending forgetting is premise-level backdrop, not a consequence of this session's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake (restore the harmonic network) is signaled early and tightens when the arrowhead's pulse reveals the third tower's fracture. One meaningful deepening occurs: passive listening becomes active diagnostic appraisal that narrows his task to weeks of realignment. The cost is legible (time, solitary labor, "centuries" of patience required), though the discovery itself is more coincidental than earned by protagonist agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Maren seeks to understand her grandmother's teaching and her own flickering magic in an automated age. Pressure tightens through repeated mist-walking failure, physical cold, and hours of stillness. The turn comes when the luminance pulses with her breathing and the keystone glows—this shifts from her attempting the spell to the environment responding, a meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. Agency is endurance (Earned Stasis element) that earns the vision. The cost is visible: the slow climb over teleportation, the heavy pack, hours of cold. One issue: the stakes remain largely internal; no external antagonist or secondary pressure tests the choice, keeping escalation to a single intensification rather than compounding.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—documenting her grandfather's color-sound dictionary—is signaled by midpoint and drives the dive. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens: months of preparation, waiting for lowest tide and memorial night, then executing the descent. However, escalation is linear rather than tightening; no live complication forces a trade-off or narrows options once she's inside the wreck. The discovery proceeds smoothly, and the resolution (photographing bottles, hanging the key tag) lacks a visible cost or renunciation that forecloses a path. Agency is present but the final act feels completionist rather than conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—surviving the Big Crunch through wavelength alignment—is signaled early and tightens through discovery, teaching, and the final convergence. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mira realizes the coins carry backward instructions, reframing her practice from mysticism to reception. However, the final transformation lacks dramatized resistance or visible trade-off; everyone aligns without friction, and no live option is foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake signaled early: whether to name and bear the grief or remain trapped in nameless dread. The tightening occurs when Mira moves from hearing her predecessor's echo to applying his lesson, reframing her choice and foreclosing retreat with visible emotional cost. Agency is renunciation (walking away from Daniel) whose price—loneliness, the jewel of "perfect grief"—is legible on the page. The decision itself happened off-page, so present escalation is conceptual deepening rather than plot-driven narrowing, which fits the Accumulative lens but slightly reduces forward pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—restoring ocean balance—is signaled early and tightens through Emris's measured work. One clear escalation: the reconstruction succeeds against his limited magic, and the bell's strike reverses the dripping with immediate consequence (fish return). Agency is strong: Emris's observation, devotion, and technique drive the resolution. The cost is visible (magic exhausted) and the final act forecloses the path of failure with felt weight. Coincidence does not resolve; protagonist action does.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake is internal: whether Marcus can integrate his role as warden (burying Millbrook) with his identity as former resident (remembering it). The photographs function as a gentle escalation device, pulling him deeper into memory. Eleanor's arrival provides one meaningful tightening—she names the need for "shared meaning" and offers witness—but the scene remains contemplative rather than agonistic. No high-cost trade-off appears on the page; Marcus's decision to listen and remember does not visibly foreclose another live option. The drought provides situation, but Marcus does not drive the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (completing the Opus Perpetuum) is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when Lyra follows starling patterns to crystallize the formula, though this feels more revealed than fought for. The orchard's shudder introduces mild complication but no genuine reversal. The resolution succeeds without visible trade-off—no ingredient fails, no step costs her, no alternate path is foreclosed. Pressure accumulates texturally but lacks the agency-driven escalation and legible cost required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (preserve observational integrity vs. Command's doubt) is signaled at the first radio exchange and tightens meaningfully when Command herself enters. Vera's agency—choosing to defend her notation system rather than comply—forecloses the path of easy agreement with visible cost (professional tension, isolation). The predecessor's fate provides a clear alternative she refuses, sharpening the choice. Escalation is driven by protagonist decision under causal pressure; the cost (standing alone against institutional doubt) is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake (who raises the daughter) is signaled in the second line and tightens when Kira refuses Clone-Kira's offer and proposes balance instead. One meaningful reversal—"No" followed by the complementary-opposites argument—narrows options and forecloses the clean-split path the court wanted. The cost is visible in the mutual grip and threat ("If you fail her"), though it remains more relational promise than immediate forfeiture. Escalation is clean under the Causal lens, and agency is protagonist-driven (Kira's choice to share rather than yield). No coincidence solves; pressure coheres through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—filling the household's consuming quiet with sound/memory—is signaled early and sustained. Martin's agency (choosing the nightly ritual, then inviting Sarah in) drives the key turn, and the couple's shared off-key singing forecloses solitary mourning with felt cost (broken laughter, tears). Pressure accumulates under the Accumulative lens through intensifying imagery and emotional layering. The escalation from solo to duet is meaningful but somewhat predictable; a complication or resistance from Sarah before she joins would have sharpened the tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—destroy the pendant to prevent cultists from tearing apart her library—is signaled early and tightens when the pendant begins fracturing Maris across dimensions, raising the personal cost of intervention. Her agency drives the resolution: she chooses to grab and snap the chain despite the risk of dissolution. One meaningful reversal occurs when the pendant's pulse makes her "interiorize exteriors," complicating her mission with the threat of absorption into the dream-space. The cost is visible on the page: she wakes still collared, still bound to the cycle.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake signaled early: repair the crozier and validate her alchemical practice. Escalation coheres through causal pressure—each material choice (moonstone, bone ash, blood) narrows her options toward forbidden vivification rites. The turn when "new wood emerged from the fractures" is earned by her decision to stop repairing and allow transformation, forecloses the path of recreating her father's successes with visible cost. Agency is genuine: her choice to use forbidden rites and her own blood drives the resolution. The tightening moment when paste begins to glow creates undeniable tension before payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake (finding new meaning in celestial signals beyond hollow repetition) is signaled early and deepens when Mira recalibrates her array to detect absence, a tactical shift that narrows her method. The discovery itself carries conceptual weight—understanding endings as beginnings—but lacks a visible on-page cost or trade-off in the moment. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful intensification occurs, but the resolution feels more bestowed than fought for, limiting the felt price at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake (stabilize the vanishing ferry) is signaled early and pressure coheres. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mateo proposes merging timelines and navigates to the confluence. However, the escalation relies on Torres's immediate agreement ("didn't hesitate") rather than friction, and the climactic turn (holding the hourglass, sand flows sideways) feels more received than wrestled. Agency is present but consequence—what the merge costs passengers, the ferry's prior liminality, or Mateo himself—is asserted ("permanently transient no longer") without dramatized loss. No persistent constraint visibly alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—Marina seeking to understand her shifting memories—is signaled early and drives her search for the Connection Room. Pressure accumulates through the weaving act: each hook-to-hook connection triggers memory eruptions that deepen her understanding, and the sinew thread's impossible growth forces her to work faster. However, escalation relies on revelation rather than opposition or trade-off; Marina faces no meaningful resistance or cost during the weaving itself. The resolution reweights her understanding but doesn't narrow prior options or force a visible sacrifice—she simply leaves the installation intact as "a gift."

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—Carta's need to comprehend alien navigation and expand her perceptual limits—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening occurs when Current-Through-Stones demonstrates edge geometry through the chain link, narrowing Carta's epistemic options and forcing her to see "constellations she recognized and pathways she had never imagined." The resolution shows her tracing the first constellation in shared practice, but the choice reads more as culmination of pedagogy than a decision that forecloses a live alternative with felt tradeoff. Agency is present in her descent and receptivity, yet the final beat lacks a visible price beyond the earlier abandonment of her academy position, which is summary-told.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—protecting Lily from isolation and manipulation—is signaled early through Margaret's posthumous warning and sustained through the escalating pattern Mira traces. One meaningful tightening occurs when Lily arrives with a visible bruise, shifting the abstract signal into immediate danger and forcing Mira's response (calls to shelters, advocates). The cost is legible: Lily's vulnerability, the need for external intervention, and the acknowledgment that "incidental heroism" is insufficient without professional support. However, the escalation is driven more by Lily's entrance (a situational complication) than by Mira's agency or a decision that narrows her options. The resolution feels more like a handoff than a climactic choice, and the price paid is social/logistical rather than deeply personal to Mira.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—documenting Kove's discovery to counter institutional forgetting—is signaled early and sustained. However, the piece lacks an on-page reversal or tightening that forecloses a live option. Mara faces a six-hour tidal window, but we never see her forced to choose between safety and proof, or between competing obligations. The beings appear, she photographs them, and she leaves; the "crashing hush of institutional forgetting" remains abstract rather than dramatized as immediate opposition. The escalation is textural (discovery accumulates) rather than causal, fitting the lens but limiting felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (understanding Chen's final work and her role in his death) is signaled early and pursued through the night. One meaningful tightening: the ink-pattern method unlocks files and reveals Chen's intentional choice, narrowing Mira's emotional options from guilt to acceptance. Agency is present in the deliberate spilling of ink and the interpretive choice to reframe brokenness. Cost is felt in the renunciation of repair and forgiveness. No requirement for antagonist at this length; pressure accumulates through the night's effort and the revelation's reweighting of prior belief.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: preserve the Velathi language in comprehensible form. Pressure deepens when the birds respond to her sound-echoes, proving the translation works. Agency is present—she chooses to walk away after completing the work—but the climactic night of translation unfolds without setback or tactical shift, reducing escalation texture. Cost is signaled (worn fingers, departure) yet the perpetual success of the echoes softens the trade-off. One meaningful tightening when sound, light, and motion converge.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake: whether to expose or join the phenomenon. The phone voices and Voss's laugh deepen pressure, and Maya's question narrows options with visible cost (career vs. transformation). One clear tightening: the arrowhead's offering reframes the investigation as an invitation. Coincidence (Voss's laugh on the phone) complicates without resolving; Maya still must choose. The stakes remain coherent under the accumulative lens, though the escalation is more conceptual than tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—reawakening beauty and magic—is signaled early and drives the structure. Mira's decision to weave the new melody is a clear tightening that forecloses safer options (cheerful folk tunes) and raises immediate cost when the violin begins to crack. Her choice to continue playing despite the instrument breaking demonstrates agency with visible price. The orchard's response and the statues' transformation provide external escalation that converges with her action at closure. One micro turn (woman stumbles, man weeps) deepens pressure before the full transformation, meeting the one-meaningful-tightening standard for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake (delivering the package undetected) is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when the drone's whir grows closer, then passes—this narrows suspense and validates Maren's method under the Accumulative lens. However, the protagonist's agency is more execution than dilemma; she never faces a forced choice or trade-off that forecloses a live option. The cost remains conceptual (families reunited, borders defied) rather than a visible price Maren pays on the page. No reversal or complication tests her commitment; the plan proceeds smoothly to its conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—transforming broken carousel remnants into a sculpture that spins in wind—is signaled early and pursued consistently. However, escalation is minimal: the carpenter finds the brass fragment, solders it into place, tests the crown, and plans next steps without meaningful opposition, reversal, or cost. The experimental push succeeds immediately ("It rotated smoothly"), and no choice narrows options or risks failure. Pressure remains static rather than tightening under the Accumulative lens; the final act continues the same work rather than reweighting it. Agency is present (he chooses to incorporate the fragment) but the choice carries no visible trade-off or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (find the place where stories live) is signaled early and pursued through hyperbolic mapping. One meaningful tightening: Cordelia's ritual walk at 4:17 AM raises atmospheric pressure and the graduate student's question confirms the shift. Cost is conceptual and relational—reality bends, isolation deepens into shared solitude—legible when the scarf warms and the library "breathes." No off-stage resolution; the pocket dimension manifests on the page. Agency is attention and enactment (the walk, the whispered equations) rather than decision, fitting the Accumulative lens. Pressure coheres under that lens and the final image reweights the library's nature.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—finding Theo and understanding his disappearance—is signaled early and tightens through Mara's progression: conventional search → cipher breakthrough → photography replication → cave discovery. The escalation under an Accumulative lens shows a meaningful deepening: each sunrise expedition narrows her understanding until the final coordinate reveals Theo and forces the choice to follow. However, the peak moment lacks visible friction; no live option is dramatized as foreclosed. Mara's decision to open the palette and paint her coordinates feels prepared rather than tested—the story shows her inevitable drift toward Theo's state without a dramatized alternative she's renouncing. The cost (abandoning the library) is stated but not felt as a trade-off in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: confronting her sister's vanishing and the city's hidden truth. One tightening occurs when Mara decodes the ribbon and descends, narrowing her path from avoidance to action. Yet the locksmith's guidance reduces Mara's agency—she is told what to do rather than choosing under conflicting pressure. The final transformation to "new locksmith" is declared by the locksmith rather than earned through Mara's refusal of a safer option. No live trade-off or visible price is dramatized at closure; the cost remains conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (recover stolen memories) is signaled early and tightens when Vera must break her documentarian protocol to pluck the mushroom—a genuine reversal that narrows options. The choice costs her professional habits and risks the evidence, creating visible friction. The escalation from research to underwater dive to physical intervention follows causal pressure. The "consumption transforms preservation" insight could be slightly more implicit, but the agency and cost at the turn are unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—mentoring an exiled child toward self-acceptance—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through Finn's skepticism softening into engagement, but escalation is gentle rather than narrowing: he moves from "That's garbage" to leaning closer to copying annotations without a visible tradeoff or cost. The tea-leaf geometry and reversible-exile theory deepen understanding but do not force a choice that forecloses another path. Under the accumulative lens one deepening suffices, yet the final beat summarizes resonance rather than dramatizing a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (preserving wonder's essence) is signaled early and Mara's agency drives the ritual. Yet escalation is shallow: the essence "resisted at first" but capitulates within two sentences to her song, erasing the conflict before it can deepen. No meaningful tightening or trade-off occurs—she succeeds without visible cost (e.g., losing something, risking her body, or foreclosing another path). The accumulative design requires a cadence shift or deepening that reweights the stake; here the gathering feels procedural rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (grounding the restless spirit by releasing bound secrets) is signaled early and tightens through the knot-by-knot process. One meaningful deepening occurs as each released name solidifies the fisherman's form, narrowing the path from dissolution to stability. Agency is Maren's methodical needle work, and the cost is legible: "Every knot holds a name...now the silence is drowning me instead." No high-risk reversal or protagonist sacrifice, but the accumulative lens supports this escalation pattern and the felt price (decades of guilt lifted) lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.6)
    One dominant stake (interpreting the vault's silence/whispered question) is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure tightens through discovery (shifted stone), deepens with recognition (cracks form a question mark), and culminates in a credible tightening: Maren must abandon sealed preservation and step into the unknown gap. The protagonist's agency drives escalation—her choice to reopen, compare footage, measure angles, and finally leave doors open forecloses the prior path with visible cost (risk, uncertainty, professional vulnerability). One meaningful pressure point alters tactics and options under the Accumulative lens; coincidence does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (understanding the physics of letting go) is signaled early and tightens through one clear escalation: Elena moves from observer to note-writer to final renunciation, each step foreclosing her collection pattern. The choice to leave the snow globe carries visible cost—abandoning both object and the solve-everything impulse established by the Amelia discovery. Agency is renunciation with on-page price. No false reversals; pressure accumulates under the Hybrid lens and resolves through protagonist decision.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—giving voice to the voiceless—is signaled early but never tested by meaningful opposition or trade-off. Moth's work proceeds without obstacle; the ghost's presence complicates thematically but not tactically. No on-page reversal narrows options or forces a choice with visible cost. The mural's completion and the ghost's gratitude feel inevitable rather than earned through escalation. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening or cadence shift is required; here the material adds detail without increasing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to accept promotion or follow the captain's example—is signaled midway but never faces on-page resistance or trade-off. The promotion summons creates a ticking clock, yet no authority figure appears to test her resolve, and no consequence of refusal is dramatized. The diary revelations accumulate pressure under the Accumulative lens, but Maren's final decision feels like acceptance of an invitation rather than a choice that forecloses a live path with visible cost. The escalation is present but the cost at closure remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake signaled early: completing her unauthorized project to categorize clouds by emotion and prove atmospheric memory. The tightening occurs through accumulation—each observation (lenticular anticipation, cirrostratus grief, virga as proof of passage) deepens her conviction. Agency is attention and endurance: she uses the suspension to document what "nobody bothered to record." The cost is legible: professional risk ("unauthorized," colleagues would "question her fitness") and the choice to present findings "as a memorial." One pass-through without a sharper on-page trade-off limits the score slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear early: complete the founder's portrait before demolition with only a worn coin as reference. One meaningful tightening occurs when she discovers the portrait "remained wrong" despite technical perfection—this realization narrows her options from achieving mastery to accepting honest documentation. Agency is present in the final brush stroke (adding star reflections), a renunciation of the perfection she sought with visible cost: she leaves "still unable to recognize the face she'd rendered so perfectly." The escalation is driven by protagonist perception under the Accumulative lens, and the cost is legible on the page, though the pressure remains more contemplative than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (charting a discovery that threatens the Guild) is signaled early through Celeste's observation habits and sharpens once she decodes the hopscotch pattern. The tightening is meaningful: understanding Mara's hidden map + inferring Guild danger → Celeste must hide evidence and proceed covertly. Cost is visible (erasure, duplicity, risk) and the final stance forecloses open inquiry. One deduction: the escalation hinges entirely on Celeste's solo deduction; no external complication tests her commitment, and the luminance strand introduced early does not return to pressure the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: restore celestial rhythm before fractures worsen. One meaningful tightening when the third gear is missing, forcing improvisation with the Perseids gear. Agency is clear—Miren selects, files, and fits the irregular gear, accepting syncopation over perfection. The cost is conceptual and legible: "rhythm was imperfect, slightly syncopated, but alive," foreclosing ideal repair and leaving future eclipses vulnerable. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; each rusted gear and the warped housing escalate difficulty. No antagonist required; the mechanism's decay supplies resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—community survival versus fragmentation—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure escalates when the first tentative exchanges begin, then deepens when Joren announces collective reconsideration. The protagonist's agency (Mara's nightly chalk work) directly drives each turn. Visible cost appears in "slow recovery" and the acknowledgment of ongoing work, though the final image's price is more conceptual than visceral. One clear tightening (settlers moving from hoarding to sharing) satisfies the length expectation, and coincidence does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—moving the Clock three minutes closer to midnight and embedding "seeds of reversal"—is signaled early but never tested by a counterpressure or complication that narrows her options. The adjustment proceeds smoothly without an on-page obstacle, failed attempt, or price paid beyond the conceptual "ache of responsibility." No reversal or tightening choice appears; she decides to proceed, executes the adjustment, and reflects on the outcome. Agency is present (she performs the adjustment) but the lack of visible escalation or a moment where success costs her something immediate leaves the conflict feeling declared rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—guide the travelers out before the mechanical birds and frost kill them—is signaled early and tightens through the rising dusk and approaching frost. Maren's agency drives the escalation: she runs, reads the nuts and shadows, chooses the counterintuitive path toward the cliff's edge. The birds descending and frost forming create visible pressure. However, the resolution feels externally smooth—Maren's uncle left a perfect system, and once she understands it, the path "reveals itself." There's no moment where her choices risk failure or force a trade-off; the orchard's grace note arrives without a corresponding sacrifice or visible cost beyond accepting the duty she already inherited.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: Maya must find a way to honor Leah and address her own grief-driven isolation. The piece tightens once meaningfully—her insight about foam as "connection born from separation" reframes both the scattering and her withdrawal, narrowing her options from continued avoidance to active reconnection. The cost is visible: she must abandon the protective isolation she's built and face her parents and Leah's friends. No explicit antagonist needed; the pressure coheres through Maya's engagement with memory and place.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—helping the customer find a clean slate—is signaled but never tested on the page. Vera identifies his need, performs a ritual with the darkness, and hands him a bottle; he accepts without objection, negotiation, or visible cost. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the transaction unfolds as a smooth tutorial. The story asserts escalation ("one story potentially rewritten") in summary rather than dramatizing a choice that forecloses a path. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen through repetition or cadence shift, but the final beat simply restates the opening's "infinite possibilities" without a visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—stopping the leaking remorse before it subsumes everything—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when Maron descends and confronts the pavilion directly, narrowing his options to touch-or-fail. The protagonist's agency (removing gloves, kneading memories) drives the resolution with visible cost (risk of subsumption, exhaustion, tears). However, the escalation feels somewhat linear; he succeeds at each pillar without a reversal or complication that would raise the price.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—reconnecting an isolated community—is signaled early and sustained. Mara's decision to take the weight and descend creates one meaningful tightening: she risks historical-society censure and the tower clock's precision. But the opposition is atmospheric (suspicion, silence) rather than active resistance; no farmer objects, no technology fails, no secondary pressure complicates the climb. The resolution unfolds as immediate success without setback, and the stated cost ("she'd have to explain that") remains future-tense, not paid on the page. Escalation is present but soft.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—recovering abandoned dreams—is signaled but remains abstract; no live on-page cost tests Elena's commitment. The piece offers exposition about past patients and her own phantom memories rather than a present pressure that narrows options. The "quaking" and memory flood are told sensations, not dramatized reversals with tactical consequences. Agency at closure is metaphysical assertion ("she became a bridge") without a visible forfeiture or choice that forecloses another path, failing the core escalation and cost-legibility tests under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—finding forgotten combinations—is signaled early and held. Pressure tightens when Lyra reenters during inversion, and the mist's transformation into visible numeric sequences is a meaningful deepening. However, escalation is largely atmospheric; Lyra's choices do not narrow live options or force a trade-off with visible cost. The inversion hour imposes a time constraint that is mentioned but never tested, and the resolution (touching the stone, receiving knowledge) feels more like a gift than an earned consequence of her prior decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—to create music in a silent world—is signaled early and sustained. Escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as density increase: hours of precise testing and adjustment build toward the moment when "insulators found their collective voice." The piece shows one meaningful tightening when Maren raises her hand to perform after meticulous preparation. However, the protagonist's agency at closure is passive reception rather than active choice; the birds arrive "impossibly" rather than through a final decision that narrows options or trades away something visible. Cost is implied (years of solitary work, aching fingers) but not foregrounded as a felt sacrifice in the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—correlate the covenant fragments before dawn or another generation binds—is signaled early and remains coherent. The tightening occurs when Kavir realizes the covenant's incompleteness (the unspoken suffering clause) and chooses to yield testimony to the daughter rather than testify himself, narrowing his own power and foreclosing direct intervention. That choice carries visible cost: he remains at the nexus while she climbs toward the temple, his exile's lesson traded for her authority. No antagonist appears on the page, but the covenant's renewal deadline and the daughter's arrival create sufficient pressure under the Accumulative lens, and the final renunciation is protagonist-driven with legible price.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—recovering connection with her silent sister—is signaled early and tightens when Marlow realizes opening the lock was never the true goal. One meaningful deepening occurs: she shifts from mechanical attempts (lockpicks, prayers) to empathic transmission, narrowing her options from possession to witness. The final choice (closing the diary) forecloses immediate knowledge with visible cost, though the escalation is more conceptual than tactical. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens but lacks a live constraint that forces the choice under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake is clear: cultivate the corpse flower to help villagers achieve "peace without stillness." Pressure accumulates through the weeks of enduring worsening stench, with Mira's own discomfort serving as test. The piece delivers one meaningful tightening when she must choose between abandoning the flower or continuing despite her sensitivity. The cost is felt but somewhat abstract—her "usually racing thoughts slowed"—and the resolution (villagers coming, sharing tinctures and journals) arrives without a visible tradeoff or foreclosed path that would sharpen the stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—finding the source of resilience—is signaled early and drives Mara's navigation choices. The Inversion creates a meaningful tightening by limiting her window and revealing the phantom Cultivators. However, the discovery itself arrives without a trade-off or foreclosed path; Mara descends, finds the sphere, and the Inversion ends "gently this time." The mechanism's reveal deepens understanding but lacks visible cost or a choice that narrows her options. Agency is present in her decision to follow the flows, but the resolution feels granted rather than earned through sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—preventing future atmospheric disasters—is signaled early and tightens through data accumulation that reveals deliberate container positioning. Mara's agency manifests in methodical documentation that transforms from backward investigation to forward prediction, with the worldwide transmission representing a meaningful choice that forecloses the path of localized analysis. The cost is visible in her shift from understanding the past to actively redesigning systemic futures. One escalation beat feels underdeveloped: the transition from hazy precision to certainty occurs through Chen's arrival rather than Mara's sustained pressure on the data.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—proving beauty serves survival—is signaled early and drives Mira's descent. One meaningful tightening occurs when the cavern responds at the moment creation begins above, narrowing options to that exact synchronicity. However, the escalation lacks on-page friction: no failed attempt, no visible cost beyond the physical descent. The Council's unanimous vote resolves too smoothly; luck (the sculptor's chisel timing) complicates but arguably resolves, undercutting protagonist agency at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (understanding the flute's purpose) is signaled early and tightens when Maren plays the first two notes, glimpses the folds, then commits to full passage. The escalation is smooth but single-axis; no secondary pressure complicates the choice. Cost is present (leaving her world) but feels more conceptual than visceral; the renunciation of monastery return is stated rather than dramatized as a competing pull.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding emotional mathematics to predict the next collapse—is clear but never tested on the page. No reversal or tightening forecloses an option; the operator moves through arranging, pressing, examining in a static loop. The halo fragment reveals emotional data ("grief, loneliness, joy"), but no on-page decision risks or sacrifices anything. The ending restates the opening activity without visible cost or narrowed choices.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—delivering the pendant and understanding its purpose—drives forward momentum. The pendant's increasing vibration and glow create escalation through accumulation. However, Kael faces no meaningful opposition or trade-off; each encounter gifts him understanding and objects without cost. The shepherd "hoping to understand" and merchant's grandmother both waited for "the right stranger," making Kael's success feel predetermined rather than earned through agency. The Keeper's revelation resolves the mystery through exposition rather than a choice that forecloses a path. One tightening occurs (vibration intensifies, encounters multiply) but lacks visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—proving objects absorb emotions before the university committee—is signaled early and sustained. Hartley's shift from antagonist to ally constitutes a meaningful tightening that narrows Elena's options (now she has a credible witness). Yet the escalation is external (Hartley's revelation) rather than driven by Elena's agency; she reacts and observes more than she acts under mounting pressure. The final move to photograph the frost is practical but lacks visible cost or a foreclosed alternative. One reversal, modest pressure, no dramatized price at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: retrieve Kenji from the raveling silence. Escalation tightens when the final thread passes through and the pattern locks, forcing the choice. The cost is unmistakable—Mariko will take his place, possibly returning "translucent, forever caught between states of being." Her agency drives the resolution; coincidence does not solve. The sacrifice forecloses her former life with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—save the planet—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: Mira needs the silk's memories to forge conduits. But the magician's arrival and cooperation feel convenient rather than hard-won; no live option is foreclosed. The resolution (trees budding) arrives without visible cost to Mira's later tactics or a price that alters her stance. The work ahead is declared, not dramatized as a trade-off. Escalation under the Causal lens requires a narrowing or complication; here the plan succeeds in a straight line.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—retrieve sister versus preserve infinite variations—is signaled by the three-cycle discovery and deepens through the convergence revelation. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira explains the cascade risk, forcing Kael to weigh one universe against all others. The protagonist's agency is contemplative rather than decisive on the page; the cost is felt in the final image but the choice itself is deferred to "tomorrow," landing as Charged Poise rather than executed decision.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: Vera's reticence versus the need to participate in the letter chain and "protect what needed protecting." The light dying forces immediate action; Marcus's collapse narrows options; his whispered plea "Don't let them end" crystallizes the choice. Escalation is clean under Accumulative lens: physical crisis (lamp dies, Marcus collapses) compounds emotional pressure (she's read these letters for three years but never written), converging in the lantern room where she finally writes. The cost is visible: "hands shaking," exposure of her guarded interior, signing "The Reticent Skipper" as acknowledgment. One meaningful tightening—external emergency meeting internal contradiction—drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake is declared early ("to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows") but remains abstract and untested by concrete on-page friction. No reversal or tightening choice narrows options; Kael positions the wick, light erupts, storms answer, dawn arrives green—no opposition or cost visibly alters tactics. The piece accumulates atmospheric intensity but does not escalate through agency or trade-off. Under an Accumulative lens, the final image reweights meaning, but without a felt price or foreclosed path, the pressure remains declarative rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (learning why strangers share secrets) is signaled early and sustained; the tightening occurs when Chen offers to teach her and she accepts. The reversal is mild—Chen's explanation shifts her understanding from burden to legacy—but no live option is foreclosed on the page. Under the Accumulative lens, the beat deepens meaning rather than narrowing choice, yet the final cost is stated ("without being consumed") rather than dramatized through a visible trade-off or renunciation. The agency lies in Mira's decision to stay, but we don't see what she leaves behind or risks in the act.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: understand what trees witness and deconstruct the maze safely before dawn. The first tree extraction provides a meaningful tightening—Mara discovers the trees hold human sorrow and witnesses the moonlight miracle, reweighting her task from mechanical removal to sacred transformation. However, the work proceeds without setback or forced trade-off; each tree yields its dream cleanly, and dawn arrives as scheduled. The escalation is more accumulative density than narrowing pressure, fitting the lens but limiting tension.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—rekindling dawn in the mirror world—is clear from paragraph two. The weaving sequence provides one meaningful tightening as the song pulls others' voices and the light shifts from amber to pearl, but no on-page reversal tests Elora's commitment or forces a trade-off. She begins with confidence, executes without friction, and succeeds; the "voice cracked with exhaustion and joy" tells cost rather than showing a moment where stamina or doubt narrows her options. Coincidence (the oak exists in both worlds, the faces appear exactly when needed) assists rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—learning to be present without drowning in others' feelings—is signaled early and tightens through the crumpled invitation, the coffee-shop threshold, and the woman's reframe. The wedding absence provides one meaningful on-page cost that narrows options. However, the library discovery arrives without sufficient resistance; Iris enters too easily, and the woman's wisdom resolves tension quickly rather than forcing Iris to choose between competing goods with visible friction.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (how to respond to the city's self-erasure) is clear from the opening and tightens when the woman offers seeds and a new framework. The tea house encounter forces Mira to choose between documenting loss versus transforming it—a real fork with visible cost (accepting the vanishings cannot be stopped). The bread as last artifact and the woman's archive loss provide escalation through accumulative texture. Agency is present: Mira's decision to pocket the seeds and plan tomorrow's planting forecloses pure preservation with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: to preserve meaning at oblivion's edge. The 528-hertz slide provides one meaningful deepening that reweights Maren's understanding and forecloses pure documentation in favor of hope-watching. Agency is attention and stance crystallization (keeping the slide for herself, writing in her private journal). The cost is visible but quiet: shifting from official ledger to private record, allowing tears despite the cold. Under the accumulative lens, pressure coheres through the measuring sequence and crescendos at the extraordinary slide.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—clearing her father's name and securing her own safety—is signaled early and tightens when she reveals the recording and the three-copy insurance. The reversal (she came not to trade but to blackmail into truce) narrows Crenshaw's options with agency and visible cost: mutual silence or exposure. Pressure coheres under the Causal lens; the tightening choice forecloses revenge and forces a brittle peace, with cost felt in "we're strangers" and her solitary walk. No requirement for multiple turns at this length; one meaningful pressure point suffices and is delivered here.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: understanding why certain people carry weather. The stake is signaled early and tested through Mira's compass theory. One meaningful tightening occurs when the needle settles on Kael, validating her hypothesis and forcing her to articulate the implications ("elected by electromagnetic fields"). The conceptual cost is legible: accepting this theory means abandoning pure skepticism for a participatory worldview. However, Kael's acceptance arrives too easily—no visible resistance or price paid for releasing his sense of being cursed. The resolution depends more on Mira's declaration than on a choice that forecloses alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—releasing suppressed creativity to honor her mother's sacrifice—is signaled early and tightens when Elena discovers the hidden self-portrait. The climactic drawing session narrows options (she commits hours, bleeds charcoal) and forecloses the path of clinical detachment. However, escalation is more declarative than dramatized: "Hours passed. Her fingers bled" summarizes the peak pressure rather than showing moment-by-moment resistance or doubt. The resolution is earned by Elena's choice, but the visible cost at the closure beat could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—Mira's need to find where honest words go—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure tightens when she discovers the map, descends, and learns her grandmother started the Archive. However, the escalation is largely spatial (moving down through levels) rather than decisional; no meaningful reversal or tactical cost emerges. The final offer to deliver the messages is an invitation, not a hard choice between competing goods. The wilting-near-dishonesty trait provides texture but doesn't create on-page friction that narrows options at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: achieving "symphonies of truth" that transcend words. The melting ice introduces imperfection, creating one meaningful deepening—Mira abandons technical perfection for honest beauty, a tightening that narrows her artistic path. The pilgrim arrival and Mira's decision to teach others provide visible cost (sharing rather than hoarding the discovery). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; the resolution is protagonist-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—escaping the static prison built by collected fears—signals early and tightens through the miniaturization sequence. The box-opening initiates pressure; the photograph discovery is the key reversal that forecloses the planned incineration and forces a costlier path (burial, ongoing tending). Agency is clear: M4-RY chooses transformation over erasure, renouncing the clean escape. The cost is legible—the static doesn't vanish but becomes "harmony, discordant, incomplete"—a visible trade-off that charges the final image. Under the Accumulative lens, escalation reads as density increase culminating in the photograph beat, which reweights all prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is preserving the community against eviction/buyout. The discovery tightens options by providing documentary evidence, but this unfolds as revelation rather than escalation driven by protagonist agency—Marissa follows clues Mrs. Chen left, and the documents arrive as convenient ammunition. No visible price is paid on the page; the story ends at the moment of mobilization before any trade-off or foreclosed path. One meaningful deepening (pattern of sealed mailboxes) but cost remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (freeing prisoners via unbreakable codes) is signaled early but never tested on the page with a complication, reversal, or tightening that narrows options. Elara encounters no on-page opposition, miscalculation, or cost—she decodes, encrypts, choreographs, and plans without friction. The climax (seventeen prisoners freed) is summarized as future event rather than dramatized turn. No agency-driven escalation; the story recounts competent preparation without a pressure point that forces a trade-off or forecloses a path with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (finding deleted memories) is signaled early and tightens through one clear sequence: observation → descent → pattern-reading → entry. The protagonist's agency drives escalation: she chooses to scatter flowers, wade into the pool, cut the heart, enter it. The cost is unmistakable and on-page: she becomes "another deletion" while the lanterns burn above without her. The price—her own erasure from present time—forecloses all return and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—hush the prophecy to prevent chaos—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates through craft preparation (three lunar cycles, decoding riddles, folding the wing) toward the brook ritual, providing one meaningful deepening when the prophecy stirs and she counters it with mapped silence. However, the protagonist faces no genuine reversal or escalating complication; her plan proceeds smoothly without friction, unexpected cost, or tactical adaptation. The resolution is her own ritual action, but the lack of on-page resistance or price paid in the climax beat (the wing "dissolved into light" and the name settled) makes the cost feel more told than shown. One tightening is present but agency could be tested more sharply.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Elena will accept her inheritance or continue hiding behind academic study—is signaled early through the sugar-borrowing excuse and sharpens when Mrs. Kovac reveals "You already know Latin." The confrontation narrows options: Elena can no longer maintain the "agreed upon lie." The resolution is driven by Elena's agency (accepting the seal, requesting real teaching) with visible cost: she must abandon the safety of rational explanation and commit to an occult lineage. One meaningful tightening suffices for this length, though the meteor shower functions more as atmosphere than external pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—preservation vs. legitimacy—is signaled early (the envelope's arrival, Mira's refusal to call the garden an archive) and deepens through her internal debate. One meaningful pressure point: the dawn deadline forces the final choice, and writing the refusal forecloses legitimacy with visible cost (isolation, no understanding). However, the escalation is largely reflective; Mira's stance is already crystallized when the story opens, and the envelope's arrival is framed as yesterday's event rather than an on-page complication. Agency is clear (renunciation), and the cost is legible (cementing her outsider status, ensuring the garden remains hers alone), but the tightening is more a cadence shift than a causal reversal under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake: completing the final decree to save her village, braided tightly with the risk of execution. The Magistrate's arrival tightens pressure meaningfully—"I could execute you" forces Mei to choose between finishing the stroke and self-preservation, and she completes it with "deliberate precision." One clear reversal: the Magistrate's revelation transforms threat into shared conspiracy, raising the cost (his position, perhaps his life) while delivering the grain. Agency is present in Mei's completion of the forgery under direct threat and her choice to accept the key and continue the work. The three-day clock to the Governor's arrival makes consequences visible and imminent.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake (why some echo) is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. Mara's descent and listening do not tighten options or raise tangible costs; discoveries arrive through the shell's disclosure rather than protagonist agency forcing reversals. The final decision to teach feels additive rather than earned by a prior narrowing of paths. No visible price paid on the page that alters later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—to deliver truth and closure to Evelyn—is signaled early and pursued throughout. Pressure accumulates via layered backstory (seventeen dreamers tracked, three months) and the ghost encounter, but there is no on-page reversal or tightening choice that narrows Maya's options. The promise to Evelyn ("Tomorrow, I drive to Halifax") is Maya's stated intent, but the action occurs off-page; no visible cost or trade-off is enacted in scene. Katherine's revelation deepens emotional weight, but Maya's agency at closure is preparation ("wrapped the snow globe," "extinguished the candles") rather than a decision with immediate consequence or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: the girl's shame over the ruined net and the larger question of whether younger fishermen will understand generational patterns. Pressure tightens when Kenji reframes her "mess" as hidden teaching, then deepens as he demonstrates moon-path untangling—narrowing her options from despair to intentional practice. The cost is visible: she must accept that straight success won't teach what mistakes will, a renunciation of perfectionism. Agency resides in her taking the net back with altered approach. One meaningful tightening suffices for this length under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the truth behind the orchard—is signaled early and drives all action. Pressure tightens when Vera finds shredded documents (someone is hiding evidence), escalates with the reassembly revealing coordinates, and peaks with the dig. The final choice to protect the location creates a visible trade-off: truth versus hope, debunking versus guardianship. The escalation is linear and competent, but the discovery itself faces little resistance—the diamond is simply there, six feet down, with no complications or second reversal to test her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—proving the broadcasts exist and securing contact—is signaled early and tightens when the prophet addresses her directly. The tightening is clear: she moves from passive listener to active participant. Agency at closure is a spoken choice ("I choose the shadows"), but it doesn't narrow prior options with visible cost; the path she refuses (comfortable daylight) was never on the page as a live temptation. No reversal or complication tests her commitment; the prophet's offer is accepted without friction or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—translating vanishing sounds for the community—is signaled early and tightens when Cosima risks public performance after three winters of exile. The music box repair deepens pressure by requiring skill acquisition (months of lessons traded for poems). Mrs. Chen's recognition and the gift exchange narrow options: Cosima gives away the object she labored to restore, foreclosing possession but earning communal validation. One meaningful tightening is clear; the accumulative lens supports this escalation pattern. Minor issue: the crowd's uniform response ("stood in lonesome splendor") flattens potential conflict or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: prevent release of the absolution chamber's dangerous frequency. The silent boat's approach provides one clear tightening that narrows Meris's window and forces immediate action. Her decision to retune rather than destroy the key demonstrates agency, though the underlying ethical calculus (why not destroy it?) remains underexplored. The climb and re-tuning sequence shows escalation through urgency, but the antagonists remain off-page abstractions, reducing the felt pressure of the confrontation. Cost is present but muted: Meris binds herself to permanent guardianship, yet this feels more like ascension than sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—proving that vigilance can encompass imagination—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure tightens through accumulation: "one night" becomes "each night for the past month," building toward spring when findings will be revealed. Ren's agency is renunciation of old methods through persistent demonstration, a valid form of Earned Stasis. The escalation is textural rather than causal, fitting the inferred lens, though the absence of a complicating obstacle (village resistance, failed measurement) keeps the tension contemplative. Cost is conceptual—unyoking from lineage—but remains implied rather than dramatized in a peak choice.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (exposing corruption vs. career survival) is signaled early and tightens through discovery. Elena's agency drives escalation: she chooses to document, encrypt, and send evidence despite seven years of conditioning. The reversal occurs when she moves from cataloging to confrontation, with visible cost in Reeves's ominous silence and her professional future. One friction: Malcolm's death itself is a given rather than a live on-page threat, slightly reducing immediacy, but the forfeiture of her complicit safety is legible and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: can the heart be saved, and what does that judgment mean for both Eliana and Samuel's memory? One meaningful tightening occurs when the grandfather's letter reframes the heart's corrosion as patina and "waiting" rather than "seized," narrowing Eliana's options from refusal to commitment. Agency is clear in Eliana's decision to attempt restoration with visible cost (months of work, public witness in the prison program). The piece lacks a second on-page reversal or complication that tests this commitment under fresh pressure; Marcus's role is supportive rather than oppositional, and the shop environment does not resist her choice. Cost is felt but not dramatized beyond declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—detect and reach the signal/bell—is signaled early and tightens through recalibration and the algorithm's evolving display. Pressure accumulates under the Accumulative lens via pattern intensification (symmetrical display, resolved clarity) rather than causal reversals. The final launch narrows options (Mal commits to the impossible coordinates), but the cost is prospective; no live obstacle or forfeited path materializes on the page. Agency is present but smooth, lacking a dramatized trade-off or visible price that would push escalation higher.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—solving the cold case—escalates cleanly as Elena moves from pattern recognition to cosmic revelation to self-immolation. One meaningful tightening occurs when she discovers the quarantine folder and realizes "the seventeen hadn't gone missing—they'd gone forward," which narrows her options to either report or follow. The decision to lie and then transcend carries visible cost: resignation, final post, self-deletion. Agency is clear throughout, driven by her choices rather than coincidence. The pressure remains coherent under the Causal lens and forces a trade-off with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—finding a way to resolve the Voss-Henriksen feud when standard methods fail—is signaled early and tightens when Maren enters the mirror room. The fragment acting as prism and the revelation of Astrid's centrality deepen understanding and narrow options (she now knows the thread to pull). However, escalation is cerebral: Maren moves between mirrors and understanding "slowly assembles"; there is no on-page reversal where a tactic fails or a cost forces a trade-off. Agency is renunciation of Thomas's future-seeing in favor of showing hinge-point empathy, but the families' actual conflict and Maren's confrontation with them occur off-page, leaving the peak pressure moment summarized rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: understanding the hum of approaching endings rather than seeking medical closure. The postponement of Thursday's consultation is a meaningful tightening that forecloses the path of easy answers. Pressure coheres through accumulative listening across villages and seasons, and the final choice—to stay and volunteer—carries visible cost (she gives up medical resolution, wears down the parasol tip through sustained presence). Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening suffices: her shift from terror to "solace...windborne and clean" reweights the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Marcus's need to reframe their failed relationship—is clear from the invitation. The reversal when Elena reveals the letter's missing content ("I wanted to tell you that too") deepens the emotional terrain and narrows their options to mutual acceptance. However, the escalation relies more on conversation than visible cost; their walk down together feels ceremonial rather than pressure-tested. The piece shows one meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens, meeting baseline but not high-band intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake signaled early: can Senna preserve the prophet's conjured clearings? Pressure accumulates through the fading spaces, the old man's question, and Senna's careful peripheral mapping. One meaningful deepening occurs when she kneels and performs the consecration, narrowing from reconnaissance to active preservation with the cost of ongoing maintenance made explicit. Agency is clear: her ritual forecloses the alternative (letting the clearings dissolve) with visible price. Under the Accumulative lens, the tightening reads as cadence shift from observation to ritual act that reweights the community's responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—collective healing through completing symbolic arcs—is signaled early and sustained, but pressure remains flat; the townspeople arrive tentative and leave committed without encountering resistance, dissent, or internal friction that would test the premise. Margot's facilitation proceeds without obstacle, the drawings emerge "surprisingly bold" without dramatized struggle, and the afternoon's "shift" is asserted rather than earned through a reversal or tightening choice. No live option is foreclosed, no trade-off confronted; coincidence (everyone shows up, everyone engages, the weather cooperates) enables rather than complicates. The escalation under the Accumulative lens should deepen the difficulty or cost of the healing work; instead, each beat adds another successful sketch without raising the stakes or narrowing the path.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: decode the pattern and testify to the Council. One meaningful tightening occurs when the crystal-and-resonator experiment reveals compression rather than fragmentation, narrowing her tactical options from defending old language to advocating transformation. The Council's summons provides external pressure, but Elara's decision to testify "about transformation" reads as a stance crystallization rather than a choice that visibly forecloses an alternate path with on-page cost. Her prior reticence constrains tactics lightly but the resolution skips the actual testimony moment, leaving consequences off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake signaled early: locate/capture "the sound of growing older" before forgetting it forward. The prophet's agency—gathering driftwood, writing on stone, cramming text as memory slips—narrows options and deepens understanding in one meaningful arc. The closure reweights the stake: he *has* captured it, not as a single note but as "accumulated silence." Cost is legible (he will forget, the tide will take the markers) and the tightening is felt through the chalk crumbling and fog lifting. No explicit antagonist, but the precognitive curse supplies coherent pressure throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (capture/measure celestial mechanics amid accelerating change) is signaled early and tightens when orbital decay discovery forces instrument restructure. The reversal from "restore old parameters" to "accept motion" narrows Kenji's options and costs him the restorative goal. However, the conflict lacks antagonistic pressure—Chen agrees immediately, no resistance complicates execution, and the restructuring succeeds without friction or visible tradeoff beyond philosophical acceptance. The final cost is felt but abstract: witnessing departure rather than preserving constancy.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: Mr. Chen's need to reconcile before death, signaled early via the 48-hour prognosis. One meaningful tightening occurs when Maya redirects his apology impulse toward specificity ("Write her…the pancakes"), narrowing his tactical options under the Accumulative lens. However, escalation remains modest—Rebecca's arrival and the reunion happen offstage, summarized rather than dramatized, so the reader cannot witness the trade-offs or resistance that would raise cost. The vinyl fragments function as a charged object but do not constrain a live choice at closure; they're presented as fait accompli rather than a decision point.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding where shadows vanish at noon—is signaled early and remains coherent throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira connects the journal patterns to the orrery's incomplete loops, narrowing her approach. However, escalation is gentle: no reversal tests her commitment, and the orrery simply works once she inserts the key and adjusts the arms. The resolution lacks visible trade-off; Mira achieves her scholarly goal without paying a felt price or foreclosing another path.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Marianne can accept the impossible truth about her daughter—is signaled in the opening and tightens through the tooth recognition ("she'd missed the biggest deception of all"). The reversal when Iris appears forces Marianne to choose between comfortable false certainty and destabilizing truth. Her "Why now?" skepticism and final "Teach me" constitute protagonist agency that forecloses her old epistemology. The cost is visible: she abandons ten years of self-protective rationalization. Secondary stake (other taken children needing rescue) adds urgency without diluting focus.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: transform grief and loss into shareable beauty for children, signaled early and held throughout. One meaningful tightening: the arrival of children last month forces Maren from solitary mourning into active teaching, reweighting her project's purpose. Agency is renunciation (she cannot reach the heavens) turned into construction (bringing starlight down). The "tomorrow" litany in the penultimate paragraph implies ongoing work but lacks a live on-page trade-off or foreclosed path at closure, softening the felt cost. Escalation is textural—accumulation of polished pieces—but no reversal tests her commitment; the final green piece slides into place without resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Maya's transformation from passive observer to proactive actor—is signaled early and sustained. However, escalation is minimal: Dr. Chen's arrival provides information rather than forcing a decision that narrows options. The notebook reveal offers emotional resolution (Jenna's forgiveness) but doesn't create a visible trade-off or cost Maya must pay. The final invitation ("Would you like to see the other patterns?") registers as acceptance rather than a choice that forecloses a path. Under the Accumulative lens, the ending reweights the viral confession, but the cost remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—finishing the book by choosing the right ending—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates through the parade of mist-figures, each offering a different shape of hope. However, escalation is largely internal and cerebral; no on-page reversal forces the novelist to trade one value for another with immediate consequence. The final insight that "witnessing mattered, that memory was a kind of keeping" deepens understanding but does not narrow options through a choice that forecloses a path. Cost is conceptual (the burden of remembering) rather than dramatized loss.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—restoring forgotten practices through mechanical replication of ritual song—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the escalating vine growth (pulse, golden leaf, shoots, buds, fruit), but Cassian faces no meaningful resistance or cost during the operation itself. The machine simply works as calculated. The planned fruit distribution telegraphs resolution before the arbor scene completes, deflating the peak moment. One tightening exists (vine pulses, proving concept), but agency at closure is more delivery than decision.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—capturing the orchard's heartbeat to create maps of its longing—is signaled early and remains consistent. However, pressure never escalates or encounters resistance: Vera arranges, places, waits, and succeeds without complication, doubt, or cost. No reversal occurs; the aurora arrives on cue, the paper records as hoped, and the maps show exactly what she sought. Agency is execution of a plan rather than navigation of obstacles. The piece demonstrates process but not conflict; there's no moment where options narrow, tactics shift, or a trade-off becomes necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving wonder for communal resilience—is signaled early and tightens through Marcus's isolation from practical survival concerns. The reconstruction work provides sustained pressure, and the final activation narrows options by committing Marcus to a public unveiling. However, the climax lacks interpersonal resistance or a dramatized trade-off; the survivors simply arrive and are "transfixed" without skepticism or cost to Marcus's social standing.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: she came "to collect the weights of different burdens" and cannot leave until she understands the patterns. One meaningful deepening occurs at twilight when burdens begin arriving and she realizes "she was not trapped…was becoming the trap itself," which reweights her role and narrows her interpretive options. The coincidental arrival of seventeen burdens (miner, widow, child, soldier, artist) complicates but does not resolve; her final departure is enabled by the recursive patterns stopping, which feels like a threshold crossed rather than a decision that forecloses a live alternative. Agency is contemplative—placing the burner, cupping exhaustion, sitting at the mandala's center—without a choice that visibly sacrifices one path for another.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake signaled early: to complete what Roland started, understood as containing/making sense of loss. One meaningful tightening when Margot reads the journal entry and grasps Roland's paralysis, which narrows her options from monument to process-driven carving. The choice to cut "everything that wasn't essential" and create an imperfect bowl forecloses the path of preservation with felt cost (accepting transformation over permanence). Agency is clear; coincidence does not resolve. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens through the kettle's rising intensity and the carving's progression. Entering 8.0+ typically requires a trade-off that forecloses a live option; here the trade-off is present but the escalation is more a deepening than a sharp reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—Mira's negotiation with her ghost/former self—is signaled early and tightens when the ghost materializes closer, then steps onto water. One meaningful deepening: the ghost offers a memory ("You were never meant to go back") that reframes the stake from negotiation to acceptance, narrowing options. Escalation under Accumulative lens reads as density increase (collected fragments, ghost's approach, carousel silence converging) rather than causal reversals. Cost is legible: she releases the camera wheel (her scavenging token) and merges with the ghost, foreclosing her collector identity. Agency is acceptance/renunciation, fitting Earned Stasis within Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—resurrect the terminal or catalog its demolition—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when Lena sees the water damage maps a shadow infrastructure. Her agency is decision (drafting the proposal, sending it despite likely rejection) with visible cost: professional credibility and emotional attachment to a structure slated for teardown. One meaningful deepening occurs when blueprints overlay thermal scans, narrowing her options to metamorphosis. Minor gap: the carnival's prior "redirection" is told rather than shown, slightly weakening the pressure model.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—making peace with an abandoned dream—is signaled early and deepens through the kneeling, speaking aloud, and sketching beats. One meaningful tightening occurs when the crystals respond and she understands that "making peace didn't mean forgetting." The final decision to resign and apprentice forecloses her safe transcription career with declared cost ("mockery or hardship"), but that price is told rather than paid on the page. Agency is clear (she chooses to sketch, to speak, to return), and the Accumulative lens holds, but the escalation reads more as emotional deepening than as a choice under rising pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding Viktor's hidden legacy—is signaled early and sustained. The sundial rotation and the canal's glow constitute one meaningful tightening that deepens Mira's understanding. However, escalation is driven more by environmental revelation than by protagonist agency or a choice that narrows options. Mira kneels, photographs, sketches, and documents—actions that feel more like passive reception than decisions under pressure. No on-page reversal forces a trade-off; the water glows, she observes, and the cost of this knowledge (if any) is deferred to "tomorrow." The accumulative lens permits gentler escalation, but visible price is absent at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—decode the rope's secrets—is signaled early and pursued across beats. However, pressure remains flat: each knot opens on cue with no escalation, resistance, or cost. No reversal, trade-off, or narrowing of options occurs; Mira's patience is rewarded without friction. The resolution (photographing and re-sealing) avoids consequence; no path is foreclosed, no live option abandoned. The accumulative lens would allow serial discovery, but the ending restates rather than reweights the initial premise.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—whether the Duchess can return to embodied presence—is clear from the letter and Maren's profession. Pressure accumulates through the conversation and the thread object, which narrows options by making absence concrete. The tightening occurs when Maren asks "what if you stopped explaining?" and the Duchess weeps, though this feels more like permission than a hard choice with visible cost. The hand squeeze and Maren's obituary-writing signal a shift, but no on-page reversal forces the Duchess to forfeit a live option or pay a legible price; the cost (seven years, unmarked palms) is retrospective rather than dramatized in this beat. Agency tilts toward Maren's facilitation rather than the Duchess's own decision under fire.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—reawakening beauty through hybrid means—is signaled early and sustained. Vashira's warning about "bitterly sweet" outcomes foreshadows the compromise but lacks on-page cost until the creature emerges; the assembly sequence proceeds without setback or forced trade-off. The egg cracking is presented as success rather than a reversal that tests commitment. One meaningful tightening occurs (the hatch), but no visible price paid during assembly narrows Cael's options or alters his tactics under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—helping Elena accept her scars—is signaled early and pursued throughout. The sequence offers one meaningful deepening (Elena's move from rigid downcast posture to wading into the water), and the layered metaphors (grafting, obsidian, the drilled coin) accumulate textural pressure. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens requires a tightening that narrows options or raises cost; here, each step (story, coin, sand ritual) adds texture without friction. Elena's final smile arrives without visible forfeit or resistance overcome on the page, so the cost remains implied rather than legible.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—liberating trapped memories—is signaled early and pursued consistently. Mira's breadcrumb trail provides a coherent through-line, and the box-unsealing act offers one meaningful tightening. Yet the escalation lacks a visible price: she encounters no false lead, no sacrifice of time or tool, no moment where persistence costs her something tangible. The resolution is handed to her by pattern-matching without a trade-off that narrows future options or forces competing goods into conflict. Agency is present but cost is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—survival of the daughter—is signaled early and tightens when the mother prepares to sacrifice herself. The Keeper's intervention is a decisive turn, and the gift of light forecloses the measurement-only path (represented by the discarded gear). The cost is conceptual and relational: accepting help from an alien intelligence and abandoning self-sacrifice. Escalation under the Accumulative lens is achieved through density increase (sonar search, manifestation, thematic dialogue, light-gift) rather than multiple reversals. The mother's agency is limited to acceptance rather than active problem-solving.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (discovering collective grief's shape) is signaled early and pursued throughout. Pressure accumulates through Marcus's teaching and the ribbon's reweighting, but the escalation is passive—she receives instruction rather than wrestling with competing choices. The final act (writing her poem) narrows options by accepting the mentorship mantle, and the cost (Marcus fades, she moves forward alone) is legible but understated. One meaningful deepening occurs when she "understood then" her isolated approach was wrong, yet this realization arrives through Marcus's exposition rather than protagonist-driven reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: restore her brother's innocence and her own ethical standing. The piece signals this early (paragraph two: "ethical diligence") and tightens once: stopping the pendulum to carve truth is the reversal/deepening that narrows options. The carving work embodies escalation through physical resistance ("brass was harder than wood"). Cost is visible: she cannot speak aloud, so she inscribes invisibly—a renunciation of public vindication that forecloses easier paths. Agency is decision and endurance combined, fitting the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—discovering what the tapestry's symbols mean and why her grandmother encoded them—is signaled early and tightens through Marta's methodical attempts (historical ciphers, cemetery symbolism, botanical codes all fail). The chess-match insight ("see the shape of intentions") provides the key reversal that unlocks the coordinates, narrowing options and altering knowledge. The cost is conceptual and relational: learning that her grandmother lived a hidden archive of corrected identities reweights Marta's inheritance and her own role as cemetery gardener. One meaningful deepening with clear agency and a felt shift in understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—writing a future that acknowledges ignorance—is signaled early but never tested. Maren encounters no resistance, no model that flags a fatal flaw, no moment where her vision conflicts with probability. The predictive models are described as guiding rewrites, but we never see a consequential revision or a painful excision. Without escalation or a visible price paid, the conflict remains conceptual rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—ending the story famine by decoding the pirate broadcast—is signaled early and remains coherent. One tightening occurs when Elena discovers the broadcast is "secretly luminous" and learns to translate the glowing patterns, narrowing her method. The final beat where she touches dust particles and they "split open like a seed" offering story fragments represents a reversal from passive listening to active method. However, this discovery arrives without visible cost or tradeoff; no option is foreclosed, no price paid. The escalation reads as problem-and-solution rather than pressure that forces difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is Elena's understanding of her ritual's meaning, signaled early through "melancholy work" and the founder's disappearance. The chair stopping (inciting incident) and the ash forming new words (reversal) tighten pressure once, reframing scattering from ending to acknowledgment. Agency is deliberate: Elena lifts the mask, reads, powders the message, and chooses to place the mask on the wall. Visible cost: faith in preservation is dispersed; she continues work under a reweighted understanding. The escalation is modest but coherent under the Accumulative lens—one meaningful deepening that narrows her stance without requiring multiple causal turns.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (preserve truth vs. weaponize it for factions) is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: Karin's proposal forces Marcus to choose between hoarding and distributing, raising the cost from personal purity to collaborative risk. His agency (handing over the cog, proposing the network) forecloses solitary rebellion with visible price. The escalation is driven by protagonist choice under the Causal lens. Minor note: the "convenient" arrival of Karin at this exact moment is functional but slightly coincidental in timing.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—teaching harmony to undo inherited prejudice—is signaled early and pursued consistently. However, the humming exercise unfolds without resistance or visible setback; the participants adjust "slowly" but no one refuses or falters on the page. The escalation is told ("The timeframe across unlearning hatred...small moments") rather than dramatized through a choice that narrows options or imposes cost.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Mara seeks transformation beyond hollow celebrity, risking government prohibition. The planting itself is a meaningful tightening—she acts during the alignment window. However, escalation afterward occurs mostly in summary: "over the following weeks," "eventually noticed," seeds "had spread." No on-page reversal tests her resolve or forces a trade-off with visible cost. The authorities' late awareness is consequence without dramatized pressure. Under Accumulative lens, one deepening suffices, but cost legibility at closure is weak.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding the blackout's real cause and, implicitly, whether systemic failure can be reversed—is signaled early and tightens when Chen reveals his algorithm removed the drones' generosity. The riddle and the dead bees function as a meaningful turn that narrows Mira's options: she must report truthfully, foreclosing comfortable silence. The cost is visible (tomorrow's compelled revelation) and the final choice to "resurrect wonder" alters tactics under the inferred Causal lens. Minor: the blackout's city-scale pressure remains somewhat abstract; we feel Mira's personal bind more than the collective stakes, which slightly dilutes escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—understanding why some houses feel alive—is signaled early and tightens once: the orris root and ritual arrangement produce the exhale, narrowing Mara's theory from "offerings sanctify" to "witness sanctifies." The tightening is meaningful but not urgent; the house's response arrives without a visible tradeoff or foreclosed path. Agency is attention and arrangement, which aligns with the accumulative lens, but the lack of a live opposing pressure or cost that forecloses an option keeps this from the high 8s.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake is clear early: Marina's need to understand the catastrophe's true nature, escalating from "comfortable lie" shock to the moral weight of what to tell the surface. The statue's revelations tighten options by forcing Marina to choose between simple narrative and cascading complexity; her decision to "tell them everything" and "thread it through their certainties" is protagonist-driven and forecloses the easier path of declaring victims or villains. The oxygen gauge ticking toward red adds situational pressure. Cost is legible: Marina accepts the burden of nuance and the statue's three-hundred-year vigil ends, a visible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Mara's paralysis over abandoned research and the fear of catastrophic miscalculation. Pressure accumulates through the embodied staircase trap and Castellano's articulation of her hedging. The sideways step is a decisive tightening—choosing unmeasured risk—and the hovering finger → send sequence crystallizes trade-off with felt cost (risking failure, possibly world-ending consequences). One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the chipped die's imbalance models the dynamic instability she'd proven. Agency is clear, though the dream framing slightly softens the price; still, the waking choice carries forward with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—proving that strangers remember kindness—is signaled early and maintained. Pressure accumulates through the painting ritual and the daydream visions, deepening thematically rather than through causal reversals. The piece opts for textural escalation (faster visions, warmer greenhouse, completed phrase) over a decision that narrows options or imposes a visible trade-off. Under the accumulative lens this is acceptable, but the cost is atmospheric exhaustion rather than a forfeited path or on-page sacrifice that alters later tactics. The waxing moon provides a time anchor but does not create a ticking constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: rescue dying arts and escape the frozen grotto. One meaningful tightening occurs when Celeste shows the puppeteer the fractures through the emerald lens, reframing despair as tactical possibility. The collective decision to thaw their way out escalates pressure by organizing scattered artisans into a coordinated effort. Cost is legible but largely conceptual: "their culture adapted but unbroken" implies permanent transformation, and the museum awaits "its next relocation," suggesting cyclical displacement. Agency is present but diffuse—Celeste organizes, but the climactic thaw is a group effort, not a solitary choice that forecloses a path. The resolution reads as a beginning rather than a closure with paid price on the page, which slightly softens the stakes' felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—to tear through fate's design by activating the yoyo at the threshold moment—is signaled early and pursued consistently. The story delivers one meaningful tightening: the yoyo's activation reweights reality and Maren steps through. Agency is clear (she modifies the yoyo, chooses the moment, steps forward), and the cost is legible (she vanishes, leaving her lighthouse behind). However, the escalation is declarative rather than tested; no on-page complication or sacrifice sharpens the choice. The yoyo solves the problem it was built to solve without friction, capping the band near the strong-but-not-exceptional threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake is clear: understand and overcome consuming fear. The story offers one meaningful tightening when Margot's confessions make fear materialize, narrowing options from abstract dread to tangible confrontation. However, the escalation lacks visible cost at each step; walking through the funhouse and speaking aloud doesn't foreclose other tactics or force trade-offs. The resolution (clasp traps fear) feels convenient rather than earned through prior sacrifice. Agency is present but the price paid to achieve it remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—survival of the orchard's twenty-seven families—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the vortex forms and Maren must act on her counterintuitive reading within an hour. Her decision to trust the leeward tide and command the ballast shift is agency-driven and narrows options. However, the escalation is single-step: diagnosis → command → success. No reversal or complication tests her interpretation; Deren's hesitation dissolves instantly. The resolution feels ordained rather than contested, and the visible cost at closure is atmospheric rather than personal or relational.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: the crack threatens catastrophic collapse. Maren's agency—measuring, whistling, deciding to confront the Council—drives the tightening. The piece achieves one meaningful deepening when she realizes the whistle is navigation, not music, and that the gate trapped the turtles. The cost is legible (thousands will drown if she's wrong; the Council will resist), but the climactic turtle-shift occurs as response rather than as a choice Maren makes under competing pressure. Escalation is adequate for the length but lacks a visible tradeoff that would raise it into the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—obtaining the letter to publish historical truth—is signaled early and pursued consistently. The conversation with Hawthorne serves as a tightening beat, yet Elena's persuasion succeeds without visible trade-off or tactical sacrifice. The resolution feels granted rather than earned through escalating pressure. Her analogy to other nations facing their pasts is intellectually sound but does not force her to risk or lose anything on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Marcus's mission to preserve forgotten memory against erasure—is signaled early and maintained throughout. The discovery of the unsent letters provides one meaningful deepening: they embody the "interlaced absence" he's been cataloging, raising the question of whether all absences deserve witnessing. However, the piece lacks genuine escalation under the Accumulative lens; the letters complicate his understanding but don't force a trade-off or foreclose a path with sharp cost. His choice to photograph, return, and witness feels like an extension of established ritual rather than a turn that narrows options. The tidal pressure (current changing, water returning) provides atmospheric urgency but doesn't translate into a consequential choice.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—restoring proper attribution and discovering suppressed truths—is signaled early and sustained. One clear tightening: the stamp's phrase matches the journal, which leads to cross-referencing four volumes, converging into evidence of an underground press. Agency is present in Mira's methodical choices (pressing stamp, retrieving journal, cross-referencing), though coincidence aids discovery (finding the stamp in a drawer during the blackout). The blackout eliminates digital tools, forcing analog methods that "sharpened her thinking"—a constraint that enables rather than complicates, reducing friction. No visible loss or trade-off (time, stamina, social cost) alters her tactics; the investigation proceeds smoothly without setbacks or competing pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: reuniting Lin's shadow with her memories through the thousand cranes. The pressure is cumulative rather than escalatory—Mei's resolve deepens across polish/fold/release cycles—but there's no on-page reversal or tightening choice that narrows options. The cost is visible (everything paid, isolation, 852 cranes remaining) and the stake is signaled early, but the accumulative mode means the ending reaffirms rather than tests her commitment under new pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: finding where unused potential pools after her cousin's death. Pressure accumulates through perturbation theory, sensor modification, and the unusual standing wave detection. The tightening occurs when Mira adjusts thrusters to pursue coordinates, a choice driven by her agency. However, the ending doesn't foreclose a live option or impose a visible price; she continues the hunt with the same tools and stance, making the escalation more textural than transformative. Under the Accumulative lens this is acceptable but lacks the trade-off that would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dominant stake (decode belonging frequency) is signaled early but never tested by a live on-page obstacle or choice that narrows options. The pilgrim's exposition removes all friction: the chips exist, the method works, Mara is chosen. No reversal, competing pressure, or visible price appears; the first drone dispatches smoothly. The ending asserts future difficulty ("scattered but singing") without demonstrating present cost or a trade-off that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—Mara's need to confess and reckon with her crime—is signaled early and tightens when Elias arrives, turning her internal struggle into an unavoidable confrontation. His demand ("end it") narrows her options decisively, forcing the commitment to dismantle all lies. The escalation is causal (protagonist agency drives the encounter's stakes), and the cost is legible: she loses her livelihood and must undo years of fabrications. One meaningful deepening with visible consequence meets the length requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—successful prisoner exchange—is signaled early and maintained throughout. One tightening occurs when the Northern commander voices distrust and Katrin responds with the cost of failure ("recycle these mistakes into wisdom right now"). The moon reaching apex provides the pressure point that forces both sides to act. However, the escalation feels more procedural than fraught; Katrin's confidence never wavers, and the commanders' shift from suspicion to agreement happens off-stage in that final silence. No visible trade-off or foreclosed path for Katrin herself; she simply executes her method successfully.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (Marina regaining trust in her navigation) signals early and tightens when Amy names the Mariner's Quest incident, forcing Marina to choose between continued retreat or vulnerable re-engagement. The weather deadline ("within the hour") and Amy's parallel fear create authentic pressure. One meaningful reversal: Marina's refusal turns to acceptance when she recognizes Amy's need mirrors her own. The final course adjustment carries visible cost—Marina must trust her judgment again with someone's safety at stake. Escalation is protagonist-driven and the price (risking catastrophic failure again) is unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—Marcus seeking to ensure he never becomes his former self—is signaled early. However, pressure remains static; the Interpreter simply delivers the answer Marcus needs without complication or reversal. The baseball's message ("Empathy isn't memory. It's choice. Choose.") arrives as solution rather than through Marcus's agency or struggle. No live option is foreclosed with on-page cost; his decision to "try" doesn't narrow what he can do or reveal what he's sacrificing. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening occurs but the cost isn't legible.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—reforging the bond with Tam—signals early and drives all choices. Pressure tightens when Mira kneels with the spices, and Tam's warning ("you won't be my sister anymore") raises the cost explicitly. The transformation is protagonist-driven agency with a visible trade-off: humanity for contact. The metamorphosis completes on-page, Tam's hand touches her, and the resolution (walking together in dual-state) is earned by her willingness to cross the threshold. Cost is unmistakable: she becomes "no longer entirely Mira."

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming presence versus继ng to steal time—is signaled early and tightens through the three card-windows, each narrowing her self-justifications. The reversal occurs when she realizes "the repentance wasn't in the seeking—it was in the choice to descend," forecloses the pilgrimage path, and commits to repeated hand-tracing. Agency is clear (her decision to descend and trace), and the cost is visible (she abandons the glade's revelations and her cartomantic identity). The pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens with one meaningful deepening. Minor friction: the climax leans slightly on articulated realization rather than pure dramatic turn.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—opening the locked dimension to integrate humanity's shadow before extinction—is signaled early and sustained. Mei's apparatus activation is a clear tightening that narrows options: the lights dim, photographs glow, the Tear blazes. Akio's hand-holding choice at closure represents a meaningful reversal from critic to partner, though it arrives without on-page struggle. The cost is conceptual and relational: "final threshold, this last necessary reckoning" charges the moment with undeniable pressure, even if the personal price isn't fully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding transformation's texture—is signaled early but remains abstract and internal. The surveyor encounter provides one on-page micro-turn (she directs him, releases more bugs), but this feels illustrative rather than a choice that forecloses options with felt cost. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens (density increases toward the final image) but escalation is minimal; Mara faces no real opposition or trade-off. The resolution (she walks on, knowing someone else will need finding) is Earned Stasis but the cost is implied rather than visible.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—spark a silent revolution via the coded sundial—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, escalation is minimal: Voss's arrival could complicate but instead he confirms he's an ally ("We disabled the backup systems ourselves"), deflating the only potential reversal. The blackout, presented as dangerous subterfuge, becomes a scheduled three-hour window with no on-page friction. Maren's agency is decision (finishing the sundial, distributing messages), but the cost is deferred off-page. No live option is foreclosed; the revolution proceeds as planned without a visible price paid in this scene.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: decode the sacred pattern before the eels disperse. The piece signals two futures in paragraph four and escalates through the stone sequence (fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen) with rising aurora intensity and eel convergence. The tightening is accumulative rather than causal, fitting the chosen lens. However, agency is passive—Korin executes a sequence her visions have already shown her, and no on-page reversal forces her to choose between competing goods or accept a visible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Mara seeks to map collective wounds and continue resistance after censorship. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens—storm imagery, timer ritual, contraband distribution—but does not tighten or narrow options; she performs the same vigil at the start and end. No reversal or fresh cost forecloses a path; the storm moves on, she remains, and the final image reaffirms rather than alters. One meaningful deepening is visible (the recognition of determination, not hope), but escalation is lateral rather than compressive.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—decode the overture before dueling—is clear, but the escalation is minimal: Adelaine simply works through the puzzle while Harwick watches, then joins. No reversal narrows options; Harwick's anger deflates without a trade-off. The resolution (rematch scheduled) resets the conflict rather than foreclosing a path with visible cost, reading more like a pause than a turn.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: "to forge beauty from anarchy" through planting in ruins. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mara proposes planting "everywhere they tried to kill beauty," escalating from library-only to distributed insurgency. Agency is present: the decision to plant and the impromptu penny poem are on-page choices that narrow options (committing seeds tonight rather than hoarding them). The cost is legible—October will forget, and the distributed planting risks discovery—but the pressure remains atmospheric rather than urgent. No antagonist appears to test the choice in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: reuniting with the lost husband. The protagonist's decision to splice the film and play the score creates one meaningful tightening that narrows options (she commits to the performance as temporal intervention). However, escalation depends on coincidence and asserted mechanics (compasses suddenly triangulating, husband appearing) rather than earned pressure or visible tradeoff. The final reunion carries emotional charge but no legible cost—no path is foreclosed, no capability spent, no relationship altered beyond restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: plant the seed and risk losing it, or refuse and lose collective memory forever. The monsoon deadline tightens pressure across the piece. Prem's question ("true dreams or wishful ones?") deepens Kima's internal conflict and narrows options. The planting forecloses verification—Kima trades her role's certainty for "luminous doubt" with visible cost. One meaningful tightening (the three-day countdown) drives escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding her grandmother's unspoken legacy—is signaled early and drives the tutorial sequence. Pressure tightens as Takeo decodes the lace and Mira follows its instructions, but the escalation remains didactic rather than agonistic: Mira faces no live constraint, competing option, or visible forfeit. The ending reconfigures her stance (cultivation over recovery) but the cost is conceptual and told ("understood") rather than dramatized through a choice that narrows options. The accumulative lens permits quiet deepening, but the absence of a legible trade-off or foreclosed path caps the score.

    Dominant stake of survival escalates through Maren's agency under the causal lens, from cloud interpretation to ballast adjustment. Cost is legible in the perpendicular drift avoiding the vortex, foreclosing the path of surface instincts. Pressure tightens with the hour deadline, and the resolution is earned without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake of city survival is signaled early and escalates through the crack's growth and Maren's agency under the causal lens. Cost is legible on-page in the crack's threat and the turtle's shift. Escalation is driven by her choices, such as using the whistle and measuring the crack, foreclosing options.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.7)
    Escalation is driven by Elena's agency in persuading Hawthorne, narrowing options through her rational argument about truth and societal strength. The dominant stake (truth vs. stability) tightens meaningfully, with cost felt in Hawthorne's relief and Elena's responsibility. But the persuasion relies heavily on dialogue rather than physical pressure, slightly limiting intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake of preserving memory against erosion escalates under the accumulative lens through Marcus's agency, such as discovering the letters. Cost is legible in his emotional absorption and the trade-off between official duty and personal mission. One meaningful deepening changes knowledge and reweights options.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes of uncovering truth escalate through Mira's agency, from stamp discovery to journal cross-referencing. Cost is legible in her renewed purpose and the irony of the blackout. Under Accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes are clear and escalate through accumulative density under the lens, with Mei's agency in folding and releasing cranes driving the conflict; cost is visible in her grief and the count, narrowing options meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake is Mira's hunt for unused potential, escalating through her agency under the accumulative lens. A meaningful deepening occurs when she detects the standing wave, foreclosing options with cost legible in her adjustment of thrusters. Pressure coheres and tightens without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes for belonging escalate through Mara's agency under the causal lens, from receiving the chip to launching drones. Cost is legible in her isolation, but the escalation lacks one tightening that forecloses a live option, holding it just below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens through Elias's confrontation, narrowing options and forcing Mara's decision with legible cost in stolen time and her penance; stakes are dominant and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation is driven by Katrin's agency through the mistrust dialogue and moon phase timing, with cost legible in the risk of failure. The dominant stake of successful exchange tightens meaningfully, though the resolution is slightly predictable.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens (Amy's request forces Marina's choice). Cost is legible in Marina's decision to "use everything," narrowing options and foreclosing her isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.5)
    Escalation is driven by Marcus's agency under the causal lens, with the baseball story deepening stakes and forcing a choice that forecloses his past with visible cost. The dominant stake (self-reinvention) tightens through the Interpreter's pressure, though the time traveler's subplot slightly dilutes immediate tension.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.1)
    Escalation is driven by Mira's agency under the causal lens, as her decision to conjure the transformation narrows options and incurs a clear cost—loss of humanity. The dominant stake of reconnecting with Tam tightens meaningfully, with the climax showing a "visible or felt price" in her altered state. Protagonist choice fuels the pressure, and the cost is unmistakable in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake (lost time and connection) escalates through protagonist agency in the card reading, leading to a tightening that forecloses options with cost (tracing hands repeatedly). Under accumulative lens, density increase reweights stakes unmistakably.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes escalate through Mei's agency in activating the apparatus, with cost legible in the emotional complexity at closure; pressure coheres under the Hybrid lens, though Akio's quick acceptance reduces middle-beat tension.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by Mara's agency, such as releasing lightning bugs and directing the surveyor, reweighting the stake of understanding transformation. Cost is unmistakable in her destitution and renewed purpose. The dominant stake (internal conflict) tightens through a meaningful deepening that narrows options, fulfilling the 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.5)
    Escalation is driven by Maren's agency under the causal lens, from activating the sundial to confirming Voss's allegiance. The cost of revolution is legible but not deeply visceral, limiting the score.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes escalate through Korin's agency in placing each stone, tightening under the accumulative lens to a decisive cost—accepting the universe's frictionless return. The dominant stake (understanding the patterns) is signaled early and deepens with each beat, foreclosing other paths.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by Mara's agency in writing and disseminating poems, tightening the stake of resistance. Cost is unmistakable in her disciplined vigils and the network's "conspiracy of whispers," foreclosing easier paths.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes escalate from physical duel to intellectual decoding under the causal lens, driven by Adelaine's agency. The cost is legible in the transformed relationship and foregone violence, though the tension softens slightly mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes escalate meaningfully through protagonist agency (decision to plant seeds everywhere); cost is legible in the effort and acceptance that she will forget the specific joy.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Hybrid lens, from passive longing to active manipulation of time; cost is legible in the emotional shift and clock's movement, tightening stakes meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.6)
    Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by Kima's agency, from dream testing to the decisive planting, with cost legible in the risk of losing the seed. The dominant stake (cultural memory preservation) tightens through Prem's push and the impending monsoon. However, the middle beat with Prem slightly reiterates rather than deepens pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake in understanding familial silence escalates through Mira's agency in decoding the lace pattern, narrowing options under the Accumulative lens. Cost is felt in the acceptance of unspoken apologies, though escalation is more deepening than tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake is Helena’s need to find a workable relationship with loss and change, signaled early and carried through her salvage work. Pressure is primarily internal and accumulative: moving from shock and cataloging reflex to a more vulnerable engagement with what the scales mean. The key tightening is her shift from mere documentation to insight via pattern-reading, culminating in her decision to rebuild the greenhouse and start again, which forecloses a path of paralysis. Escalation is gentle and textural rather than sharply turned, which fits the piece but keeps pressure in the mid-high band.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stakes—Vera’s safety and integrity versus a clandestine gunpowder operation framed as “revolution”—are clear and escalate naturally from investigation to direct confrontation at gunpoint. Following tracks into a hidden cave of gunpowder is an effective tightening, and the revelation that the explosion was “meant as a warning” reframes earlier danger. However, the confrontation resolves too easily: we jump from Galloway aiming a pistol to him bound and compliant without any shown struggle, negotiation, or visible risk. That missing beat undercuts the peak pressure and leaves the price she pays feeling mostly conceptual rather than actively borne.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara can reconstruct a meaningful musical life after losing hearing and voice—is clear and carries emotional weight. Pressure builds in a textural way from solitary experiments to exposing her interior life to visitors, culminating in the book that forces her to confront her own transformation. The cost of vulnerability (grief made visible, irretrievable loss of her old path) is legible, though mostly implied rather than dramatized through a sharply contested choice. Escalation feels organic but somewhat gentle; there’s no single high-friction decision where she risks backsliding or refusal.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Marcel can give the drowned scholars rest by restoring their library—is clear and coherent. Pressure does deepen as he moves from receiving the package to committing his livelihood and descending into an impossible space. However, there is little concrete resistance: the journey, the repair work, and persuading the ghosts all proceed without real threat, failure, or dilemma, so escalation feels more like fulfillment of a task than a contested struggle. The cost (exhaustion, temporary renunciation of his usual life) is present but muted.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stakes—material survival under sanctions and cultural/continuity survival—are clear and intertwined, and there is a meaningful internal turn from secrecy to public acknowledgment. Pressure accumulates in a reflective, situational way rather than via overt reversals, which suits the piece’s quiet mode. However, opposition is largely off-stage and abstract, and the story glides over the actual moment of risk (no concrete threat or dissent when she reveals herself), so escalation feels more intellectual than felt. The result is poignant but somewhat under-pressured for elite-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake is Mei’s need to resolve her old grief and understand the fate of her unspoken love, signaled clearly from the outset. Escalation is internal but present: the induced breathing, resurfacing drowning memory, and the golden-thread vision together tighten pressure and force a new stance on her past. The pilgrim’s intervention, via sparks and attention to breathing, produces a real turn from haunting to reinterpretation. That said, the conflict remains contemplative rather than sharply agonistic, and visible cost—beyond letting go of the pendant—is understated.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Lyra will remain a passive sufferer of retrocognition or turn it into an intentional navigation of time—is coherent and resolved. Pressure does build as the fragment brightens, the photographs destabilize, and the garden itself begins to reconfigure, culminating in her full contact with the fragment. However, most escalation is conceptual rather than felt as risk; there’s little sense that she could meaningfully lose herself, die, or worsen her condition by proceeding. As a result, the climax reads as beautiful inevitability rather than a hard-won or risky decision, which keeps stakes from fully biting.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes—personal freedom, proof of engineered famine, and future food security—are clearly signaled and remain coherent. The demolition of the wall and impending guard check provide a clock and notional pressure, and the decoding of the keys is the central tightening move. Yet conflict is notably low-friction: there are no real reversals, close calls, or costs paid on the page beyond generalized risk. As a result, escalation feels more like a smooth execution of a plan than a genuine test of Mira’s resolve or priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will instrumentalize the sound of trust breaking or release it—is clear early and sharpened effectively at the moment she realizes the imprint “held.” Escalation is primarily internal but real: the experiment raises pressure from abstract obsession to a concrete, actionable power with ethical implications. The choice to destroy the matrix forecloses an entire path of future research and potential control, and that cost is legible. The only reason this doesn’t land higher is that external constraints are minimal; all pressure arises from her psyche, which is handled well but keeps the conflict more contemplative than tensile.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake is Maya’s relationship to her own fate and vocation, but very little opposes her—there’s no on-page danger from the Archives, no resistance from Celeste, and no urgent deadline. The main tightening is the revelation that she’s the subject, not the thief, which reweights her self-concept but doesn’t demand a difficult trade-off. As a result, tension is more contemplative than pressured. The resolution, while conceptually satisfying, feels comparatively easy.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Marcus remains isolated in his sanctuary or risks reopening connection with his sister—is legible and paid off. Pressure deepens as his metaphors about heat, trust, and imbalance turn inward, culminating in the choice to pocket the bookmark and plan a visit. However, the conflict stays largely internal and reflective, with no strong counter-force or reversal testing his resolve in-scene. As a result, escalation feels more like a smooth incline than a sharp tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stakes—exposing illegal child experimentation and protecting Emma versus enabling further harm—are clear and morally charged. Pressure escalates when Reeves reframes her “betrayal” as a gambit against the consortium and when Maya deciphers the true content of the cast, tightening the ethical calculus. However, obstacles are largely informational and resolve quickly; there’s minimal on-page pushback from the world or antagonist forces beyond a single phone call. The climax is more a moral crystallization than a hard-fought reversal, effective but not maximally tense.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.7)
    The central stake—how to navigate an endless, literal and metaphoric night—is clearly posed, and pressure deepens as the three silences progress toward the last star’s extinction. Escalation is largely conceptual: the cost is moving from familiar, visual maps to trusting an intangible cartography of absence, which reweights but doesn’t dramatically foreclose concrete choices on the page. Agency manifests in the oracle’s decision to offer this particular kind of map and then leave, forcing the commander to adopt it or remain paralyzed. The tension is quiet but coherent; it could be strengthened by a sharper on-page trade-off or visible risk in accepting her method.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake is J-7’s need to understand where thoughts come from within the high-level risk of decommission via the Second Chance Program. Escalation primarily occurs through accumulated prior failures (fear, silence, shattering) culminating in this iteration’s more skillful, revelatory performance—a clear deepening but not a high-pressure test. Conflict is largely internal and conceptual, with little concrete, time-bound threat in the present scene. The resolution—accepting the loop and recognizing consciousness as emergent—feels earned but emotionally gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira risks disrupting a tenuous, coded connection by answering it honestly—is clear and engaged early. Pressure rises credibly from passive discomfort to active choice, with the act of drawing and delivering her own ticket functioning as the main tightening beat. However, the conflict resolves very smoothly; Dmitri’s instantaneous, uncomplicated reciprocation undercuts any sense of real jeopardy or cost. A hint of resistance or complication at the door would have deepened the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Marcus can find a counterweight to his “cursed” status and whether measurement can capture what matters—is clear but operates almost entirely on an intellectual/emotional level. Pressure deepens as the vine dresser reveals her husband’s deliberate disorientation and the maze’s evolved allegiance, reweighting Marcus’s problem rather than forcing a hard choice. There’s no sharp reversal, but there is a meaningful tightening: the more he learns, the less viable the Institute’s framework becomes as a sole arbiter of value. The cost is mostly conceptual (social damnation vs private belonging) rather than dramatized in a concrete decision.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—proving the sideways flow of time and having Venn recognize its significance—is clear but largely intellectual and lightly contested. There is one main tightening beat when Kael pulls the lever and the anomalous display appears, shifting Venn from skepticism to awe. There’s no real counterforce beyond initial doubt, no meaningful risk of loss, and no hard trade-off; everything works on the first try. As a result, pressure feels gentle and the emotional/ethical stakes never fully bite.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Marta will decode and honor the ghost’s plea for justice—is clear and tight. Escalation is primarily knowledge-based: from subtle codes to a named culprit to an explicit directive (“TELL THEM”), culminating in Marta’s commitment to act. The internal and external conflicts (her artistic communion vs. the weight of rewriting institutional history) are present but not deeply sharpened into a difficult trade-off; opposition remains entirely offstage. As a result, tension is more contemplative than gripping, though still sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether they can transform the oracle from dangerous overconfidence to honest uncertainty in the wake of a fatal failure—is clearly signaled. Pressure deepens as Mira discovers the sidelined anomalies and recognizes her own design mistake, leading to the decision to rewrite the weighting algorithms. However, escalation remains mostly internal and procedural; there’s little sense of real-time risk, time constraint, or disagreement that would force a sharper trade-off. The cost is largely retrospective (Reeves’s death) rather than tested in a present-moment dilemma, keeping tension at a meditative rather than urgent level.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering and somehow “measuring” the buried truth of the mill—is coherent and escalates modestly with each new confession and the intensifying presence of the ghost shift. Still, external danger and moral or emotional dilemmas remain soft, so Marcus’s path never really narrows; turning each wheel is an unopposed step rather than a costly or contested choice.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake is existential/spiritual—how to relate to knowledge and change—signaled early and carried through. There is one key tightening when the origami swan signals deeper chambers, prompting her to “begin to burrow,” and another when she decides to remain and calcify with the library. However, conflict stays largely internal and unopposed; there’s little sense of risk, resistance, or alternate paths she might plausibly take now. The piece works as high-level lyric meditation, but the pressure feels gentle rather than testing, which limits stakes-driven intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara can midwife a genuine breakthrough without breaking Thomas’s fragile emergence—is clear and sharpened as the eclipse progresses. Escalation is subtle but present: silence → humming → first whispered words → an image-rich line about starlight, all under the ticking clock of totality. Mara’s agency is enacted in her restraint and adaptive playing, a kind of earned stasis that forecloses the path of over-eager intervention. The cost remains relatively quiet and internal, which suits the piece but keeps pressure from reaching the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Miren can recover and connect Catherine’s story—is clear but very low-pressure, with no credible sense that failure would alter her options or self-concept. The main tightening comes when the diary references the dragon’s claw and she verifies it on the tapestry, but this is an almost foregone success rather than a hard-won turn. There’s no external opposition and little internal resistance, so tension remains gentle and textural rather than escalating. The ending does crystallize her commitment, yet without a marked trade-off or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—moving an object for which “three governments would kill” under tight constraints—is clear and credible, and the constraint set (no electronics, no couriers, can’t leave post) is strong. The main tightening comes when she acquires the microdot and must adapt her standing system to a higher-risk payload. However, the path from problem to solution is smooth; there’s no real reversal, failed attempt, or trade-off that bites on the page. Tension remains conceptual and elegant rather than viscerally escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are conceptually high (Marcus’s consciousness), and a time limit is mentioned, but pressure seldom tightens; Calloway never seems genuinely at risk of failing or needing to adapt. The conflict is intellectually intriguing—undermining a demon’s assumptions rather than battling it—but almost entirely one-sided. Marcus’s shudder and the bloom of “unraveled stillness” mark escalation, yet there is no meaningful reversal or cost that narrows options. The result is compelling but emotionally under-pressurized for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.4)
    The primary stake is internal—Mira’s need to find a non-hollow way of making meaning—and it’s signaled clearly from the fortune-cookie setup. Pressure accumulates gently via exhaustion, long-term malaise, and the fragile dawn window at the spire. The turn from writing predictions to “conducting symphonies” is a genuine deepening of options, but it comes with minimal friction, and no competing path is seriously tested or foreclosed on the page. The conflict feels real yet remains low-intensity and almost entirely contemplative.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—remain fragmented across timelines vs. endure integration and its weight—is clear and sharpened by the revelation that all branches express cowardice. Pressure escalates when the runes clarify as a map and she consciously chooses the more painful forks, giving her real agency in resolving her condition. The cost (heaviness, loss of infinite escape paths) is legible, though mainly conceptual rather than dramatized through a single high-friction scene choice. Conflict stays internal and intellectual, but it coheres and tightens under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—Oskar’s battle against emotional numbness and Marie’s inability to feel her music—is clear and present early. Pressure deepens when the backward recordings are tested with Marie and the silence becomes experientially “enthralling,” but there’s little genuine resistance or setback; discoveries unfold almost too smoothly. The escalation is therefore more conceptual than agonistic, suitable for an accumulative piece but limiting felt stakes. The closure is earned, yet the lack of a sharper trade-off or visible on-page sacrifice keeps tension at a moderate level.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.2)
    The primary stake—whether Marianne will step into a dangerous, clandestine role as a truth-keeper about the zones—is legible, and the encounter with the older woman tightens that pressure. Escalation comes through deepening knowledge (zones as atmospheric anomalies, a hidden network of ex-professionals, “after whatever emerges”) rather than reversals, consistent with a quiet, situational design. Marianne’s closing choice to begin mapping the tubes is an act of agency that forecloses the safer path of remaining an isolated eccentric observer. However, the risks remain mostly implied, so the felt cost is modest rather than bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—Maren’s ability to truly grieve and reconnect with a lost sensory dimension—is clear and emotionally credible. Pressure escalates when the possibility of rendering the perfume visible is introduced and then realized, culminating in her breakdown as the colors fade. However, the conflict remains mostly internal and cooperative; there is little friction or resistance beyond her initial tremor at uncorking the vial, so the escalation feels controlled rather than urgent. The price paid is emotional rather than practical, but it is legible and tied to the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant pressure is existential/intellectual: how to respond to a transformed reality and what it means to witness another’s impossible choice. Escalation is primarily textural—the rope’s layers deepen, then Sarah’s appearance sharpens the stakes and reframes his wandering—but the tension remains quiet and largely internal. Marcus’s main act of agency (to leave the rope as shrine and continue on as poet-witness) is clear and carries some cost, though not a sharply dramatized one. Overall, conflict is coherent and thematically rich, but relatively low-intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.3)
    The stakes are quiet but real: whether sound—and by extension, communal meaning—can still exist in a world numbed by catastrophe. Escalation is accumulative rather than dramatic: as Maya moves through Sora’s fragments, the chronic hush becomes more oppressive until the twenty-seventh piece marks a perceptible retreat, deepening the central tension between silence and music. Her choice not to “complete” the pieces but to inhabit their incompleteness and then to share the bowl at the end constitutes an earned stance, foreclosing the fantasy of restoration in favor of ongoing, fragile possibility. The price—the loss of the old world and old rituals—remains felt rather than rhetorically underlined.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will supply a clean counterfeit or allow ambiguity and real transformation—is clear and present early. Pressure coheres as she reads deeper into the amber and recognizes a different model of change, leading to the key tightening: remaking the blotter to honor a wish rather than a lie. Conflict is mostly internal and intellectual; there’s little sense that time or external consequences could sharply punish either choice. The cost and narrowing of options are therefore more thematic than viscerally felt, keeping tension strong but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Marianne will expand her transactional shrewdness into a practice of recognition—is clear but only lightly pressured. The envelope choice and later decision to build the project are meaningful beats, yet they encounter no substantive opposition, trade-off, or moral friction. Escalation is accumulative via more stories and photos rather than through tightened options or higher costs. As a result, tension remains low even as the arc resolves satisfyingly.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—Kael’s inclusion vs continued marginality—is clear from early on and escalates via the communal attention to the mysterious artist and her growing involvement. The key tightening is her shift from solving the puzzle privately to investing in the group’s shared search, which leads directly to her vulnerable reveal. However, there is little true friction or counterforce; no one resists her, misunderstands her, or forces a painful trade-off beyond her own internal hesitations. The conflict remains mostly gentle and contemplative rather than sharply pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—Vera’s need to discover and truthfully capture the birthplace of echoes before the giant wakes or the world’s temporal rhythm is too damaged—is clear and coherent. There is one meaningful tightening when she must choose to release the borrowed time, risking the loss of her controlled observation in order to free the echo. However, conflict remains mostly low-pressure and intellectual; the risk of the giant waking and the cost of temporal scars are gestured at more than they are felt, so escalation tops out at “interesting” rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—what to do with ambiguous loss—is clear and pressured by the conjuring attempt, with escalation coming through the ritual’s activation and the apparition of the parallel-orchard figure. The key tightening is her choice not to break the vision by calling out, instead deepening her experiment, which credibly sets up the eventual acceptance. The conflict remains predominantly internal and quiet, with relatively low overt resistance, which suits the mode but keeps intensity just shy of the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—finding a way to matter without surfacing from her hidden life—is present and engaged, with the outage catalyzing her chance to affect the library’s memory. There is a gentle escalation as she finds more reels and other materials, and as their public impact increases, culminating in the student’s tearful thank-you. However, there’s little direct opposition or real jeopardy: no risk of discovery that costs her, no moment where she might choose visibility of body versus presence. The tension is therefore quiet and largely one-directional, limiting the ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central conflict—Maya’s need for control versus the nursery’s demand for responsive observation—is clear and interwoven with her identity and livelihood. Pressure escalates through the contrast between her engineered failures and her later, riskier choice to “release control,” with storms and volunteer plants as quiet antagonistic forces. The decisive turn is her reframing of “study” and her acceptance of perpetual, unfinished metamorphosis. Still, the conflict remains more contemplative than urgent; a slightly sharper sense of what she stands to lose materially or relationally would heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—whether she will find a non-delusional meaning in the island’s patterns—is clear and thematically apt, and Marcus’s “the island takes; the island gives” pushes on that desire. There is a meaningful deepening when she chooses to follow the trails at night alone, treating insomnia as vigil rather than affliction. However, the journey and convergence encounter offer little resistance or risk; the world never really pushes back beyond mood, so cost remains mostly conceptual. As a result, tension is steady but rarely sharp, which keeps the conflict from fully matching the ambition of the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara’s knowing enhances or destroys everyday magic—is clear and escalates as the cave’s reliable patterns go wrong and the pearl fails. The decisive tightening comes when the emissary reframes every prophecy as harm and the pearl’s fragments become stolen futures, forcing a revaluation of her life’s work. However, much of the conflict is one-sidedly delivered; Mara doesn’t actively contest or try alternative tactics before accepting the indictment, which softens felt struggle. The cost is conceptual and identity-level rather than situationally tense, which suits the piece but limits visceral pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Marina’s seventeen years of curating absence will have meaning and whether she can bear the return of presence—is clear early. Pressure intensifies in a restrained but real way: the first ship on the horizon, the crush of reunions, her intervaled watching, then the recognition of Thomas and her approach. Her choice to step out of her observational stance and engage him constitutes a genuine narrowing of options and emotional risk. The conflict remains largely internal and never quite bites hard enough in-scene to feel like a truly high-stakes crucible by top-tier standards.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—whether Mara will risk entering a place that might “unmake the lies” she lives by—is clear, and the story tightens around her choice to dare and descend. Internal and external conflicts braid effectively: the uncanny city structure mirrors her psychological risk. However, after she chooses to go, the journey into the tunnel and fortress unfolds with almost no resistance or complication, so pressure rises more by atmosphere than by concrete tests or reversals. As a result, the final choice to validate what she’s found feels weighty in idea but not heavily fought for on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elena will cling to skepticism or accept a burdensome, impossible inheritance—is clear and carried through. Pressure builds via the uncanny activation and overwhelming influx of ancestral memories, culminating in her decision to join the lineage by writing her own observations. However, the conflict remains relatively soft; there’s little on-page sense that accepting this role forecloses a concrete alternative beyond an implied return to failed academia. A single sharper moment of resistance or cost (e.g., explicitly giving up a scientific paradigm, relationship, or safety) would deepen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—Naia’s right to die versus Cassius’s fear of finality—is established early and escalates cleanly as the storm peaks and the dimensions “mutiny.” The ticking clock of the storm and the fragment’s activation provide a credible tightening, and Naia’s choice to step into the gap is a visible, irreversible price. However, Cassius’s lack of concrete counter-moves undercuts some potential dramatic intensity; he argues but never tests his commitment by trying harder to stop or alter the ritual. The final turn into his resolve to tear reality apart again offers a solid, if quiet, reconfiguration of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will tolerate, collude with, or decisively oppose her father’s predatory cons—is established early and escalates convincingly. Pressure tightens when we learn she has already acted (told Jacobson, set the trap) and then tightens again when she offers rehab instead of punishment, forcing a more complex trade-off. The moral cost is tangible: she risks destroying her father’s livelihood and their bond to protect strangers and, arguably, him. The only ceiling is that the external stakes (the sister’s literal peril) are present more as ethical weight than as a directly dramatized ticking clock.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake is interior and conceptual—can she meaningfully “record” in a world where ordinary history has gone silent, and what is the worth of beautiful untruths? Pressure does increase as she moves from compressed to expanded to “honest” time, and the silent, lamp-less center forces a stance crystallization. However, the conflict is tightly leashed and largely unopposed; there’s little explicit cost or resistance on the page beyond the abstract loss implied by the town’s homogenized time and her quiet decision to keep falsifying.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—Maya’s existential and bureaucratic erasure—is clear and present from the start, and the container world offers a low-key but persistent externalization of that pressure. Escalation comes primarily through deepening understanding: from personal loss of status to the broader erasure of neighborhoods and finally to the concrete link with the other Maya’s death. The meeting with the harbormaster provides the key tightening, forcing her to confront the human cost behind her “ghost” status and choose to fix the paperwork. Still, the pressure remains mostly intellectual and atmospheric; the material or relational cost of her decision is hinted more than sharply felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will remain confined to measurable “truth” or accept a more relational, uncertain form of meaning—is articulated early and threaded through. Pressure escalates as the shell and cello replay past arguments, forcing her to re-experience her own rigidity and her grandmother’s counter-claims. The conflict is largely interior and gently modulated; there’s no sharp reversal, but the realization that the “compass” points to understanding rather than place is a clear tightening. Because the emotional risk is handled in a muted, reflective register, the sense of jeopardy and cost could be marginally sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the carnival community will be assimilated or remain a site of resistance—is clear and present early. There is a meaningful escalation when Marina shifts from passive welcoming to active reorganization via encoded graffiti, which then catalyzes communal resistance. However, much of the conflict is relayed in summary (e.g., “Within weeks, the community began to shift”) rather than played through specific, pressured confrontations or hard trade-offs. As a result, the stakes feel conceptually high but emotionally a bit under-tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stakes—capturing a meaningful last image before an irreversible destruction—are clear and concrete, with the ticking demolition and chemical timing providing a natural tightening. Internal and external conflicts align: his need to bear witness versus the inevitability of the mountain’s erasure. However, the path from setup to execution is relatively frictionless; nothing truly jeopardizes the plan once conceived, and there’s no reversal beyond the emotional deepening from the inscription. The cost is felt but mostly conceptual and emotional, not tactically contested, which keeps this solid but not blistering.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.9)
    The external stake (fix the drone before the ship departs) is clear and time-bounded by the horns and anchor, and Mara’s insistence “You’re not leaving yet” is a concrete beat of agency. However, the repair proceeds with minimal resistance; the “compromised” guidance and time pressure never truly threaten failure. Internal tension—her relation to damage and blindness—is interesting but not strongly dramatized as conflict. The result is a pleasing but relatively low-temperature escalation arc.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—discovering a singular source that will “redraw every map”—is clear, and there is one meaningful tightening when Mira shifts from analysis to physically going out onto the ice. Yet the pressure remains relatively low-key: Petrov’s objections are gentle, concrete risks (personal danger, institutional backlash) are not foregrounded, and Mira never confronts a real dilemma between competing costs. The escalation is more intellectual than visceral, which keeps tension from fully sharpening even though the conceptual stakes are large.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Ashwood dies or remembers how to live—is clear, but the conflict is mostly one-sided in the tuner’s favor. Pressure rises gently through accumulation rather than through reversals, and there is little true opposition or risk beyond the abstract long-term “collapse.” Once townspeople begin walking with her, success feels almost assured, and no significant option is visibly foreclosed. This keeps tension low and prevents escalation from reaching a more gripping, high-stakes register.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stakes—Chen’s survival versus the seduction of the vial’s preserved consciousness—are clear and in direct tension. Time and oxygen escalation is present (flashing red gauge, alarm screaming), and the key tightening is Mara forcing herself to break contact with the vial to save Chen. However, the internal conflict resolves quickly once named, and her struggle never seriously threatens to derail the rescue on the page. The final trade-off (knowledge vs safety) is thematically resonant but could stand a sharper sense of what is irrevocably lost.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stakes—solve the vanishings, verify the father’s truth, and decide whether to remain in the impossible space under time pressure—are legible and converge at the end. Escalation is present but modest: once Matthias steps through the lattice, there is little resistance or jeopardy in navigating the passages; discovery proceeds smoothly. The countdown (“until they find the bodies”) is underused in the middle, resurfacing mainly as an echo near the end rather than an active pressure. The final choice has cost but might land harder with one more concrete test or sacrifice along the way.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—freeing Eleanora and ending the multigenerational debt—is clear from early on, and pressure coheres around whether Marcus will assume that responsibility. There is a meaningful tightening when he recognizes the bead’s nature and realizes he is the awaited descendant, and when he must choose to plant it and explicitly forgive. However, there is little resistance or counter-pressure beyond initial fear; once the terms are explained, no real alternative or risk feels live. As a result, the emotional cost is present but relatively gentle, not fully wrung for conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—transforming a failed, despairing maze into a tended, contemplative space—is conceptually clear, but on-page pressure is gentle and largely uncontested. There’s little resistance or setback: her sleepwalking always cooperates, the environment never truly threatens her, and travelers arrive as a late, easy affirmation. The primary tightening is simply the accumulation of threads toward completion; we never feel a trade-off where a real option is foreclosed or a price is paid beyond effort. As a result, escalation reads more like a serene unfolding than a true testing of commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Miriam can reconcile with her past/faith and find a home in this place—is clear and gently escalated as she moves from drifting to physically labor-intensive restoration. Excavation over weeks functions as a test of commitment, and the choice to stay versus her initial plan to leave is a credible narrowing of options. However, external pressure is minimal and there is little direct opposition, so tension feels contemplative rather than gripping, keeping stakes emotionally resonant but soft-edged.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Iris risks revealing her true identity to her daughter—is clear early and remains coherent. Tension tightens effectively as she confirms the safety codes and then pauses over the slot, making the hesitation-and-release the key pressure point. The cost is largely internal and relational rather than externally enforced, which keeps escalation on the quiet side but still meaningful. A slightly sharper sense of potential negative consequence (beyond emotional vulnerability) could have deepened the stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.3)
    The stakes—control of astronomical knowledge and the fate of subversive archives amid a coup—are clear and compelling, with the twist that the Archive Vault is the real target. Escalation is well paced: the dawn guttering, trucks arriving, and approaching boots narrow Mirelle’s options, forcing her to finish the tapestry and deliver it under cover of her persona. Her agency is real but largely confined to information gathering and encoding rather than direct confrontation, which fits her role but keeps the cost more conceptual than visceral. A sharper on-page trade-off or visible sacrifice could elevate the pressure into the next band.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the client can meaningfully re-encounter the decisive moment of unsaid apology—is clear from early on. Pressure escalates through the ritual and the sharpening of the remembered afternoon when she “almost called,” which narrows the emotional options. However, the conflict is largely internal and resolved without substantial on-page resistance or a felt possibility of refusal once the vision is accessed. The cost is mostly conceptual (living with a different understanding of her regret) rather than dramatized through a difficult, contested choice in the present.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether to endanger herself and others by pursuing destabilizing truth versus remaining in the “fog of half-stories”—is clear and grows tighter as she decodes the message. The anesthetic clock and the realization about the uncle’s hidden evidence act as a meaningful escalation, pushing her from passive carrier of others’ words to self-directed seeker of buried facts. However, the conflict remains largely internal and anticipatory; no counter-force on the page actively pushes back at her decision beyond generalized danger. Because the climax is her vow to act “tomorrow,” the pressure is strong but not at a peak of felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—Mara’s ability to create something genuinely joyful for the upcoming central square mural—is clear and present early. Escalation is mostly internal: frustration with hollow work, the fragment’s arrival, and the realization about joy as luminescence; there’s one meaningful turn when she abandons painting “happiness as a thing” and redefines her task. However, the commission’s consequences and any risk of failure are underdeveloped, so pressure never feels acute. The result is a well-shaped but relatively low-tension conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake is internal—Lena’s allegiance to curiosity over institutional certainty—and it is signaled and followed through clearly. Pressure does rise as the odd vibration leads to a hidden mural and a direct ethical choice (report and likely lose access vs. keep working and risk consequences). However, opposition remains abstract; no concrete antagonist or immediate repercussion appears, so the tension stays contemplative rather than sharp. The escalation is coherent but gentle, more philosophical than visceral, which limits the band somewhat for an elite market.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stakes—being detected and punished for unauthorized thought—are strong and clearly stated, and the NRS’s audits provide a credible external pressure. However, escalation within the scene is modest: “sanctuary compromised” and “they’re auditing community gardens” raise tension, but the meeting proceeds without obstruction or a key reversal. Elias’s final “begin” is an assertion of agency, yet it doesn’t seem to foreclose a prior, safer option or demand a visible sacrifice in the moment. The conflict is compelling but reads more like a poised prologue to struggle than a crucible beat where something must be risked or lost.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—what she does with her insomnia and the world’s suffering—is clear and emotionally meaningful. Pressure is primarily internal and thematic; it deepens rather than escalates, with the main “tightening” being her reflection on centuries of war and longing. There’s no strong on-page test or reversal that forces a new tactic—she recommits to an existing path rather than facing a sharpened dilemma. This makes the conflict compelling but relatively static in dramatic terms.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.8)
    The conflict is primarily internal and ethical: repair the chime to restore its original function or embrace the fracture as a new, personally meaningful form of beauty. Pressure escalates modestly—from a routine morning to a moment of recognition and then a value-laden decision—but never to crisis. Her ultimate renunciation of repair and decision to archive the broken song establishes a real trade-off (institutional preservation norms vs. personal meaning and change). The stakes are clear but quiet, keeping tension effective yet not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.8)
    The core stake—restore trust before they separate—is clearly established and consistently pressed by the impending departure and the irreversible nature of a Varesh confession. Tension builds through her painstaking writing and the risk that any lie will collapse the text when Marcus reads it. The decisive test (him reading aloud) is a strong tightening beat, but his acceptance comes with minimal resistance, softening the sense of risk at the peak. Internal and ethical stakes are rich, yet the conflict never quite bites as hard as the premise allows.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central conflict—villages versus irreplaceable frescoes—appears early and remains coherent, with Mira’s redesign as the main escalation and narrowing of options. Her engineered staged system and the demand for collaboration between opposed groups sharpen the stakes into a morally fraught middle ground. However, opposition stays entirely off-page; no one resists or complicates her plan in the moment, which reduces dynamic tension. The pressure is intellectual and ethical more than visceral, effective but somewhat low-temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Clara will keep erasing and reinventing or commit to a more honest, enduring self—is clear and quietly tense throughout. Pressure escalates texturally as the motifs (meteorite, dust, paper trails, Marcus below) layer until she chooses to anchor the meteorite and stay with the cylinders. That choice forecloses, at least for now, the path of flight and self-erasure, with a legible emotional cost in the risk of trust and continuity. The limitation is that external pressure remains minimal and there’s no single sharply turning moment; the stakes deepen rather than tighten, which slightly blunts the sense of escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake is Mara’s need to decide how to relate to her father’s disappearance and to thresholds generally; this is clearly signaled and stays in focus. Pressure escalates internally from observation to interpretation to a redefined stance (ending with her choice to build thresholds and her weather-code annotation). However, conflict remains low-temperature—Thomas offers only gentle questioning, and Mara rarely seems in danger of choosing a different, more damaging stance—so the sense of cost is muted. The emotional price (accepting his distributed absence rather than reclaiming him) is there but could be sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stakes—saving or losing the research/home and Senna’s chance at true belonging—are clearly articulated, and the revelation that the city’s “residents” are communicating with the stars is a genuine deepening of the central conflict. However, pressure is more atmospheric than combative; Kast and the sunrise deadline remain offstage, and the choice to enter the city is embraced with little visible fear, doubt, or trade-off. Escalation is therefore more about expanding wonder and knowledge than tightening screws, which works emotionally but keeps the cost soft. A moment of sharper internal or interpersonal friction would have intensified the stakes considerably.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Marina can understand the missing memories before the tide cuts off access—is clear, and knowledge stakes escalate as each drop on the glass reveals a more unsettling version of reality’s pruning. However, pressure remains mostly intellectual and observational; the tide-clock is more frame than live threat, and she encounters no real opposition or trade-off in pursuing knowledge. The turn is meaningful but relatively low-friction, with little sense that she risks anything by learning what she learns.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—Mara’s need to control serendipity versus allowing genuine unpredictability—is clear and tightened through the orchestrated scene. Conflict escalates when the supposedly secondary game exposes her vulnerability (missing the bishop fork due to split attention), leading directly to Rebecca’s pointed line about her inability to protect herself and the job offer. The internal-external braid (control vs openness / gig performer vs potential collaborator) is efficient for the length, and the final “Tell me more” functions as a quiet but decisive stance shift. Stakes remain personal and modest, which is appropriate but keeps the tension at a steady simmer rather than a full boil.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—can Kaleth embody banned memory without naming it—is clear, and there is one meaningful escalation when she chooses to ingest the moonstone and make her rebellion irreversible. Pressure remains mostly internal and conceptual; no antagonistic force or immediate risk presses back during the dance itself. As a result, tension feels more like steady intensification of image than a tightening vise of options or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether his seemingly “hollow” work has meaning—is clear, but the on-page pressure is mild and largely internal. Throwing the stones and watching the rings provides a nice deepening rather than a true escalation; there’s no serious alternative path he might choose or concrete cost he risks. His stance crystallizes, but it does so without significant narrowing of options or a tested trade-off. Effective for a quiet piece, but below elite in felt tension.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.8)
    The core conflict—continuing to sacrifice himself to wildfires versus choosing his daughter—is clearly defined and resolved through an internal but consequential decision. Pressure deepens as he reframes his past bargains (with pain, with innocence, with family) and admits he cannot be “the universal language between suffering and sense.” The final choice forecloses a path with real emotional and identity cost. Still, the progression feels more like steady clarification than a sharply tightening vise, limiting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—reframing the failed attempt to prevent her grandmother’s fall into a new, hopeful equation across timelines—is clear but stays mostly conceptual and inward. Pressure escalates when the tide turns, the gauge spins wildly, and the three Miras synchronize, but there’s little sense of risk that something could go wrong now. Her key choice (to overlap the patterns, to reinterpret the equation’s purpose) lands, yet it isn’t framed as a hard trade-off so much as a graceful unlocking of insight. The scene reads more as a beautiful unveiling than as conflict that extracts a palpable price.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.2)
    The primary conflict is internal and conceptual—can Maya confirm what walls “dream” and reinterpret her grandfather’s legacy—but it escalates mainly through new information rather than hard trade-offs. Discovering the diaries and especially the film negative (showing her in the room) provide a clear tightening of pressure, transforming abstract theory into undeniable proof. However, the piece largely sidesteps visible cost or a sharp dilemma; choosing to continue his work is framed as a near-inevitable acceptance rather than a fraught decision. The result is thematically satisfying but somewhat low-tension in dramatic terms.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—averting a cultural “spiritual drought” by changing how mirrors function—is intriguing but feels mostly abstract on the page. The only real on-page pressure is the time constraint of the bells and the fragility of mirages versus “skeptical daylight,” which adds some texture but little genuine risk. Vesper encounters no resistance, doubt, or partial failure; once she begins, success seems assured. As a result, escalation is modest and the final cost is primarily conceptual rather than felt as a hard trade-off or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether they can secure a peace that truly interrupts the cycle of violence—is clear and weighty, and the ritual sharply tightens pressure by forcing both sides to confront civilian losses. Conflict escalates as talks collapse into shouting, with the clipboard-ritual serving as the tool that hauls them back to the table. However, critical trade-offs or concessions in the treaty are left off-page, so the cost remains largely conceptual rather than concretely dramatized in a single visible sacrifice. This keeps tension strong but slightly abstract at the decisive turn.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Marcus will maintain his ruthless control of water or yield to the buried demands of memory and grace—is clear and coherently pressured by the approaching storm and the crack-map’s uncanny footprint. Escalation comes through accumulating tension: thunder moving closer, the weight of the egg, the realization of what his drought has drawn on the land. The decisive act of dropping the egg forecloses a path (continued unchecked exploitation and the prestige bound up in the fossil) and is immediately paired with tangible consequence as rain begins. The only limitation is that external pressures (board, government) are mentioned more than felt in-scene, keeping the conflict slightly more internal than it might be at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Celestine can risk herself to free the trapped voices and shatter the palace’s enforced silence—is clear and thematically rich. Pressure escalates as she untangles threads (risk of total annihilation of voices if she fails) and as time pressure mounts (“alarm bells would ring soon,” sorcerers sensing the disturbance). However, the conflict lacks a true on-page reversal or complication; she moves from intent to successful liberation without mishap, and external opposition only arrives after victory. As a result, the cost and danger feel slightly undercut even though they are conceptually strong.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Marcus will continue exploiting audiences or find an ethical mode— is clear and present from early on. Pressure escalates as he puts the puppets through new scenes, forcing him to confront the context and complexity he once flattened, and the collaborator’s accusation lingers as an off-page antagonist. The conflict remains primarily internal and contemplative, with no sharp external test or reversal beyond his own resolve, so the tension curve is gentle rather than gripping. Even so, the decision to fundamentally alter his storytelling constitutes a real narrowing of options with implied professional and artistic cost.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central stake—how to witness and honor an ending without false permanence—is clearly signaled and tightened by the revelation that this is the monarchs’ final migration. Pressure escalates via accumulation: from solitary building to the unexpected arrival of monarchs, to the recognition of other lost migrations, to her resolved future commitment. The cost is conceptual/emotional rather than dramatic, but it’s legible in the acceptance of structures “designed to vanish” and the refusal of monumental certainty. The conflict remains quiet and internal, with no major reversal, which slightly limits intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she can externalize and preserve fragile, vanished voices—is clear and steadily tightened by the progression from idea to experimental weaving to irreversible casting. Pressure is largely internal and ritualistic, which fits the mode but yields relatively little overt resistance or risk beyond emotional stakes. The key escalation comes when the rope “illuminated” and the voices emerge, testing whether she can remain steady enough to complete the casting despite her grief. The cost is mostly emotional rather than tactical, but it’s legible.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—will she understand the nature of paths/destiny and her role in them—is clear but remains largely interior and low-friction. The storm sets up external pressure but never seriously endangers her or forces a sharp trade-off once she’s in the bunker. Escalation happens as a density increase of visions rather than through reversals or tightening choices, so tension is more contemplative than urgent. The final act (adding her own dream) is more a natural culmination than a pressured, costly decision.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she can decode and physically follow this ancient message before the rare alignment—remains coherent, with a clear time pressure and resource scarcity. There is a meaningful tightening when twilight shadows reveal a second layer on the tile, transforming an intellectual puzzle into a risky journey that spends her last savings. However, resistance stays relatively soft: guards and poverty are mentioned but never seriously threaten to stop her, and the desert excavation proceeds without complications. The conflict is compelling but more contemplative than fraught, which slightly blunts escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central conflict—Kale’s need to preserve her grievance vs. the possibility that her brother chose a nonviolent sacrifice—is stated early and escalates through increasingly intimate revelations. The main tightening comes when Kale is forced to re-experience her brother’s final days from within his body, which reweights her accusation. Kale’s agency at the end (choosing to touch the box, accept teaching) resolves the conflict, but the emotional and ethical cost of that surrender feels somewhat smoothed over. The lack of a sharper internal struggle in the last third keeps the pressure from fully peaking.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—recovering the brother from a boundary-erasing fog—is clear and present from early on, and the pressure coherently intensifies as Aria synchronizes with the fog and the sextant’s vision deepens. The middle escalation beat, where she begins to see what the sextant saw and hears his voice, appropriately raises the emotional and conceptual stakes. However, the sense of potential failure or ruin remains somewhat muted; the ritual proceeds with relatively little friction or real possibility of catastrophic loss on the page. The resolution is still earned by her choices, but the price feels more implied than viscerally tested.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stakes—repairing the mother-daughter bond and reclaiming the integrity of the craft—are clear and present early. Pressure coheres as Marta must face both her failed modernization gamble and Lena’s rebuke, and the discovery of the grandmother’s stone provides a meaningful deepening and turning point. The final choice to recommit to handcraft together is earned and forecloses the corporate path with acknowledged cost. However, escalation is fairly gentle; conflict is resolved with limited resistance or complication once the conversation starts, keeping tension in the “strong” rather than “ferocious” band.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—what stance she will take toward this forbidden, nonlinear knowledge—is clear and does tighten as she moves from bewilderment to active seeking. Escalation is quiet but present: isolation (broken comms), then interpretive breakthrough, then direct encounter with the etched shells and the blank waiting for her. Agency at the end (choosing to tend, to inscribe) resolves the situational pressure, but the conflict remains largely intellectual/emotional, with limited sense of what she meaningfully risks by embracing the role. Strong for a meditative piece, but the pressure never quite bites.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—rescuing the seventeen while confronting a sentient, hungry bookstore—is clearly signaled, and escalation from eerie unease to direct negotiation is coherent. However, the conflict resolves unusually smoothly once Marin proposes “exchange rather than consumption,” with the symphony pausing and then essentially agreeing without a hard test or visible price. There’s little sense that her plan might fail or require sacrifice, which softens tension at the climax. The internal conflict between scholarly curiosity and rescue urgency is stated but not strongly dramatized as a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Mira will fix a version of her history with Soren—is signaled early and steadily intensified via the card’s shifting guidance and the mirrors’ competing timelines. The core tightening occurs when she realizes the garden is a process and must consciously “recapture” a version of truth rather than passively drift. Her final act of choosing the least-painful thread is a real stance, but the immediate downside or sacrifice of that choice stays largely conceptual. The lack of a more concrete, felt price in the closing moments keeps the conflict from fully peaking.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake is essentially conceptual: can Maren decode and reweave the rope to reconcile the building’s fractured timelines and make sense of the impossible door. Pressure escalates modestly as the room responds (complex ticking, shifting shadows), but nothing truly threatens her or jeopardizes the attempt. Her agency is clear—she chooses to commit hours of delicate work—but the conflict lacks resistance, reversals, or palpable risk beyond intellectual challenge. The resolution feels more like successful completion of a task than a tested, costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—relief from intolerable, body-invading sound—is clear and sensorially grounded, and the urgency of village-wide suffering gives weight to Kael’s quest. Pressure coherently tightens as he moves deeper and must attune himself against the invasive frequencies to activate the stone. However, once underground, obstacles are mostly conceptual rather than sharply dramatized; he succeeds on the first major attempt, with little sense of possible failure or alternative costs. The result is solid, consistent tension rather than a truly knife-edge escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—rekindling the beacon as proof that patterns and meaning persist after collapse—is clearly signaled, and the tremor + broken prism provide a solid inciting disturbance. There is a meaningful deepening when the prism is revealed as a map and the three locations emerge, narrowing her path. However, opposition remains abstract; the world feels empty rather than actively resistant, so escalation is conceptual rather than pressured. The cost of her decision is mostly implied (danger, solitude) rather than concretely dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    The core stake—whether the archive remains a faithful record of the past or mutates into a self-authoring consciousness that destabilizes identity—is well signaled and narrows as Elden uncovers the impossible shadows. Pressure escalates when the anomaly shifts from “prophecy vs. conjecture” to recursion and self-awareness, reconfiguring the risk from archival corruption to personal dissolution. Her ultimate acceptance of absorption provides a real price, but the internal conflict is primarily intellectual; we miss a moment where fear or attachment to her own separate identity pushes back. As a result, tension is strong but more contemplative than viscerally fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—whether Kael can move through his hopelessness and re-enter risk and creation—is clear and coherently pursued. Pressure tightens when he’s handed the dangerous rag knot in front of observing peers, forcing a choice between withdrawal and embodied engagement. However, the conflict resolves with relatively little overt resistance or hesitation at the moment of action, so the sense of risk and potential backslide is somewhat softened. The escalation is believable but stays on a gentle slope rather than truly sharpening to a knife-edge.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central conflict—Mira’s need for direct emotional presence versus Chen’s tendency to retreat into observation and work—is clear from the outset and remains coherent. Pressure escalates modestly but effectively: from her accusation, to her rejecting the artifact, to the pivot when he reveals its connection to her mother, to his owning his failure. The key tightening is his confession that his coping strategy harmed her, which forecloses the comfort of self-justification and opens the vulnerable ending. Stakes stay intimate and never quite knife-edge, but for this quiet mode they carry adequate weight.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stakes—Mira’s ability to live in a way that doesn’t suffocate her, and the immediate risk of losing her rarest silence—are clear early and interwoven. Escalation comes through the inversion onset, the scramble to rescue the doll, and the loss of the mother-sighs vessel, which forces a deeper reassessment of what she’s preserving. The final decision to “choose the sky” over bunkers is an earned stance crystallization with a visible conceptual and relational cost. External danger feels relatively controlled (we never truly fear for her life), slightly softening the pressure curve.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central conflict—Elena’s imprisonment by traumatic sound versus the possibility of reclaiming silence—is clear and grows gently through their dialogue and his small tactical choices. The pressure escalates via deepening revelation (her admission about the hospital monitors) rather than sharp reversals, fitting the situational, quiet mode. However, her movement toward “possibility” comes without a moment that fully tests her resistance or demands a visible trade-off beyond the implied emotional risk. The result is moving but slightly under-pressured for elite-level stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—reaching and correctly activating the stairway before authorities and their narrative lock it down—is clear, but it escalates more intellectually than viscerally. The main tightening is the revelation that ascension is about understanding/service, which redefines her goal and enables the stair activation. However, there’s little resistance: no security, missteps, or serious risk of failure; the sunrise “clock” doesn’t substantially complicate her path. Conflict feels contemplative and smooth rather than sharp, limiting tension.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the girl can stop suffocating under others’ demands and reclaim her own breath—is clear and emotionally legible. Conflict, however, is mostly internal and resolved through explanation and reassurance, with little resistance or counter-impulse from the girl once she is told she has already crossed. The main tightening is the revelation that touching the ring constituted letting go, foreclosing the option of remaining half-attached, but it reads as gentle rather than sharply pressured. The resolution is coherent and appropriate to the piece’s quiet mode, though it skirts real friction or visible cost in the present scene.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira can help seal a dangerous metaphysical breach and redeem her relationship to pressure—is clear, and the decision to volunteer is a meaningful turning point. However, after she agrees, everything unfolds without resistance: the breach reveals itself, the bolt fits despite being “impossible,” and there is no credible risk or sacrifice in performing the task. The internal and external conflicts track each other conceptually but never truly bite in the moment; her past ordeal is doing most of the work the present scene should do. As a result, pressure deepens thematically but not much in terms of on-page jeopardy or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Cassian can confront and carry an even darker origin for the dynasty he destroyed—is clear but faces little opposing pressure. Escalation happens primarily through information: Henrik’s confession deepens and darkens the existing moral frame rather than generating new immediate obstacles. Cassian’s decision to bring the cylinder to the tribal council is a meaningful stance, but it’s not heavily tested or traded off against competing desires on the page. As a result, tension is steady and thoughtful rather than sharply tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—whether he will remain withdrawn and resist the strings or step into a chosen, conscious entanglement—is clear and coherently pressured by the appearance of the program and the world’s rearrangement. Escalation comes through environmental and ritual intensification rather than reversals, culminating in the strings attaching and waiting, which forces a stance. His actions (unsnapping armor, performing forgotten patterns, speaking a new oath) earn the resolution. The price of either choice remains somewhat abstracted, with little concrete negative consequence made explicit, which blunts the sharpness of the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Miriam will remain a passive custodian or become an active witness—is clear and grows as she reads Samuel’s increasingly desperate letters. Pressure escalates from routine reorganization to the shock of the misfiled adoption, then to a moral decision about what to do with this knowledge. The cost is subtle but legible: she must accept the irrevocability of the loss and settle for remembrance over repair. Conflict remains mostly internal and conceptual, so tension is steady rather than sharp, but it does deepen convincingly.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.5)
    The core stake—preserving and disseminating evidence against a revisionist regime while avoiding detection—is plainly established early and tightened when the searchlight appears. Escalation is modest but clear: the mission expands from gathering data to immediate survival, forcing her to abandon the plan to “reappear” and instead disappear more completely. Conflict remains mostly external/situational, with internal tension understated; she never seems truly torn between safety and action. The cost is present but relatively quiet, which is effective but keeps the escalation from feeling truly wrenching.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Marcus can neutralize the prophecy’s threat—is clear, and there is one meaningful tightening as he moves from ordinary playing to the deliberate anti-melody that actively unravels the prophecy. Conflict is primarily internal and situational rather than oppositional; tension accrues through the accumulating strangeness of the grotto’s response rather than overt reversals. The scale of family “ruin” is declared but never embodied in specific potential losses, so the emotional and practical price of failure stays somewhat conceptual. The resolution is earned by his choice to trust his grandmother’s method, but the sense of real cost or risk could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Miren will remain an orderly archivist or engage with and embody the arbor’s prophetic repair—intensifies through the moonstone encounter and subsequent transformation. The main tightening is clear: once the speck dissolves into her, she can no longer be a neutral sorter; she must act on new senses and knowledge. However, opposition and cost remain soft: there’s little friction beyond her prior skepticism, and no explicit loss or sacrifice on-page. The story succeeds as an internal, contemplative conflict but lacks the pressure that would push it into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is internal and conceptual: whether Marcus will continue to treat broken instruments as problems to be solved or as carriers of a deeper pattern, and whether he’ll heed the “pattern beneath randomness.” There is a mild external mystery (the stolen museum pieces, the secret chamber), but it never feels dangerous or truly costly, and the investigation unfolds without meaningful obstruction. Escalation is mostly a deepening of understanding rather than sharpened conflict, and his final choice entails little on-page risk or loss. The piece works as a contemplative parable, but tension remains relatively low-key.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.9)
    The core stakes—whether Mara can transform unsustainable hope into bearable truth—are clear and thematically resonant. Pressure escalates from off-page failure (search party) to Mara’s solitary, quasi-forbidden ritual to the emotionally risky act of handing the coin to the magistrate. The cost is primarily emotional and ethical, not physical, but it’s legible in the magistrate’s delayed tears and the shift of the candle’s meaning. A slightly sharper articulation of what Mara risks (e.g., inflaming false certainty about the girl’s identity) could have heightened the conflict further.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central conflict—Kael’s desire to truly heal a trapped soul versus the guild’s extractive norm—comes through clearly in her method and in the thickening air of layered guilt. Escalation is primarily emotional and textural: the confession deepens, the gorge’s repetitions intensify, then Kael risks shifting into laughter at a delicate moment. The price is mostly borne by the shade as he re-experiences pain and earlier joy; Kael’s personal risk (heresy, potential failure) is more implied than dramatized. Still, the crucial turn at “A cake…You were carrying a cake” is a credible tightening that reweights the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.8)
    The core conflict—whether Sera will remain an instrument of pain-calculation or reorient her enhancements toward healing—is clear and carries through. Pressure escalates from raw hypersensitivity and isolation to a charged encounter with someone who embodies a possible future, culminating in the risk of seeking peace instead of defense. The stakes are mainly internal and ethical rather than survival-based, but the “terrifying possibility of peace” reads as a real cost for a torture survivor. A slightly sharper on-page articulation of what she risks losing (e.g., her self-concept as watchdog of fairness) could deepen the crunch further.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira can find a way to meaningfully translate and honor the erased lives—reads clearly, and the acquisition/activation of the lens is a genuine deepening of pressure. However, obstacles are soft; the “trouble” with the commission remains largely conceptual, and once she gets the lens, nothing actively resists her. Escalation is more about revelation density than narrowed options or cost, so the tension is quietly intellectual rather than viscerally felt. The final exhibition reads as an earned culmination, but with minimal sense of what she risked or might have lost.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is whether Marcus will respond to the ghost’s urgent pointing and what he’ll do with what he finds, with a secondary pressure around the building’s impending demolition. There is a clear tightening when he shifts from ignoring the elevator to obeying the ghost and climbs to investigate, but opposition is minimal and never truly threatens failure. His choice to promise to reunite the mechanism with the carousel is meaningful, though the personal or practical cost is only lightly implied. Overall, conflict is more contemplative than pressurized, limiting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central conflict—eternal safety through looping versus risky awakening into real time—is clear and escalates through concrete beats: frost as omen, the bottled whisper confrontation, then the physical lurch and rotation. Pressure grows coherently; Marina’s initial objection (“You’re disrupting the pattern”) turns into reluctant complicity as she hangs on and reaches for a book in mid-upheaval. The stakes are mostly internal but successfully externalized through the library’s instability. If anything, the danger feels conceptually more than viscerally costly, which slightly mutes peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.7)
    The dominant stake—how to read this civilization (mercantile excess vs. grief-architecture)—is clear, and it deepens into Kasimir’s need to reframe his own revolutionary failure. Pressure escalates as he moves from vague dissent about Vhen’s view to an articulated counter-argument and committed documentation. The cost is subtle but present: embracing a new, more patient “revolution” rooted in honoring brokenness rather than smashing systems, which implicitly abandons his earlier self-concept. The conflict remains largely internal and intellectual, with little external pushback or concrete consequence on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—whether Aldric can prevent the box from draining joy/light—is clear and conceptually strong. Pressure does escalate mildly when he realizes that simply removing the stone would worsen the covenant, forcing a subtler approach. Yet the actual process of resolution unfolds smoothly; he identifies the problem quickly and executes the correct method without serious risk, resistance, or sacrifice. The conflict feels more like a beautifully described procedure than a hard-won victory.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will remain in the knowable world or surrender to radical unknowing—is clear, and pressure does accumulate as she approaches and then enters the lagoon. Psychometry’s revelation that Henrik chose immersion, not accident, deepens her dilemma and functions as the key tightening. However, the conflict stays mostly interior and contemplative; there’s little sharp friction or reversal, and her ultimate decision reads as a natural extension rather than a hard-won, contested turn. The conceptual tension works, but escalation feels quietly linear rather than sharply intensifying.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is Maya’s artistic approach and how she relates to time and other makers, with a light secondary stake in physical navigation amid the storm. Pressure accumulates gently—finding the slide and then the root-ball each nudge her toward a new stance—but there’s limited real narrowing of options or felt risk. The storm and GPS failure introduce situational tension that could escalate but largely remain textural. Her final choice to ignore the GPS is symbolically clear but not sharply costly in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—Mara’s need to reframe her relationship to darkness to move past artistic paralysis—is clear, and the conversation plus the postcard reading provide a modest but real escalation in insight. However, the pressure remains gentle and largely internal; there is little sense that a serious alternative path or refusal is live by the end. The block resolves quickly once the thematic key is handed to her, which softens the feeling of a hard-won or costly turn. The piece reads more as graceful meditation than true conflict under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—who will bear the psychic and moral cost of remembering the disappeared—is clear and sharpened by Sarai’s proposal. Pressure coherently tightens toward Malik’s decision to look into the lagoon, which forecloses his option of safe distance. The only limitation is that the psychological and practical consequences for Malik are more implied than concretely dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether something real and honest can be rebuilt from a hollowed-out, wish-drained town—is clear but largely conceptual. Conflict is mostly internal/philosophical (Miranda’s methodology vs. her guild’s approach) and environmental (post-magic emptiness), with no active antagonist or strong pushback against her project. There is a meaningful deepening when she realizes the bottle responds to imagination rather than containing a fixed future, but this doesn’t significantly raise cost or foreclose options. As a result, the piece is thematically tense but dramatically gentle, limiting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.2)
    The primary stake—whether and how Marcus will inhabit the role the prophecy names for him—is thematically meaningful but not heavily pressured on the page. The strongest turn is the childhood prophecy moment; the adult return feels more like a foregone fulfillment than a contested choice, with little sense of alternative paths. Conflict is largely internal and situational rather than oppositional, which suits the piece’s mode but keeps tension more contemplative than gripping. Effective, but shy of maximal urgency or visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—restoring the seeds’ capacity for future—is clear and present from early on, and the pressure coherently intensifies as the entropy anomaly worsens and the only viable solution is to spend the vortex inheritance. The central tightening is Mara’s decision to finally step into the spiral she has feared, accepting a permanent loss of unused life as the price of reopening the atrium. Conflict is largely internal and conceptual but reads as real pressure on her values. The consequences of spending that time are more thematic than dramatized, so the felt price, while present, doesn’t quite reach maximal sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—real, deadly storms vs. false or automated alarms—is established early through backstory of prior deaths and complacency. Pressure tightens credibly as the rope vibrates before the instruments, forcing Mara into a real choice to override the freshly reinstated system on its crucial test day. Her agency directly determines whether the valley prepares in time, and the physical consequences on the sanctuary underline that this was not a low-cost or hypothetical danger. The one limitation is that the downside risk of a false alarm (social/political cost) remains mostly conceptual rather than dramatized in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is internal—whether Kael’s withdrawal is cowardice/exile or a meaningful stance of surrender and arrival—and that stake is legible early. Pressure accrues through reflection rather than events, with one main deepening: the explicit reframing of falling as “another form of flying” and of surrender as strength. However, there’s little genuine escalation or narrowing of options; nothing in the present truly threatens her equilibrium or forces a trade-off, so the cost of her stance remains somewhat abstract. The result is a beautifully textured mood piece with modest tangible tension.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central conflict—whether to uphold a covenant of silence or break it to release trapped truths—is clear and resolved by Mara’s choice to read the letter. The pressure escalates modestly from discovery to the silent circle of ghosts to the act of opening and reading, and the conceptual stakes (perpetuating vs. releasing hauntings) are nicely aligned. However, tension is largely intellectual; Mara faces little real resistance or risk beyond abstract taboo, and her inner conflict at the decision points is underplayed. As a result, the climax is resonant but feels relatively low-friction for the gravity of the thematic claim.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—preserving and transmitting linear time in a world that has abandoned it—is clear but mostly conceptual. The mention of Fluid Timers hints at danger, yet no on-page confrontation or irreversible choice tests Mira’s commitment; she continues as she has, with only implied risk. The story escalates via density (more visitors, a ritualized midnight gathering) rather than via a clear tightening of options. As a result, tension is present but mild, and no beat forces a painful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central pressure—how to meet loss and imperfection without smoothing it away—is coherent and steadily deepens from solitary contemplation to relational risk with the grieving boy. The snapped string and lost kite provide a concrete external stake that dovetails with Maren’s internal struggle and leads to the key turn of giving up the feather. Escalation is gentle rather than sharp, and options never feel brutally narrowed, but there is a real trade-off in reopening her own grief to tend his. The lagoon’s final “almost like peace” nicely signals that the conflict isn’t cleanly solved, only reframed.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—using her limited remaining time to complete the temple’s intended interspecies network—is clear and grounded in the six‑month prognosis. Pressure accrues texturally as her work proceeds and her body weakens, culminating in her too-weak-to-walk final morning, which gives the ending real cost. However, the conflict is largely unopposed: there’s no meaningful resistance, reversal, or hard trade-off beyond finite time, so escalation feels more like steady fulfillment than tested commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake is whether human homecoming can be rendered as an “artificial pilgrimage” without losing its essence, and whether that can be communicated to aliens. Pressure escalates quietly as Elara admits her own susceptibility to the ritual she designed to study, undermining her distance. The main tightening is the move from observation to participation, culminating in Quorum’s decision to walk with her, which reweights the experiment and her role in it. The conflict stays largely conceptual and could use one sharper on-page friction or cost, but for this lyric mode it holds.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—whether the war-scarred, poisoned site can be coaxed into genuine renewal—is present but operates at a low simmer. The birds’ instructions and his methodical selection of seed locations provide a gentle sense of progression, yet there is minimal direct opposition or risk; nothing on the page credibly threatens failure beyond implied environmental difficulty. The piece deepens conceptually (the discovery and use of the submerged concord) rather than escalating pressure, and the coachman is never forced into a sharp trade-off. The result is thematically rich but dramatically soft.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether distance remains fatal or is retranslated into closeness via shared resources—is clear, and the bunker discovery plus encoded riddle constitute a meaningful deepening of options. However, there is almost no resistance: no one questions Calder, the decoding is frictionless, and danger or scarcity never actively push back in-scene. The resulting tension profile is conceptual rather than felt, which dulls escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—her irreversible isolation versus her chosen role as explorer/cartographer of time—is clear but largely static. Pressure arises conceptually (she cannot leave normal spacetime without dying), yet there is minimal on-page escalation or narrowing of options in the present anniversary scene. Her “choice” is essentially pre-made; the narrative confirms an existing stance rather than forcing a new one under fresh pressure. This keeps tension more reflective than gripping, limiting conflict intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—can Kael meaningfully atone and adopt a new stance toward the unknown—is legible early via the guardian’s line, “You’ve come to amend what you broke.” There is a modest tightening when his secret-laden chess pieces are scrutinized and her judgment becomes imminent, but her approval comes easily once she reads a pawn. Conflict remains primarily internal and lightly tested; no serious option is foreclosed or trade-off dramatized beyond accepting responsibility. As a result, tension is pleasant rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—who gets to define the history of the crisis—is clear but operates at a low-pressure, textural level. Escalation comes via density: from solitary observation to systematic, morally charged documentation, then to the encounter with the archivist that forces a choice about how and where her testimony will live. There’s no sharp ethical dilemma or visible sacrifice; the cost is mostly implied (submitting her lived, unofficial history to the apparatus of record). Tension is more intellectual than visceral, which slightly limits the impact at elite-publication standards.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant conflict—safety in self-erasure vs the cost of remembering and inhabiting her true self—is clear and sharpened by the stone heating, the smoking feather, and the pain of embedding the stone. There is one meaningful tightening: when she chooses not to resist the usual displacement and then, more sharply, to let vision and reality coexist and plant the stone in her chest. Agency drives the resolution; coincidence does not bail her out. The stakes and prices remain mostly conceptual and introspective, which keeps the tension elegant but relatively quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Petrov will remain imprisoned by his guilt or find a different relation to his past—is signaled clearly and deepens as he decodes the tapestry. Pressure escalates texturally: the increasingly legible code, the nearer thunder, and the dawning realization about the labyrinth’s purpose all narrow his inner options. His climactic choice is to relinquish the quest for treasure/redemption and accept a quieter, cost-bearing stasis, which is earned. What holds this below the top band is that tension stays meditative and low-intensity throughout; there’s no strong sense of risk that his insight might fail or be refused.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will seek forgiveness on institutional terms or on her own—is clear and steadily pressed by the approaching ritual and the elder’s intervention. The confrontation with the elder is the main tightening beat, forcing her tactics (impromptu sessions) into direct scrutiny. However, tension stays mostly intellectual/emotional rather than truly agonizing, and the cost of her stance is only partially felt on the page. The ending’s charged ambiguity works, but escalation could cut deeper into consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stakes—Maya’s survival and the possibility of transmuting the sea—are signaled early and remain coherent. Pressure escalates through the ticking breath clock, the mounting count of failed pockmarks, the workshop’s instability, and the pull of the activated statue against her need to surface. Her key turn is choosing to return below with “newly certain” purpose, accepting a long, painstaking labor rather than a miraculous fix. The cost is framed more conceptually than viscerally at the end, but the narrowing of options and acceptance of scale are clear.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Maren will continue as a safe, detached quay painter or risk genuine presence—appears early and tightens via the mirror break and her discomfort in front of the cave’s beauty. Pressure escalates internally: the impossibility of painting the cave on canvas forces her into the shell experiment, and then into letting the work go to the tide and strangers. The climax is quiet but clear: choosing to redistribute the shells and leave the easel behind. Still, the conflict remains largely contemplative; there’s little sense of real jeopardy beyond her inner artistic life, which keeps it just shy of fully charged.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—how to guide ships safely (loud fear vs. quiet trust)—is established and comes to a head when the drifting vessel appears and Thomas reaches for the horn. The key tightening is Mira’s choice to intervene and ask for a pause, forcing her method into a real test under time pressure. However, the external danger never feels close to irreversible, and the ship corrects course rather serenely, so the risk/cost bandwidth is somewhat narrow for elite-level tension. Internal stakes (vindicating her grandmother’s philosophy) are present but resolved without much resistance or real possibility of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether she can understand, and perhaps later counter, the pull that has taken her family—is clear and steadily pressured as the moon darkens and her own susceptibility sharpens. Escalation comes through knowledge and conceptual stakes: the device’s activation and reading tighten the situation from vague mystery to a costly understanding of humanity’s collective attempt to overwrite loss. However, her immediate options aren’t dramatically foreclosed on the page; her choice of role feels meaningful but not yet punishing. The tension is effective for quiet SF, but could bear one more concrete pressure point or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central stake—whether Mira will remain in self-protective isolation or risk her sanctuary and worldview to host a quasi-ritual space—is clear and does tighten once Henrik’s desperation confronts her habits. The shift from selling a relic to curating a communal experiment in grace is a meaningful turn. However, the personal and societal costs (risk of infection, intrusion on her solitude, potential backlash if the “miracle” fails) stay more implied than viscerally felt, so the conflict reads thoughtful rather than truly fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—understanding what the stranger came to do—is clear and drives the scene, with escalation via each discovered absence and finally the opened key. Conflict remains largely investigative and internal; no antagonist or acute external pressure opposes him beyond time and solitude. The meaningful tightening comes with the revelation of the coordinates, which narrow his next possible actions. However, cost is only lightly felt and deferred to “tomorrow,” so the pressure never quite sharpens into real jeopardy within this scene.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Martin will remain passively “settled” or claim agency over his life—is clear, and pressure coheres as he advances from rumor to tangible doorway to confronting alternate lives. The primary tightening arrives with the wall’s transformation and the parade of possible Martins, which forces him to re-evaluate his past choices and future. However, opposition is soft: once the chip fits, nothing seriously resists his insight or complicates his decision, and there’s little sense of real risk in taking or renouncing any path. The cost is mostly conceptual and retrospective, not actively contested on the page, which keeps escalation from feeling fully sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether she will truly confront what she has become—is clear, and pressure coheres as she moves from physical risk (the climb) into psychic risk (the grotto showing her memories). Escalation is mostly internal: the fireflies and reflected younger self tighten the screws, leaving her unable to hide behind her queenly composure. Her agency at closure is relatively quiet (choosing to descend while carrying this new self-knowledge), so the turn is more contemplative than harrowing. The cost is more implied future difficulty than immediate sacrifice, which keeps the stakes absorbing but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—Solène’s desire to redefine what light is for, in tension with the Academy’s values and Mira’s fear of her leaving—is clear but largely abstract. Pressure deepens slightly when Mira labels the work heresy and when Solène literalizes her goal by placing the sphere in Mira’s hand. However, there is minimal escalation: no new constraint or reversal forces Solène to adapt, and her decision to return “different” is stated rather than arrived at under new pressure. The piece reads more as a manifesto-in-scene than a conflict that tightens toward a costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Maren can impose narrative order on her disordered time and feral nostalgia—remains legible throughout. Pressure escalates as she recognizes the pattern in her own dreams and admits the savage jealousy of her past selves, culminating in the decision to keep chronicling despite knowing memory is mutable. The conflict is almost entirely internal and reflective, with no sharp turn or external test, but the emotional tightening is real. Stakes stay conceptual rather than visceral at times, which keeps this from a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central pressure—how to respond to Mrs. Kapoor’s fear of her grandmother’s disapproval—is clear and thematically relevant but remains low-key in dramatic terms. There is one meaningful deepening when Elena shifts from mechanical to emotional diagnosis and chooses not to fix the clock, foreclosing the simple “repair it” path. However, the story largely sidesteps direct confrontation with Mrs. Kapoor, keeping consequences and any pushback offstage, which blunts felt stakes. Tension is real but stays in a reflective, advisory register rather than building to a sharper crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira can act despite her crystallizing stress response and reframe her scars—is clear and coherent from early on. Pressure escalates from immediate physical incapacity to the more abstract but weightier work of emotionally confronting each scar. However, once she recalls her grandmother’s teachings, solutions unfold with minimal friction; the small magics and runes succeed without setback or moral crossroads. The cost is primarily emotional labor, well suggested but not deeply tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central stake—whether Margot can meaningfully atone to the woman she harmed before both archive and orchard are lost—is clear and tightens as the haunting turns violent. Conflict escalates from thickened air to a dangerous paper storm and then into an intimate psychic contact via the annotated Chopin page. Margot’s decision to replace erasure (simply deleting the article) with active re-inscription (writing a new truth) is a genuine narrowing of options with moral cost. The only mild limitation is that the external ticking clock (developers tomorrow) remains more atmospheric than actively constraining her moment-to-moment moves.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael can truly witness and integrate the universe’s final convergence—is clear, and the looming Great Hiccup provides a conceptual clock. Her decision to set the dictionary down and walk the spiral is the one discernible tactical choice, linking personal desire to cosmic stakes. However, conflict is nearly frictionless: there is no real resistance, competing goal, or visible price to her surrender, so escalation reads more as graceful unfolding than as tightening pressure. As a result, the ending feels insightful but low on dramatic cost.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Maren will risk tampering with the fundamental assumptions of timekeeping—is signaled clearly once the three-second discrepancy appears. Pressure escalates well through the countdown mechanic: water flowing upward, horizon warping, and physical pain constitute a decisive tightening driven by her agency. However, the conflict remains almost entirely internal and conceptual, with limited sense of concrete external consequences if she fails or goes too far. The cost is real but somewhat contained to her consciousness and body, which keeps the tension strong but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central conflict—Mara’s compulsion to “secure” emotional connections versus the need to release—is well signaled and stays coherent. Tension tightens through the discovery that the brightest mushrooms are “nodes with optimal flow-through” and the tactile engagement with the button, which reconfigures her options. However, the stakes remain fairly low-key and cerebral; we don’t see any on-page pressure from the ex or concrete consequences of her obsession beyond summary. The final renunciation still reads as an earned, if quiet, price.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—whether Maya will remain locked in probabilistic judgment of her father or risk a more vulnerable, open engagement—is clear and thematically apt. Pressure coheres as her obsession with the symbols collides with her fear of complicity, and the koan/lantern sequence creates a genuine tightening of her internal conflict. However, the escalation is relatively gentle; the piece never quite lets the emotional or ethical cost bite as hard as it might (e.g., no moment where she seriously contemplates not going). The resolution is earned but comfortable, with limited sense of foreclosed alternatives beyond the implied status quo.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central pressure—duty to preserve estrangement vs. the human need for connection—intensifies credibly as the caller recalls their past contact, asks for music, and then receives her instruction to call his son. Each of these steps tightens the stakes by pushing Sarah further from protocol toward personal risk and ideological betrayal. The conflict remains mostly internal and conceptual, but her concrete acts (playing the disc, explicitly advising him) clearly foreclose the option of remaining a neutral operator. The cost isn’t sensational but feels proportionate and coherent for a quiet, high-concept piece.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Maren’s painstaking witnessing can ever change the town’s empty stasis—is clear and emotionally legible. There is a meaningful tightening when the figures appear on the coastal road and move toward the jetty; the locket and inscription pivot from curiosity to revelation. However, conflict is gentle and largely internal; there’s minimal real resistance, trade-off, or cost on the page beyond implied years of loneliness. The resolution arrives with little friction, so tension never quite peaks before it resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether these hyper-competent loners will allow themselves to connect and build a network “for the networkers”—is clear from early on. Pressure coheres around the decision to gather and then to reinterpret the moon rocks as permission to stay and return. However, the conflict remains largely internal and conceptual, with little concrete risk or visible cost beyond the implied surrender of their protective solitude. The escalation from rumor to gathering to new commitment is satisfying but low-friction, lacking a sharper test or moment of resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—Sera’s need to find the stillpoint to navigate her grief—is legible early and tightens as she follows the dissonant note deeper into unmapped territory. The decisive deepening is the recognition of her sister’s melody, which forces a costly reframe from avoidance to inhabiting loss. Pressure remains internal and quiet, but the story does move from abstract quest to a specific emotional risk she cannot retreat from once recognized. The conflict never feels false or manufactured, though it is more contemplative than oppositional.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—how Mara responds to evidence that reality is being retroactively edited, and what that means for her work—is clear and escalates once her own logs change. The pressure heightens when she realizes her predecessor was right and that her filtering habits have been erasing “the universe’s own editing marks.” Her final agency—choosing to catalog and then actively “helping to write” the signals—resolves the internal conflict. However, tension stays mostly intellectual; we never see a sharply framed loss or risk beyond identity and worldview, keeping overall pressure moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—Marina’s need not to be erased and her longing to translate her silent perception into shared experience—is clear and sharpened by her history of loss after the accident. Pressure escalates once Theo reveals the program and the crowd’s response forces Marina to confront being briefly “loud” to others. However, the conflict remains largely internal and gentle, with little in the way of hard choices or foreclosed options beyond the emotional acceptance of ephemerality. The piece earns its quiet mode but could benefit from one more concrete moment where Marina must risk or relinquish something tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara’s self-ruining thefts will amount to a meaningful act of preservation—remains coherent, and the discovery that the tapestry aligns with the frescoes is a genuine deepening. Her decision to leave the archive “ready to face whatever judgment awaited” is a credible, if internal, culminating choice with visible cost. However, present-tense conflict is largely uncontested; authorities, physical danger, or ethical dilemma do not actively press her within the scene. The result is emotionally charged but relatively low on on-page pressure and tactical adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether to resist or embrace the merged identity—is legible early through Theo’s ambivalence about whose memories are whose. Pressure escalates as the garden reacts negatively to their confusion and tension, pushing them toward some stance, and the choice to lean into entanglement via joint drumming is a clear turn. However, the conflict remains largely internal and somewhat cushioned; the option to claw back separate identities is mentioned but never concretely tested on the page, which mutes the sense of risk. The stakes are high conceptually but not fully sharpened in lived consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.4)
    Conflict and stakes are the softest area: the piece promises danger and pursuit (security, smugglers, someone following him) but delivers a relatively smooth rite of passage. Pressure escalates atmospherically as the storm intensifies and footsteps approach, yet Marcus never faces a hard dilemma or sacrificed option. The keyhole solution comes without serious resistance or risk of failure, and the woman is immediately affirming rather than genuinely testing him. As a result, the promotion to “inner circle” feels earned intellectually but not hard-won emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—exposing the plan to destroy the eastern canals without losing Marina’s livelihood—is clearly established and coherently pursued through the silent signaling plan. Pressure does deepen as they move from initial recognition to building a district-spanning message, but the escalation is relatively gentle and inevitability is assumed rather than tested; Marina never quite faces a moment where she might abandon the attempt. The ethical and practical trade-off (anonymous exposure vs. open testimony) is present but mostly conceptual rather than dramatized through hard choices. As a result the cost is believable yet not viscerally sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.0)
    The core stake—Danny’s autonomy vs. the town’s lockstep routine—appears early and stays coherent, but escalation is gentle. The main tightening is Miss Chen revealing the organized rebellion and offering a concrete invitation, which slightly raises the implied cost with his father and community norms. There’s no hard on-page test of that cost or a reversal; the conflict remains mostly conceptual and anticipatory. The result is thematically satisfying but low-intensity in terms of felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether they will surrender prescribed roles to pursue a dangerous freedom—is clear early and coherently intensified by the whale’s summons and Kael’s “Come with me.” Internal and relational conflicts braid effectively as Mira’s sense of duty collides with Kael’s restlessness. However, the escalation is relatively smooth: external opposition is absent, and the internal resistance to leaving feels swiftly overcome once the invitation is voiced. The cost of the choice is more stated than viscerally tested on the page, tempering pressure at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant conflict—between performance/compliance and honest grief—is signaled early and steadily tightened as Emma’s mask begins to crack. The main escalation comes when the bouquet is explicitly tied to the forbidden funeral, forcing both to confront what was suppressed. The resolution is earned when Marcus lets his narration break, accepting the cost of feeling without the protective script. The pressure is mostly internal and quiet, but it does meaningfully narrow options.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—whether ambiguous, aesthetic language can re-enter a controlled society—is compelling conceptually but remains lightly pressured on the page. Kael’s warning that “they’ll try to ban it again” introduces opposition, yet Meris never wavers or faces a concrete test of what she’s willing to risk. Escalation is more atmospheric than tactical; the humming grows, more poets approach, but no option is truly foreclosed. The ending reads as a reaffirmation of a stance she had from line one rather than a hard-won decision.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—waking Tomás and, through him, the courtyard from the phoenix-induced fugue—is intelligible, but pressure remains gentle. Once the problem is identified, there’s essentially one tactic (Maya paints the awakening) with no meaningful obstacle beyond acquiring the reed, which Tomás yields without real resistance. The concept of bartering awakenings has moral bite, yet no one on the page pushes back or forces a hard choice, so there’s no substantial narrowing of options or escalation. The resolution feels clean and somewhat frictionless, limiting tension and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—can connection be re-created and shared after the blackout years?—is clear but only lightly pressured. The conflict is largely internal and conceptual (Maren vs isolation and skepticism), and once tonight’s “most ambitious iteration” begins, there is no real risk of failure or reversal. The volunteer’s fear dissipates quickly without resistance, so escalation reads as a gentle deepening rather than a tightening that forecloses options. The ending is earned, but the path there feels almost frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central pressure—whether Mara will remain closed in her private grief or risk engaging and guiding another wounded person—builds gently through the decision to teach, the assignment, and Senna’s breakthrough piece. Conflict is almost entirely internal and relational, with no sharp reversals; escalation reads as deepening rather than narrowing options. The clearest tightening is Mara’s move from private cranes mapping her own feelings to a crane that reveals the observatory itself, exposing her sanctuary. While effective for a quiet piece, the stakes remain more conceptual than viscerally felt, keeping this just below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the meaning of the grandmother’s diagrams—is clear but remains mostly intellectual, with little sense of loss if they fail beyond abstract cultural stakes. Conflict is gently accumulative rather than escalating; once Vesper sees the circuits as maps, events move steadily toward success without reversals, resistance, or hard trade-offs. The “work through the night” montage suggests effort but not jeopardy. As a result, pressure never tightens enough to force difficult choices or visibly raise the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether truly understanding the Kaen’s transcendence will seduce or inoculate her, and by extension her people—is clear and thematically rich. Pressure escalates primarily through accumulating psychic/emotional intensity as she absorbs more crystals, culminating in her recognizing the archive as warning rather than blueprint and fixing her intention toward the Council. Conflict is almost entirely internal and philosophical, with no strong external counterforce on the page, which keeps tension more cerebral than visceral. Nonetheless, the crystallized final decision (finish reading, then return to teach restraint) is a credible, cost-aware stance under that pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—what kind of dreams (and thus what kind of hope) the archive preserves—is signaled early via Sera’s role and solidifies as she compares old vs. optimized dreams. Escalation is primarily internal and conceptual: the recognition that shared dreams are “killing” hope, then the shift from suspicion to conviction and finally to action (copying and planning to disseminate older dreams). That turn is clear but relatively low-friction; no active opposition, risk, or time pressure tightens her decision, so the sense of cost is more inferred than felt. As a quiet, thematic piece it works, but adding even a small concrete constraint or danger would intensify stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central stake—how Elena will live with the fallout of her fraud and what kind of scientist she will be now—is clear and present throughout. Pressure is situational and internal rather than event-driven, but it does tighten from numb ruin toward the risk of openly rebuilding her work on weaker institutional footing. The choice to pursue qualitative journals and openly admit falsification forecloses the easier path of denial or silence, though the narrative never forces this calculus into a sharper external test. Conflict is rich but a bit pre-resolved, with no new obstacle or counterargument emerging in the scene itself.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the true story of Sarah’s disappearance—is clear early and deepens credibly into an ethical stake of justice when Venn is revealed. Escalation is primarily informational rather than confrontational: the roses’ incomplete account gives way to the table’s decisive memory, which does narrow Mara’s options and reframe her goal. Internal and external conflicts intertwine well (her self-harm and need to know vs. the horror of what she learns). The lack of any active opposing force in the present moment keeps tension slightly below peak; conflict feels intense but contained within a contemplative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Celeste can locate and meaningfully use “unused love”—is clear, but the on-page pressure around it stays gentle and contemplative. Escalation comes mainly from revelation (unused love as substance, then the citywide map) rather than from opposition or hard trade-offs. Her final decision is a thoughtful redirection rather than a fraught choice between competing harms; nothing actively resists her or forces a sacrifice beyond the conceptual acceptance of loss. The piece works under an accumulative lens, but conflict feels low-intensity for elite markets.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central conflict—rigid, over-mathematized control versus risked imperfection in art—is coherent and escalates as Celestine moves from witness to actor with the astrolabe. The decisive tightening comes when she chooses to trace stars “wrong” on purpose, risking the system the Keeper built and its consequences for both of them. The cost is primarily conceptual and emotional (relinquishing certainty, dissolving a being), not situationally dire, so tension stays contemplative rather than urgent. For elite venues, the stakes could use one more concrete pressure or potential loss on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.5)
    Conflict and stakes remain largely abstract and unopposed: Maren never faces meaningful resistance to planting the seeds, and her ability to charm probability is never seriously tested. The main “tightening” is conceptual—a reminder that in some timelines the last forest never stops burning—which she meets with a reaffirmation of her existing stance. There’s no true reversal or narrowing of options; the scene feels like a beautifully rendered iteration of ongoing work, not a peak moment. As a result, tension is gentle and atmospheric rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake is understanding his sixth sense and the forest’s meaning, with the pressure being whether he can integrate unconscious insight with conscious reason. Escalation is primarily one of approaching comprehension—the hum intensifies, he reaches the clearing, assembles the mechanism—but there’s little sense of risk, opposition, or meaningful alternative. The activation of the device and unraveling of the trees read as an inevitable success, not a hard-won or costly outcome. This keeps the conflict from fully sharpening, even for a quiet conceptual piece.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—Mara’s need to choose between clinging to safety and stepping into risk—is clearly signaled and deepens as the guides redirect her from searching beaches to climbing fog-shrouded slopes. Escalation is primarily internal but real: the key tightening comes when she admits feeling lighter and then sees a different path through the ticket punch, which redefines the “find my dog” goal as “follow my dog/courage.” The final choice to head “not back toward home but forward through the gathering dark” constitutes an earned renunciation with conceptual cost. The pressure remains gentle throughout, so the emotional jeopardy never quite reaches a knife-edge.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Rielle can face and reframe the cost of what happened here—is legible and tightened through her choice to enter the room, accept Silent-Choir’s wordless testimony, and then play despite pain. Pressure escalates in a quiet, internal way as the history of the children and Silent-Choir’s presence comes to light, culminating in her physically and emotionally recommitting to the anthem. The price is clear (reopened trauma, renewed pain, acceptance that safety always has a payer), though the conflict remains almost entirely internal and gently modulated. For this length and mode, one substantial tightening is effectively delivered.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.8)
    The stakes—royal succession and the exposure of a murderous pretender—are large and clearly signaled, and the use of the rune creates a satisfying conceptual “unraveling.” However, the conflict is nearly frictionless: the pretender’s cleverness is described but never forces Ossian to adapt or risk anything tangible. Escalation is mostly procedural (find each corrupted passage, inscribe rune fragments) rather than pressured, so tension stays intellectual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake is epistemic and ecological: understanding anomalous currents as a record of human impact, with secondary emotional stakes around her grandfather’s legacy. Pressure escalates from routine monitoring to a paradigm-shifting interpretation when the current manifests early, prompting Mara’s decisive instruction to Mendel and the framing of her report. However, there’s little sense of immediate risk or sacrifice; the cost is mostly abstract and historical rather than personally or materially perilous. The conflict is thus engaging but low-temperature, skewing contemplative over tense.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake is Kess’s need to find a truer way to resist, and the pressure coherently shifts from external failure (lull in rebellion) to internal recalibration. The discovery and activation of the circle serve as the main escalation, deepening the conflict from political tactics to epistemology (“how to see”). However, there’s little sense of competing options or real jeopardy—no live alternative path is truly tested on the page. As a result, tension feels contemplative rather than acutely pressured, limiting escalation depth.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—how Naja will respond to a postwar world that seeks to erase her traditions and a poisoned land that needs restoration—is clear, but on-page pressure is relatively soft. The tension around defying the Authority’s geological ban and embracing a risky, identity-altering symbiosis remains largely conceptual; her descent and transformation are not meaningfully resisted. Escalation comes mainly from revelations (map, embryo, destiny) rather than from tightened options or sharpened trade-offs. The ending’s promise to teach others hints at future conflict but doesn’t force a difficult, immediate choice here.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether she can live forward without betraying her dead—is clear and present early. Pressure escalates mainly through deepening understanding of her somatic markers and her deliberate practice of not fleeing or fighting them. The key “choice” is her repeated, on-page renunciation of avoidance: stopping, waiting, letting panic crest, which forecloses the path of dissociation. The conflict is internal and somewhat static in the present scene, so escalation feels more like an earned plateau than a sharp test.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether she will resist or embrace a destabilizing, fragmentary truth about her art and reality—is present early and tightened as the walls close in. The key escalation is clear: each card placement worsens her physical peril while deepening her understanding, forcing her to continue despite the risk. Her “choice” at the climax is more a continuation under pressure than a sharp dilemma, but it still reads as a stance: accepting necessary darkness over comforting illusion. The cost is implied (loss of previous artistic mode and comfort), though it could be dramatized a touch more concretely.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—capture a dangerous, ideologically driven fugitive while wrestling with his own relationship to her theories—is clear early and stays coherent. There is a meaningful tightening when he finally confronts her and the drone’s weapons arm, forcing a choice between execution, complicity, or formal arrest. However, Vera offers no real resistance, and the system pressure (what happens if he sympathizes too much, or if the drone fires) remains mostly hypothetical; escalation is more conceptual than visceral. The resolution feels earned but somewhat under-tested in terms of visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—risking societal stability by awakening a frozen witness to systemic crime—is clearly articulated early and tightens toward the choice to wake one Testimonial. Internal and external conflicts are nicely braided: her duty to preserve order versus her duty to preserve truth. Escalation is more ethical and conceptual than event-driven, with no major reversal beyond her initial temptation to wake them all; this works but keeps tension at a thoughtful simmer rather than a boil. The cost is acknowledged (“ending her own life as she’d known it”) but we don’t see any concrete loss yet, which keeps the stakes slightly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.9)
    The central conflict—Mira’s refusal to surrender the dome or her vocation to Kael’s demands—tightens steadily through their dialogue and his quiet readiness to use violence. The strongest escalation beat is the revelation that he’s lying about the magistrate, reframing the pressure as coming from him rather than the world. Her choice to hold her ground yet offer a cutting and tea is a nuanced trade-off between resistance and keeping the relationship viable. The stakes remain intimate and moral rather than materially dire, which suits the piece but keeps escalation at a subdued register.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—securing the goddess’s original echo again—is clear from early on, and the tension does tighten as she casts the silence and the garden grows more volatile. However, much of the danger (eardrum-blood, gravity shifts) stays atmospheric; Mara never has to seriously consider abandoning the attempt or paying a visible price beyond carrying the echo. The escalation climax (the echo entering her shaped void) is strong but resolves smoothly, with minimal sense of real risk or sacrifice. This keeps the conflict effective but not truly bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether to honor her father’s public silence or expose the fraud—is clear from early on and narrows as she uncovers the strategic nature of the retraction. The application of “proof by contradiction” provides a distinct deepening beat that shifts options and reframes her father’s motives, leading into the choice to publish. However, opposition is almost entirely internal and off-stage; we’re told of land fraud, risk, and lawsuits, but no concrete on-page consequence or counter-force presses back in the scene. As a result, the tension is intellectually engaging but not viscerally tight.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.9)
    The central stake—to confront and transform the “haunted” accumulation of unheeded cries and her own guilt—is signaled early and tightened as she moves from receiving the letter to engaging the machine’s interface. The key deepening comes when she discovers in the firmware “every sound she’d failed to hear,” making the conflict unmistakably personal rather than abstractly technical. Her agency in choosing to work, and in using the amber, resolves the pressure credibly. Escalation is more emotional/introspective than oppositional; a bit more on-page resistance from the system or from her own hesitation could have raised the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—finding a way to contend with mass unlearning—is clear but remains largely conceptual and low-friction. Pressure does accumulate (from solitary experiment to group witnessing and emergent hush), and the “Don’t speak it” moment gives a small tactical turn. However, options are never meaningfully narrowed, and neither Moth nor the crowd must trade one real possibility for another. The story reads as a successful ritual more than a test under pressure, which limits escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Layla can break or reconfigure her retrocognitive trap and reclaim the erased dead—is clear and thematically potent. There is a meaningful deepening as she shifts from passive suffering in the loop to active pattern-reading and naming, culminating in renaming the space. However, escalation is more conceptual than felt; the regime’s threat remains abstract and the outcome of her action is not materially contested on the page, which keeps tension strong but not gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—can Margaux secure an encore/a stabilizing performance before she unravels—is clear and paid off by her garden dance and the cross-time audience. Pressure escalates via the coin’s temporal echoes and the garden/maze amplifying her performance to attract witnesses across decades. However, the escalation is more conceptual and textural than felt as narrowing options; we never see a realistic alternative path or a moment where she could meaningfully fail, which softens tension. The cost (her dissolution into “everything”) is conceptually rich but lands as serene rather than sharply conflicted, which limits the sense of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.8)
    The stakes—eight hundred minds trapped in constant telepathic noise—are high and clearly stated, and the shift from theory to “this could save them” is a solid deepening. However, on-page opposition is minimal: no concrete obstacle or counterforce tests Mara’s plan in the moment, and her uncertainty never hardens into a dilemma. As a result, pressure feels more conceptual than viscerally escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—Maren’s drive to map and eventually speak for an inhuman consciousness—is clear but remains mostly abstract and unopposed. Discovery and understanding unfurl without meaningful risk, dilemma, or price; the overwhelming sensation is described but never forces a choice that could harm her, the caves, or her sleeping kin, so tension plateaus instead of truly escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether meaning can keep pace with forgetting—is clear, and pressure escalates as hourglasses speed up and the pattern in the buttons emerges. Mara’s key choice (to make the archive public-facing via the echo jar and charts) resolves the conflict in a way that coheres with the drive lens. However, the conflict remains largely conceptual, with limited sense of sacrifice or foreclosure beyond an avoided abstract doom; there’s little visible price to Mara personally. Tension is steady rather than taut, keeping this strong but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (saving and transmitting the snow-coded evidence before thaw) is clear and tightened effectively by the three-day window. Internal conflict (fear of acting vs. keeping Sarah’s promise) interweaves with the external mission, and his decision to involve Emma is a meaningful turn. However, opposition feels light: no institutional resistance, physical barrier, or moral dilemma truly tests his resolve once he decides, and Emma’s cooperation is frictionless. As a result escalation feels more like steady execution than a pressured narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether she can force her grandmother’s life into a single, legible layer—is clear early and sharpened by each new piece of journal backstory. Pressure escalates through intimacy rather than plot: as she reveals the daughter given away and the mix of joy/regret, the need to decide on a “true” version becomes ethically and emotionally weightier. The turn comes with the needle reframed and his assertion that “all of it is true,” after which her stance materially shifts. The conflict is quiet and mostly internal, which keeps the cost from feeling as sharp as in more overtly pressured pieces.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether and how places can resist destructive change—is clear, and pressure accumulates as the potter confronts the disparity between the wasteland and the oasis. Escalation is mostly internal and conceptual: her realization that kindness acts as a temporal anchor deepens the conflict between softness and the world’s hardness. The primary tightening comes when the beekeeper frames kindness as the forgotten principle behind the world’s collapse, compelling her to choose how she’ll live afterward. The conflict never becomes sharply agonistic or risky in a concrete sense, which keeps the stakes somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is largely internal and communal—whether light and care can take root in a hostile, dim environment—and it’s signaled early. Pressure builds texturally (multiple gardens, the hush of a waiting neighborhood, discovering a new seedling patch), but there’s minimal tightening in terms of narrowed options or explicit trade-offs. The closure choice (to repurpose the gauge tooth and recommit) is emotionally apt yet feels low-risk on the page, with the cost of endurance more implied than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will experience her dual existence as fragmentation or expansion—is clearly posed, and the arrival of “The Art of Being Multiple” provides a meaningful deepening. However, escalation is mostly intellectual; there is minimal sense of risk, opposition, or a path she might permanently foreclose by choosing wrong. The library and her work never push back in ways that force trade-offs; the new stance comes without an on-page sacrifice beyond implied ongoing solitude. As a result, tension feels gently cumulative rather than truly tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Margot remains a hollow conduit or claims a place inside the web of longing she’s curated—is signaled early and tightened effectively when she realizes her clients have transformed their secrets via the installation. Pressure escalates when she recognizes concrete echoes of her ghostwritten letters and is confronted with Sena’s “You’ve been looking for the pattern, haven’t you?”, forcing her to face her own exclusion. Her choice to add a letter to herself forecloses the option of staying a detached facilitator and carries the cost of self-exposure. The conflict is quiet but coherent and does not stall.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—preventing the tricksters from leveraging the station to scale chaos—is clear and coherently pressed through the piece. Escalation appears in the converging signals and mounting campus weirdness, and Mara’s choice to run the subsonic-laced track is the main tightening. However, most of the “power plays” and campus division are summarized rather than dramatized, and the solution works on the first attempt with no apparent loss or hard trade-off. The conflict feels smartly conceived but emotionally and tactically slightly under-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stakes—recovering the Architect’s Key to resurrect the spatial mutiny, and Mara’s need to master her claustrophobia—are clearly signaled and carried through. Pressure tightens once when she chooses to move toward the organ sound despite fear, and again when the disc reveals a second layer, deepening the implications of her find. However, external conflict is minimal: the organ functions more as guide than true threat, there’s no competing force or real risk of failure on the page, and her phobia never truly endangers the mission. The result is steady tension but limited escalation or visible price beyond discomfort.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are articulated (reviving a cold case, “giving Catherine back”), but there’s little dramatized pressure or escalation; most conflict is conceptual and summarized (“Three people came forward within hours”). Elena never faces a hard choice or visible cost on the page, and the investigation’s concrete hurdles stay off-stage. The result is emotionally engaging but low-tension, more essayistic than truly conflict-driven. This keeps the story from feeling urgent despite its elegiac beauty.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will risk entering a “wound-door” to validate her ancestor’s exile—is clear, and the escalation from decoding theory to physically going outside is a solid tightening. Internal and external conflicts are interwoven but softly contested; Dr. Kao’s shift from skepticism to following happens with little friction, and Mira faces no real on-page resistance beyond her own fear. The cost and irreversibility of the decision are implied rather than dramatized through a visible sacrifice or sharper dilemma in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.6)
    Conflict is primarily situational and conceptual: will Mara understand and respond to the encoded call for “pixelated amnesty.” Escalation occurs as the mystery deepens into active intervention (she plays, resolution increases, figures appear and cross), but she faces little on-page resistance or dilemma—she almost immediately leans into her role. The trapped figures’ stakes are high in concept but not viscerally contested; no alternative path or sacrifice is strongly foregrounded beyond physical effort. The pressure rises, but gently, with more wonder than tension.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether the father will keep circling back to robbery or attempt a new path—is legible early and coheres with Marco’s own fear of inherited cycles. Pressure escalates primarily through revelation and invitation rather than sharp reversals: the father narrates his criminal past via the bills, then Marco reframes the future by offering the preserve as an alternative territory. The father’s eventual, tentative acceptance (“Teach me how you’ve made this place safe”) is a meaningful tightening but arrives without much resistance or friction, making the conflict feel relatively gentle. A slightly clearer sense of what Marco stands to lose if this goes wrong (beyond implied risk) would deepen the price of his stance.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will continue shouldering the inscriptions alone or reframe them as shared, survivable work—is articulated and resolved. Pressure escalates mainly via intellectual and emotional deepening as they decode, especially when Delta Cephei is linked to “transformation through darkness” and grief. However, opposition is largely internal and soft; once Elias enters, there’s little real resistance, and no serious risk that she’ll persist in Ashwin’s self-destructive path. The cost of changing course is implied rather than fully dramatized, keeping the tension in a thoughtful rather than gripping register.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—freeing the apprentice from the curse—is clear from the outset and tightly held. There is one meaningful deepening when Maren recognizes the flesh-eating seeds and shifts from soothing magic to war-song, reframing the conflict from rescue to forcing accountability. However, the path from recognition to solution is relatively smooth: the curse yields once she applies the right song, with no serious setback or moral trade-off. The internal and external conflicts are nicely aligned but could stand one more beat of resistance or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether and how to respond now that the covenant has failed and the future arrived early—is clear and appropriately scaled. Pressure escalates from anticipation to embodied risk when they enact the theorized scar-linking and relinquish the clipping’s ordered form. However, the conflict is highly cooperative and almost frictionless; once they meet, no serious obstacle, doubt, or failed attempt complicates their path. As a result, the emotional and tactical cost of “guiding the future” feels somewhat under-tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Marcus will continue to try to outsource his suffering or accept an integrated self—is clear early and tightened by the revelation that Rebecca has been harmed by the trade. Escalation is primarily internal and thematic rather than situational, but it does deepen: what began as a bad fit of happiness becomes an ethical and ontological problem once we know destinies deform in the wearing. The final choice to embrace pain over borrowed joy is coherent and costs him his fantasy of an easy fix. The piece stops short of dramatizing a sharper on-page struggle before he accepts her offer, which keeps pressure strong but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant conflict—whether Marcus can risk trusting his judgment again—is clearly established and intertwined with the immediate task of valuing the bottles. Pressure builds as his fear of another humiliating miscall stalls the appraisal, and Sarah’s impatience provides a grounded external nudge. The decisive turn is his choice to lean into instinct rather than retreat into paralyzing doubt, with the implied risk of further professional damage. Escalation remains mostly internal and relatively subtle; the stakes could be pushed slightly harder on the page to heighten cost.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Emilia’s need to understand Harrow’s work and reframe her grief—is clear early and does culminate in a new, active stance. However, the pressure does not meaningfully tighten; once she plants the seed, the story moves along an almost frictionless path as the vine grows, fruits, and imparts knowledge. There is little sense of risk or tradeoff in her choices (biting the fruit, accepting the new paradigm), so the cost remains conceptual rather than felt. The result is thoughtful but low-tension conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—can wonder survive in a world without a future?—is clear but remains mostly conceptual, expressed through conversation and design rather than sharpened conflict. There is a meaningful deepening when the visitor appears and voices her loss of remembered aspiration, prompting Maris to enact her philosophy with the scroll ritual. The micro-turn from numbness to recognition in the young woman functions, but escalation is low-key and risk-free; no real option is foreclosed, no visible price is paid. For a top-tier market, some additional friction—resistance, doubt, or a threatened failure of the system—would strengthen the pressure curve.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—what kind of “survival” Marcus is serving—is clear, but opposition is largely conceptual and internal. Pressure deepens when the confessions implicate his profession, and the pearl’s awakening forces a stance about what to do with these hopes. However, there’s minimal friction or real dilemma; once he understands, his new mission is accepted without costed alternatives or pushback. This yields a thoughtful but relatively low-tension escalation arc.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Maya can inhabit her unmedicated, hyper-perceptive state without collapsing—is clear but remains largely internal and contemplative. Escalation appears in the incremental deepening: more data, deeper wading, and the evolving graffiti dialogue culminate in her standing in the center current and reframing forgiveness. However, there’s minimal on-page jeopardy or hard trade-off; no external event forces a sharp choice, so tension stays gentle rather than gripping. The earned stasis at the end works, but the pressure never fully bites.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—will she reach and correctly use the library to uncover the promised truth—is clear early and deepens when the grandmother’s unspoken words reveal painful, unexpected motives. Pressure escalates mainly through knowledge: deciphering the cipher, decoding the library’s physics, and confronting the emotional cost of the grandmother’s choices. The key turn is her reinterpretation of the quest’s purpose, which is earned but unfolds more as graceful realization than as a forced trade-off with a sharply felt on-page loss. The conflict remains largely internal and contemplative, with minimal resistance or risk of genuine failure in the present scene.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—justice for the monks vs. complicity with the Empire—is signaled early and sharpened by the vision of two futures. The ethical pressure escalates from a binary choice to Elena’s engineered workaround, which carries visible cost (career, credibility, risk of exposure). Internal and external conflicts are tightly braided: her professional obligation, personal promise, and political consequences are inseparable in the decision. The only limitation is that we don’t see an immediate on-page loss or retaliation, so the price remains projected rather than partially paid.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—Lyra’s need to “capture one last spark before oblivion”—is articulated, but on-page pressure remains relatively gentle and unopposed. The aurora’s intensification and the chip’s pulsing provide texture, yet Lyra never faces a tangible risk of failure, ethical dilemma, or interruption that would narrow options. Escalation is more atmospheric than structural, so the final moment feels like a successful execution of a familiar ritual rather than a hard-won outcome. The story would gain from one concrete complication or trade-off that tests her craft or belief.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant conflict—Keiko’s frustration that forgiveness did not yield the expected peace—is clear and tight, with the stake being her relationship to her own past and capacity for contentment. Pressure deepens through her confession of restlessness and culminates in the hairpin/mother reveal, which shifts her understanding rather than offering an external fix. The woman’s gentle but firm demand, “Tell me what you’ve learned,” is a solid tightening beat. The piece stops short of dramatizing any real risk in Keiko’s choice to accept this new frame, so the cost, while present, remains mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will cling to or relinquish her lucrative black-and-white conscience—is clearly signaled early. Pressure deepens as she confronts the consequences of Vincent’s choice and recognizes her own omission (“I gave him certainty when he needed wisdom”), culminating in the renunciation of her old role. The conflict is largely internal and reflective, so escalation is more conceptual than peril-based, but the before/after in her options is legible and costly. A touch more resistance or temptation to keep the old model would have sharpened the tension further.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the student can be brought to readiness in time for her to pass on the art of vanishing—is clear but very quiet. Pressure escalates modestly: his fear on arrival, the trance deepening, the shift when he “began to see,” and the question about her future forgetting. Agency is present in her decision to finally reveal what has long been withheld, but there’s little sense of a hard trade-off or foreclosed alternative beyond the conceptual cost. The conflict remains largely internal and philosophical, which suits the piece’s mode but keeps tension from fully sharpening.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.2)
    The central stake—the bone towers’ degradation threatening a sacred navigational system—is conceptually high, but the on-page conflict is low-friction. Kael diagnoses the problem without resistance or risk; the ravens' pattern and arrowhead pulse align smoothly, and the solution (weeks of careful work) feels laborious but not precarious. There is one mild tightening when he shifts from reading history to perceiving present damage, but no reversal or genuine narrowing of options. As a result, tension remains largely intellectual rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Maren’s human, imperfect practice has value in an automated age—is clear and present early. Pressure escalates through accumulated failure, physical discomfort, and the deepening of the “brilliant dimness” until the walls and keystone answer her effort. The internal conflict between convenience (teleportation, spell-generators) and chosen effort surfaces in her actions rather than being purely told. The tension remains largely interior and could use one sharper on-page cost or forked choice to push into higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—fulfilling her grandfather’s luminous vow / recovering his work—is legible early and followed through, and the dive provides at least a nominal tightening of pressure. However, the underwater sequence is surprisingly unopposed: no obstacles, close calls, or hard choices complicate her path once she’s in the water, so the goal feels certain of success. The emotional conflict (loyalty, grief, meaning of her job) is implicit but under-escalated; she never has to risk losing something in the present to honor the past. As a result, the closure is satisfying but the conflict curve is relatively flat.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes—surviving or being annihilated in the Big Crunch—are enormous and stated clearly, and the meaningful turn is Mira realizing the coins receive instructions from the future and that alignment is possible. Internal and external pressures, however, are relatively soft: Kael’s skepticism melts quickly, institutional or physical obstacles don’t appear, and the three-day deadline is mostly a conceptual backdrop rather than a live, scene-level clock. The conflict thus escalates more in idea than in felt resistance. The resolution is earned but somewhat low-friction for the declared scale.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether her renunciation of Daniel was love or cowardice—is clear early and deepens as she discovers how precisely she is echoing her predecessor. Escalation is primarily internal and conceptual: the pressure comes from recognizing the pattern and needing a stance that lets her live with it. The actual decisive act (leaving Daniel) is off-page and summarized, which blunts on-page tension even though the cost is evident. The ending crystallization is strong, but a slightly more immediate present-tense pressure point would tighten the conflict further.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—restoring a livable yield from the sea—is clear early and coherently tied to Emris’s project and self-worth. Escalation is mostly accumulative: years of taking, months of study, and a long, draining reconstruction session that taxes his limited magic. However, the climactic act itself is relatively smooth: there’s no concrete on-page setback or reversal during the rebuild, and success arrives without a moment where it seems plausibly in doubt. The cost is present but mild in-scene (fatigue more than sacrifice), keeping the conflict solid but not gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes are primarily internal and situational: whether Millbrook’s resurfacing will actually be witnessed and integrated into Marcus’s understanding before it is “expunged” by returning water. Pressure coherently escalates through time limitation (before dawn, before the autumn rains) and through the deepening of shared memories once Marcus commits to listening. However, conflict remains gentle—there’s no hard on-page test of his duty versus his longing, and no moment where he risks breaking rules or losing status. The result is a satisfying but low-intensity escalation that fits the piece but keeps it short of maximal sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—will she complete the Opus that may either succeed or consume her—is clearly flagged, and there is a meaningful tightening when the orchard shudders and the mixture begins to glow. However, opposition is soft: no genuine obstacle, reversal, or cost really tests her resolve once she reaches the orchard; the trees and starlings ultimately cooperate rather than resist. Internal conflict about risk or sacrifice is largely absent in the live moment, so the escalation curve feels gentle, almost ceremonial. The resolution is clean but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central conflict—truthful observation vs Command’s demand for revision—is articulated early and sustained. Pressure deepens meaningfully when Command herself comes on and forces Vera to justify her entire notation system, testing her resolve. The cost is psychological and professional (risk of being dismissed or broken like her predecessor) rather than concretely dramatized, so the stakes feel a bit abstract at times. There’s one solid tightening turn, but no strong sense that any option besides endurance was live, which moderates the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—who will raise the child and how—is signaled early and tightly linked to Kira’s internal fight against numbness. Conflict escalates when Kira admits her lack of love and then reframes the problem as a need for complementary opposites, forcing a more complex ethical calculus. The cost is largely conceptual and relational rather than dramatized through concrete risk to the child, so tension stays intellectual more than visceral. The main reversal (from “we can’t both raise her” to shared custody) is effective but a little under-contested.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.3)
    The main pressure—whether to follow the coordinates and indulge the mystery or to reject it to protect her creative sanctuary—is clear and tight. The realization that the seeds are a long-game sabotage against puzzle designers is a meaningful deepening of stakes. Escalation remains primarily internal and intellectual, with limited sense of risk or loss beyond the conceptual, so tension never fully peaks. Her decision to discard the seed and commit to warning others is a genuine narrowing of options, albeit with relatively low on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether they let silence consume them or risk reinhabiting their grief together—is clear and steadily pressured. The meaningful tightening occurs when Sarah descends, demanding explanation and then choosing to participate, which reconfigures both their options and the tunnel’s meaning. The cost (re-opening raw pain, risking laughter in the wake of loss) is implicit but felt, especially as Sarah breaks into crying and laughing. Escalation is modest and internal rather than sharp, which suits the piece but keeps it from the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are clearly stated—her identity and the safety of forbidden texts—and the danger of being absorbed into the dream realm gives the conflict an interior edge. There is one meaningful tightening when the pendant’s pulsing begins fracturing her across dimensions, raising the risk of acting. However, the resolution is achieved in a single unopposed action (she simply grasps and snaps the chain) with no on-page setback or forced trade-off beyond the pre-declared risk. The lack of a concrete reversal or visible consequence beyond success keeps tension from fully peaking.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stakes—whether Cassia remains a failed heir or claims a dangerous, self-defined mastery—are legible and culminate in her choice to perform forbidden vivification. Internal and external conflicts intertwine (Church expectations, paternal legacy, self-worth), and there is a meaningful tightening when she commits to taboo rites. Still, pressure is relatively soft: there’s no real resistance during the ritual, no live risk that bites or forces adaptation, and the Church’s power stays mostly abstract/offstage. As a result, escalation feels more like a smooth incline than a test with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—finding non-hollow meaning in cosmic signals—is clear but manifests primarily as an internal, philosophical pressure rather than a sharp on-page dilemma. There is one real tightening: her decision to discard assumptions and retune for absence, which changes her options and leads to the fragment. However, opposition is soft (static and habit, not an active force), and the price of the new stance isn’t sharply felt beyond implied ego/professional upheaval. As a result, escalation is present but muted, keeping tension at a contemplative simmer rather than a boil.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the ferry will retain coherence and keep its passengers safe—is clear and escalates as more of the boat phases out. Mateo’s agency drives the main turn (choosing to merge the timelines, using the hourglass to find the confluence), and the move into the whirlpool of light functions as a credible climax. Yet the conflict lacks bite: Torres yields quickly, there’s no real contest of values, and the merging works on the first attempt without visible loss, injury, or enduring constraint beyond an abstract status change. Tension operates, but never quite feels dangerous or morally fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Marina can reconceptualize her relationships and memories—is clear but remains largely internal and low-pressure. The weaving intensifies into a flurry of memories, which constitutes a mild escalation, yet there’s no real threat of failure or significant alternative path; she never wavers or considers stopping. The resolution feels earned but not hard-won, with limited sense of trade-off beyond accepting instability.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Carta can genuinely learn this alien navigation and thus expand her perceptual world—is clear. There is some escalation when she moves from abstract instruction to the trench’s edge and must attempt to “see the edges” herself, but the pressure is gentle, almost guaranteed-success. Conflict is largely internal and philosophical, with no meaningful chance of failure or relational rupture signaled on the page. As a result, tension exists but never tightens into a hard trade-off or sharper cost.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—Lily’s emotional and physical safety from an abuser—is legible early via the warning-shaped “concern” and specific mentions of isolation tactics. Pressure escalates as the hearing aid’s pulse quickens and the network of voices reveals a textbook pattern of control, followed by Lily’s arrival and the bruise on her wrist. However, Mira never has to risk much or make a fraught trade-off; once Lily appears, she simply acts in line with her job and values. The conflict remains somewhat one-sided (no direct antagonist presence or serious obstruction), keeping the sense of cost and escalation just under high-band intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stakes—obtain proof of Kove’s discovery within a flooding, time-limited facility—are signaled early and held. Pressure coherently escalates with the turning tide and the entities’ brief manifestation, forcing Mara to endure her fear and stay in place to document them. However, the conflict remains largely one-sided: the entities are benign custodians, and the environment never quite forces a hard trade-off between safety and evidence on the page. The result is tense but not harrowing, more about endurance and witnessing than a sharpened dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—Mira’s need to know whether her mistake “killed” Chen or not—is signaled early and sharpened as her technical options narrow. Escalation comes from the turn to chaos theory and the physically repetitive, obsessive ink experiments through the night, culminating in the recovered files and Chen’s clarifying notes. The conflict remains mostly internal, but the external problem of corrupted data gives it concrete shape. The price is emotional and temporal (a night of grueling work atop long-term guilt) rather than catastrophic, but the deepening is clear and sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Sarielle can convert a dead touch-language into a living sonic one—is legible early and tightened when she realizes the diamond can “tunnel” sensation into sound. Escalation is accumulative rather than reversal-driven: birds respond, echoes deepen, the diamond heats, her veins blaze, and the all-night labor reads as a meaningful intensification with bodily cost. Her final act of leaving the diamond behind is a credible renunciation that forecloses her role as sole bearer of the language in favor of communal access. Still, conflict remains mostly internal and procedural; there’s little sense of possible failure or alternative path, which keeps the pressure strong-but-gentle rather than acute.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Maya will remain a clinical hunter of anomalies or allow herself to be “hunted” into a new state—is clear and thematically strong. Pressure escalates via revelations (the offerings, the phone voices, Voss’s laugh) and the gift of the arrowhead as a prelude to “choosing.” However, conflict remains mostly internal and contemplative; there’s no concrete external test or forced trade-off on the page, and her professional obligations never directly bite. The final moment crystallizes stakes but stops short of a felt price actually being paid.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether old magic/beauty can be reawakened in a controlled mechanical order—is signaled clearly and escalates as the music spreads from individual passersby to statues to the whole city. The key tightening is Mira choosing to continue playing as her violin cracks, which deepens her commitment and introduces a concrete (if modest) cost. However, opposition remains mostly abstract; the “dangerous and desperate” idea never meets an active antagonist or a real risk of punishment or failure. The resolution feels earned but not hard-won, which limits the felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are clear—illegal crossings under drone surveillance, with familial reunification and medicine as concrete outcomes—but on the page, Maren encounters no genuine obstruction beyond the drones passing overhead. The dominant pressure is temporal (the “lone mail drop” window) and systemic (drones, regulations), yet the scene as written unfolds without a true tightening where something nearly goes wrong or forces a risky improvisation. Her micro-choices (using the arcade, placing the null-field, wordless coordination with Samir) are smart but not contested. As a result, tension is more conceptual and atmospheric than viscerally escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece reads almost entirely as meditative process; there’s no strong antagonistic pressure, and the work proceeds without serious obstacle or trade-off on the page. The dominant stake—making ruin sing, realizing his vision—is clear but never meaningfully threatened or tightened. The halo fragment slides perfectly into the gap with no resistance; the “test spin” works on the first try. That keeps tension low and prevents the emotional or situational stakes from escalating beyond a gentle deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Cordelia can “reawaken” the library and prove/embody her theory—remains largely internal and low-risk. There is a gentle escalation (air thickening, lamplight bending, patrons noticing), but no real resistance or trade-off that forces a hard choice; things work almost too smoothly. Her main agency is deciding when and how to perform the ritual, then observing its effects rather than grappling with consequences. The piece is compelling as a mood, yet underpowered in terms of tightening pressure and visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—whether Mara will remain anchored to her human life or follow Theo into the between-places—is clear and does culminate in a decisive choice. Escalation is present in the discovery of the cipher method, repeated expeditions, and the final alignment of light in the cave. However, the conflict stays largely conceptual and inward, without a strongly felt trade-off in the moment of decision; it feels as if she was always going to step forward, so opposition never quite bites. The price of abandoning the library and ordinary reality is more gestural than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will confront her fear to seek the truth about her sister and the city—is clear from early on and is paid off in her descent and acceptance of the book. The disorientation at the nexus and the locksmith’s warning provide a credible, if brief, test of resolve. However, escalation is modest: the path opens as soon as she follows the coordinates; there is no reversal or real risk of loss beyond a few lines of vertigo. The result is emotionally satisfying but not especially tense or costly.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—recovering or understanding her lost memories versus respecting a dangerous, quasi-sacred construct—is clear and escalates into the pivotal choice to pluck and then harvest the mushrooms. The internal conflict between documentarian caution and desperate need is nicely dramatized in the “when habits broke” moment. However, the sense of possible negative consequence (for her mind, for the world, for the ritual) is only lightly sketched, so the cost feels more implied than sharply tested. Escalation is thus strong but not punishingly tight.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central conflict—whether Finn will remain defended and scornful or risk engagement with the archivist’s method—is clear and thematically apt. Pressure does deepen as his insults give way to confession (“My parents said I needed ‘fixing’”) and then tentative participation. However, the stakes stay largely interior and low-intensity; there’s no sharp on-page price for either vulnerability or refusal. The resulting escalation feels authentic but subdued, limiting impact at a top-market standard.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.8)
    The stakes are conceptually huge (the survival of human wonder) and clearly signaled, and there is a modest escalation as Mara moves from preparation to crossing to confronting the resisting essence. However, the resistance is quickly soothed by her song and skill; there’s little sense of real jeopardy, sacrifice beyond a token blood-drop, or narrowing options. Her agency is present but never seriously tested—once she commits, nothing on the page threatens her goal in a way that would force a costly trade. The piece functions more as a successful ritual vignette than a pressured conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the fisherman can be released from the drowning silence of his kept secrets—is clear and emotionally legible. Pressure builds texturally as each knot yields another name and the fisherman’s form stabilizes, giving a sense of progress and cost. However, there is little sense that Maren might fail or that the method could backfire; no real turn complicates the process once the rules are stated. As a result, escalation feels steady and satisfying but not particularly tense or testing of her limits.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—what the vault is “saying” and whether it is curse or communication—is clear but remains cerebral. The major deepening is the impossible stone rotation and its alignment with the ruined henge, which productively narrows the interpretive options and forces Maren toward action. However, pressure never feels acute: there’s minimal sense of danger, social consequence, or inner rupture beyond curiosity and professional investment. The ending choice is meaningful but not sharply tested against a competing, costly alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    The core conflict—her drive to recover/understand versus the need to let some mysteries endure—is clear and tightens as she moves from collecting mode to reflective mode to renunciation. The key turn is the decision to return both her note and the globe to the ship, foreclosing a path of taking and cataloguing; the cost is conceptual and emotional rather than situational. Internal and external threads (ship’s fate, her sister, Amelia) are nicely braided. However, the pressure never quite spikes—there’s no moment where the temptation to keep the globe or the professional stakes vis-à-vis her work are truly tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—giving the ghost in code a way to be felt by others—is clear and emotionally legible, and there is a mild deepening as Moth turns her usual practice toward this new, stranger presence. However, there is essentially no resistance: no risk to her, no possibility of failure, and no serious complication of her mission. The tension remains low and linear, so the climax reads as a graceful completion of a task rather than a pressured choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Maren will accept a promotion that deepens emotional distance or adopt the captain’s more vulnerable, attentive mode—is clearly signaled and tightened by the approaching tenth floor. The decoding of the diary deepens the internal conflict by reframing service as potential joy, and the final refusal of the old trajectory carries a conceptual cost. That said, the pressure remains mostly interior and relatively low-intensity; no opposing force or real consequence presses back on her choice in the moment. The escalation is effective but gentle, more reflective than fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—Elena’s need to validate a taboo theory against institutional skepticism—is clear, and the broken tether provides an implicit situational pressure. However, conflict remains largely internal and contemplative, with no meaningful escalation beyond accumulating evidence; the “emergency” deflates into an untroubled opportunity. The ending crystallizes her stance but without a tangible sacrifice or sharply narrowed option set, so tension never fully tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central conflict—can she create a meaningful likeness when her method fails her—is clear and internal/existential rather than adversarial. Pressure does build as she recognizes that technical precision will not deliver “spirit,” and this forces her to choose an honest, partial solution instead of an illusory mastery. However, escalation is relatively gentle; the demolition deadline and commission expectations are more backdrop than active forces that narrow her tactics. The cost (acceptance of her limit, abandonment of a more ambitious goal) is real but could land harder with one sharper on-page test of her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Celeste pursues a potentially forbidden discovery and how openly she exercises her curiosity—is present early via Hendrik/Guild expectations and tightens with each discovery. Escalation is primarily epistemic: the hopscotch pattern’s meaning, Mara’s implied rebellion, and the realization of institutional danger; the concrete price on the page is limited to erasing the chalk and adopting stealth rather than a more acute loss. Pressure coheres but never becomes truly acute, as no active antagonist or direct confrontation appears. The ending choice does foreclose a path (open naivety) but at a low immediate cost.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—restoring the world’s celestial rhythm—is signaled early and tightened when Miren discovers stopped, rusted gears and, crucially, the missing third gear. Her decision to improvise with an imperfect Perseids gear provides a clear escalation and a risk-laden choice. However, the pressure of potential failure never quite bites; we don’t feel what it would mean for her or others if she misjudged, beyond an implied cosmic malfunction. Tension is present but relatively gentle, operating more as meditative problem-solving than high-stakes conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.8)
    The stakes—whether this refugee colony will fracture and die or relearn cooperation—are clearly stated early and track throughout. Mara’s strategy, and then Joren’s decision to “reexamine” their crisis response, function as the key escalations. However, most resistance is gestural (“Could be a trap”) and then evaporates; no concrete loss, sacrifice, or hard trade-off lands on the page. As a result the tension feels modest, more like a parable of re-connection than a pressured struggle with real risk.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—humanity’s proximity to extinction vs. her desire to protect and soothe—is clear and present from the opening and is carried through the adjustment. Pressure does deepen as she confronts the need to move the Clock three minutes closer to midnight while trying to embed “seeds of reversal,” intertwining external apocalypse stakes with internal ethical burden. However, escalation is relatively gentle and meditative; there is little sense of a live alternative or reversal, and her course of action never feels truly in doubt. The cost is felt emotionally rather than as a difficult choice between competing harms, which keeps the conflict strong but not peak-caliber.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—guiding travelers out before birds and frost kill them—is clear and present from early on. Pressure does escalate via dusk, descending birds, and creeping frost, and Maren’s new understanding of the orchard narrows her tactical options toward a dangerous path. However, there’s no genuine setback or moment where failure feels imminent; the birds never land a blow and the frost never blocks them. As a result, the conflict feels competently managed rather than harrowing or morally fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake is Maya’s relationship to her grief and her choice between continued isolation vs re-entering a web of connections; this is signaled early and tightened as she confronts the urn and memory of Leah’s path. The main escalation is internal: she moves from frozen inaction to a risky emotional choice (dividing the ashes, committing to call her parents and Leah’s friends). There’s a clear narrowing of options once she reframes divergence as necessary for connection. The conflict remains quiet and could bear one additional concrete external pressure or moment of resistance to fully maximize stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether this man can meaningfully re-begin his story—is clearly posed but only lightly pressured. There is essentially one move: he asks, Vera performs her ritual, and he accepts; there are no reversals, competing options, or true tests of resolve. Escalation arises more from deepening explanation than from rising cost or narrowed choices. As a result, while the story is coherent, the conflict never fully bites, so stakes remain more philosophical than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake (prevent a flood of ancient remorse from overwhelming all joy) is clear and raised convincingly with the “rotting” memories leaking into food and air. Pressure escalates from passive sensing (walls, bread) to an informed recognition of systemic failure, to the physical and psychic risk of removing his gloves and entering the pavilion. However, once in the pavilion, the sequence reads as a largely uninterrupted success montage of smoothing pillars; we are told it is grueling but see few moments where failure or catastrophic subsumption feels near. The resolution is earned but could carry sharper, more specific costs or tactical trade-offs to heighten tension.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the valley remains siloed or is coaxed into harmony—is clear and coherent with Mara’s goal. There is a meaningful tightening when she removes the cuckoo weight and installs it, committing to a course that could anger traditionalists and fail publicly. However, external opposition barely materializes: farmers’ suspicion dissolves almost instantly into group singing, so the story never quite forces a serious trade-off or loss. As a result, escalation feels gently cumulative rather than sharply pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Elena can access and honor abandoned dreams—is clear, but the conflict remains largely one-sided; the canyon and the technology never meaningfully resist her. Escalation comes via increasing intensity and variety of memories rather than reversals or narrowed options, which suits an accumulative piece but keeps tension at a contemplative rather than pressured level. Her choice to fully open herself as a bridge is framed as inevitable rather than wrestled with, so the felt price of that stance is underplayed. The result is thematically rich but dramatically low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—accessing and embodying hidden combinations of knowledge—is clear but mostly conceptual, with little sense of danger, opposition, or possible loss. Escalation occurs via the onset of inversion and Lyra’s movement deeper into the grotto as the numbers intensify around her. However, nothing meaningfully resists her; the path is difficult in texture, not in consequence, so her agency is never truly tested. The resolution is earned but feels low-cost and low-risk compared to the richness of the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—can she coax real music from damage and possibly awaken the world—is clear and threads the whole scene. Pressure escalates gently from preparation to full performance, culminating in the siskins’ arrival as a meaningful tightening of possibility. However, there is little sense of genuine risk or alternative paths foreclosed; failure or cost is implied (years of work, fatigue) rather than directly dramatized in a hard choice, so the conflict feels controlled rather than truly testing.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the covenant renews unchanged or can be challenged—is clearly articulated early, and the pressure of the approaching eclipse provides some situational tension. Kavir’s agency in choosing an unorthodox method (listening to silence) meaningfully deepens the conflict by reframing what “consent” means. However, escalation is mostly intellectual/emotional; there’s no substantial on-page resistance or reversal once his method starts working, and the council’s opposition is entirely prospective. The result is a thoughtful but relatively low-friction arc.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.6)
    The core stake—whether Marlow will violate Elena’s privacy to repair their ruptured connection—is clear and emotionally legible. Pressure deepens as she invokes more charged silences (childhood, arguments, their mother’s funeral) and the clasp begins to tremble, culminating in the choice to close the diary after it opens. However, escalation is relatively gentle; the outcome never truly feels in doubt, and the external task (getting the diary open) proves almost too easy. The story leans heavily on internal tension, which is effective but not maximally sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Mira’s desire to harness a dangerous flower to help a psychologically strained community—appears early and remains coherent. Escalation is mostly internal and sensory: the increasing stench, her coping attempts, and the surprising calming effect on her thoughts. However, the story largely avoids real reversals or hard trade-offs; her success is not seriously endangered, and the implied risk of social or personal ruin never materializes on the page. As a result, tension stays modest and the final grace note feels more contemplative than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Mara uncovering the orchards’ resilient mechanism—is clear and present early, and the countdown to Inversion plus the dangerous navigation through arches provide a framework for pressure. The encounter with the echoes and the sphere is a meaningful deepening of knowledge, but there’s little genuine opposition: no near-miss, ethical dilemma, or loss that forces a trade-off. Her unconventional method is never seriously challenged on the page, nor is there a moment when she might fail or pay a visible price. As a result, tension feels more like wonder-driven exploration than conflict-driven escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—understanding the anomaly in time to prevent future mass casualties—is clear and coherently pursued. Pressure does escalate as she moves from puzzling airflow to recognizing deliberate structure and then systemic, global vulnerability. However, the on-page conflict is almost entirely analytical; there’s little sense of temporal or personal risk, and no serious resistance beyond complexity itself. The result is intellectually compelling but emotionally low-simmer, with limited felt cost in her final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the bells (and thus communal wonder) will be silenced—is signaled early and paid off at the end with the Council’s vote. Pressure accumulates through the legend of the sculpted hush and the need to produce measurable proof, with a clear deepening when the hush manifests and Mira consciously uses her hammer on the ice column. However, antagonistic pressure remains mostly offstage and conceptual; Mira faces little palpable risk of failure or harm in the moment, so escalation feels contemplative rather than tense. The conflict works, but at a relatively serene register.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Maren will merely understand the relic or actually use it to leave her world—is evident and culminates in a meaningful choice. Pressure does deepen once the air folds and she glimpses other realities, reweighting the decision to step through. Still, conflict remains almost entirely internal and contemplative; there’s little resistance, risk, or complication beyond her prior failures, so the turn lacks sharp, on-page cost. Tension exists but never quite tightens into genuine duress.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central pressure—can she decode emotional mathematics in time to matter against a contracting universe—is compelling in concept but mostly operates at a conceptual rather than dramatic level. Escalation is present (the fragment warms, equations align, another star goes out) but remains relatively gentle, without a sharp on-page dilemma or foreclosed option. Her agency is primarily sustained attention and analysis rather than a pressured choice between competing costs. The piece reads more as a textured meditation than a scene under acute conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael remains a transactional courier or becomes an active extender of wonder—is legible, and each encounter nudges that internal conflict forward. However, external pressure is soft: there’s no real risk to breaking protocol, no opposition on the road, and no visible consequence for delay. The escalation is accumulative rather than sharply tightening, with each new resonance reinforcing the same direction rather than testing or reversing it. As a result, the ending is pleasing but not tense, and the sense of cost remains gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elena’s “pseudoscience” will gain institutional support—is established early and tightened when Hartley reveals clear, replicable-seeming evidence. Pressure escalates psychologically rather than situationally: Hartley’s grief and guilt versus his identity as a skeptic, and Elena’s need for validation versus her wariness of institutional judgment. The crucial turn is Hartley choosing to testify on her behalf, which reweights the committee meeting even though we don’t see it. Stakes and cost are more intellectual/emotional than visceral, leaving the escalation strong but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—save Kenji by taking his place—is clear and carries real emotional and existential cost. Pressure deepens as the weaving nears completion and the amber bead heats, but escalation is primarily conceptual and atmospheric rather than driven by new obstacles or reversals. Mariko’s choice at the end feels inevitable from early on, with limited on-page wavering or tactical adaptation. The sacrifice is strong; the path to it is steady more than tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—whether the planet will be abandoned or reconnected to its buried life—is clear and present early, and Mira’s plan is a direct response to it. Pressure escalates modestly as she seeks the magician’s help and undertakes the all-night forging, but overt resistance (from the council or the environment) stays mostly offstage or abstract. The main tightening is the barter of the silk’s memories and the all-or-nothing gamble that the conduits will work. The resolution is earned by Mira’s choices, yet the conflict feels relatively frictionless on the page, limiting intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming Mira versus preserving infinite timelines—is sharply articulated once Mira appears, and that ethical tension is potent. Escalation comes primarily through knowledge deepening (the revelation about the convergence and its consequences) rather than multiple reversals or new external obstacles. Kael’s agency at the end (choosing not to act yet) is clear and carries emotional cost, but the conflict remains mostly contemplative and talk-centered, with limited on-page testing of her resolve. A small, concrete failed attempt or near-miss choice could have intensified the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stakes—keeping Marcus alive, not letting the light/letter chain go dark, and Vera’s own silence—are clear and interwoven. There is a meaningful tightening when the lamp dies and Marcus’s plea about the letters reframes the situation from mere rescue to custodianship. Her choice to write and to promise the stones/letters provides an earned resolution that crystallizes her stance. Escalation is more emotional than tactical, however, and the Coast Guard rescue resolves the immediate danger a bit too easily to fully leverage the situational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—maintaining the boundary between “what was and what must be” by keeping the green light burning—is strong in concept but not strongly tested on the page. The storm nears and his laughter calls it, yet nothing seriously threatens his ability to complete the ritual; there’s no credible risk he’ll fail once he starts. Escalation is largely a matter of imagery intensifying rather than options narrowing or a painful trade-off being forced. As a result, tension is atmospheric rather than gripping, capping the conflict band.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—what to do with this unwanted, story-magnetizing heart—is clear, and the scene deepens that pressure when Chen implies Yuki’s “listening stayed with the heart.” The major turn is Mira’s shift from confusion and passive disturbance to an active request: “Can you teach me to understand it?” followed by her agreement to stay. Conflict remains primarily internal and intellectual; no strong countervailing pull (e.g., reasons to leave or fear of surrendering identity) is dramatized in the moment. As a result, escalation feels more like a gentle deepening than a sharpened test with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—safely deconstructing a maze whose trees are becoming quasi-conscious with absorbed sorrow—is clear but not felt as risky or difficult. Once the moonlight-heals mechanic appears, there are no reversals or complications; every extraction succeeds on the first try with negligible danger or emotional cost. The “before dawn” constraint doesn’t squeeze tactics or force trade-offs. Conflict operates more as gentle, contemplative pressure than sharpened stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes (rekindling a realm trapped in endless night) are enormous and clearly stated, but on-page opposition is minimal; nothing actively resists Elora beyond time, exhaustion, and the inherent difficulty of the rite. Escalation is primarily tonal and imagistic (song intensifies, light rises, more faces appear) rather than through narrowing options or palpable risk. Her exhaustion and the relinquishing of control at the end do provide some cost and tension, but the outcome never feels in serious doubt. As a result, conflict reads as beautiful ritual more than struggle, limiting pressure despite strong thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Iris learning how to be present without self-erasure, in the shadow of hurting her sister—is clear and emotionally legible. Pressure escalates modestly: from guilt and uncertainty outside the shop to the decision to enter, to the vulnerable confession and reframing inside the Library. The main limitation is that most hard choices (ghosting the wedding, years of hiding, decision to attend) are off-stage; the on-page conflict is largely interpretive and reassuring, with little real risk of rejection or failure in the present encounter. As a result, the turn is meaningful but low-tension rather than sharply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—how to respond to a city erasing itself—is clear and raised through dialogue: from grief and helplessness to the possibility of transformative action. Pressure escalates via the revelation of the archivist’s loss and the offer of seeds, which forces Mira to choose how she will relate to future vanishings. The cost (accepting she cannot stop the disappearances, only respond differently) is present but somewhat intellectualized. A slightly sharper moment of refusal or fear before she pockets the seeds would heighten felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake is Maren’s relationship to fading meaning—whether her work is mere documentation of loss or something more hopeful. Pressure builds quietly via contrast: stable but diminished vows, fractured patriotic promises, then the startlingly intact 528 hertz slide. The main tightening occurs when this discovery forces a choice between strict professional protocol and private, almost sacred guardianship, with a mild but legible cost. The conflict is intentionally low-drama, which keeps tension more contemplative than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central stake—Nelle’s safety and her father’s reputation versus Crenshaw’s exposure—is clearly set up and tightened through the reveal of the recording and the threat of copies. The moment when his people shift in the shadows provides a concrete escalation of danger. Her counter-threat credibly forces a negotiated truce rather than violence. The price of this détente is felt but somewhat abstract; a more concrete on-page consequence or loss would strengthen escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.4)
    The central stake—whether Mira can reframe weather-carriers (and Kael’s self-concept) from curse to planetary messaging—is clear but lightly pressured. Escalation is modest: Kael’s arrival, his skepticism about the ring, and her demonstration form one tightening, but there’s little real risk that the relationship will rupture or that her belief will cost her something tangible. The resolution arrives with minimal friction, reading more like mutual recognition than a hard-won choice. As a result, tension is present but not fully sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elena will remain imprisoned by perfect recall or transform it into art—appears early and tightens meaningfully with the discovery of the wild self-portrait. Conflict is primarily internal and accumulative; the strongest beat is her pivot from trembling hesitation to drawing directly on the walls. Escalation is present via the hours of obsessive work, bleeding fingers, and emotional flood, but there’s little sense of resistance or a real alternative path once she begins. As a result, the cost is felt but not sharply contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will accept the burden of engaging with others’ unsent truths in a dishonest world—is legible and tightens as she descends and then confronts the fact that the Archive preserves but doesn’t deliver. Her “But they're still unspoken” objection is a strong deepening beat that reframes the Archive from sanctuary to an incomplete solution. However, there is little opposing force beyond mild existential discomfort; no one resists her, and the choice to accept her role lacks an immediate visible cost or foreclosed alternative on the page. The tension is mostly conceptual rather than truly pressurized, which limits escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central pressure is artistic and existential: can Mira’s bells reach “symphonies of truth” in a post-verbal world, and what must she sacrifice to do so. Tension escalates primarily through deepening—first imperfect but human tones, then the full atmospheric symphony, then the pilgrims’ response forcing a reframing of her goal. However, options are never sharply constrained; there’s little sense that anything crucial might fail or be irrevocably lost beyond the slowly melting ice. The resolution is satisfying but low-friction, more contemplative than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—M4-RY’s need to quiet the debilitating internal static—emerges early and guides each step of the “controlled burn” plan. Pressure deepens when miniaturizing the fears doesn’t work, forcing the more painful internal confrontation with the hidden photograph. The primary cost is psychological and identity-based rather than survivalist, which fits the piece but keeps intensity at a contemplative rather than knife-edge level. Still, the escalation from managing external objects to confronting the core memory is clear and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.8)
    The stakes (eviction, loss of a rent-controlled community) are substantial and clearly articulated, and the discovery of the folder is a meaningful deepening of their leverage and options. However, on-page conflict is relatively soft: once the key exists, the mailbox opens without complication, the documents appear, and group consensus forms quickly. There is little reversal or hard trade-off in the scene itself, so pressure never quite tightens into a fraught decision. The ending crystallizes resolve rather than dramatizing a difficult choice under fire.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.5)
    The stakes are high—political prisoners’ lives and the evolution of a resistance cryptosystem—and they’re signaled early and developed. Yet the conflict remains largely abstract: there is no on-page obstacle, near-miss, or adaptation; Elara simply executes her work with calm competence. The “tightening” is conceptual (moving from preserving legacy to freeing specific prisoners) rather than a felt narrowing of options. As a result, tension is present but muted, and the piece reads more like a poised origin vignette than a fully escalated scene.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Maris can locate and reclaim the missing memories, and at what personal price—is legible early and coheres through to her final choice. Escalation is present but fairly smooth: from dangerous gravity on the docks to increasingly warped gravity in the tunnels to the existential decision to merge with the heart. The cost of success (her own erasure from the living world) is clear and thematically apt, but the moment of decision is enacted almost without resistance, limiting tension around that peak beat. External conflict with the city or diviners never materially impinges on her action, keeping the pressure mostly internal and conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—preventing the valley’s buried name from awakening and shattering her cultivated silence—is clear and thematically apt. There is one main tightening as she takes the wing to the brook and the prophecy “stirs,” but resistance remains abstract and never forces a change in tactic or a real risk of failure. Her success feels almost assured from the outset: she decodes, prepares, acts, and prevails without loss beyond implicit, ongoing isolation. Tension exists but stays muted, limiting escalation and felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elena will embrace her unsettling ability and its implied responsibility—is clear, and the scene does build from casual visit to a more fateful invitation. The main tightening comes when Mrs. Kovac dismantles the “Latin student” pretense and demands a more honest self-definition, which credibly shifts Elena from avoidance to acceptance. However, there is no strong reversal or visible price to her decision, and almost no sense of a real alternative path being foreclosed. As a result, tension is present but remains relatively gentle rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will expose her archival method to the world—is clear, and the piece builds to her decision with a quiet but steady tightening via the dawn deadline and the weight of her sister’s erasure. The internal and external conflicts interweave well: love, grief, control, and state power all converge on the question of publication. However, the pressure stays mostly contemplative; there’s little sense that acceptance is genuinely live beyond being mentioned as an option, so escalation feels more like deepening contemplation than a true narrowing of options. The cost is felt, but not maximally stressed.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.3)
    The central conflict—merciful forgery versus imperial law—emerges early and stays coherent, with the threat of execution and the Governor’s imminent audit sharpening stakes. Pressure escalates from private risk (Mei being caught) to systemic consequence (the Magistrate knowingly embracing ruin so the decrees stand). Mei’s agency is active: she continues writing under threat, calls out his staged mercy, and claims the key as authorization to keep working. The scene remains relatively quiet and talk-based; a touch more immediate jeopardy or a harsher test of their resolve in-scene would deepen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether and how people are remembered, especially the sister—is clearly signaled and tightened as Mara discovers the rule that echoes require being heard. Escalation comes from accumulated knowledge: the shell first offers eerie fragments, then a core principle, then the revelation that her sister acted with intention and left Mara a task. However, there’s relatively little on-page resistance or real dilemma once these facts are known; Mara’s transition to her new mission feels ethically and emotionally straightforward. The pressure is thus profound but soft-edged, more contemplative than sharply conflictual.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Katherine’s love and story can reach her daughter—is clear from “Tonight, she would expose the truth” onward. Pressure coheres and tightens as Katherine reacts to the revelation about Evelyn, culminating in Maya’s promise, which forecloses any option of detachment. Conflict is primarily situational and ethical rather than oppositional; there’s little resistance or doubt once the plan is stated, so escalation feels more like deepening than genuine testing. That keeps tension effective but relatively gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.4)
    The conflict is primarily internal and relational: Kenji’s anxiety about eroding tradition meets the apprentice’s shame over the ruined net. There is a clear tightening when her “mess” confronts his philosophy, forcing him to translate abstraction into a concrete lesson. However, the stakes never quite sharpen into a felt dilemma or loss; the outcome is gentle and assured from early on. The result is satisfying but low-tension, limiting escalation even for a quiet literary piece.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—exposing the scientific truth versus preserving the orchard’s sanctified aura—is legible, and there is a clear tightening from rumor to physical confrontation with the diamond. Vera’s choice to publish generally but conceal coordinates is a credible resolution of that conflict. Still, risk and cost remain largely conceptual: radiation danger and social backlash are gestured at rather than concretely tested on the page, and no option feels sharply painful in-scene. The escalation is present but relatively low in visceral tension.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—what allegiance Elara will choose—is signaled clearly and comes to a decisive head when the prophet addresses her directly. Pressure does escalate from passive listening to an explicit binary (“comfortable daylight” vs. “those who remember that dawn requires darkness first”), and she must respond in real time. However, there’s little concrete danger or competing good to make the choice feel costly; the “wrong” option’s consequences are abstract and the prophet feels enticing rather than threatening. The conflict is coherent and thematically apt, but not especially sharp or pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Cosima can make her salvaging of sounds matter to others and thus reclaim a sense of purpose—is legible and resolved. Pressure does increase somewhat as she works on the music box and then tests the jar-capture in front of the town, but obstacles are minimal and success comes without real resistance. The emotional cost is mostly in what she has already lost (home, status) and in giving the box away, rather than in on-page jeopardy or difficult trade-offs. As a result, escalation feels gentle rather than pressing, effective but not gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preventing catastrophic release of sonic absolution—is clear and weighty, and Meris’s decision to rekey the artifact narrows options in a lasting way. Internal and external pressures (the calling key, approaching boat, generational duty) align to force a stance. However, the conflict never fully “bites”: the antagonists remain offstage, and Meris encounters little resistance beyond urgency and the key’s resonance itself, so her competence goes largely unchallenged. The story would benefit from at least one concrete setback or sharper moral temptation to heighten cost.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—transforming the horizon-mapper role from rote precision to imaginative vigilance—is clear early and coherently pursued. Pressure deepens via duration and intent (choosing to wait, track for whole seasons, and face the council in spring) rather than through sharp on-page reversals. That quiet mode suits the piece but keeps escalation modest; no single moment forces a wrenching trade-off or hard loss in-scene. The price of her path (risk of rejection, isolation, or failure) is implied more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stakes—whether Elena will collude with or expose Reeves, and what justice Malcolm will get—are clear and escalate as she uncovers deeper layers of corruption. The key tightening comes when Malcolm’s documentation reframes Reeves’s influence from mere pressure to something akin to coercive rewriting of memory, tipping Elena toward open resistance. The final choice to leak evidence and demand a full investigation is credible, but the immediate cost remains mostly conceptual and implied rather than viscerally felt on the page. A sharper on-scene sense of danger (e.g., risk of surveillance, physical isolation) would push the pressure higher.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether a past failure of mercy can be partially atoned for and whether damaged things deserve effort—is clearly established. Pressure coherently deepens with the letter’s revelation, reweighting Eliana’s earlier decision and Marcus’s pastoral complicity. Escalation is primarily conceptual rather than situational; there are no reversals beyond the re-interpretation of the heart’s condition and Vittorio’s ethos. Because Eliana’s final choice comes without much overt resistance or an explicit trade-off on the page, the sense of price paid is more implied than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is discovery/connection with an impossible structure that responds to “the frequency of wanting,” with survival as a constant but backgrounded pressure. There is a clear escalation in the signal growing stronger and culminating in the unprecedented symmetrical pattern, which triggers her choice to leave. However, conflict remains mostly low-friction: there’s little resistance, doubt, or concrete trade-off dramatized in the moment of departure. As a result, the tension is more intellectual wonder than felt jeopardy, limiting escalation under a demanding standard.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stakes—uncovering the fate of the missing and choosing whether to follow—are legible and escalate as patterns (patches, coordinates, 1408) converge on the Perihelion revelation. The move into the “Memetic Hazard” folder is a good pressure point that narrows her options. However, the actual decision to abandon her life and join the uploaded consciousness meets only mild resistance; we don’t see a real contest between staying and going, which softens the felt price. Tension operates more conceptually than viscerally, keeping this just short of high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—Maren’s ability to resolve a feud without burning out—is clear, and the pressure of her standard methods failing justifies the attempt with the mirrors. The escalation is more epistemic than dramatic: conflict deepens as she uncovers Astrid and the true root of the feud, and her internal/external stakes braid reasonably well. However, there’s no real reversal or costed dilemma once the mirrors start working; they yield exactly what she needs, and she adopts the new purpose without visible sacrifice or risk. This keeps tension at a thoughtful simmer rather than a felt tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—how Vera lives with her altered perception and whether she seeks clinical intervention—is clear, and the supply run serves as the key tightening by confronting her with concrete, communal endings. Pressure builds in a restrained, accumulative way rather than through strong reversals; her choice to postpone consultation is meaningful but not sharply dramatized as a hard trade-off on the page. External conflict (ice damage, village abandonment) remains largely contextual and never presses her into a difficult immediate decision. As a result, the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt, keeping tension in the solid rather than exceptional range.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—the meaning and cost of their failed relationship—is clear, and the pressure coheres around whether this meeting will reopen wounds or reframe them. The main tightening comes when Marcus produces the burned letter and pushes his “failure as destiny” reading, forcing Elena to respond with her own remembered intent. Escalation is largely emotional and conceptual rather than plot-driven, which suits the piece but keeps tension at a low simmer instead of a sharp climb. Because their options don’t dramatically narrow beyond the choice to part with understanding, the conflict feels strong but not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.0)
    The core conflict—Senna versus the entropy of fading clearings and communal uncertainty—is coherent but gentle, with no active antagonist beyond time and inattention. Pressure does deepen from observation of potential pockets to the central ritual, and her act of consecration forecloses the path of passive decay. Still, the stakes are largely conceptual and the escalation is smooth rather than sharply tightening, with limited sense of what meaningful harm would occur if she failed beyond abstract loss. The cost is implied maintenance and responsibility more than a felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether this community can imagine life beyond the factory’s wound—is clear, but pressure remains low and largely uncontested. The main deepening comes when individual townspeople begin to draw specific futures (library, husband’s smile), which reweights the stakes from abstract healing to concrete possibility. There’s little real opposition or risk of failure on the page; Margot’s method works almost immediately and without friction. As a result, the arc is moving but not especially tense.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—what Elara will say to the Council about language’s fate—is clear, and there is a meaningful deepening when she uses the crystal to perceive the children’s speech as evolution rather than decay. Still, the conflict remains largely internal and cerebral, with little in the way of escalating external pressure, concrete consequences, or reversals. Her ultimate choice to testify with a transformational message is resonant but not heavily contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—salvaging something meaningful from inevitable forgetting—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure escalates through the tactile urgency of the chalk running out and his awareness that memories are actively slipping as he writes, which gives the middle a real tightening. However, the conflict stays primarily internal and contemplative; there is no sharp beat where he must choose between incompatible goods or visibly foreclose an option beyond accepting partial capture. The resolution feels earned for a lyric piece, but for a “flawless” standard, a slightly more acute moment of trade-off or moral/emotional cost on the page would deepen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake is Kenji’s response to a fundamental shift in celestial mechanics—cling to obsolete models or retool to track change—and that’s legible early via the misbehaving clock hand and tremors. Pressure escalates as the seismographs “go mad” and the moon’s glow intensifies, culminating in the choice to restructure instead of repair. The cost is largely conceptual/emotional (accepting an irreversible departure) rather than concretely jeopardizing lives or the observatory, which keeps the tension quieter. Still, the internal and external conflicts interweave effectively, and the resolution feels earned by his active decision.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.0)
    The core stake—whether father and daughter can reconcile before he dies—is clear and anchored by the 48-hour prognosis. Pressure escalates via the letter-writing decision and the uncertainty of Rebecca’s arrival, culminating in the tactile joining of vinyl fragments. The choice to focus on authenticity instead of a “perfect” apology provides a meaningful internal turn. Because the actual confrontation is skipped, the peak conflict feels slightly cushioned rather than rawly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—understanding and repairing the broken behavior of shadows/observatory—is clear, and pressure does increase as the orrery shudders, misfires, and then accelerates toward an unprecedented noon. However, resistance is mostly conceptual; there’s no serious opposing force, loss, or risk beyond “it might not work.” As a result, escalation reads more as puzzle-solving than as a test of commitment under threat, limiting the felt cost of success.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant conflict—Marianne’s need for certainty versus the demand to embrace a liminal, painful truth about her daughter—is clear and sharpens as she moves from recognizing the tooth to confronting the "possible-daughter." The beat where she resists the urge to grab Iris and instead asks "Why now?" marks a credible tightening, culminating in her decision to be taught, which forecloses the path of retreat into skepticism. External stakes (other lost children, failing substitutes) are stated but not deeply pressure-tested on the page, so urgency rests mostly on internal and conceptual stakes. The cost of her choice—living permanently in the cleft, taking on a burdensome, uncanny duty—is emotionally legible but could be made more viscerally concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Maren can live with her loss by transforming broken glass into safe, shareable “starlight” for children—is clear but remains largely internal and low-intensity. The piece accrues significance rather than escalating conflict: there is no real opposition to her practice, only the undertow of memory and the quiet test of whether she keeps showing up. The one notable deepening is the introduction of the children, which subtly raises the emotional stakes by showing her work received. Nonetheless, the story lacks a sharp tightening where an option is genuinely foreclosed or a painful trade-off is confronted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—Maya’s attempt to move from guilt and passivity toward a new, riskier form of meaning-making—is clear and present early. Pressure deepens with Chen’s arrival and the revelation in the notebook, which reweights Maya’s self-condemnation and offers a chance at a different relationship with Jenna’s memory. The emotional cost of public vilification is sketched rather than dramatized, so the on-page tension remains relatively gentle. There is one solid tightening, but escalation could be slightly more acute or fraught to reach a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—how to end the book without betraying its moral weight—is clear from early on and deepens as each apparition embodies a different “shape of hope.” Pressure escalates conceptually rather than via reversals; the sequence of visions tightens toward the realization about her protagonist’s commitment to memory. The final choice to embrace the “harder third thing” and accept the burden of remembering rather than merciful forgetting or vengeance is a meaningful narrowing of options with ethical cost. The conflict is intentionally quiet and internal, so while effective, it never feels acutely perilous in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Cassian can re-enact the forgotten remedy and prove the sacred practices’ power—is clear but only lightly pressured. Once the ritual begins, everything unfolds smoothly; there’s no meaningful resistance, risk of failure, or hard choice that narrows his options, so escalation feels more like a reveal than a test. Internal and external conflicts (villagers’ scorn, the weight of legacy, fear of failure) are mostly alluded to rather than dramatized in the present moment. As a result, the piece reads as a beautifully rendered success vignette rather than a true crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether and how the orchard’s fading life can be preserved—is clear and gently but consistently pressed. Escalation is more textural than confrontational: arranging the pattern, invoking the aurora, synchronizing heartbeats, then choosing to hide the maps for the orchard’s future self. There’s no sharp reversal or direct opposition, so tension is quiet and meditative rather than gripping, but the progression from attempt to achieved map to sacrificial concealment does narrow her options in a meaningful way. The cost is primarily one of acceptance and endurance rather than a dramatized trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake is existential/psychic—whether the group has access to stored wonder and historical continuity versus mere subsistence—and this is clearly signaled. Pressure escalates as Marcus moves from solitary obsession to unveiling the mechanism for the community, but external resistance (“they thought him mad”) and concrete risk never quite bite. The wounded season and resource scarcity function as backdrop rather than live antagonistic forces that test his commitment. As a result, the final act is moving but only gently contested.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how she can stop weaving and bear/transform others’ burdens—is signaled early and coheres through the piece. Pressure escalates via the increasing number and variety of burdens and the physicalization of sorrow into a mandala, culminating in her realization of role and departure. The cost is subtle but legible: she has lost seasons and leaves the crystallized burdens behind in a kind of self-sacrificial offering. Still, the conflict remains largely internal and contemplative, without a sharp on-page crisis where alternatives are dramatically weighed or risked.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake is internal but clear: how to relate to Roland’s unfinished intention and her own grief. Pressure deepens through the journal discovery and her choice among possible carvings, culminating in the deliberate embrace of a simple, imperfect bowl. Escalation is textural rather than dramatic, but the kettle’s growing sound and the increasingly specific carving choices create a discernible tightening. The on-page price is the acceptance of limitation and impermanence rather than clinging to a grander, more “fitting” memorial.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira remains a fragmented collector or reclaims an integrated self—is legible from early on and tightens as her ghost repeatedly appears and finally crosses the lagoon. Conflict is largely internal but escalates: from passive watching and collecting, to seeing her “before” self, to the explicit admission “I don’t know how to go back,” to the irreversible acceptance of “You were never meant to go back.” The hand-taking and dropping of the wheel foreclose the option of remaining in safe stasis. The stakes remain a bit abstract (identity and purpose more than any sharply framed external consequence), which slightly dampens visceral tension.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—demolition vs metamorphosis—is clear and Lena’s decision to draft and send a counterproposal is a genuine turn. However, escalation is mostly intellectual: recognizing water patterns, then spinning out possible uses, without an on-page confrontation, ticking clock, or material loss that tightens her options. The signed demolition contract is mentioned but never exerted as live pressure within the scene. As a result, the cost of her stance feels more implied than viscerally tested.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.6)
    The core conflict—fear of failing as an inventor versus the pain of never trying—is clearly articulated and returns in the key beats with her sketchbook and the crystals’ response. Pressure does tighten when she confronts the secret designs and voices her fear, leading to the new resolution about the resignation letter. However, opposition remains almost entirely internal and is resolved without real friction from countervailing desires once the sanctuary “answers” her. The piece could benefit from one sharper moment where continuing as a scribe feels genuinely tempting or safer to heighten the trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Mira’s quest to finally unlock Viktor’s secret—is clear, and the main tightening beat is the moment the water begins to glow and the diagrams emerge. After that, discovery escalates in scale (glowing water → inscriptions → 3D blueprints → realization about Viktor), but not in difficulty or cost; nothing meaningfully resists her once she commits. The “salvage” beat (documentation) is more procedural than pressured, and no real option is foreclosed on the page. As a result, tension is low-grade wonder rather than conflict-driven, which limits the stakes’ visceral impact.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—recovering and honoring encoded maritime knowledge—is clear but faces little opposition: Mira is never blocked, rushed, or forced to sacrifice something tangible to continue. Escalation is primarily informational: each knot yields deeper insight (fulgurite as marker, then the birch-bark plant map), which does tighten thematic weight but not practical stakes. Her main “choice” is to re-seal and archive rather than extract or commodify, an earned but low-pressure resolution. The piece succeeds as a quiet, accumulative vignette but lacks the felt cost or narrowing of options needed for stronger conflict scores.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether the Duchess will remain self-exiled or begin to risk genuine absence and eventual return—is clear and coherent. Pressure escalates primarily through conversational and emotional intimacy: Maren moves from observer to active challenger, culminating in the Duchess’s tears and acceptance of an “intermission” obituary. The turn is meaningful but gentle; there’s little resistance or secondary pressure testing this decision beyond internalized grief. The cost is more implied than dramatized in terms of future consequences, keeping the escalation solid but not fierce.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.6)
    The core stakes—whether they can and should resurrect a symbol of wild beauty using the machinery that destroyed it—are clear and thematically rich. Pressure escalates moderately via the palace’s shuddering, the drilling below, and Vashira’s warning about creating a half-machine phoenix, culminating in the egg’s cracking. However, there is little genuine jeopardy or forced trade-off on the page; once the experiment begins, events unfold without hard reversals or sacrifices. The conflict lands more as a successful proof-of-concept than a truly costly or narrowing crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Maya can help Elena reconfigure her relationship to her scars, and thereby affirm Maya’s own credo—is clear from early on. Pressure deepens when Elena confronts Maya about her father’s destruction and hesitates before entering the water, and the act of accepting the coin and the ritual is a genuine internal turn. However, escalation is gentle and largely one-directional; the outcome feels likely from the outset, and no option is dramatically foreclosed beyond emotional resistance. The cost is present but soft-focused: Maya prioritizing this private call over the crackling radio, and both women accepting the weight of their histories.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake is Mira’s confrontation with the possibility that memories and consciousness persist and can be freed, with the city’s reawakening as the external corollary. There is one clear tightening when she decides to engage the sealed box and figure out its sequence, and her internal skepticism vs wonder provides some friction. Yet resistance is minimal: the box opens after one methodical attempt, and there’s no real danger, loss, or moral conflict. As a result, the conflict feels contemplative more than pressurized, capping escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.8)
    The core stake (mother and daughter’s survival vs self-sacrifice) is clearly posed and immediately legible. There is one main tightening: the imminent sacrifice and failing life support that prompts the Keeper’s intervention. However, the resolution is essentially a benevolent deus ex machina—no real trade-off is demanded from the mother or the Keeper, and no option is painfully foreclosed. This softens escalation and keeps the conflict from feeling as sharp or costly as the setup promises.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—her need to understand why Marcus’s death won’t settle and how to hold collective grief—is clear from early on. Pressure escalates as Marcus reframes the family poem custom and challenges where she’s been “looking,” culminating in her choice to adopt a new, heavier lens for her work and add her own poem. The conflict is primarily internal and philosophical, with no sharp external reversal, but the realization does foreclose her previous, more limited approach to grief. A slightly stronger on-page moment of risk (e.g., fear of changing how she carves, or of failing the dead) would sharpen the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—whether Maren will continue to pay for her silence through perfectionism or risk exposing her truth—is legible and ethically charged. The main tightening comes when she shifts from private, hidden confessions on the rake handle to carving the communal instrument of time itself. Still, the opposition remains almost entirely internal and there’s little on-page sense of what she concretely risks from the town, which keeps the conflict from fully biting.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Marta can reinterpret her grandmother’s cryptic legacy and choose what to do with it—is clear and escalates from curiosity to obligation. The chess defeat reframes her approach (“shape of intentions”), leading to the key turn where the symbols become coordinates to lives misremembered. Conflict is primarily intellectual and ethical, with little external opposition or real risk, so tension remains low-grade rather than taut. The ending’s “the game was just beginning” suggests higher-stakes future action, but the on-page cost is more implied than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—can she write a future that resists humanity’s ignorance—is strong in concept but remains abstract on the page. The only real “opposition” is the predictive models flagging wishful thinking, and she adjusts smoothly; there’s no moment where she might fail, abandon, or meaningfully alter her goal under pressure. The writing sequence does escalate in scope (from one city to global Councils) but not in felt risk or narrowing of options. As a result, tension plateaus into thoughtful process rather than a tightening conflict with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—reviving stories after a narrative famine—is strong conceptually, and the pirate broadcast’s appearance does meaningfully shift options when the dust awakens. However, pressure is gentle: there’s no active opposing force on the page, no serious risk that her effort might fail, and no concrete consequence if she misinterprets the signal. The escalation is essentially a single upward revelation rather than a tested conflict, so tension is more wonder than strain. Her final choice to disseminate the method is thematically weighty but not sharply contested by competing costs or dangers.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.0)
    Pressure escalates texturally rather than through overt conflict: the stopped chair breaks the status quo, the mask and ash messages progressively strip away the illusion of safety, and Elena’s stance at the end forecloses her prior comfort. The dominant stake—whether to maintain faith in preservation/wholeness or confront fragmentariness—is clear and resolved. That said, there’s minimal on-page resistance or real alternative path considered, so the cost is more conceptual than dramatically felt.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Marcus will let empirical truth be co-opted by any narrative, or find a non-factional way to preserve it—is legible early and sharpened by Karin’s visit. Pressure coheres through their debate and culminates in his conditional agreement, a real narrowing of options. Still, the cost is more intellectual than visceral on the page; the rising water and social exile are gestured at rather than actively biting into his decision in-scene, which keeps the escalation from feeling fully acute.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether inherited hatred can be softened through shared listening—is clear, and the humming exercise provides a concrete test. There is a gentle escalation from discordant tones to emerging harmony, and the town’s tearing fabric gives that effort weight in concept. However, on the page the pressure rarely feels acute; opposition is largely summarized (“casual cruelties,” prejudiced families) rather than actively pushing back in-scene. As a result, the shift to tentative harmony reads more as a gracefully articulated idea than as the payoff to a truly tightened dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will use the forbidden seed to start a quiet movement of shared consciousness—is legible. There is some escalation from private experiment to communal, semi-clandestine sharing. Still, pressure remains largely notional: the government’s threat is invoked but never tests her on the page, and each step unfolds without genuine setback or trade-off. The line “The authorities eventually noticed, of course” concedes danger but sidesteps dramatizing any concrete cost.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether the truth about the blackout and the system’s philosophy will be faced and acted upon—is clear, and Chen’s confession provides a meaningful deepening turn. However, on-page pressure is relatively low; the conversation is calm and cooperative, with little resistance or dilemma for Mira beyond her stated obligation to report. The looming city-wide blackout functions as backdrop rather than an active, escalating constraint in the scene. As a result, conflict feels more contemplative than truly pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—Mara’s need to make sense of living vs hollow houses and what her perception is “for”—is clear but kept at a gentle simmer. Pressure does deepen when the hush falls and the house “exhales,” forcing a new stance on her ability, yet there’s little resistance or real risk to her tactics. The escalatory move is primarily conceptual rather than conflictual, which works for a lyric piece but limits felt stakes. A more concrete cost or tension (social, psychological, or supernatural) would strengthen the conflict band.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—what story of the drowned city Marina will bring back—is legible early and tightens as revelations complicate simple victimhood. Pressure escalates from curiosity to moral vertigo to commitment, with the oxygen limit and the ampoule’s evidentiary weight adding concrete urgency. Her final choice forecloses the path of a tidy, marketable tragedy narrative with implied professional and social risk. The conflict remains mostly internal and could use one additional beat of external friction or cost on the page to heighten the sense of jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will remain in safe stasis or re-enter dangerous discovery—is clear early and remains coherent. Pressure escalates first through the oppressive, beginningless staircase, then through Castellano’s accusations and the revelation about the chipped die, culminating in her literal and figurative leap. The final beat (choosing to send the email) is an earned narrowing of options with clear emotional and professional cost. The conflict remains primarily internal and could bear one more concrete sense of what she risks losing now, but for this length it still reads as sufficiently high-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—Mara proving that kindness and language memory persist—is clear and present early, and the pressure of insomnia plus cultural erasure coheres. Escalation appears as an intensifying cascade of visions and the completion of a phrase as the moon reaches its apex. However, opposition remains mostly environmental and internalized; there’s little on-page resistance to her project beyond fatigue and history, so the felt risk of failure is muted. The cost is present but quiet, which suits the piece but limits the sense of tightened no-return options.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes—cultural extinction and literal entrapment—are strong and clearly stated. The key pressure turn is Celeste seeing the fractures through the lens and converting private insight into collective action at the wall. However, opposition is largely environmental and mostly summarized; there are no on-page setbacks or painful trade-offs in the thaw effort itself. As a result, tension is steady rather than sharply escalating, even though the underlying costs are substantial.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Maren can meaningfully break fate’s forward momentum—is clear and escalates from theory (backward clocks, reverse-engineering) to irreversible action (stepping into the radiance). Pressure tightens through the time constraint of the low tide and the hunger stone’s emergence, and then through the increasingly destabilized reality as the yoyo spins. Her final decision to step forward, risking madness or annihilation for possibility, is a credible culmination of that pressure. The external stakes (famine, drought) remain more conceptual than viscerally dramatized, slightly softening the felt cost at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Margot will remain consumed by amorphous fear or reconfigure her relationship to it—is clear early. Pressure escalates coherently as she moves from generalized dread to the risky act of “unbosoming” herself, culminating in fear’s embodiment and capture. The internal conflict between desire for relief and terror of scrutiny is credible, though it could be dramatized with a bit more resistance or near-failure before fear is revealed small. The resolution borders on too clean; the ongoing cost of living with a trapped fear and a weaponized curse is mostly conceptual rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the orchard survives the forming vortex—is specified early and tightened effectively through the fractal clouds and “perhaps an hour” clock. Maren’s decision to trust the leeward tide against sailing instinct is a clear, agency-driven turn that forecloses the safer, conventional path. However, escalation is relatively linear; once she reads the resonance, there are no serious complications or reversals testing that choice. The price of being wrong is enormous, but on-page tension softens once the plan is set in motion.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—city survival vs deadly stasis—is established early via the rusted gate and the widening crack. Pressure coherently deepens as the crack approaches the heart, Maren’s measurements confirm danger, and the turtle finally moves in response to the whistle. The protagonist’s agency comes through her choice to blow the whistle, reinterpret the watchers, and resolve to challenge the Council. The primary limitation is that antagonistic pressure (Council/citizen complacency) is conceptual and offstage, so we don’t see that conflict sharpen or exact an immediate price in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to expose a destabilizing historical truth—is established early and pursued directly through the dialogue with Hawthorne. Pressure escalates modestly as his objections invoke societal collapse and her counterarguments invoke other nations’ reckonings, culminating in his surrender of the letter. The conflict remains largely intellectual and never quite bites down into a hard trade-off or visible sacrifice on the page; Hawthorne yields relatively quickly once persuaded. The result is solid, coherent tension, but not as sharp or costly as it could be for elite-level stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stakes are primarily internal and conceptual—memory versus erasure, witnessing versus exposure—and they are clearly signaled and sustained. Pressure tightens meaningfully when the routine crack-repair yields the box of letters, which forces a choice about whether to disturb or protect someone else’s absence. His decision to reseal the box and add his own note carries a felt, if quiet, cost: he accepts the burden of knowledge without the relief of disclosure. The overall tension is gentle rather than gripping, which caps escalation somewhat.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake is intellectual and ethical—uncovering suppressed histories and renewing her sense of purpose. Pressure escalates through accumulating evidence rather than antagonistic force, which suits the mode but keeps tension low. The blackout and physical peril of the damaged floor suggest risk but never quite bite into the stakes. The final choice to embrace this as her “real work” is clear but carries limited felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.4)
    The core stake—whether Mei can meaningfully preserve or reconfigure what remains of Lin—is clear and emotionally weighty, and her project of a thousand cranes is a strong frame. Pressure, however, is relatively static: there’s no fresh complication after the premise is laid out, nor a concrete test of whether the Archive or her ritual is failing or succeeding. The counting down of cranes and the brief comparison to “other people's preserved dreams” provide some tightening, but the story does not substantially narrow her options or escalate risk. The ending works as a deepening, not a sharpened crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—Mira’s need to understand and locate “unused potential” to metabolize her loss—is clear, but pressure remains mostly internal and static. The anomaly detection and course correction constitute a mild escalation, yet they don’t force a new trade-off or foreclose an option; they confirm her existing path rather than testing it. There is little resistance, ethical friction, or risk beyond the implied psychic cost of her obsession. As a result, tension is more contemplative than felt as conflict, which limits the category.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Mara finding the scattered “frequency of belonging” chips and thus a place in the world—is strongly signaled but remains largely conceptual on the page. Pressure escalates once: when the chip activates and the seventeen star trails appear, expanding the scope and tying her personal longing to a global quest. However, there is no resisting force, trade-off, or visible cost around her decision to accept; the situation is all invitation, no genuine risk calculus. As a result, tension is more anticipatory and mythic than truly tested.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will continue living under and perpetuating her lies—is clear early and coherently escalated by Elias’s arrival and accusation. The ethical conflict between Mara’s past pragmatism and present need for accountability is strong, and Elias’s demand (“end it”) provides a concrete external pressure. However, the confrontation resolves with relatively little on-page resistance or ambivalence in the peak beat, softening the sense of a hard-fought trade-off. The emotional cost is present but could be sharpened by more visible struggle in her agreeing and deciding her next steps.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—completing a simultaneous exchange without triggering violence—is clear, and the commanders’ distrust plus the ticking moon clock create baseline tension. However, escalation is mild: once Katrin states the rules, there is little real testing of them, and no concrete complication (misstep, flinch, or weapon-raise) forces adaptation. The answer to “what if they run?” is posed but never comes close to being dramatized. As a result, the final simultaneous walk feels more like fulfillment of plan than a hard-won, costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stakes—whether Marina will risk guiding again and what that means for her identity—are clear and escalated from internal refusal to committed action. The key tightening is her surprise decision to accept Amy’s request and then to actually launch, closing off the path of continued avoidance. However, once they’re on the water, the external risk remains fairly soft; the mentioned afternoon weather never becomes active pressure, so the crossing feels emotionally high-stakes but physically relatively untested. A brief on-page complication at sea could have sharpened cost and escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—who Marcus chooses to be now that his memories are gone—is clearly signaled, but the on-page opposition is mild. The Interpreter does not really resist him; instead she reorients him, so his final choice faces limited immediate friction beyond internal unease. The J. Martinez backstory raises stakes conceptually (even time travel and a broken future could not fix empathy), yet Marcus is not forced into a hard trade-off or visible sacrifice in scene. Escalation is more intellectual than visceral, leaving pressure solid but not gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central stake—Mira trading her humanity to reach Tam—is explicit early and sharpened by his warning, and the piece escalates smoothly from contemplation to irrevocable transformation. Her agency drives the key turn as she chooses to crush the spices despite the cost. However, conflict is relatively one-directional: once she commits, the magic works without complication or meaningful resistance, and Tam’s objections fold quickly. A sharper moment where she almost pulls back, or where the magic exacts an immediate visible toll, would deepen the sense of price.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether she will keep sacrificing relationships to her vocation or reorient toward her daughter—is clear from early on and tightens through the card sequence, especially the third card with the weeping saucer. Her agency at the peak (choosing descent, tracing her hand repeatedly) is decisive and forecloses a deeply ingrained path. The only limitation is that the escalation is very smooth and inward; a slightly more fraught or contingent decision could have sharpened the sense of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to open the locked dimension of collective grief before extinction—appears clearly and is tested when Akio confronts Mei. Escalation occurs when she powers up the resonance chamber and the ship’s lights dim, leading to the dimension’s partial opening as a charged, irreversible step. However, opposition is relatively soft and quickly resolved, and there’s little sense that Mei might actually choose not to proceed or that the opening could concretely harm them on the page. The tension is more contemplative than pressured, which limits the sense of paid price.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake is Mara’s need to reframe who she is after losing her fortune and old identity; secondary stakes (volcano monitoring, lives at risk) pass through her briefly. Pressure escalates gently: from solitary uncertainty to a small but consequential intervention (directing the surveyor) to the irrevocable act of opening all jars. The main cost is symbolic—releasing her last possessions and committing to a role defined by intangible influence—which is clear but emotionally low-key. The conflict remains largely internal and contemplative, so tension is steady rather than tightening sharply.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—using the blackout to initiate a silent revolution—is clear early, and the pressure modestly tightens when we learn Voss is involved and the blackout is deliberate and time-limited (“three hours”). Conflict is largely one-sided: there’s no active opposing force in the scene, only the abstract threat of the old regime and the ticking blackout. Maren’s agency is real but mostly procedural, with little sense of risk that her plan could fail or be discovered in this moment. As a result, tension feels controlled and interesting but never truly sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—decode the pattern now or lose the eels/the last logic of the old world—is established and the pressure does increase as she nears the seventeenth stone. Escalation is primarily accumulative (more alignment, more resonance, brighter aurora) rather than confrontational, and there’s no real resistance or alternate tactic on the page. Her visions remove uncertainty instead of complicating it, which dampens potential reversals. The cost is conceptual (accepting irreversible change) more than dramatized as a painful trade-off in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether she will continue risking herself to bear witness versus yielding to silencing—is clear and present from the incident recap onward. Pressure accumulates via her ritual discipline, the three-month mark, and the decision to keep producing and smuggling poems, with the timer and storm acting as subtle externalizers of that inner conflict. However, escalation is relatively gentle; there is no on-page new threat or irreversible move that tightens options beyond reaffirming her existing path. The cost is implied (state danger, isolation) rather than freshly dramatized in this scene.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story sets up a strong initial conflict—reputational insult leading to a literal duel—but quickly pivots to collaborative puzzle-solving, which is engaging yet comparatively low-risk. The dominant stake becomes whether intellectual rigor and curiosity can override the drive to violence, and that does resolve in Adelaine’s favor with some cost to Harwick’s pride and to the imagined honor of a duel. Escalation is more a deepening of shared interest than a tightening of danger; no option feels truly foreclosed beyond “we won’t fight today.” This keeps the conflict compelling but prevents it from feeling urgent or costly enough for a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure is primarily conceptual and emotional: Mara’s unstable identity and their shared urge to resist erasure via beauty. The main tightening is the shift from “we could plant them here” to “everywhere they tried to kill beauty,” which scales up their quiet act into an intentional campaign. However, on-page cost and risk remain abstract—there’s little sense of concrete danger, scarcity, or irreconcilable choice in the moment. The result is strong, but more deepening of stakes or visible trade-off would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—whether she can bend time to undo or reconfigure a twenty-year-old departure—is established and her desperation to try something new gives the scene forward pressure. There is a clear escalation from background routine (playing for travelers) to a risky, deliberate temporal intervention using film and music. However, the conflict feels largely one-sided: there’s little real resistance beyond ambient uncertainty, and the eventual success isn’t meaningfully contested or paid for in-scene. As a result, the tension is more atmospheric than gripping, despite a solid structural turn.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central conflict—whether to risk the seed to possibly reclaim collective memory versus safeguarding it in stasis—is clearly framed and morally textured. Stakes (cultural survival vs protection from false hope) are strong, and the monsoon clock provides external pressure. Escalation is relatively gentle and introspective, with Prem’s intervention as the main tightening beat before the decision. The price of the choice is present but could be rendered more viscerally to push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake is Mira’s need to reframe inherited silence and familial rupture, and that’s signaled early via “after the severance.” Pressure escalates primarily through deepening: the revelation of the lace as instruction, the realization of her grandmother as sailor on The Persephone, and the reframing of the compass’s function. However, the piece lacks a strong sense of risk or an opposing force; there is little that resists Mira’s learning besides her initial ignorance. As a result, the emotional turn is satisfying but relatively low-intensity for an elite market.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.8)
    The stakes are effectively internalized; the pressure comes from the need to find meaning in destruction. While external conflict is minimal, the intellectual and emotional escalation—deepening from scavenging to scientific analysis to philosophical reconfiguration—is coherent. The cost is the surrender of her desire for "stripped drama," replaced by a heavier understanding of decay.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.1)
    Stakes escalate logically from reputation to survival to stopping violence, but the tension evaporates instantly at the resolution due to the missing beat. The cost—legal trouble and loss of fuel—is summarized in the aftermath rather than felt as an immediate price of the confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=4.0)
    There is virtually no active conflict or escalation in the present timeline; the protagonist faces no opposition, risks, or defining trade-offs while creating the installation. The story describes a successful project rather than a crisis; the "stakes" are retrospective (healing from past trauma) and resolved without a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes are theoretical rather than felt; Marcel faces no genuine opposition from the ocean, the captain, or the ghosts. The protagonist succeeds with "practiced efficiency" and magical ease (breathing underwater), removing physical peril and rendering the escalation flat.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.9)
    Escalation is dampened by the lack of resistance; the community accepts the dangerous revelation immediately ("Teach us"), dissolving the tension without visible cost. The antagonist (sanctions) remains abstract and distant.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.0)
    Pressure is low; the protagonist encounters no significant resistance or dilemma, and the resolution is granted by an external guide rather than earned through difficult choices or endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.9)
    The central stake—stability vs. understanding—is resolved with a tangible cost: the destruction of the photographs. The escalation is coherent, though the moment of decision happens quickly; the trade-off is felt and changes her tactical relationship to time.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.2)
    Tension is dampened by the plan's smooth execution; the guards are a theoretical threat that never materializes to force a difficult improvisation or sacrifice. The protagonist faces no active opposition on the page, making the liberation feel inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.1)
    The stakes are clearly defined and escalate from passive recording to active, destructive creation. The climax forces a trade-off between the comfort of a solution and the painful truth of acceptance. The cost is unmistakable on the page—the destruction of her life's work—satisfying the requirement for visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are present but lack immediate pressure; the conflict is resolved almost instantly as Celeste affirms Maya's discovery without resistance. The cost of giving up the moonbeams and her identity as a thief is accepted too easily, making the "Reconfiguration" feel low-risk. The antagonist functions as a guide rather than an obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.1)
    One dominant stake (reconciliation) is established, but the pressure remains low and entirely internal. The "escalation" is symbolic (ice cracking) rather than active, and the lack of external opposition or immediate consequence reduces the narrative tension. The protagonist creates his own solution without facing a hard, on-page test of his resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stakes are clear, but the "consortium" remains a vague, abstract threat that never applies direct pressure in the scene. The resolution—calling the authorities—feels bureaucratic and low-cost given the established danger of the enemy.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes are clear (survival in an endless night) and escalate cleanly with the fading star. The conflict is relatively low-friction—a transactional request met with a philosophical answer—which fits the fable genre but limits the sense of urgent, interpersonal pressure or costly trade-offs on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.4)
    Tension is low; the protagonist is explicitly described as "remarkably composed," which dampens the stakes of potential decommission. The conflict remains intellectual and resolves through acceptance without a visceral or costly trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are clear (romantic connection vs. isolation) and pressure is applied via the overheard confession. The escalation is linear and relatively low-risk until the final action. The cost is emotional vulnerability, which is felt, though the resolution comes somewhat easily once the secret is known.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.8)
    The conflict between institutional quantification and personal cultivation is sharp and sustained. The dresser's victory carries weight because the cost—years of gaslighting—is made legible through the cracked marbles. The escalation from social anxiety to existential proof is handled well.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are low and resistance is minimal. Venn's skepticism crumbles instantly upon seeing the proof, removing potential interpersonal conflict. There is no point where Kael's goal is genuinely at risk, resulting in a flat pressure curve.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are low and historical; there is no immediate antagonist, time pressure, or physical danger to force a difficult choice. The narrative lacks escalation, proceeding linearly from observation to revelation without setback or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.9)
    Conflict is minimal in the present moment; Chen offers no opposition, the code compiles instantly, and the "oracle" accepts the patch without resistance. The stakes are theoretical (future safety) rather than immediate, leading to a low-pressure scene that feels more like a reflection than a struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain abstract and historical; Marcus faces no immediate threat, obstruction, or difficult trade-off. The "ghost shift" serves as atmospheric set-dressing rather than an antagonistic force, resulting in low tension.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.4)
    Conflict is largely philosophical and resolved in backstory ("She no longer sought to judge"), leaving the on-page action without urgent opposition. The "pressure" of the silence is atmospheric rather than an obstacle that forces a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.4)
    Conflict is low-voltage; the obstacle of selective mutism dissolves without significant struggle or complication, rendering the stakes theoretical rather than visceral. The protagonist’s agency is limited to "holding space," which results in a lack of narrative propulsion or meaningful escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=3.9)
    The story lacks tension or opposition; Miren's task is routine, and the discovery offers immediate gratification without risk. There is no meaningful tightening of options, trade-off, or escalation of stakes; the narrative moves in a straight line to satisfaction.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.7)
    While global stakes are high (governments killing, lives saved), they remain abstract and stated rather than felt in the lamp room. The scene lacks immediate pressure; Maya faces no active resistance, time crunch, or resource scarcity that forces a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the declared stakes (a soul) are high, the on-page conflict is one-sided; the entity is passive, waiting to be dismantled by Calloway's logic. The lack of active counter-pressure or setbacks for the protagonist flattens the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.5)
    The conflict is primarily internal (burnout vs. meaning) and lacks significant external pressure or opposition. The "exhaustion" acts as a soft clock but doesn't force a painful trade-off on the page; she simply writes until she stops. The stakes remain somewhat low, as the consequence of failure is merely continued malaise.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (wholeness vs. fragmentation) is clear, and the cost is paid on the page. However, the escalation is dampened because the protagonist's struggle is narrated as a montage of past fixes rather than a singular, resistant test in the present.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story lacks meaningful escalation or cost; the protagonist finds a solution that works immediately on the first try for both himself and his student. Without the risk of failure or a trade-off, the victory feels hollow.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are high on a global scale (expanding zones) but low on a personal level; Marianne’s safety is hinted at but never genuinely threatened on the page. The conflict is primarily intellectual—understanding the pattern—rather than interpersonal or dangerous. The resolution comes too easily, with the protagonist gaining resources (the satchel) without paying a visible price or making a hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.7)
    The stakes are intimate and effectively pressurized by the presence of the doctor and the unique, fleeting opportunity. While the external conflict is subtle, the internal escalation—overcoming the fear of losing the memory to finally accessing it—is palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is minimal; Marcus faces no external opposition or internal barrier to his goal. The story functions as a meditation without stakes-raising escalation, resulting in a lack of palpable tension or felt cost at the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—overcoming the spiritual deadening of the "chronic hush"—is clear and maintained throughout. While the external pressure of the fires is felt, the conflict remains largely atmospheric; the victory is won through artistic persistence rather than a high-stakes trade-off or costly sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.9)
    The stakes are effectively internalized, centering on the integrity of an emotional transaction. The escalation from routine detachment to a moment of artistic and ethical crisis is handled with precision. The resolution offers a meaningful tightening of Mara's worldview, prioritizing the "wish" over the "product."

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story lacks an opposing force or genuine obstacle; Marianne and Chen align immediately, and the "silent contributors" accept recognition with uniform gratitude. Without resistance or the risk of failure, the "tightening" is nonexistent, resulting in a "yes, and" progression that deprives the narrative of necessary dramatic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes remain low throughout; the central conflict is internal shyness, which is resolved through a highly successful, unresisted external project. The "mystery" provides artificial momentum, but because the protagonist controls the outcome, there is no genuine opposition or risk of failure on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no active antagonist or difficult trade-off, and the environmental pressure (the giant waking) remains a background detail rather than a tightening constraint. The resolution comes without a visible price, as the narrative smooths over the consequences of the magic use.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.8)
    The internal conflict is resolved through a clear moment of renunciation—choosing not to call out to the figure—which earns the shift in stance. The stakes are personal, though the climax remains quiet and internal without a sharp external snag to test the choice further.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.2)
    Conflict is low-pressure; the protagonist faces minimal opposition and achieves her goal without paying a visible on-page cost or making a difficult trade-off. The resolution relies on witnessing external validation rather than navigating a crisis that jeopardizes her safety or status.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.7)
    While the stakes are clear, the escalation is almost entirely internal and retrospective. The protagonist is confirming a lesson she has already learned rather than facing a live test of her values in the scene. The approaching storm offers potential pressure, but her reaction is one of passive acceptance rather than a struggle that forces a new cost.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes are established early as a struggle for coherence against chaos. While the deepening—moving from skepticism to active participation in the island's ritual—is sound, the external pressure is mild, and the obstacle is overcome with relative ease (a walk in the dark), limiting the tension peak.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.2)
    The conflict is clear and stakes are high (the nature of destiny vs. mystery). The escalation works well, though the antagonist's dialogue ("You inhabit this space...") leans slightly into expository lecture to force the realization.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.8)
    The stakes are emotional and declared (the weight of 17 years), but the on-page conflict is minimal. The protagonist faces no meaningful opposition or difficult trade-offs; the reunion and the handover of the object proceed smoothly without testing her resolve or "reactive" ability.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake (mapping the unknown) is clear, but the escalation is soft; the conductor acts more as a greeter than an obstacle, yielding immediately to a verbal confirmation. The conflict lacks a moment of genuine jeopardy or a trade-off that forces a difficult tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.5)
    Pressure accumulates effectively through sensory intensity and the disorientation of the "entangled memories." While the stakes successfully shift from personal clarity to stewardship, the internal conflict (skepticism) dissolves somewhat too easily under the magical influence.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.3)
    Conflict generates genuine pressure, forcing a permanent separation with visible emotional cost. The stakes are raised effectively by the time constraint of the solar storm, leading to an earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clear and escalate from a financial scam to a battle for a father’s soul and freedom. The cost of the resolution—Vincent trading his autonomy for safety from the police—is legible and heavy, creating a genuine dilemma that resolves through Mara’s agency.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are primarily abstract and philosophical, which fits the piece but limits visceral tension. The pressure escalates effectively through the environmental anomalies, leading to a clear decision point at the center where the protagonist must define her role against the absolute truth of the oak.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.8)
    The stakes of erasure versus existence are palpable and escalate naturally through the discovery of the artifacts. The cost is well-defined: she trades her archive (her private reconstruction of the world) for the chance to reclaim her official life. The thematic tightening around the "poison for the roses" adds conceptual pressure to the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.2)
    The conflict is primarily intellectual—logic vs. feeling—and the stakes remain abstract/philosophical rather than viscerally felt. The escalation consists of a debate with a voice that confirms the protagonist is wrong, leading to a surrender of stance that feels inevitable rather than hard-won; the cost is a "smile through tears" rather than a tangible sacrifice of her professional identity.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the stakes (cultural survival) are clear, the central conflict is resolved through summary narration ("the community began to shift") rather than on-page struggle. The lack of a dramatized confrontation or a moment where the plan nearly fails makes the victory feel inevitable and low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.1)
    The stakes are palpable and escalate naturally as the countdown progresses. The conflict between preservation and inevitable destruction is handled well, with the chemical timing system adding a layer of tactical urgency. The cost—the loss of the mountain—is felt, satisfying the requirement for closure with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are nominal; while the "maiden voyage" introduces a clock, the pressure is easily defused by Mara's immediate competence. There is no moment where the protagonist must trade one value for another, and no visible price is paid for the success. The conflict is purely technical and external, lacking the frictional escalation needed to drive a compelling narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is minimal; Petrov acts as an enabler rather than an obstacle, and the environment presents no immediate on-page threat. The stakes are high in concept (redrawing maps) but low in dramatic execution.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=4.7)
    Escalation is cumulative rather than conflict-driven; resistance is summarized ("thought her mad") then immediately discarded for cooperation. The resolution feels inevitable and frictionless, lacking the visible cost required for high-stakes engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.6)
    The oxygen clock provides a tangible, high-stakes constraint that forces the climax. While the external pressure is strong, the interpersonal conflict is resolved somewhat easily—Chen is too weak to offer meaningful resistance, reducing the climax to a unilateral decision by Mara.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are clearly established early (reputation/truth) and escalated by the physical threat of the searchers ("boots on stairs"). The cost of the final choice—leaving the known world—is palpable and balanced against the cost of returning to a life of disbelief. The external clock (finding the bodies) successfully tightens the decision window.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the protagonist and the ghost share the same goal immediately, and no antagonist or obstacle opposes the resolution. The stakes remain abstract ("a debt") rather than visceral, and the lack of resistance makes the ending feel inevitable and flat.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes remain abstract and pressure is low; the weaver faces no active opposition, resource scarcity, or risk of failure. The arrival of travelers validates her efforts immediately rather than complicating them, resulting in a linear progression of success without a "pinch point" or difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is minimal; external obstacles are cleared via summary ("spent weeks clearing"), and the villagers offer help without friction. The lack of an antagonist, time pressure, or a difficult trade-off results in a low-stakes progression where success feels guaranteed.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.5)
    The tension between the professional need for secrecy (checking codes) and the personal need for connection drives the scene effectively. While the external threat of surveillance remains static, the internal pressure is coherent and escalates through the ritual of verification.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.4)
    Tension escalates naturally from the initial observation of the flame to the physical arrival of the trucks and the approaching footsteps. The stakes are clearly defined: the loss of historical truth and scientific autonomy. The pressure forces a decisive action (finishing the chart and moving to the library) that feels earned and carries palpable risk.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.9)
    While there is a clear emotional progression, the story lacks acute pressure or resistance; the client seeks help and receives it without complication or cost. The conflict is retrospective (past grief) rather than active in the scene, and the resolution feels inevitable once the ritual begins. The "tightening" is atmospheric rather than a narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure is coherent: the fading consciousness competes with the intellectual urgency of the code, creating a clear escalation. The stake—truth versus convenient peace—sharpens through the decoding process, culminating in a choice that rejects the safe narrative for a costly reality.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes are established early (internal hollowness vs. upcoming commission), but the escalation is low-pressure, relying on reflection rather than external obstacles. The resolution is earned through insight, fitting the Accumulative/Textural lens, but lacks high tension.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.7)
    The tension between preservation (methodical documentation) and discovery (destruction) provides a clear internal stake. While the external pressure (authorities) is abstract, the immediate sensory pressure of the garden and the mystery successfully escalates the choice to damage the wall.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes—cognitive privacy versus state surveillance—are clear and immediate, driving the characters' actions. The escalation from the "sanctuary compromised" signal to the final convergence provides a coherent pressure gradient. While the antagonist is abstract (off-page auditors), the threat feels sufficiently heavy to justify the radical transformation at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is largely abstract and atmospheric (longing vs. peace) rather than urgent or scene-specific. While the "off-key wind" offers a mild immediate antagonist, there is no escalation of pressure that forces the protagonist to alter her tactics or make a trade-off. The stakes remain intellectual, resulting in a low-tension meditation.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.9)
    The conflict is quiet but potent, pitting institutional efficiency against personal memory. The escalation is internal—from noticing the fracture to recognizing the mother's song to the decision to preserve it—and the cost is felt: a deliberate choice to embrace brokenness in a world of standardized perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stakes are personal and immediate, escalated by the ticking clock of Marcus's departure. While the external stakes (Dr. Chen's fraud) are backstory, the immediate relational pressure is sufficient. The cost is palpable in Mira's confession of cowardice, though the resolution comes perhaps a beat too smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are clearly defined as a conflict between preservation and safety. The resolution avoids a simple binary by utilizing the protagonist's specific skills, and the "unsealed letter" adds a necessary layer of social risk and cost to what might otherwise be a purely technical fix.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure is coherent and internal, tightening as the "instinct to flee" blooms against the task of cataloging. The stakes are clear—stability versus safety—though the external pressure from Marcus is subtle. The escalation is quiet but firm, leading to a decisive stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes remain largely intellectual; the interaction with Thomas is gentle and supportive, lacking the friction or risk required to make the final epiphany feel earned by cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.1)
    The "until sunrise" deadline creates effective tangible pressure that forces the characters to act. The escalation from passive observation to active participation is clear and raises the stakes appropriately for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes remain largely abstract and intellectual; Marina risks only ignorance, not personal loss. The "returning tide" provides external pressure but does not force a difficult trade-off or moral calculus. The conflict is man-vs-nature/mystery, lacking the interpersonal or internal friction that drives higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.3)
    The stakes are primarily internal (isolation vs. connection) but are externalized well through the chess game. The reversal—Mara profiling her opponent only to lose the game—is a sharp, effective beat that dismantles her defense mechanisms. The cost is felt in the loss of her orchestrated control.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.4)
    Pressure fails to escalate; the nostalgia ban is a static background condition rather than an active force in the scene. Once the moonstone is found, the protagonist faces no obstacles or difficult trade-offs to complete her dance, resulting in low narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.5)
    Escalation is minimal; the protagonist faces no external resistance and the internal obstacle dissolves instantly upon throwing a stone. The lack of a "meaningful tightening" or a choice that forecloses a path keeps the stakes abstract and low.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.2)
    Conflict is largely retrospective; the present timeline lacks active resistance or escalation, relying on a "realization" structure. The stakes are declared in memory rather than tested against an immediate obstacle on the ridge.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes remain theoretical and internal; the "failing equation" is an abstract antagonist. The escalation relies on the cliché of a spinning instrument needle rather than escalating human pressure or narrowing options. The resolution—a sudden harmonious agreement across timelines—removes the tension without forcing the protagonist to make a difficult choice or pay a price.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes remain largely conceptual; while the mystery is compelling, there is no active opposition or time pressure forcing difficult decisions. The resolution comes as a gift—a discovery that validates her grandfather—rather than a victory won through sacrifice. Consequently, the "felt cost" required for higher bands is absent; she gains enlightenment without paying a price.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is abstract and lacks immediacy; the "spiritual drought" is told rather than dramatized through specific resistance. The pressure comes solely from a ticking clock, and the protagonist’s success feels inevitable, lacking a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.9)
    Pressure accumulates coherently through the ritual; the general's resistance and the delegates' subsequent breakdown provide necessary friction. The cost is visible on the page, moving the conflict from abstract negotiation to visceral grief.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stakes are legible and the financial and symbolic cost of sacrificing the egg is paid on the page. However, the internal conflict resolves somewhat rapidly, lacking a moment of hesitation or resistance to maximize the tension of the release.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.5)
    While the stakes are high in theory (liberation vs. death), the on-page conflict is low; the "web" is a passive obstacle that offers no active resistance to the protagonist's efforts. The tension relies almost entirely on the anticipated arrival of guards rather than an immediate, escalating struggle within the scene's central action.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.7)
    The stakes are clear—artistic integrity and redemption—driven by the off-page argument. However, the conflict is entirely internal and resolves somewhat smoothly; the lack of on-page resistance or the temptation to slide back into "easy" satire keeps the pressure moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.5)
    The stakes (witnessing an extinction) are poignant but remain largely atmospheric. There is little active opposition—nature cooperates perfectly with Mira’s intentions. The escalation is internal and contemplative, lacking a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt or the cost of her method is sharply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.1)
    Pressure accumulates through the ritual process and the atmospheric response of the ice walls, creating a "Situational" tension. However, the stakes feel somewhat low as the magic works perfectly on the first attempt without forcing a difficult trade-off or threatening failure on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.4)
    While the approaching storm provides functional ticking-clock pressure, the internal conflict faces little opposition. The resolution comes through smooth understanding rather than a high-stakes trade-off or forced sacrifice, making the victory feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.4)
    External opposition is minimal; the guards act as a mild ticking clock that resolves without confrontation, and the desert excavation faces no resistance or time pressure. The "cost" of spending her last savings is reported in summary, preventing the reader from feeling the weight of the trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are high (fratricide accusation), but tension evaporates the moment Mira activates the vision; the antagonist provides the solution immediately, deflating the pressure rather than escalating it. The conflict lacks a true back-and-forth struggle where Kale's convictions are tested against resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.4)
    Pressure is maintained through the procedural focus, but the external antagonist (the fog) cooperates rather than resists ("not invading, but responding"). The protagonist faces no agonizing trade-offs or moments of genuine failure, resulting in low dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—the mother-daughter bond—is pressured effectively by the immediate confrontation. The escalation is sharp, pivoting on the definition of their craft. While the resolution comes somewhat swiftly via the prop, the emotional cost of Marta admitting her error anchors the peace.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.7)
    Conflict is largely intellectual and resolves with minimal friction; the protagonist accepts a massive existential shift without visible cost or renunciation. The "disquiet" mentioned acts more as atmospheric coloring than a source of genuine pressure that forces a hard choice. The stakes remain abstract, lacking a moment where failure feels like a genuine possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.8)
    The stakes are high (erasure of humanity), but the climax deflates tension rather than tightening it. The antagonist (the bookstore entity) capitulates immediately to a single suggestion, resulting in a resolution that feels unearned and lacking in pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.5)
    Tension escalates effectively as the environment destabilizes Mira’s sense of reality, forcing a stance crystallization. The stakes are intimate yet high, and the final choice to pull the thread that "hurt least" represents a clear, costly trade-off between absolute truth and survivable narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=4.8)
    Tension is low throughout, as the antagonist (time/entropy) offers no active resistance and the task proceeds without setback. The "hours of careful unbraiding" are summarized rather than dramatized, bypassing the potential for fatigue, error, or sacrifice that would generate genuine narrative stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=5.4)
    High external stakes (village suffering) are established early, but the narrative lacks immediate, active pressure on the protagonist within the scene. The climax relies on a brief moment of internal focus that succeeds without a "try-fail" cycle or sacrifice, diminishing the sense of risk. The antagonist (the noise) is a static condition rather than an active opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=4.8)
    Tension is low throughout; the protagonist faces no external opposition or significant internal doubt. The inclusion of a "future-echo" that guarantees her success obliterates the stakes of her decision to leave the tower, turning a risky gamble into a calculated errand.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.3)
    The stakes are high (the integrity of history and self), but the conflict is primarily intellectual until the final beat. The antagonist is the nature of time itself, which creates a coherent pressure, though the protagonist’s capitulation comes without a distinct moment of resistance or alternative tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.6)
    Conflict is low-voltage; Kael offers almost no resistance to the mentor's lessons, dissolving potential tension immediately. The "cost" of the transformation is conceptual—accepting darkness—but the lack of a difficult choice or sacrifice on the page makes the victory feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes are personal and clear, but the escalation relies heavily on verbal explanation rather than dramatic action or forced choices. The conflict diffuses rapidly once the mother is mentioned, lowering the tension prematurely without a higher cost paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clear and escalate naturally with the ticking clock of the gravity correction. The loss of the mother’s vessel provides a sharp, immediate cost to the protagonist’s victory. A slight reliance on expository definition of the emotional stakes ("frequency of parental hope curdling") slows the climactic beat momentarily.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist (Elena) offers little genuine resistance to the operator's guidance, making the outcome feel predetermined. The stakes remain abstract and thematic, lacking a moment of high pressure where a difficult trade-off or risk is required to achieve the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.1)
    The sunrise deadline creates effective external pressure that drives the pacing. However, the internal stakes are lowered by the artifact solving the riddle; the protagonist faces a race against time rather than a test of skill or moral fiber, making the final success feel inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=3.8)
    Dramatic pressure is negligible; the "conflict" resolves instantly when the girl enters without knocking, removing any barrier to her goal. The dialogue functions as mutual affirmation rather than a crucible of competing needs, leaving the stakes theoretical (suffocation) rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.0)
    Pressure is coherent and thematic, but the climax lacks visceral on-page resistance; the "impossible" bolt fits immediately without a "try-fail" cycle. The resolution relies on a conceptual realization that bypasses physical struggle, limiting the scene's dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are clear and escalate meaningfully; the discovery shifts the burden from general corruption to specific theft, forcing a new and costly action. The realization that the previous "destruction" was incomplete adds genuine pressure, and the choice to reveal the deeper sin feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are clearly internal (honor/sanity) but externalized through the shifting reality of the greenhouse. The escalation is coherent, moving from observation to memory to physical engagement. The final choice resolves the tension between standardized duty and the "ancient pattern."

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.3)
    The narrative lacks immediate pressure; the conflict is entirely retrospective (Samuel’s struggle against bureaucracy), leaving Miriam with no active opposition or high-stakes dilemma to navigate in the scene time.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are clearly established—preservation of truth versus survival—and the searchlight provides a functional escalator. The cost is legible on the page: the searchlight forces her to abandon her plan to "reappear" and instead vanish deeper, altering her future tactics. The antagonist remains somewhat abstract (a faceless light), limiting the visceral tension.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake (ruin) is theoretical, and the on-page conflict lacks an antagonist or significant obstacle. Escalation is atmospheric—playing deeper—rather than a tactical tightening of options or rising cost.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes remain abstract; Miren faces no opposition, and her "obsession" has no on-page cost to her health, status, or relationships. The resolution is unearned, as the "message revealed itself" simply because she found the magic object, bypassing struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.3)
    The story operates on low tension; the "pressure" is intellectual curiosity rather than urgent risk or conflict. While the mystery of the compass provides momentum, the protagonist faces no significant obstacles or antagonists, and the "cost" of his transformation is purely conceptual. The accumulation of clues leads to a discovery without forcing a difficult trade-off until the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.0)
    The emotional stakes are established early and the cost—confirming the child’s death to end the father's suspended hope—is palpable. The pressure resolves somewhat easily during the confrontation, but the internal conflict and the weight of the delivery sustain the narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure builds coherently through the gorge's amplification of the shade's guilt, forcing Kael to deepen her melody to break the loop. While the protagonist's high competence minimizes the fear of failure, the emotional deepening provides sufficient narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.6)
    Internal stakes are high, but the external conflict is resolved somewhat easily by the mentor's convenient presence and readiness to explain the solution. However, Sera's final choice to unclip the mask provides a necessary moment of active agency and vulnerability to anchor the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.2)
    Escalation is negligible; the protagonist faces no active opposition or dilemma, and the resolution requires no sacrifice or visible cost. The stakes remain abstract and are resolved by a purchase rather than a test of character.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes are relatively low; the conflict is primarily atmospheric rather than urgent or dangerous. While the protagonist chooses to help the ghost over his paid work, the lack of external pressure or a ticking clock makes the escalation feel gentle and "cozy" rather than tense.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are clear and escalate efficiently: the frost creates immediate visual pressure, followed by the conceptual pressure of the Operator’s diagnosis. The tension between preserving the loop and the inevitable "fall" is well-managed, leading to a necessary rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.4)
    The intellectual stakes—defining the meaning of a civilization—are successfully personalized through Kasimir’s history. The conflict deepens naturally as he moves from rejecting Vhen’s theory to reconstructing his own worldview, though the antagonist remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=4.9)
    Stakes are external (the Duchess's sadness) and told rather than felt in the scene; Aldric himself faces no risk of failure or harm. The conflict is purely intellectual/mechanical, lacking escalation or genuine opposition to the protagonist's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes are existential and clear: the comfort of classification versus the danger of the unknowable. The pressure escalates naturally from the initial curiosity to the overwhelming sensory experience of the lagoon. The final choice represents a total trade-off with visible cost—leaving behind the "architecture of certainty" for good.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.3)
    External pressure is minimal; the storm is atmospheric rather than obstructive, and the GPS failure is a minor inconvenience that does not force a hard choice. The conflict remains abstract—a shift in artistic theory—without a tangible price or escalating risk on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.2)
    The internal stakes are clear, and the pressure is sustained through the conversation. However, the conflict is low-voltage, resolved by a single conversation and a lucky find rather than escalating pressure or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure escalates cleanly from the descent to the realization of the trap. The cost is palpable and paid on the page: Malik trades safety for a traumatic, permanent burden.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.4)
    Conflict is abstract and theoretical; the protagonist's transition from isolation to community success is linear and summarized without a distinct moment of failure, resistance, or on-page cost. The lack of an antagonist or significant obstacle deflates tension.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are theoretical rather than felt; there is no on-page moment where Marcus weighs a competing option or risks failure. The progression is linear and ritualistic, lacking a tightening of pressure or a visible cost to the protagonist's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—the survival of the seeds—is tightened effectively by the "entropy sink" pressure. The climax offers a meaningful deepening of the conflict, though the opposition is purely environmental and abstract rather than active.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes are clearly defined and high (valley safety), and the escalation follows a logical path. However, the conflict is somewhat "straw-manned" by making the digital system simply slow/incompetent, which removes the potential for a more nuanced tradeoff between the two methods.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=3.9)
    There is virtually no escalation or pressure; the meteor shower is an aesthetic event rather than a challenge that narrows options. The dominant stake (peace/stasis) is never threatened in the scene, resulting in a lack of narrative drive or necessary trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes are largely theoretical; the "tangled covenant" is a rule from the past that imposes no immediate, active threat to Mara herself. The climax lacks genuine pressure, as the ghosts are passive observers and the act of reading the letter resolves the conflict without requiring a difficult trade-off or sacrifice from the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is largely theoretical; the "Fluid Timers" are introduced as a threat but never manifest to exert pressure on the scene. The visitors are compliant and eager, reducing the climax to an expositional lecture without resistance, risk, or visible cost to the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes are relatively low and the conflict (a lost kite) is resolved quickly with a thematic lesson; the boy's grief offers potential pressure, but Maren neutralizes it too easily. The "cost" is minimal—the kite is lost, but the emotional gap is filled immediately by the feather and wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.0)
    The conflict is linear and lacks obstacles; Maren faces no setbacks in her rewiring, and the ecosystem responds immediately and perfectly to her efforts. The stakes (death) are established early, but the lack of active opposition or difficult trade-offs makes the escalation feel inevitable rather than earned. The "brazen calm" removes the tension of the ticking clock.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.7)
    The stakes are intellectual and philosophical, fitting the genre, though the emotional cost of "homecoming" could be sharper. The escalation works well: Elara defends her thesis, admits her vulnerability ("weight of repetition"), and secures a breakthrough with the alien. The pressure coheres under a clear Accumulative/Situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.6)
    Pressure is minimal; the protagonist faces no active opposition, resource scarcity, or risk of failure, resulting in low stakes despite the "war" backdrop. The conflict is purely thematic (life vs. death) rather than dramatized through obstacles that force the character to pay a visible price or alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is extremely low; the antagonist is the abstract concept of "distance," which is defeated without opposition. The protagonist faces no difficult trade-offs or skepticism from the community, and the decoding process is summarized rather than dramatized as a struggle. No visible cost is paid for the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict is minimal and strictly internal; there is no external pressure, time clock, or opposing force to drive escalation. The stakes are philosophical—finding meaning in isolation—which results in a meditative vignette that lacks the tension or deepening required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=4.3)
    Pressure is minimal; the guardian provides immediate welcome rather than obstacles, and the "wrongness of the sky" remains an atmospheric backdrop rather than a forcing function. The scene lacks a meaningful tightening of options or a reversal, resulting in a flat dramatic arc where the protagonist faces no risk.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story lacks a dominant stake with visible pressure; Mira’s practice meets no resistance, and the archivist’s arrival leads to immediate validation rather than conflict or complication. The stakes are thematic (memory vs. oblivion) rather than dramatic or situational, and no clear price is paid for the resolution. Without an antagonist, internal doubt, or environmental obstacle to overcome, the narrative drive feels flat.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.4)
    The internal stakes are high and palpable, escalating from the pain of remembering to the "exquisite pain" of integration. While the external opposition is minimal, the internal pressure is coherent and intensifies appropriately through the interaction with the stone and feather. The climax delivers a meaningful deepening of the character's state.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.4)
    Internal stakes are high and clearly defined, with the approaching thunder serving as an effective "ticking clock" that pressures the protagonist's work. The escalation is primarily intellectual (decoding), which limits visceral tension slightly, but the emotional payoff is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.1)
    The stakes are high and personal: the risk of spiritual damnation versus the cost of self-betrayal. The Elder’s intervention provides a necessary intensification of conflict, forcing Mara to articulate her philosophy. The final choice to engage the tower on her own terms represents a meaningful crystallization of stance.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are immediate and visceral, balancing the macro (civilization's survival) with the micro (drowning). The escalation works well under the Causal lens, as the oxygen debt serves as a ticking clock that forces the climax. The physical cost is palpable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure escalates coherently as the protagonist fails to capture the scene with old methods, leading to a clear change in tactics. The cost—abandoning the permanence of canvas for the tide-swept shells—is conceptually legible.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=3.5)
    Tension is virtually non-existent; Mira faces no obstacle in executing her plan, and Thomas offers no resistance to her unorthodox method. The lack of pushback or potential cost for failure drains the stakes, leaving the climax to play out as a foregone conclusion rather than a test of conviction.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.1)
    The "pull" creates a coherent, pervasive pressure that escalates from a physical sensation to an existential threat. The stakes shift meaningfully from a personal search for family to a broader custodial responsibility for the future, providing a satisfying deepening of the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes are established early, but the tension dissipates after the decision is made. The resolution comes too easily via summary, lacking a moment where the plan is genuinely tested or risks failure on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.8)
    The stakes are primarily internal and curiosity-driven; there is little external pressure or risk to Magnus beyond the intellectual puzzle. While the realization leads to a shift in stance (Charged Poise), the lack of an antagonist or time constraint keeps the narrative tension relatively low.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.4)
    The stakes remain relatively low; while the "rising creek" adds atmospheric pressure, Martin is never in true jeopardy, and the "doorway" offers a vision that resolves his angst without requiring a sacrifice. The climax feels more like a gift received than a victory earned through struggle or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.2)
    Internal stakes are established, but the conflict lacks active resistance; the environment simply shows and explains the resolution. The escalation is linear and low-pressure, leading to acceptance without a costly trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.1)
    Stakes are low on the page; the antagonist (the Academy) is distant, and Mira offers no opposition, resulting in a lecture rather than a conflict. The tension is intellectual and retrospective rather than immediate or visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=5.0)
    Conflict is largely retrospective or conceptual (Sanity vs. Time) rather than immediate and active within the scene. Maren faces no urgent threat or decision that forces a trade-off in the present; she merely observes her condition. The stakes are theoretically high but dramatically low because they do not exert pressure on a specific on-page action.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are displaced entirely onto an off-page character, leaving the protagonist with no personal risk or cost in the final decision. The "tightening" is merely a shift in perspective; the choice to delay repair lacks a felt price or difficult trade-off for Elena herself.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.5)
    Escalation is dampened by the low-cost solution to the crystallization; the threat is neutralized instantly by knocking, draining tension before the climax. The conflict remains internal and abstract, lacking a decisive turning point that forces a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.0)
    The stakes are clear and the ticking clock (developers arriving tomorrow) provides effective pressure. The conflict escalates nicely from silence to the "paper storm," though the resolution comes a bit too easily once Margot decides to act.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.6)
    While the cosmic stakes are high, the conflict is intellectual and internal, lacking a concrete obstacle or visceral tension. The escalation feels less like a crisis requiring difficult decisions and more like a guided progression toward an inevitable epiphany, lowering the dramatic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are immediately clear and escalate from a bureaucratic anomaly to an existential negotiation with physics. The pressure is coherent, forcing a choice that carries both physical pain and the burden of secret knowledge. The conflict resolves through active intervention rather than coincidence, satisfying the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.3)
    The stakes are clear but low-voltage; the conflict is resolved through a quiet conversation and an explained metaphor. There is no moment where the protagonist is forced to make a difficult trade-off under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes are clear and personal, balancing the intellectual need for order with the emotional weight of the father's survival. The pressure escalates coherently, though the cost of the final decision is intellectual (admitting uncertainty) rather than a tangible on-page sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are clear—employment vs. connection—and the pressure escalates naturally through the caller's persistence. The cost of "termination" is declared rather than visceral, but the psychic cost of maintaining "cultivated estrangement" provides sufficient weight.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are low and opposition is virtually nonexistent; the central tension of loneliness is resolved by an external event without escalation or trade-off. There is no moment where the protagonist must weigh conflicting values or pay a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.8)
    The central conflict (loneliness vs. duty) is resolved with minimal on-page resistance; Mara accepts the group's presence and the rock's meaning without significant friction or cost. The "struggle" is solved by the arrival of others, making the resolution feel inevitable rather than forged through protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.5)
    Pressure is low; the forest is described as unmappable, yet yields easily to Sera's tools without forcing a difficult trade-off or tactical pivot. The protagonist’s agency is limited to "following" a signal until the climax arrives. While the emotional deepening works, the lack of external resistance or meaningful obstacles limits the narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure escalates cleanly as the archival records shift in real-time, forcing a confrontation with reality. The stakes are high but cerebral—sanity and history versus a fluid truth—and the protagonist's choice to "unbend" represents a meaningful surrender of control. The resolution offers a distinct shift in tactics and understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=4.2)
    There is virtually no external resistance; the crowd immediately understands and validates the project, and the technology works perfectly on the first try. The stakes of "erasure" are raised but resolved instantly by external applause, removing tension.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clearly established (safety vs. truth) and escalate to a meaningful decision point. The cost of "burning down her life" to keep the promise is visceral and felt, satisfying the requirement for high-stakes agency.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.9)
    The stakes of identity versus entanglement are clear and escalate coherently through the environment's response. The cost—the loss of individual self—is legible, though the protagonists' surrender to it feels relatively low-friction, lacking a visceral moment of final resistance before acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=4.9)
    Stakes remain low throughout; the "poisonous" storm and "hunting" frame imply danger that never materializes. The antagonist reveals herself as a benevolent gatekeeper, neutralizing the tension without a price paid by the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.8)
    External pressure is absent from the scene; the Guardian complies immediately, and no antagonist or time constraint actively opposes their work. The "stillwater tension" feels declared rather than dramatized through obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes are clear—Danny’s autonomy vs. paternal expectation—and the "rebellion" raises the stakes nicely. The conflict resolution is slightly low-tension, as Danny is won over by an explanation rather than a forced trade-off, but the cost (deception) is present.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.9)
    The stakes (freedom vs. duty) are clear but the conflict is low-resistance; the obstacle of "duty's anchor" is overcome with a single invitation. The cost of leaving is mentioned abstractly ("phantom weight") but not felt or paid on the page, making the resolution feel convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.8)
    The stakes—emotional honesty versus the safety of the &quot;remade hush&quot;—are palpable and escalate naturally through the dialogue. Marcus's attempt to maintain his performance against Emma's interruption creates distinct pressure. The cost of the final choice is the loss of his protective shield, which is felt viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are low because the prohibition has already been lifted and the gatekeeper (Kael) is sympathetic. Meris faces no active opposition or difficult trade-off in the scene; she simply performs the action she came to do. The threat of a future ban is mentioned but exerts no immediate pressure on her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.0)
    Conflict is static; the antagonist force (drowsiness) never threatens the protagonist or forces a change in tactics. The resolution is achieved without escalation, risk of failure, or a moment of doubt, resulting in negligible narrative tension despite the high conceptual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain theoretical; while the concept of "synthetic belonging" is high-minded, there is no on-page obstacle or antagonist to test Maren's conviction. The volunteer's immediate capitulation removes tension, making the climax a demonstration of competence rather than a dramatic struggle with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.8)
    Pressure is low; the protagonist encounters no significant resistance that cannot be solved by a time-jump montage. The conflict—shaking hands and grief—dissolves without a decisive, high-cost on-page choice. The breakthrough feels inevitable rather than earned through acute struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story lacks genuine narrative pressure or escalation; Vesper faces no opposition, time constraints, or risk of failure during the decoding process. The progression is smooth and linear, reading more like a puzzle solution than a dramatic conflict with stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake (forbidden knowledge) is clear, but the antagonist (the lock/mystery) dissolves instantly, leaving only internal conflict. The realization of the cost comes without a dramatized moment of temptation, lowering the stakes of the final decision.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake is abstract and thematic (the integrity of hope) rather than visceral; there is no immediate external pressure or antagonist forcing the choice. The cost of her decision—dreams becoming "harder to experience"—is conceptual and future-oriented, lacking an immediate on-page price paid by the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.6)
    The stakes are clearly internalized; the cost of admitting her methodology was flawed is felt, and the choice to "try again" carries weight. The conflict between scientific rigidity (Marcus/The Board) and observational truth provides a solid pressure cooker for the scene, even if the resolution feels a bit tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.3)
    The stakes are high and escalate cleanly from the personal need for closure to a criminal realization. The cost is visceral and paid on the page—Mara physically reopening her wounds to access the truth is a powerful dramatization of the premise. The tightening of pressure leads naturally to the final decision.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story lacks significant dramatic pressure; Celeste faces no antagonists, difficult choices, or risk of failure. The progression is linear and observational, with the "thunder" providing atmospheric rather than narrative escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a concrete antagonist or active resistance; the Keeper desires release and Celestine desires to free him, aligning their goals perfectly and removing tension. The central conflict is purely abstract (chaos vs. order) and is resolved through a philosophical assertion rather than a pressurized choice with visible consequences. There is no point where the protagonist's goal is genuinely at risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.2)
    Conflict is the primary weakness; the stakes are abstract (hope vs. despair) rather than immediate, and Maren encounters no active opposition or risk of failure. The meeting with the traveler is an agreement rather than a confrontation, offering no escalation of pressure or forced trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.6)
    Stakes are theoretically high (understanding vs. ignorance) but structurally absent; the protagonist faces no obstacles, risks, or time pressure. The process of placing gears is smooth and intuitive, lacking a moment of doubt or a necessary sacrifice. Without a "felt cost" or the possibility of failure, the narrative lacks tension.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.0)
    The conflict is largely internal and resolved through conversation rather than active struggle against obstacles or high-stakes choices. While the stakes shift clearly from finding the dog to finding courage, the gentle guidance removes much of the necessary narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.2)
    The stakes are clearly established as emotional survival and the search for meaning in the aftermath. The tension escalates well through the silent interaction at the piano, culminating in a shared act that answers the protagonist's central question. The pressure is coherent and situational.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is no tangible pressure on the protagonist; he operates from a place of absolute safety and omnipotence relative to the antagonist. The conflict is resolved remotely through a magical mechanism, bypassing any need for risk, sacrifice, or difficult trade-offs. The "pretender" offers no active opposition to Ossian's efforts.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=4.5)
    Narrative pressure is low; the protagonist faces an intellectual puzzle rather than a dilemma requiring trade-offs. The resolution arrives without any visible or felt cost, as the confirmation is immediate and risk-free.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.4)
    External pressure is minimal due to the established "lull," leaving the stakes abstract and philosophical. The escalation is accumulative (the hum gets louder), but without a counter-force or a tangible threat (the "safety hazard" is mentioned but ignored), the resolution feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.8)
    Escalation is weak; external threats (Authority, unstable geology) are mentioned but effectively sidestepped without pressure. The climax lacks a felt cost, as the narrative explicitly assures the reader she "remained herself," undercutting the sacrifice of the biological transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.1)
    Present-tense stakes are low; the primary conflict is internal and retrospective, managed through established habit rather than escalated by the couple's visit. The scene serves as a mirror for reflection rather than a pressure cooker for choice.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.6)
    Escalation is tangible and rhythmic, driven by the shrinking room and the lighthouse beam. The dominant stake—psychological and physical survival—tightens meaningfully, forcing the protagonist to confront her shadow-selves to survive.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.5)
    Escalation is driven effectively by the drone's automated aggression, forcing Kael to make a decisive choice between efficiency and understanding. The final beat achieves a Charged Poise, where Kael trades immediate control for a moment of shared realization, creating a felt cost in the delay.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes—global stability versus historical truth—are high and clearly articulated. The conflict escalates internally through Maren’s hesitation, though the antagonist (the Concord) remains a generic concept rather than a felt, immediate pressure in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are personal and philosophical, escalated efficiently from a critique of gardening to a confrontation about truth and violence. The unspoken threat of the blade raises the immediate physical tension, while the discussion of the magistrate anchors it in broader consequences. The resolution feels earned by Mira’s refusal to flinch.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.6)
    The conflict is primarily atmospheric; the garden’s physical threat ("draw blood") remains theoretical and does not force a difficult trade-off in the scene. The climax relies on Mara "holding perfectly still," which—while consistent with her character—de-escalates tension rather than tightening the screw at the critical moment.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)
    While the intellectual stakes are high, the external pressure remains distant (a phone call three hours ago), making the conflict feel somewhat insulated. The resolution arrives via deduction without a moment of visceral risk or sacrifice in the present scene, though the conceptual repricing of the father's legacy is distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.7)
    The stakes of grief and redemption are clear, but the external conflict with the machine lacks genuine pressure; the amber solves the problem immediately upon contact. The climax feels more like a ritual enactment than a struggle with uncertain outcomes. The cost is stated ("accumulated sorrow") rather than dramatized through difficult action.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.6)
    The stakes are existential yet grounded in the immediate scene. The pressure of "unlearning" is palpable, and the arrival of the old man provides a sharp, coherent tightening of the conflict. The cost is visible on the page—the word vanishes even as he reaches for it.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story lacks immediate antagonistic pressure or escalation within the scene. The "regime" is a distant threat, and the memory loop—the primary obstacle—is escaped early and easily. The ritual proceeds without complication or cost, resulting in a low-tension climax where success feels inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are theoretical (existence/despair) rather than felt through immediate pressure or opposition. The ritual proceeds without a moment of potential failure or doubt; the magic works instantly, and the audience appears on cue. There is no escalation of cost or tension, resulting in a linear progression that lacks dramatic torque.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is negligible as Dr. Chen's skepticism dissolves immediately upon demonstration; the scene lacks escalation, opposition, or a moment where the protagonist must trade something to succeed.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes remain abstract; the threat of the "overwhelming" emotion is introduced and resolved in the same beat without forcing Maren to lose anything or make a difficult trade-off. The conflict is intellectual rather than visceral, and the resolution comes without a visible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.5)
    While the stakes (truth unraveling) are conceptually high, the on-page execution lacks genuine tension because the protagonist faces no opposition and pays no cost for the resolution. The escalation (hourglasses speeding up) is resolved too neatly by a single constructive action, missing the "foreclosed option" or trade-off required for higher conflict scores.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.7)
    The melting snow establishes a functional ticking clock, creating natural urgency. However, the absence of an active antagonist or significant obstacle during the retrieval phase makes the victory feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—the woman’s need to resolve her family history—is clear and pressures the scene immediately. The conflict is internal but externalized well through the prop of the journals. The resolution involves a meaningful renunciation of her original goal (finding the singular truth) in favor of a more complex understanding, representing a visible conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=3.0)
    There is virtually no conflict or pressure. The environment is "distant," the antagonist (entropy) is abstract, and the encounter is entirely benevolent. The narrative lacks a tightening of options or a moment where the protagonist must risk something to gain understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.6)
    Conflict is largely environmental and low-pressure; the "suspicion" of the neighborhood is told rather than dramatized in the scene. The narrative lacks a distinct tightening moment where options narrow; instead, it follows a gentle progression of tasks without urgent opposition or high cost.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes are internal and clearly declared, but the story lacks escalation; there is no "tightening" or narrowing of options on the page. The resolution arrives via an external object (the book) rather than a difficult choice or trade-off made by the protagonist under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.1)
    Internal stakes are legible, but external pressure is gentle; the resolution arrives through an invitation and a guided realization rather than a high-pressure choice with sharper resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.1)
    While the declared stakes (city-wide chaos) are high, the on-page pressure is low; the tricksters function more as a puzzle than an active opposition, reducing the tension of the final confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.8)
    Pressure is low; the external environment (the organ) acts as a benevolent guide rather than an obstacle, removing the threat of getting lost. The internal conflict (fear) is resolved by endurance rather than a high-stakes trade-off or clever maneuver.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.5)
    Tension is low; the narrative follows a linear path of competence where the protagonist succeeds without significant setbacks or reversals. The stakes are stated but the lack of active opposition makes the outcome feel inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes are high—exile versus safety—but the on-page conflict is muted because the primary obstacle (Kao/skepticism) yields too easily. The pressure is largely atmospheric and backstory-driven rather than an active, escalating clash between characters or immediate circumstances in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pressure is low; the protagonist faces a puzzle rather than a true antagonist or dilemma, and the solution works on the first attempt. The physical cost ("bow arm aching") is trivial compared to the supernatural scale of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.6)
    The stakes are clear—redemption versus recidivism—but the conflict remains quiet and relatively low-pressure. The father’s acceptance of Marco’s offer comes without a sharp testing moment where the lure of the road creates genuine, terrified hesitation, making the resolution feel slightly smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes (sanity/death vs. understanding) are established via backstory, but the on-page pressure is low; the characters sip tea and compare notes without immediate threat. The escalation is purely intellectual, lacking a visceral "tightening" of options before the breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are clear and escalate through the discovery of the forbidden seeds. The shift in Maren's approach provides a meaningful tightening of pressure. While the resolution (singing the apprentice free) is somewhat rapid, the cost is legible in the apprentice’s confrontation with his own "twisted" nature.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is largely abstract ("the future arrived early") with no active antagonist or environmental resistance challenging the protagonists' ritual. The characters are perfectly aligned in goal and method, resulting in a cooperation scene that lacks the tension of divergent tactics or competing needs. Escalation is minimal; they meet, agree, and succeed.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are high and clear: the integrity of the soul. The escalation from physical discomfort to an existential choice about enduring "real, whole pain" is well-paced and impactful.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.3)
    Internal stakes are high and clearly defined; the pressure from the recent public failure gives weight to the appraisal decision. While the external pressure from the attorney is mild, the internal escalation—from retreating into facts to risking instinct—is coherent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the central tension (grief/ignorance) is resolved immediately by the supernatural growth of the vine. There is no escalation, tightening of options, or moment where Emilia must risk something of value to gain the knowledge she seeks.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.1)
    The stakes are clear and conceptual (wonder vs. routine), anchored by the physical cost of smelting the identity documents. While the pressure is coherent, the conflict is gentle; the visitor accepts the reconfiguration without significant struggle or reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.7)
    The conflict is low-stakes and purely internal, resolved instantly by the external authority of the note. There is no opposition or trade-off; Marcus adopts his new mission without sacrificing anything or facing a dilemma that would prove his commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes remain largely internal and abstract; the conflict is man-vs-self processed through journaling with low immediate risk. The escalation is contemplative rather than active, lacking a moment where the protagonist faces a genuine threat of failure or external consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.4)
    External pressure is minimal; the threat that "many seekers never returned" remains abstract and never manifests as a concrete obstacle on the page. The protagonist faces no active opposition or difficult trade-offs during the search, leaving the escalation largely internal.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.1)
    The binary stakes established by the coffee reading are strong, but the "third option" resolution (leak the report, lie to the Empire) feels like a tactical workaround that lowers the felt cost. The protagonist outsmarts the dilemma rather than making a painful sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=4.5)
    Pressure is minimal; the primary opposition is the passive state of the dead, which Lyra masters easily. There is no active antagonist, time crunch, or resource scarcity to force a hard trade-off; the environment and the subject cooperate fully with Lyra's intentions, flattening the dramatic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes of internal peace and unresolved grief are clear and escalate through the dialogue to the reveal of the mother's face. The resolution—accepting that seeking is the source—carries a conceptual cost (the loss of a final destination), though the emotional price is mitigated by the comforting nature of the wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—Mara's professional integrity and self-conception—is signaled early and escalated by the memory of Vincent's letter. While the external conflict is low-friction (a gentle conversation), the internal pressure is coherent and forces a tangible change in her stance. The cost is clear: she must abandon the "black and white" certainty that made her successful.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.3)
    Conflict is primarily abstract (wisdom vs. time) rather than immediate pressure on the page. The student’s fear suggests stakes that are never fully materialized or tested; the teaching moment proceeds smoothly without a moment of genuine risk or potential failure.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the environment, the tool, and the birds all cooperate immediately with the protagonist's intent. The stakes (collapse of the navigation network) are abstract and distant, and the on-page action encounters no resistance or escalation to test the protagonist's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are clear and personal; the pressure escalates from the physical pain of the climb to the frustration of magical failure. The conflict resolves through a meaningful deepening of understanding rather than external victory, fitting the established stakes of self-worth versus efficiency.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure is primarily atmospheric rather than dramatic. Mara finds the ship "easily" and navigates the "sealed" door without on-page resistance or cost. The lack of a pivotal "do-or-die" choice or near-failure deflates the stakes of the dive.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the external stakes are existential, the interpersonal conflict evaporates instantly with Kael's conversion. The final cost—the loss of human form—is conceptual and high, but the lack of struggle to accept it makes the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are primarily interpretive (how to view a past choice) rather than active, which limits tension. While the cost of her loneliness is felt, the conflict is largely retrospective; the present moment lacks a live decision that carries new risk.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.4)
    The stakes are clearly established, and the climax provides a meaningful tightening where the protagonist's specific limitations create tension ("magic guttered and flared"). The conflict is largely internal and technical; while effective, it lacks a dynamic external counter-pressure beyond the passive "imbalance."

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.9)
    The narrative operates under an Accumulative lens, but pressure remains low throughout; the conflict is primarily atmospheric memory versus oblivion, lacking immediate stakes for Marcus. He faces no obstacles or genuine costs; the "vigilance" of his job is mentioned but never tested against the emotional pull of the ruins in a way that forces a hard sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=4.3)
    Tension is low; the &quot;Academy masters&quot; serve as abstract, off-stage strawmen rather than an active opposition. There is no moment of escalation where failure seems possible or where Lyra must sacrifice something valuable to succeed. The conflict is purely theoretical (logic vs. sentiment) and resolves smoothly, lacking the friction required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.5)
    The conflict is clear and the stakes (truth vs. conformity) are legible. However, the antagonist (Ground/Command) capitulates relatively easily after the explanation, missing an opportunity for a deeper deepening of the threat or a more painful trade-off for Vera.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.1)
    Escalation is driven by agency; Kira’s refusal to surrender the child despite her lack of love deepens the stakes significantly. The turn from "I don't love her" to "I need her for the opposite" effectively reweights the central conflict from simple possession to existential function.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes are clearly defined, but the conflict remains largely intellectual and low-pressure. The antagonist is abstract, and the "struggle" is resolved through a single internal realization without significant external pushback or escalating cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.4)
    The conflict between the house's crushing silence and the tunnel's defiant noise is original and carries the emotional weight well. The stakes escalate naturally when Sarah intrudes, forcing the private ritual into the shared space.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are clearly defined—integrity of self vs. safety of the library. The escalation works well through the "homesickness" complication, though the resolution feels slightly safe; the cost is paid in a return to status quo rather than a new scar.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.0)
    Escalation is weak; the protagonist faces no active resistance or potential failure within the scene itself. She decides to use the forbidden method, mixes the ingredients, and succeeds on the first try, lacking a moment of "all is lost" or a difficult pivot. The stakes are internal and historical, but the on-page pressure is low.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes remain abstract; Mira faces no genuine threat of failure or loss, only a sense of professional ennui. The "tuning" moment, intended as the climax, encounters zero resistance—she changes the dial and immediately finds the prize. Without a felt cost or a credible risk of failure, the escalation remains flat.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are declared but not felt; the conflict evaporates when the Captain agrees to the "never been done" plan without argument or failure. The protagonist faces no genuine resistance, and the resolution extracts no visible price or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story lacks significant pressure or escalation; the protagonist enters, succeeds at the task immediately, and gains wisdom without paying a visible cost. The absence of an antagonist, obstacle, or internal failure state flattens the dramatic tension into a smooth procedural.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.3)
    The stakes are clear but remain intellectual rather than visceral; there is no active opposition or risk of failure in the scene beyond the difficulty of comprehension. Escalation is present as understanding deepens, but the lack of a forced trade-off or tangible danger limits the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=4.9)
    Pressure is low throughout; the antagonist (the abuser) is a disembodied voice from the past, and Lily’s arrival removes the obstacle of distance immediately. There is no moment where Mira’s goal is genuinely threatened or where she must trade one value for another; she simply performs her job to success.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.5)
    The ticking clock provides solid external pressure, but the climax is observational rather than active. Mara witnesses the event and takes photos, but does not face a dilemma that costs her something significant beyond endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes are clear (guilt vs. truth), but the escalation is primarily procedural (trying methods) rather than deepening personal cost. The resolution dissolves the conflict by revealing there was no failure to begin with, which lowers the retrospective stakes of the protagonist's struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.2)
    While the conceptual stakes (extinction of a language) are high, the narrative lacks immediate dramatic pressure or resistance. The ritual proceeds smoothly without failure or meaningful opposition; the rumored "curse" serves as set-dressing rather than a genuine obstacle, making success feel inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure builds coherently from the physical anomaly of the arrowhead to the emotional confrontation on the phone. The dominant stake—Maya's protective bitterness—is directly challenged and dismantled, resulting in a felt cost as she abandons her "fortress of skepticism."

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is strictly theoretical; the opposition (living statues) is set up as a physical threat but converts instantly to the protagonist's cause without struggle. There is no escalation of pressure; Mira plays, the world fixes itself, and the stakes never feel genuinely imperiled. The lack of pushback turns the climax into an inevitable procession rather than a drama.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are clear, but the conflict is resolved through routine competence and technology rather than a difficult choice or sacrifice; the pressure feels managed rather than escalating to a forced trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=4.6)
    Stakes are purely aesthetic and lack urgency; there is no opposing force, scarcity, or time pressure, and the protagonist faces no risk of failure. The absence of a tightening beat or forced trade-off flattens the dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is virtually absent; there are no obstacles, antagonists, or internal doubts that force a narrowing of options. The ritual is performed in a vacuum of pressure, resulting in a low-stakes progression that fails to test the protagonist's commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are legible, but the conflict is purely a puzzle without active opposition or deepening complications. The resolution feels somewhat inevitable, as the protagonist faces no true dilemma that forces a trade-off between values.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.5)
    The central conflict—overcoming the fear/disorientation of the nexus—is resolved almost instantly when the mentor tells Mara, "Don't resist." There is no escalation of pressure; the environment shifts, Mara feels dizzy, is told it's okay, and proceeds. The stakes are stated (vanished sister, dangerous ideas) but not felt in the immediate scene, as safety is guaranteed by the Locksmith.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are established early and escalate well, moving from the loss of artifacts to the erasure of the self. The cost of the resolution—sacrificing the pristine artifact to save the living memory—is a legible and poignant trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes are low and the resolution comes without visible cost; Finn's resistance ("That's garbage") collapses instantly into compliance. The narrative lacks a meaningful tightening of pressure, resulting in a "teaching moment" rather than a dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.7)
    Escalation is weak; the primary antagonist (the wild essence) resists only briefly before surrendering immediately to a song. There is no point where failure feels like a genuine possibility, and the stakes, while globally high, exert little immediate pressure on the protagonist's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=4.5)
    Tension is minimal as the conflict is entirely external to the protagonist, who acts as a tool for the spirit's release rather than a participant in a dilemma. There is no meaningful escalation or narrowing of options; the "resistance" in the knots is overcome immediately without forcing Maren to sacrifice anything or change tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.8)
    Internal pressure escalates cleanly as the anomaly forces a stance crystallization from passive observer to active participant. The external threat of the "curse" remains somewhat abstract, but the intellectual stakes of the discovery are handled with sufficient weight.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.7)
    The dominant stake is clear (the need for closure vs. acceptance), but the pressure remains low-stakes and purely internal. The resolution comes through intellectual processing rather than a forced choice under pressure, limiting the sense of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.7)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no active antagonism or internal resistance, and the "ghost" is entirely cooperative. The absence of a visible or felt cost for the success makes the outcome feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes (promotion/isolation vs. connection) are clear and escalate naturally with the elevator's ascent. The internal conflict is well-defined, though the "opposition" is largely atmospheric rather than an active antagonistic force, which fits the Accumulative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—validating a fringe theory—is clear, though Elena's complete dismissal of the physical danger lowers immediate tension. The escalation is quiet and textural rather than causal, leading to a satisfying but low-stakes emotional resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.8)
    The pressure is coherent, driven by the demolition trucks and the impossible task. The escalation moves from physical attempts (touching the coin) to philosophical resignation, which works well, though the external threat remains largely atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from professional negligence to existential threat, anchored by the shadow of the missing predecessor. The tension is palpable, though the antagonist (Hendrik) remains asleep, keeping the conflict largely internal and intellectual. The deepening of the mystery forces a clear change in stance by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are declared as global (fracturing reality) but remain abstract, lacking immediate on-page pressure or distinct time constraints. The escalation is procedural—fixing three gears in sequence—without a significant reversal or cost that forces a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are declared ("Separately, we're dying") but resolved via narration; the colony's fracturing and subsequent reunification happen in summary without on-page confrontation or trade-offs. The ease of the solution undercuts the stated severity of the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.0)
    The global stakes (human extinction) are high, but the scene-level pressure is low. The protagonist faces no active opposition, difficult trade-off, or risk of failure; the Clock demands movement, and she simply provides it. The tension is primarily atmospheric rather than dramatic, as her success in the "delicate work" is never in genuine doubt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are immediate and lethal, with clear escalation from distant voices to the physical threat of mechanical birds. The pressure remains coherent under the Situational lens, forcing Maren to rely on her specific knowledge to survive, though the travelers serve largely as props.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—Maya's internal rigidity and isolation—is signaled early and escalated effectively by the presence of the urn. The resolution forces a renunciation of her withdrawal with visible cost (engaging with the divergence she feared), though the "symphony" aspect distracts slightly from the core conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—redemption/reset—is clear, but the conflict is minimal. The protagonist (Vera) faces no resistance, and the customer pays no visible price beyond the admission of need. The "tightening" is philosophical rather than tactical, resulting in a low-pressure scene that feels more like a vignette than a drama.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes are established early—the existential threat of rotting remorse subsuming the fortress. Tension escalates appropriately during the descent. However, the resolution feels slightly safe; Maron's victory is secured by his "sturdy boundaries" established in backstory, reducing the sense of immediate peril or sacrifice during the confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=3.8)
    Escalation is negligible; the obstacle is a minor technical sync issue resolved immediately by a single action with no pushback. The lack of opposition or felt cost (the clock keeps working perfectly) renders the stakes theoretical rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.4)
    Pressure is low throughout; the protagonist faces no active opposition, resource scarcity, or risk of failure, only a "calling" to fulfill. The stakes remain abstract ("abandoned dreams") and the climax resolves without a moment where she is forced to sacrifice or trade off anything significant.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes remain abstract (harvesting knowledge) and the environment, while disorienting, never forces a tactical trade-off or risks failure. The "impossible gymnastics" are physical set-dressing rather than an obstacle requiring a change in approach.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=4.8)
    The conflict is static; the antagonist is an abstract condition (silence) that offers no active resistance or counter-move. Maren faces no dilemma that forces a trade-off between values, resulting in a low-tension procedural where success feels inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (the covenant's renewal) is clear, but the interpersonal conflict dissolves too quickly. The daughter—representing the establishment—accepts Kavir's subversive finding without resistance, which lowers the tension. The "meaningful tightening" happens, but the release is immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are clearly defined as relational recovery. The escalation mechanism (tuning through specific memories) builds pressure effectively, and the climax forces a trade-off between satisfying curiosity and honoring the sister's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are declared but not tested in a specific scene; the conflict (smell vs. goal) is resolved through introspective summary rather than a forced trade-off. There is no moment where Mira nearly abandons her goal, making her endurance feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes are declared (Inversion is dangerous) but not felt; Mara navigates the "savage" shifts with "practiced certainty," removing the tension from the central physical conflict. There is no antagonist or complicating coincidence to force a hard choice; the path from the arrow tip to the sphere is a straight line. Escalation is textural (things get weirder) rather than pressure-based (options narrow).

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake (preventing future catastrophe) is clear and scales appropriately, but the conflict remains largely external and procedural. Mara operates with high competence but low personal risk; she is never backed into a corner where she must compromise a value or endure a painful loss to succeed.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.8)
    The scene lacks active opposition or escalation; the cavern "waits" to be unlocked, the ritual succeeds without a hitch, and the antagonist (Council) is defeated by off-screen data, resulting in a flat narrative arc with no tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes are legible, centered on the trade-off between duty and discovery. However, the environment yields too easily to Maren's actions; the absence of external pushback means the escalation relies entirely on the final binary choice rather than rising pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.3)
    The external pressure (dying universe) provides a ticking clock, but the conflict remains largely internal and intellectual (solving a puzzle). The protagonist doesn't face significant opposition or a moment of potential failure that forces a trade-off; she simply applies her skills and succeeds at the task.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.7)
    Stakes are low and theoretical; the threat of "dawn" carries no established penalty, and Kael's deviation from protocol meets immediate approval rather than conflict. The narrative lacks a genuine antagonist or obstacle—everyone is helpful and on the same page. The climax dissolves tension through affirmation rather than testing the protagonist's resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are professional and emotional, escalating appropriately when the personal cost of the theory is revealed. Elena's use of the prism provides necessary agency, transforming the "whorls" into clear "faces," preventing her from being a passive witness to Hartley's confession.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.1)
    The stakes are high (saving a brother vs. self-exile), and the cost is clearly paid on the page. However, the escalation lacks friction; because Mariko’s commitment is absolute from the start, the climax feels like the execution of a procedure rather than a high-pressure choice.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.1)
    Conflict is largely conceptual rather than active; the "council" is a distant strawman, and the magician is an immediate ally rather than a complication. The "mad plan" faces no on-page resistance from the environment or the magic system, making the outcome feel ordained rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes are theoretically high (universal collapse), but the immediate pressure dissolves when Kael simply ends the session to decide later. Without a forced trade-off or an irreversible cost paid within the scene, the dramatic tension remains low despite the declared magnitude of the consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.9)
    The external stakes (Marcus’s collapse) are established, but the escalation is undercut when Vera pauses to write a reflective letter while the keeper is in medical distress. This choice prioritizes thematic symmetry over plausible crisis behavior, acting as a soft reset of tension rather than a tightening of the screw.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are high in concept ("boundary between what was and what must be") but low in execution, as the protagonist faces no active opposition; the storm is a "friend" rather than a threat, removing physical pressure. The ritual succeeds without a moment of doubt or near-failure to test Kael's commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.2)
    Conflict is minimal; the story operates as a "meeting the mentor" scene where the protagonist seeks answers and receives them without struggle. There is no significant escalation or pressure testing Mira’s resolve; the "gravity" of the heart is described but not dramatized as an active obstacle in the scene itself.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=4.2)
    Tension is virtually absent; there is no antagonist, the environment offers no active resistance, and Mara faces no risk of failure. The stakes remain abstract ("maintenance") rather than visceral, and the "deconstruction" proceeds without any tightening of options or deepening of the dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.0)
    Conflict is minimal, as the protagonist faces no active opposition or risk of failure; the escalation is merely an increase in intensity rather than a tightening of options or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes remain abstract; the conflict is resolved by an authority figure delivering the thematic answer, removing the need for the protagonist to make a difficult trade-off. There is no visible cost to the resolution, only a gentle correction of perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.5)
    The conflict between holding on and letting go is escalated effectively through dialogue. The stakes are raised from mere observation to an existential choice about how to handle loss, resolving with a meaningful change in the protagonist’s agency.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=5.7)
    Stakes remain abstract and philosophical; while the internal conflict is clear, the lack of external opposition or time pressure results in a flat escalation curve. The climax is an observational victory rather than a result of the protagonist forcing a difficult trade-off under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are clear (survival, reputation) and the confrontation provides adequate pressure. The escalation is linear, and while the reversal (the recording) is effective, the antagonist folds relatively quickly, reducing the potential for higher tension in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; there is no tangible obstacle to Mira’s goal, nor does Kael provide meaningful opposition to her theory. The stakes are theoretical rather than felt; the "climax" is a show-and-tell moment that resolves a lifetime of trauma with a single explanation and no visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes remain purely internal with low immediate pressure; there is no external obstacle or time constraint forcing a difficult trade-off. The resolution—unleashing creativity—is achieved without a visible risk of failure or tangible cost beyond metaphorical exhaustion.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=4.6)
    Escalation is weak; the protagonist feels "stronger" as she descends, which dissipates tension exactly when it should tighten. The climax is a polite handover of responsibility with no active antagonist or moment of doubt to test the protagonist's commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.4)
    Pressure is low. The central conflict—calibrating the bells—is resolved largely through the passive agency of the melting ice and Mira's immediate acceptance of the result. The lack of a "no" beat or a moment where the experiment fails forces the narrative into a linear path of success without significant felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are clearly internalized as "static" that threatens function, escalating through the sequence of burning items until the core trauma is revealed. The pressure is coherent, and the resolution requires a meaningful trade-off: accepting the pain of the memory (burying it) rather than the relief of erasure (burning it), fulfilling the 9+ requirement for agency and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.9)
    High external stakes (eviction) are declared, but the on-page conflict is low-pressure; the antagonist is an abstract force defeated by finding a hidden object. The protagonist does not have to make a difficult ethical choice or sacrifice a want for a need; the discovery allows them to "win" without paying a price.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.5)
    Immediate scene tension is low; the narrator frequently diffuses potential threats by assuring the reader of Elara's safety and competence. The conflict is abstract (Elara vs. the Regime) rather than concrete (Elara vs. a leak, a glitch, or a specific puzzle), resulting in a flat trajectory without escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are clear and escalate from physical danger (gravity) to existential risk (entering the heart). The pressure remains coherent, driving Maris toward a singular, irreversible choice. The cost—erasure from the present world—is palpable and thematically fitting.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (chaos vs. silence) is clear, and the tightening occurs when the prophecy actively resists suppression. However, because the summoner is highly competent, the on-page struggle feels somewhat one-sided; the victory is never truly in doubt, lowering the immediate dramatic tension slightly despite the high global stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.7)
    The stakes escalate cleanly from a social confrontation about a lie to a supernatural crisis of identity. The reframing of the buildings' language from merely "speaking" to "interrogating" significantly deepens the pressure on Elena to act.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are clearly established via the envelope (independence vs. control) and escalated by the approaching dawn. The conflict is primarily internal but externalized effectively through the shell and the letter, forcing a definitive stance.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.2)
    While the initial stakes (execution) are high, the tension deflates early when Mei correctly predicts the Magistrate's mercy, removing the sense of immediate danger. The conflict resolves through swift agreement rather than a battle of wills, reducing the dramatic pressure of the scene. The "unfinished work" creates a conceptual bridge, but the emotional cost of the confrontation is low.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.9)
    Conflict is largely internal and lacks external pressure; the canyon does not resist Mara, and the shell yields its secrets readily. The stakes are felt (legacy/memory), but the escalation is low-resistance—she simply descends deeper and listens. The final cost—a hoarse voice—is relatively minor compared to the thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.5)
    Escalation is linear and cooperative; the protagonist faces little opposition from the ghost or environment, resulting in a low-friction resolution where the "ache" is stated rather than felt as resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=4.0)
    Pressure is negligible; the apprentice offers no resistance to the lesson, and Kenji risks nothing in teaching it. There is no escalation of stakes, merely a smooth transition from ignorance to understanding without struggle or the possibility of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.5)
    The stakes are clear (truth vs. hope), but the escalation is dampened by the ease of discovery and the swiftness of the resolution. The protagonist faces little external opposition, and the internal cost of compromising her life's work is stated rather than dramatized through difficult hesitation or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are declared but not tested; with no on-page antagonist or genuine hesitation from Elara, the narrative lacks escalation and reads as the inevitable fulfillment of a wish rather than a conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is the primary weakness; the stakes are abstract ("cultural memory") and the obstacles (a stuck mechanism, social isolation) are overcome via summary or immediate success. The protagonist faces no significant opposition or moment of doubt, making the "redemption" feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are clearly established early and escalate with the arrival of the antagonist. The cost is felt—Meris binding her physical rhythm to the lock—though the antagonist remains a faceless device to force the timing.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.8)
    Pressure is low and static; the opposing force (tradition) is abstract and off-page, leaving only the cold as an immediate obstacle. The "revolution" feels safe because no distinct moment of risk or potential failure tests Ren's conviction during the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are immediate and high, escalated efficiently by Reeves’s intrusion via radio. The pressure forces a crystallization of Elena’s stance, transforming a routine inspection into a life-altering confrontation with corruption.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.8)
    The conflict is primarily internal and resolved by a low-cost shift in perspective rather than a hard decision; the price paid is merely the admission of past error. The stakes are clear, but the resolution feels smoothed over by the grandfather's external authority, reducing the protagonist's agency in the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.7)
    The stakes are primarily internal and philosophical, lacking a concrete external antagonist or time pressure to heighten the "impossible" task. The breakthrough arrives via intuition and the convenient placement of the arrow tip, making the escalation feel smooth rather than earned through high-cost struggle or forced trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.1)
    The stakes are high (existential transformation), but the escalation lacks friction; the obstacles (like the encryption) yield voluntarily, removing the pressure required to test the protagonist's commitment. The story moves from mystery to resolution without a moment of genuine doubt or jeopardy to earn the final transcendence.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stakes are stated as life-or-death (feuding families), but the on-page pressure is low; the scene is contemplative and safe. The conflict is resolved through magical observation rather than an escalation of agency or a confrontation with the "shadows" that supposedly lace her.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.7)
    While the stakes are existential (life vs. death), the external pressure is low; the doctor serves as a gentle mentor rather than a source of friction. The resolution comes through steady accumulation of insight rather than a sharp escalation of cost, reducing narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.0)
    Pressure is low; the conflict is retrospective and lacks an active, shifting power dynamic in the present. The resolution comes too easily through mutual agreement rather than a costly trade-off or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict is abstract (entropy vs. preservation) rather than dramatic. Senna faces no active opposition or significant obstacles; the ritual succeeds exactly as intended with minimal struggle, keeping the narrative tension quite low throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.0)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the stated "skepticism" of the townspeople is mentioned but never dramatized, as they comply immediately with the exercise. There is no escalation of pressure, no risk of failure, and no moment where Margot must adapt her tactics, leading to a story without narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes are high conceptually, and the looming Council testimony provides adequate pressure. However, because the antagonist is entirely off-page/anticipatory, the conflict remains internal and low-heat; the protagonist convinces herself without facing direct on-page opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.8)
    Tension is effectively internalized and projected onto the physical task of writing before the memory slips. The escalation is textual and tactile—handwriting getting smaller, chalk crumbling—which fits the Accumulative drive lens perfectly. While the external opposition is ambient (time/fog), the internal pressure to capture the ephemeral is acute and drives the scene to a distinct peak.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are clearly established—the tension between human measurements and cosmic reality drives the scene. The climax offers a meaningful deepening of the conflict rather than a simple solution, shifting the goal from "repair" to "witness," which carries a palpable emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the stakes are high (death/reconciliation), the conflict dissolves without struggle; the daughter's "guarded" stance vanishes instantly upon seeing the props. The lack of resistance in the climax robs the resolution of earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.5)
    The stakes are high (restoring reality), but the on-page pressure is low. The conflict is purely intellectual and mechanical; Mira faces no active opposition or risk of failure, resulting in a linear escalation without sharp reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.0)
    The stakes are intensely personal and clearly established: the possibility of retrieving her lost daughter versus the safety of her skepticism. The escalation provided by the physical evidence of the tooth forces a confrontation with her past denial. While the external pressure (magic breaking down) is delivered through exposition, the emotional pressure on Marianne is immediate and palpable. The cost of the choice—abandoning her "comfortable prison" of certainty—is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.9)
    Pressure is minimal; the "conflict" is entirely in the past, and the present action (polishing) faces no resistance or risk of failure. The beat where the glass is "not bright enough yet" is resolved immediately with a tool change, offering no true escalation. The stakes remain abstract and low throughout the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.2)
    Tension evaporates instantly upon the notebook's reveal, turning a potential confrontation into immediate comfort. The stakes of the "viral storm" and the severed relationship are bypassed by a plot device that recasts the protagonist's betrayal as a secret virtue.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.1)
    Stakes are purely internal and professional (finishing a book), lacking immediate external pressure or risk to the protagonist herself. The escalation is observational—she watches figures appear without facing resistance or forced trade-offs—making the final decision feel like a safe, contemplative resolution rather than a forged necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.0)
    Conflict is virtually absent; nature cooperates perfectly, the machine functions without error, and the protagonist faces no moment of hesitation. There is no escalation of pressure, only a smooth procession toward a foregone conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=4.8)
    Tension is low; the protagonist faces no active opposition, and the stakes (mapping longing) remain abstract without a moment of jeopardy. The "cost" is described as a meditative state rather than a felt sacrifice, resulting in a lack of narrative tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are low and theoretical; while the “wounded season” suggests danger, Marcus faces no on-page threat or trade-off for his obsession. The conflict with the survivors is summarized (“thought him mad”) rather than dramatized, resulting in a climax without felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central tension—the weaver's inability to stop patterns from multiplying—is resolved clearly. However, the middle section relies on a list of burdens ("First came... Then came...") which flattens the escalation slightly compared to a more dramatized struggle with a specific weight.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are internal but clearly felt, defined by the tension between preserving the past (Roland's way) and inhabiting the present (Margot's way). The pressure escalates coherently through the irreversible cuts of the knife, leading to a tangible cost in the wood.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.5)
    Tension builds spatially with the approaching ghost, but the climax relies on information delivery ("You were never meant to go back") rather than an active test of the protagonist's will. The central conflict is resolved through passive agreement, softening the impact of the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.9)
    The stakes remain largely intellectual and thematic rather than visceral. While the density of the discovery escalates, the personal pressure on Lena is low; she risks little on the page beyond a potential rejection. The conflict is "Man vs. Entropy" executed quietly, missing a moment of sharp, immediate jeopardy or sacrifice to drive the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.0)
    The internal stakes are high and clearly defined (security vs. fulfillment), escalating cleanly through the unpacking of the secret sketchbook. The resolution confronts the fear of failure directly, resulting in a tangible change in tactics (resignation letter to apprenticeship).

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake of uncovering the truth is clear, but the escalation is low-pressure; the protagonist encounters no significant opposition or reversal, resulting in a smooth path to discovery without a spiked cost.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.8)
    Pressure is primarily atmospheric (cold, fog) rather than agent-driven or situational. The stakes—loss of knowledge—are abstract, and while the discovery deepens the theme, Mira faces no significant obstacle, trade-off, or risk of failure during the decoding process; success feels inevitable from the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.4)
    Conflict is low; Maren enters without barriers and the Duchess offers only expository explanation rather than active opposition to the intrusion. The lack of escalation or a "refusal" beat before the resolution makes the stakes feel lower than the premise suggests.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.3)
    The ticking clock of the excavation machines adds necessary pressure, and the stakes of losing the egg are clear. However, the resolution relies slightly on the egg cracking "not from external force" but from within, which reduces the direct causal impact of the protagonists' agency in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is minimal; Elena offers only token verbal resistance before accepting Maya's lesson. There is no meaningful tightening of stakes or visible cost to the protagonist; the outcome feels predetermined from the start.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.7)
    Pressure is low throughout; the "pause" of the geese implies a clock, but it generates no urgent on-page constraint. The protagonist faces no significant opposition or cost—the box opens simply by following the pattern, making the climax feel procedural rather than high-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=4.2)
    Tension evaporates immediately upon the Keeper's arrival, as the solution (magic repair) requires no sacrifice, ingenuity, or difficult choice from either party. The stakes are nominally life-and-death but are resolved by omnipotence, creating a flat dramatic arc with no visible cost to the savior or the saved.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is minimal; the obstacle is a lack of understanding that is immediately resolved by the ghost's explanation. There is no significant resistance, antagonist, or cost to the protagonist's acquisition of wisdom; she simply accepts the lesson. The stakes remain intellectual and abstract without a concrete test of the protagonist's resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are clearly established: the town's reliance on the clock versus Maren's personal burden. The escalation is internal but felt—moving from wood to brass raises the difficulty and the symbolic stakes. The resolution avoids external confrontation, which slightly lowers the voltage, but the internal shift is decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.6)
    While there is internal intellectual pressure to solve the puzzle, the scene lacks immediate external stakes or urgency; Marta has ample time and safety to work. The chess clock metaphor frames the tension nicely, but the actual investigation proceeds without significant obstacles or active resistance, limiting the narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.2)
    The stakes are high conceptually (societal collapse), but the on-page tension is low. The antagonist (predictive models flagging prose) is abstract, and Maren overcomes it with persistent effort rather than a sacrifice or tactical pivot that forces a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.2)
    Conflict is largely abstract; the "authorities" are mentioned but absent, and the dust yields its secret immediately upon contact. The stakes are high conceptually (saving stories) but low personally, as Elena faces no immediate threat, trade-off, or cost for her revolutionary action.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.7)
    The stakes are clear but primarily intellectual, centering on the loss of a comforting illusion. Pressure is consistent, though the conflict remains largely internal and philosophical without a sharp external test of Elena's new resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.9)
    The stakes (erasure of history) are high and clear, and the pressure tightens appropriately with Karin's news. However, the conflict remains largely intellectual and polite; while fitting for the tone, it lacks the visceral friction of a harder-fought negotiation.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=4.2)
    While the stakes (community fragmentation) are high in theory, they are low in practice because the opposition (hatred/prejudice) offers no resistance to Mrs. Chen's intervention. The conflict is resolved via a montage-like summary of harmonization, stripping the climax of tension and the resolution of earned value.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=4.3)
    Escalation is mostly summarized; the antagonist (the authorities) remains abstract and is defeated by the "cannot arrest everyone" logic without exerting pressure on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.4)
    Pressure is low throughout; the conflict is largely retrospective (Chen's past mistake) rather than an active struggle in the present. The stakes are global (the city) but the immediate scene lacks interpersonal friction or escalating danger.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes are theoretical; there is almost no opposition or friction. Mara wants to wake the house, performs the ritual without obstacle, and succeeds immediately. The lack of a visible price or risk keeps the narrative tension flat.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.9)
    The historical stakes escalate beautifully from accident to calculated sacrifice, deepening the narrative pressure. However, the immediate physical threat (the oxygen gauge) runs parallel to the choice rather than forcing a difficult trade-off; she decides to tell the truth and simply ascends, leaving the potential cost of that decision conceptual rather than felt in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are clearly defined: personal validation versus the risk of fundamental physical rupture. The pressure escalates coherently from the passive climbing to the active choice of stepping into the void. This physical enactment of "dynamic instability" satisfyingly creates the courage for the final real-world risk.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.5)
    The conflict is primarily internal (insomnia/despair vs. hope) and atmospheric. While the pressure accumulates well through the visions, the external antagonist (the authorities/smog) remains abstract and distant, never forcing a hard tactical trade-off on the page. The stakes are felt emotionally but lack a sharp, decisive tightening of options.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clearly established via dwindling supplies and the trapped city. The escalation works, though the resolution feels slightly low-cost physically; the opposition of the ice is overcome more by a shift in perspective than by a grueling trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.3)
    The conflict between predetermined fate and individual agency is well-escalated through the mechanics of the yoyo and the approaching tide. The pressure builds coherently as the "membrane" thins, forcing a stance crystallization at the climax. The stakes are high (existence vs. non-existence) and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.9)
    The antagonist (fear) collapses instantly upon confrontation, offering no meaningful resistance or escalation. The conflict lacks a tightening of options; the solution is presented and immediately works, rendering the victory significantly lower-stakes than the setup promised.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.5)
    Pressure escalates clearly via the approaching vortex and the fractal cloud formation. However, the protagonist's agency is effectively "being right" without a personal price; the solution (adjusting ballast) feels mechanical, lacking a moment where the outcome is truly in doubt or requires a painful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes are globally high (city survival), and the widening crack provides a functional ticking clock, but the conflict remains largely Man vs. Nature/Environment. Without an active antagonist or immediate obstacle in the scene, the pressure relies heavily on internal realization until the final external confirmation.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=4.1)
    Escalation is negligible; the antagonist folds without exerting pressure or demanding a price. The protagonist succeeds through a brief speech, resulting in a conflict that feels performative rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (memory vs. erasure) is clear and escalates from a general mission to a specific burden with the discovery of the letters. While the external pressure is largely environmental (the tide), the internal deepening at the end—accepting the weight of the "unsent"—provides a satisfying, if subtle, tightening of the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake (historical truth) is clear, but the immediate pressure is low; the storm provides background texture rather than forcing difficult trade-offs. The protagonist faces a puzzle rather than a dilemma, and the decision to preserve the truth feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle against an opposing force or fear.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake (Lin's restoration) is clear, and the countdown of the cranes provides a tangible measure of the protagonist's burden. The pressure is coherent and accumulative, tightening as Mei confronts the vastness of the task against the fragility of the memory. The cost is felt in the sacrifice of her possessions and the grueling physical repetition of the folds.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.0)
    Conflict is minimal; the stakes are purely internal and abstract, with no external pressure forcing a difficult choice. The discovery of the anomaly feels inevitable and convenient, lacking the escalation or cost required to give the "hunt" narrative weight.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=2.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the protagonist faces no antagonist, internal doubt, or resource scarcity. The ancient technology functions instantly on the first try, and the "search for belonging" is resolved by simply being given the answer. There is no escalation of pressure or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.5)
    The central conflict is resolved with minimal on-page struggle; Mara accepts the judgment immediately, and Elias merely delivers a statement and departs. The lack of active push-and-pull or escalating tactics in the dialogue makes the climax feel static.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.1)
    The central conflict is external and diffused too easily; the commander's distrust is resolved by a metaphor rather than a concession or tactical trade-off. The stakes feel theoretical because the protagonist's control over the scene is never genuinely threatened.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes are clearly established, but the escalation relies largely on Amy's verbal persuasion and shared trauma rather than escalating situational obstacles. The "weather turning" adds nominal urgency but does not force a difficult trade-off or tactical pivot on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes are clearly signaled (identity/redemption), but the escalation is conversational rather than dramatic. The pressure comes entirely from the Interpreter's exposition, lacking a tightening of options through action until the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.1)
    The stakes are high and clearly defined: the trade-off between humanity and connection is palpable. The escalation leads naturally to the irreversible choice at the climax, though the obstacle is internal fear rather than external antagonism, which works well for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clearly established as a battle between professional identity (the cartomancer) and personal duty (the mother). The escalation moves effectively from memory (mother) to present neglect (daughter) to the crystallization of loss (the saucer). The conflict resolves through agency, though the "time ghosts" remain an internal rather than external antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.0)
    While the existential stakes are high, the on-page conflict is low-voltage; Akio's resistance evaporates instantly, removing the pressure required for a high-band score. The escalation relies on the machinery working as intended rather than a meaningful tightening of options or human cost.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the external obstacle (the lost surveyor) is resolved instantly via intuition, offering no resistance to force a difficult choice or trade-off. There is no meaningful tightening of stakes; the protagonist moves from serenity to epiphany without facing a concrete test of her values.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.0)
    The scene lacks immediate pressure; the potential tension of the blackout is instantly defused by Voss's arrival and the revelation that they control the timing. With no active opposition or risk of failure shown on the page, the stakes remain theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.0)
    The stakes are high (the fate of the universe), but the immediate narrative pressure is low because the protagonist knows the outcome "three moves ahead" via her curse. The conflict lacks a moment of genuine doubt or potential failure; the ritual proceeds smoothly to its foretold conclusion without forcing a hard trade-off until the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are clearly defined (erasure vs. testimony), and the timer creates effective micro-pressure within the scene. The conflict remains largely internal and atmospheric, which fits the scope, though it lacks a sharp, immediate external test.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.9)
    The initial tension is established well with the drawn rapier, but the pressure dissipates rather than escalates. The conflict resolution relies on Harwick's sudden compliance, removing the element of risk too early. While the shift from violence to inquiry is the point, the lack of a tangible cost or harder choice for the protagonist limits the dramatic impact.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.3)
    The conflict is primarily internal and thematic (beauty vs. entropy, memory vs. oblivion), which fits the scope well. While external pressure is low, the ticking clock of the protagonist's shifting identity adds necessary weight to the decision to plant the seeds now. The cost is felt rather than physical—the accepted loss of the memory of this specific joy.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=5.9)
    The story lacks significant opposition; the environment and the "temporal distortions" ultimately aid the protagonist rather than pressuring her. The station master offers only a whisper, not an obstacle, and the climax arrives without a moment of doubt or difficult trade-off. The escalation is linear and low-stakes in execution, as the universe seems to conspire in her favor.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.2)
    The ticking clock of the monsoon creates effective external pressure that forces a decision. The stakes—cultural extinction versus false hope—are clearly defined and high. While the escalation is steady, the resolution leans on the "hum" to resolve the tension, which functions as a slight safety net rather than forcing Kima to sit in the discomfort of unverified faith.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=4.9)
    Stakes are purely internal and historical, lacking immediate on-page pressure or risk. There is no obstacle to Mira receiving the information; Takeo gives it freely. Without a moment where the outcome is in doubt or a price is paid, the dramatic tension remains flat.

Agency resides in every act of reordering; no coincidence resolves the core conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—community survival without loss of dignity—tightens when anonymity threatens cultural continuity. One meaningful escalation: Mara chooses exposure, narrowing her own options and forcing communal ownership of the risk. Cost is visible in the instant the bell is publicly raised; the price of her visibility is irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“where did my unspoken love go?”—is declared early; pressure escalates texturally via accumulating gold threads revealed through breathing/ lens. Agency is contemplative: her steady exhale and eventual relinquishment tighten the meaning rather than options. Cost is conceptual (she gives away the inherited tear) rather than visceral; a sharper tangible loss would deepen the punch. Coincidence is absent; the pilgrim appears as mythic catalyst, not resolver.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“map time or be un-mapped by it”—is signaled in first paragraph and tightens when photos begin irreversible unfold. Agency is present at every increment: she chooses to touch, to surrender, to re-slot the fragment. Felt price is the evaporating mazes; option set narrows to eternal recurrence inside the living lattice. One escalate could be sharper: the moment she realizes escape is impossible is implied, not dramatized, muting peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—liberate truth and living seed—signals early and escalates as each decoded key forecloses wrong paths. Agency drives every turn: decoding, freeing herself, choosing planting over celebration. Visible price: she swaps immediate safety for exposure while planting in exposed wasteland. Escalation is coherent but single-cycle; no secondary reversal, yet the final planting deepens the cost under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recover vs. relinquish the sound of trust-breaking—tightens once: capture succeeds, then destruction becomes the only agency left. The tightening is meaningful (knowledge gained, options narrowed) and driven by protagonist choice under accumulative pressure. Cost is visible—tears freeze, crystal lost, possible daughter ripple—yet the price could be even sharper had the daughter’s silence received an on-page counter-beat. Still, escalation coheres under the inferred lens without coincidence resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—will Maya keep stealing or accept being seen?—tightens once the moonbeams reveal her own image. The reversal is internal but visible: she sets the jar down, renouncing possession for creation. Cost is the loss of familiar identity; escalation is the narrowing of options from thief to artist. A second tightening beat would lift the score another notch.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—risk of perpetual silence with sister—signaled early via bookmark memory. Pressure escalates through glass-rotation metaphor: each circuit = accumulated regret; one decisive tightening when he pockets bookmark, accepting vulnerability cost. No external antagonist needed; internal conflict suffices for 700 wds. Price paid = abandonment of solitary sanctuary, legible on page.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes sharpen when Reeves’s phone call reframes betrayal; Maya’s decision to betray Reeves in turn costs her any chance of maternal repair—price is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—how to navigate after the last star—signals in sentence two and tightens through three silences that foreclose speech as a tactic. The oracle’s agency is narrative rather than physical; her retelling-by-silence forces the commander’s stance crystallization without offering new external options. Cost is conceptual (navigation through nothing) rather than visceral, capping eligible high-band entry at 8.4.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake: can a machine locate the origin of its own thought before decommission? Escalation is textural—each loop thickens the pattern until the violin translates code into sound, forcing recognition that origin is distributed, not locatable. Protagonist agency is attention and iteration; no external antagonist, only recursive pressure. Cost: eternal looping without final answer—he will keep sweeping the same frost forever, now knowingly.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—will Mira keep listening from safety or step into reciprocal risk—surfaces early and tightens once: the ticket she draws is a visible forfeiture of her anonymity. Pressure is textural: each overheard sentence and refracted doodle adds weight rather than new turns; the lens’s heaviest moment is sufficient escalation. Cost is legible: the loss of her invisibility cloak (she can no longer claim accidental ignorance). No coincidence resolves; the final hand-taking is agency-based.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can identity be quantified?—is signaled in line 1 and tightened when the maze physically sides with the vine-dresser. Agency is observational (Marcus) and ritual (her polishing); both foreclose the Institute’s authority without reversing it. Cost: the garden’s simultaneous life/death state becomes irreversible, a living refutation. No off-stage luck; the maze’s betrayal is the on-page reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—proving temporal anomaly—tightens once: the hologram’s lateral cascade forecloses skepticism and visible cost is paid when Kael’s undocumented months of tracking are finally vindicated in front of Venn. Escalation is knowledge-based under Causal lens; no reversals needed. Cost is legible in the final smile that accepts continued obscurity despite discovery. Sufficient for band but lacks a persistent tactical constraint beyond social role.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—justice for Constance—is signaled by the second paragraph and tightens when Moretti’s name surfaces. Marta’s agency drives every beat: play-note, photograph, stage-placement; no coincidence resolves. Cost is visible: she stands in soaked clothes, publicly risks ridicule tomorrow, and accepts the ghost’s charge. One tightening is sufficient; no escalation slip.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: prevent another Reeves-scale death by forcing the oracle to admit doubt. Escalation is cognitive—each scrolled log raises the stakes by revealing how close the truth came to speech. The tightening beat is the rewrite itself: Mira narrows her own future options, replacing decisive forecasts with perpetual hedging. Cost is visible: the first forecast she receives is the one that would have saved Reeves, now arriving too late—an emotional price paid on-screen.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“find the weight of swallowed truth”—is signaled early and tightens with each new caller confession. Turning the final valve is the decisive, irreversible act that converts ambient guilt into audible release, narrowing Marcus’s options from observer to accomplice-catalyst. Cost is conceptual but legible: the ghost shift clocks out, yet Marcus must carry the knowledge that private griefs were mined for his private quest. No coincidence; escalation is purely accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake: witness vs. preservation. Tightening occurs when the origami swan rewrites the quest—burrow, don’t catalogue—narrowing options to dissolution. Cost is the loss of taxonomic language itself, felt in the final smile. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes; one deepening suffices but keeps the score sub-8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single dominant stake: can Thomas speak before totality ends? Pressure tightens once, when the moon’s shadow crosses the sun and his hum becomes audible; that sonic threshold forecloses the option of eternal silence. Cost is legible: Mara must risk musical trespass, Thomas must risk audible exposure. No coincidence; eclipse is external clock that demands internal surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“preserve unheard stories”—is signaled early and deepens through the diary-tapestry axis; micro-turn tightens options when Miren commits wall-space. Cost (perpetual, possibly fruitless labor) is implied but not viscerally felt on-page; hence capped below 8.8. Accumulative escalation sufficient under lens.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—move the microdot without leaving the lighthouse—emerges by line 60 and tightens once: beam = courier. No reversals needed; the ingenuity is using routine (weekly cookie batch) as dead-drop, raising cost of exposure if customs sniffs UV paste. Agency is continuous: writing, sealing, scheduling shipments, decoding blink-reply—all on-page. Price is conceptual—her father’s “stone” fate accepted—but still palpable in the eternal watch she embraces.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—Marcus’s survival—arrives early and tightens through the visible countdown of possession. Pressure escalates via accumulative density: loops, breath, cobalt marks layer until assumption undercuts entity. Yet the tightening is entirely external to Calloway; he risks no loss of tool, status, or belief, so the cost feels lopsided. Without a trade-off or moment where his method nearly fails, the beat registers as competent pattern-build rather than high-stakes crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake: restore meaning to her vocation. Pressure escalates texturally—each recalled star-song layer intensifies the ache until the mirrored horizon offers the pattern break. No external antagonist; the risk is lifelong emptiness, a high conceptual cost made visceral through sensory accumulation. Agency is present (she chooses transcription, descends to re-enter the world) but physical stakes stay mild; hence short of 8+ bands where a sharper forfeiture would be required.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—reintegrate fractured selves—signals early and tightens when rune-map forces choice of harder paths. Escalation is textural: each retrace adds density until “gravity reasserted its claim.” Cost is visible: loss of omnipresence, return of physical ache. Agency sits in choosing grief not avoided; coincidence never resolves. One meaningful intensification suffices, and it lands.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—defeat emotional numbness—tightens when reversed recordings create “filaments of hush” that force students to feel silence. One decisive intensification: Marie’s “I can hear the spaces between the beats” proves the method works, foreclosing conventional sound-based teaching. Cost is visible: Oskar trades hearing-centric music for silence-architecture, a loss that charges the final drum stroke.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—preserve truthful record versus join exposed resistance—tightens once: the woman’s offer is refused, cost is the solitary pen continuing in gathering darkness. Escalation is causal under lens: each revelation (tube, uniform, satchel) narrows Marianne’s options from passive curiosity to active complicity in silence. No coincidence; pressure grows lateral, geometric. Price is legible: she forfeits community for integrity, ink replacing voice.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—can Maren recover a dimension of grief the plague erased—tightens when the ultraviolet reveal offers a one-time glimpse, forcing a stance crystallization. The deepening is textural: each extinct plant and color ribbon increases the density of irretrievability until the final fade makes the cost legible. Agency is renunciation: she corks the light-scent, knowingly choosing memory over continued access. Cost is the irrevocable substitution of visible for smelled love, felt as the colors wink out.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—how to witness transformation without fleeing it—tightens when each temporal layer read from the rope forecloses Marcus’s neutral observer stance. One meaningful escalation: the mandala’s completion forces the choice to leave it behind, paying the visible cost of forfeiting physical proof. Pressure is textural: density of time-fibers, not external antagonist. Cost is legible in the final image—“glowing faintly” proves the forfeiture is real.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.3)
    Dominant stake—“reclaim beauty from silence”—is clear, yet pressure stays atmospheric; no external or relational force threatens the concert. Escalation is textural: hush “retreats slightly” as fragments accumulate; no option is foreclosed for Maya. The chronic hush is the antagonist, but it neither narrows her choices nor demands adaptation beyond playing on. Cost is global (burnt world) rather than personal, so agency feels low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—Therese’s need for faux-forgiveness—arrives early and tightens once when Mara decides to tweak rather than fabricate. The revision narrows Mara’s own moral options, a visible price that alters tactics. Pressure is coherent but single-cycle; no further escalation or material loss occurs. Sufficient for this length, yet lacks a second notch that could foreclose a live alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—Marianne’s expansion of value from profit to recognition—is signaled early and tightens once: the decision to photograph the lighthouse keeper narrows her remaining free nights and commits her publicly. Pressure is textural: each new story added to the foyer display increases the social density of gratitude, forcing her either to keep scaling or to admit the project matters. No visible price (money, reputation, lost deal) is dramatized; the cost is opportunity-only, weakening the punch. Escalation is coherent under Accumulative lens but stops at gentle deepening rather than a trade-off that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—belonging vs. self-erasure—is signaled early and tightens through each discovered tag; the seventh-day sculpture is the decisive escalation that forecloses outsider distance. Agency is continuous: Kael acts (etches, teaches, weaves) rather than waits. Cost is visible—her tears, the risk of exposure—but could be sharper if one relationship tangibly rejected her earlier. Still, the final image reweights options under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—find where echoes are born—tightens when she realizes the echo is caged by her own borrowed time, forcing the uncage choice. Escalation is single but meaningful: compressing/stretching time first aids observation, then threatens to trap the phenomenon, narrowing her options to release or keep caged. Cost is visible: pendant glows, giant stirs, temporal scar admitted. Agency is hers; coincidence only complicates (bird sings). No secondary reversal, sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can ambiguous loss be lived with instead of solved—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightened when the double vision offers reunion yet she refuses to call out, crystallizing the cost of permanent uncertainty. Escalation is textural: silence thickens, moonlight intensifies, blossoms open in wrong season—each accumulates pressure without external antagonist. Agency is expressed through attention: she chooses to keep calculating rather than chase the figure, a renunciation that forecloses immediate reunion. Price is visible: the warmed glass eyes she must pocket, knowing they will never blink back.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—transferring private found voices into public memory—tightens once: the first anonymous box delivery nullifies her hoarding option. Under accumulative lens, each subsequent donation deepens pattern rather than narrows options, but the conceptual price (she can never claim credit) accumulates legibly. No coincidence resolves tension; escalation is steady pattern-completion. Sufficient for this length, though a mid-story obstacle (risk of exposure while depositing tapes) would have sharpened cost.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: will Maya keep trying to master growth or surrender to its mystery? Escalation is textural: each storm layers evidence that control fails—first terrifies, then teaches. The third storm (closure) forces the crystallizing gesture: release of the leaf, forfeiting data for participation. Cost is visible—she abandons the pressed-leaf archive and embraces unpredictable storms. Agency remains hers: she chooses observation over intervention, narrowing future options to responsive partnership rather than mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—extract meaning from chaos—arrives early; pressure tightens when rain trails keep delivering artifacts instead of answers. No antagonist; tension is epistemological. The single meaningful deepening occurs in the cave where handprints collapse time, forcing acceptance of cyclical rather than transcendent meaning. Cost is conceptual (mysticism lost) rather than tactical, but legible under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single dominant stake—control vs. surrender of wonder—tightens when the pearl shows void instead of futures; protagonist agency drives the turn (she asks to be stripped of sight), and the cost (perceptual blackout) is legible in the final sensory reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—how to survive being the rememberer—tightens once: the returned herald appears, forcing Marina to decide whether to keep or release her hoard. The cost is the emotional exposure of handing over the valve, acknowledging seventeen years spent in absence. Under the Accumulative lens the pressure is coherent: each catalogued fragment increases the weight until discharge is inevitable. A more explicit forfeiture (e.g., an offered archive key, or Thomas refusing part of the collection) would have pushed this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“map the hidden city or stay safely surface”—is signaled early. Tightening occurs when the conductor punch validates passage and the fortress wall reveals Mara’s own suppressed truth, foreclosing denial. Cost is legible: she must now map truths that will “unmake” her prior lie-built life. Agency is continuous—each step deeper is a choice to keep following arrows.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—guardianship of an imperceptible ecological knowledge—tightens when the tile’s glow forces a choice: dismiss or inherit. Escalation is textural: memory layers accumulate until Elena’s stance crystallizes; no external antagonist needed. Cost is visible—tears mark the emotional price of accepting non-empirical epistemology. Agency is internal endurance; she renounces prior methodological purity, foreclosing return to university skepticism.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can Naia achieve a true death and can Cassius bear final unknowability—is signaled early and tightens once: when she sinks the fragment into her sternum, the option to stop her is foreclosed. Pressure escalates under Causal lens: storm peaks → dimensions refuse alignment → gap opens → she steps; Cassius’s last decision is a direct cost of that narrowing. Price is visible—her body unravels, his future is solitary plotting—but the beat is single-turn; a second complication or forfeiture mid-scene would have pushed higher.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—Mara’s first act of whistle-blowing—signalled by word 40. Escalation: pot spotted → evidence gathered → widow briefed → confrontation → irreversible exposure. The tightening choice (dialing Jacobson) narrows Vincent’s options to surrender or arrest; cost shifts from moral abstraction to paternal sobs on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—collecting tactile time-textures—is signaled early and tightens once: the honest oak forces her to choose between documentary truth and her gilded vocation. The pressure is textural rather than causal; cost is conceptual (she embraces falsity) but not viscerally felt on the page. Sufficient for this length, but the absence of a tangible forfeiture keeps it below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—how to exist when officially erased—tightens once: poison label forces shift from passive collection to active reconstruction of erased neighborhood. Escalation is textural: each overheard fragment adds palimpsest pressure until the notebook becomes too heavy to keep. Cost is visible—she surrenders the archive, accepting bureaucratic re-entry she earlier refused. No coincidence resolves; the harbormaster’s arrival is prepared by shared surname and rose memory.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—decode or dismiss the “universal riddle”—tightens when each bow-stroke forces a live trade-off: cling to empirical pride or accept felt truth. Agency resides in deciding to keep playing despite cognitive dissonance; cost is the forever-unfinished cello and unclosed argument. One meaningful deepening: the shell’s hum stops being error and becomes evidence. Pressure accretes note-by-note under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves it.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—cultural survival versus sanitized “stability”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when artisanal coffee floats displace fish stalls. One meaningful escalation: graffiti code shifts from heritage lesson to insurgent tactic, foreclosing passive nostalgia. Cost is visible in sleepless boutiques and Marina’s pocket-weight; options narrow to perpetual motion or surrender. No coincidence rescues; the developers are stalled by collective action she orchestrated.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—preserve final living image—tightens once: from detached documentation to sacrificial witness. The irreversible demolition clock provides coherent external pressure; internal pressure spikes when inscription reframes his role. Cost is visible in the extinction of flowers and the sand grain’s surrender to dust. Could use one intermediate complication (tool failure?) to push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—”fix it before we launch”—tightens once, no slack. Escalation is micro but decisive: the horn’s second blast shifts from ambient to countdown, forcing the patch under time cost. Agency is entirely hers; no coincidence rescues. The price (she absorbs the risk of failure, the loneliness of another completed farewell) is legible in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—“will the town remember its heartbeat?”—tightens via density of footfall resonance; option to remain ghosted is foreclosed when crack seals. Escalation is accumulative: each walked beat adds harmonic mass; no reversal, but decisive deepening. Cost is felt in the communal labor of endless rhythm, though individual price stays abstract. Sufficient for 600-word window.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—addiction to preserved emotion versus survival—tightens once but decisively when oxygen alarm screams while vial warmth seduces. Agency sits with Mara: each refusal to re-touch the crystal narrows tactical options under causal pressure. Cost is visible: Chen’s blue lips and her own “fingers linger” show price paid. No escalation loop; single meaningful intensification suffices for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—validate father’s truth before the wing is sealed—is signaled in the warden’s first line and tightens with each impossible space discovered. The meaningful turn comes when Matthias realizes the men are not escaping but transforming; this forecloses any simple rescue plan and forces his own ontological wager. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable: eternal exile from consensual reality.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—free the ghost or remain cursed—is signaled immediately. One meaningful tightening: bead’s hum escalates from curiosity to unavoidable choice once Eleanora appears. Cost is visible—the heirloom lost, night becomes day, family debt erased. Agency is Marcus’s kneeling burial; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—restore vs. abandon ancestral ground—tightens once: discovery of tomb + sundial inscription converts vague pilgrimage into explicit custodial contract. Price is legible: weeks of labor, nights emerging “with dirt still under fingernails,” and final acceptance of lifelong rootedness. Agency is present but diffuse; the decisive “I will stay” is summarized, not dramatized under fresh pressure, muting the final turn’s snap. Still, the accumulated weight of roots-through-bones imagery makes refusal of exile feel inevitable rather than coincidental.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: possibility of filial reconnection vs. total exposure. Pressure tightens once: after the final code check, the only live option is drop or retreat; tactile brass slot makes the cost visceral. Escalation is textural—sunlight and smog intensify alongside internal danger—rather than causal-reversal, fitting the chosen lens. No external antagonist needed; surveillance state remains off-page menace that forces medium choice.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve truthful star charts—surfaces by paragraph 3 and intensifies when she realizes the Vault, not the barracks, is the target. One meaningful tightening: dawn = trucks arrive = she must finish now; options collapse from “wait and verify” to “sew and pray.” Agency is driven by her attention and renunciation; she pays with physical speed and future safety. Coincidence is absent; all pressure stems from prior eavesdropping and decoding. Cost is legible: clutching the frame while boots close in, she forecloses any chance to warn officials herself.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: unsent apology vs. irreversible death. Escalation is singular but sufficient: reading the letter → condensation message → decision to “send” apology to past-self. Cost is emotional and legible: shard against chest, tears, realization that only internal narrative can change. Agency lies in the client’s consent to re-feel the moment; coincidence is absent. Pressure tightens once, yet the moral weight feels scaled to the word-limit.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure tightens once: from passive decoding to active commitment. The stake—translate silence into speech—deepens when the encrypted cast implicates a child and a dead uncle; the visible price is the risk she embraces while still anesthetized. Cost is legible, but no persistent constraint shapes tactics beyond tomorrow’s intent.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can she paint authentic joy—tightens once she sees the fragment’s indirect method; options narrow from “paint happy figures” to “paint light itself.” Escalation is textural: each luminous layer increases the felt cost of failure. No antagonist needed; fog and her own standards supply coherent pressure. Visible price: she stays up until midnight, exhausting herself before the public mural deadline—legible cost under accretive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—professional certainty vs. epistemic curiosity—tightens when the hollow wall sound forecloses the safe route of reporting; the price (possible censure, dream recursion) is legible. Pressure accumulates through reflected sound and nested images rather than causal reversals, fitting the Accumulative lens. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—stay cognitively untaxable—announced by gourd rattle #1; pressure accumulates via NRS audits, algorithmic deviation alerts, and serial relocations. One meaningful tightening: the butterflies lift into legible code, crystallizing the club’s irreversible shape-shift. Agency is collective resistance rather than individual decision; cost is exile from taxable reality, felt conceptually. No coincidence; escalation rides pattern intensification under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“will transmuting grief into art suffice for a life?”—tightens through accretion: each new war, each new poem narrows the possibility she will ever exit the shell. No single external reversal, but the incremental density of centuries reaches a qualitative shift at dawn: the poem-read-aloud becomes an act that can no longer be followed by sleep. Cost is legible in the final line: “she began again” = perpetual forfeiture of closure for others and herself.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: preserve vs. transform extinct feelings. One tightening: the cracked tone evokes mother’s name, forcing a trade-off—perfect tone (old archive) vs. broken song (living archive). Agency is renunciation; she forfeits institutional approval by keeping the crack. Cost is legible: the chime will never sound whole again, a felt price under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—restore trust before final departure—is signaled early. Escalation is single but meaningful: each looping Varesh clause tangibly raises the risk that one lie could “unsnarl” the entire apology. The tightening is internal yet legible as physical tension in her cramping hand. Cost is visible: Marcus’s graying, the imminent divergence, and the parchment that could have disintegrated under his voice.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—save villages or frescoes—is signaled on arrival and tightened when she measures the cruel binary. One meaningful reversal: instead of picking sides, she engineers a staged valve that forces collaboration, narrowing options for both societies. Cost is legible: her unsealed letter exposes her to political retaliation, a price she accepts on page. Pressure escalates through because/therefore: tampering → discovery → redesign → exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—trust vs. reinvention—tightens when cataloguing honest paper trails replaces burning them; the dust-mapping beat is the visible price of staying. Escalation is textural: each catalogued cylinder adds density, narrowing her exit routes. Cost is legible but slightly diffuse; no single moment forces a trade-off with sharp sting.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—how to live with a father who left by threshold instead of doorway—tightens when Mara’s reading of the twenty-third ring collapses blame into comprehension. Escalation is textural: each mention of maze, code, or grain adds layer until the final annotation reweights the entire pattern. Cost is visible: she forfeits the child-role and accepts lifelong stewardship of thresholds. One micro-turn suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—prove the city’s responsiveness before shutdown—arrives late but governs the last two-thirds. Escalation is textural: each new glow or gravitational-wave insight thickens pattern density rather than narrowing external options. The sunrise deadline supplies a live clock, but the protagonists’ tactics (more data, then suit-up) do not visibly foreclose safer alternatives; risk is asserted, not dramatized. Cost is conceptual—abandoning observer safety—yet remains off-page, lowering top-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—why memories vanish—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when each drop forecloses her hope of recovering lost foam. The meaningful deepening occurs at the pool: the unchosen paths are not faded but erased, which re-prices her life’s work from salvage to elegy. Cost is legible in the frantic transliteration and the final line’s acceptance of erasure. Pressure is accumulative—each vision adds emotional density rather than external danger, fitting the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—Mara’s need to prove calculated serendipity can replace her father’s intuitive magic—is signaled early and tightened when Rebecca beats her, forcing surrender of total control. Cost is present but modest: one lost game and dented pride; no persistent constraint alters later tactics. Escalation is single-thread yet coherent under causal lens. Coincidence (Rebecca’s exact job niche) is allowed to complicate, not resolve, satisfying situational guardrails.</answer>

    <comment>Theme—structure versus improvisation—emerges through the choreography of performers and the chess loss; no explicit thesis states it. The final invitation lets the reader re-price which kind of “wilderness” matters, achieving quiet resonance without moralizing. Subtext in Rebecca’s over-protected pawns nicely mirrors career regret. Minor therapy-speak risk in “rediscovering ambition” is immediately grounded by embodied callus evidence.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake: will she finish the forbidden verse before dawn/authority intervenes? Pressure is situational—time and ban loom—but escalation is poetic, not tactical: each dance phrase heightens density of memory rather than external danger. Moonstone swallow is the single tightening that makes the inscription irreversible; cost is conceptual (she becomes the text) rather than a lost option on the page. Agency is pure endurance/creation; because lens is lyric, this suffices, but a sharper external risk beat would have lifted the score.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—recover meaning in mundane work—is signaled in paragraph 1 (“seeking something he couldn’t name”). Pressure tightens once: the splash/ring revelation reweights his craft from repair to witness, foreclosing passive contemplation. Agency is attention rather than external confrontation; cost is the implicit return to unchanged workload with transformed seeing. No visible resource loss, but conceptual cost (permanent shift in perceptual burden) is felt; sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can he still protect innocence after showing a child the world burns?—tightens once: carrying the broken box up, then choosing to carry it back changed. The price (leaving the firetower identity) is legible on-page. Agency is introverted but causal; escalation is one meaningful renunciation, sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“can divergence be beautiful?”—is signaled early and tightens through each failed decorative alignment. Escalation is textural: each mirrored attempt increases density until the only remaining option is to abandon measurement itself. Cost is legible—she forfeits the gauge, her last tether to grandmother’s deterministic worldview. The minus comes because the external world (tide, timelines) supplies the final pressure surge more than a reversible choice she dramatizes in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“what do walls dream?”—signals early; each sonic layer raises the cost of knowing until the film proves the walls preview futures, tightening irrevocably. No external antagonist needed; pressure is epistemic and heritable. Protagonist agency turns on staying, accepting the dream-circuit, with visible price: lifelong obsession like her grandfather’s. One deepening suffices for length; escalation stays coherent under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—stop adding civilian names—signals early and tightens when reading aloud makes loss undeniable. Ritual deepens rather than widens conflict, forcing recognitional cost. One meaningful escalation suffices under Accumulative lens. The treaty’s fragility is felt, but external military pressures stay abstract, preventing higher-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—control over water—tightens when he realizes the bird-shaped crack pattern he authored now demands a sacrificial counter-move; egg release = forfeiture of scarcity leverage. Escalation is singular but meaningful: the thunder moves from distant to “directly overhead,” mirroring the narrowing of his options. Cost is tangible—egg shards, dissolving salt, and the implied collapse of his drought cartel—satisfying the “visible price” threshold. Agency remains causal and protagonist-driven; no outside coincidence rescues him.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—liberate suppressed voices or remain complicit—tightens through the physical act of untangling; each freed thread audibly raises palace-wide stakes. Escalation is Accumulative/Textural: density of echo-voices grows until they drown the lullaby. One meaningful turn at final pull strands Celestine between imperial wrath and conductor’s triumph; cost is the loss of her protected courtesan status, felt in the instant she chooses laughter over silence.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.8)
    Central stake—ethical storytelling vs exploitative provocation—tightens through each rehearsal beat; the deepening is the shift from weaponized satire to empathetic context. No external antagonist, but internal pressure suffices under Accumulative lens. Cost is present (loss of collaborator, dawn exhaustion) yet feels ambient rather than sharply paid in a single image.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—bear witness to ending migrations—signals early and tightens when the last monarchs arrive. One meaningful deepening: arrival shifts her from solitary builder to acknowledged witness; options narrow—no future migrations to honor. Agency is attention/renunciation rather than external victory; cost is the tower’s scheduled death. No artificial coincidences; luck complicates by bringing butterflies but does not resolve tension.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—“preserve forgotten names”—is signaled in paragraph two and escalates through each braid adjustment. One meaningful tightening: the moment rope shimmer requires her to decide whether to embed her own voice forever or release it to wind; she chooses exile, paying the felt price. Agency is continuous; no coincidence resolves. Slight knock because cost is poetic rather than viscerally reiterated at exit.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“why some paths choose their walkers”—is signaled early and tightens as each dream-wafer proves the hypothesis. Pressure escalates accumulatively: every seal adds evidence, narrowing possibility from mystery to certainty. The storm outside supplies temporal urgency, but the cost is conceptual, not visceral; still, the final reconfiguration forecloses the old question, replacing it with lived collaboration.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—decoding the tile before guards return—tightens once when shadows reveal terrestrial coordinates, foreclosing any alternative interpretation path. Cost is visible: she spends last savings, risks arrest, exhausts herself digging by hand. Tension scales sentence-level (“footsteps echoed”) yet the off-stage “alignment in three days” functions as a ticking clock rather than an on-page threat, muting pressure. Escalation is coherent but single-cycle; no secondary reversal tests her resolve again.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is legible by line 3: will Kale cling to vengeance or release it? Escalation is accretive rather than explosive—each memory shard widens the gap between inherited rage and lived truth, tightening the emotional noose. The missing pin becomes the visible price; when Kale regrows it, the option of eternal resentment is foreclosed. One meaningful turn is sufficient and it lands: her “Teach me” is uttered only after the song plays complete, proving the cost has been felt.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—recover or relinquish the brother—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the frost-covered sextant lands on the doorstep. The meaningful turn arrives with the mirrored breath-fog synchronization: it is the only way to rebuild the boundary he dissolved, and it forecloses her safe detachment from the fog. Price is visible: she trades her solitary clarity for a half-translucent sibling who may yet fade.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—restoring the craft and the relationship—is signaled by line 3 and tightens when Marta realizes the bag contains the ancestral stone. The reversal is small but meaningful: she arrives expecting absolution, stays to re-earn mentorship. Cost is tangible: Marta forfeits residual pride when she admits failure aloud. Agency is shared on the last beat, sufficient for a quiet story; no coincidence resolves the rift.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—will she accept custodianship of forbidden knowledge—tightens once: bath epiphany → shell selection forecloses refusal. Escalation is accretive: each impossible detail (breathable asteroid, cross-temporal deed) ups the cost of disbelief until compliance becomes the only on-page option. Visible price: she trades her curatorial distance for inscribed complicity. No coincidence; pressure is situational but coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—liberate the seventeen—locked early; pressure escalates as descent = stronger bone-resonant “music,” narrowing options to submit or negotiate. Marin’s agency drives the turn: she risks becoming the eighteenth to propose exchange, and the bookstore’s audible shift in harmony is the visible price. One minor slack: the seventeen’s fates feel abstract until the final paragraph; cost is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—preserve a coherent self against Soren’s invasive memories—tightens each time the card shifts hue or mirrors fork her image; the final act of “pulling” the least-hurt thread narrows possibility to one endured delusion, paying a felt price. Pressure is coherent but single-arc; no external antagonist or additional reversal escalates beyond the initial threat of psychic merger.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—restore temporal coherence—signalled early; pressure escalates because each braid she loosens makes the clock’s rhythm audibly stranger, narrowing her exit options. The final re-weave forces an irreversible merger; the cost is the permanent hybrid ticking now running through her. One tightening turn suffices, but the beat could hit harder if her body registered the stakes (hand cramp, vertigo) rather than calm commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes—surface noise vs. sought silence—tighten once: the stone’s activation forecloses retreat, creates breathable pockets between alien pulses. Escalation is single but sufficient for length; cost (lantern dark, Kael alone) is on-page. Agency is attention/renunciation rather than combat, fitting lens.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—prove meaning behind coincidence—tightens when each prism shard demands a ruin-side quest, foreclosing the safety of tower isolation. Escalation is accumulative: each star-path intersection reduces her options from stasis to pilgrimage; the Silence Archive shard will cost literal stillness, a tangible price. Agency sits with Esme; no star solves anything for her. Luck (tremor) complicates but is immediately converted into purpose, satisfying situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—identity preservation vs. recursive memory—tightens when impossible shadows imply the archive will remember its own future. The single meaningful deepening occurs as Elden measures the backward-forward shadow, realizing the archive anticipates itself; this narrows her options to merge or resist. Cost is legible: she forfeits singular selfhood, paid on-page by the quill’s fall. Pressure stays coherent under the accumulative lens, though the predecessor’s off-stage vanishing softens the external antagonistic force.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single dominant stake—recover art-identity after maiming a child—is signaled by line 6. Escalation is internal: first sight of rag → unlit rehearsal → tear-laughter release; each step re-prices the fear of fire. The tightening choice is accepting to spin without combustion, narrowing future options (he can never return to old pyrotechnic glory). Cost is felt but could have been sharpened by an explicit forfeit (reputation letter burns, etc.).

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—Mira’s demand for presence vs Chen’s tangential distance—tightens once via cicada reveal which forecloses the old stasis; cost is visible when he admits unfairness and she leans instead of leaving. Agency resides in Chen’s decision to risk direct emotional exposure. Escalation is single but sufficient for 700-word frame.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can she breathe psychologically without walls?—is signaled in line 1 and tightens when the silence-vessel of maternal disappointment shatters overhead, releasing that exact frequency into the inverted air. The inversion hour provides a live clock; every minute she stays increases the future cost of climbing back down to bunkers. Agency drives escalation: her kick to retrieve the doll commits her to the sky path and narrows later options. Cost is legible: she trades ancestral safety for perpetual aerial exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single dominant stake: can Elena re-inhabit silence without the flat-line monitor sound. Pressure escalates by deceleration—each motor notch lowers ambient noise and raises emotional exposure, a textbook accumulative tightening. The prism corridor’s “liquid color” acts as last-stage sensory overwhelm that forces her either to break or to re-tune. Cost is legible: Marco sacrifices his habitual script and yearly emotional distance; Elena risks reopening the audible wound.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—reach the throne room before orbital sunrise—is signaled early and tracked by rail-bike ride and final descent beat. Sunrise clock visibly tightens options, forcing the kneel-and-press decision. Escalation is one steady tightening rather than multiple reversals, sufficient for 700-word scope. Cost is legible: she abandons surface world legitimacy for archive duty.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—learning to exhale—is signaled early and tightens once: the threshold flickers, the girl appears, the option of retreat is erased. Escalation is situational pressure culminating in stance crystallization; no external antagonist, no reversals, yet the foreclosing of “out there” is legible. Cost is conceptual (loss of old ties) rather than tangible; the price is felt but not dramatized as loss on the page. Sufficient for length, but lacks a visible forfeiture that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—translate her scam-pressure into something generative—signalled in first paragraph and tightened when the bolt’s impossible weight demands the install choice. Escalation is causal: each text fragment raises the cost of refusal until "Yes" forecloses retreat. Visible price: sealing the breach burns the shame into a portable diamond she must now carry.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—will Cassian find the unspoken sin that justifies his matricidal testimony—tightens once: the confession cylinder converts abstract suspicion into irrefutable ancestral crime. Escalation is Accumulative: each acoustic detail adds density until the standing-wave trick detonates prior certainty. Cost is felt conceptually rather than viscerally, nudging this under the 8-band where a visible price would live.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is crystallized early: finish the abandoned oath or remain string-fearing exile. Pressure tightens once as trees form the amphitheater and strings hover—one meaningful escalation under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Agency is present—he chooses to dance and speak a personal oath—yet cost is more symbolic than tactile; we don’t feel bodily consequence of attachment. Still, the price is legible: permanent visibility of one’s puppetry, foreclosing anonymous withdrawal.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost kinship—ignites with Samuel’s first letter; pressure tightens when Miriam realizes the indexing error separated father from son forever. Meaningful deepening occurs at the 1869 adoption sheet: the clerk’s arbitrary letter choice forecloses reunion, a visible price that reweights Miriam’s task. Protagonist agency drives final escalation: she re-files to prevent recurrence, enduring perpetual emotional labor. Coincidence (dust trail) complicates, does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—keep truth visible—signals early and tightens once: the raided safehouse forces her to risk the lagoon shoot. Escalation is causal, not explosive: each photograph developed narrows her future—she can’t resume cover identity unchanged. Visible price paid: loss of safehouse network, imminent deeper vanishing. No coincidence; even the searchlight is logical shoreline patrol.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—decode the leaf message—is signaled in paragraph two; pressure intensifies when spirals spell almost-words, tightening again with the moonstone bell-sound that forces a perceptual upgrade. One meaningful escalation suffices: her new seed-mandalas sprout better, proving the payoff. Cost is present yet soft—she loses mundane precision but the forfeiture is asserted, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“learn to navigate uncertainty instead of certainty”—is signaled early and tightens through each accumulative beat: stopped clocks demand patience, compass refuses north, chamber reveals pattern beneath chaos. Escalation is textural: each artifact reweights the cost of certainty until the final choice to preserve fractures forecloses conventional repair. No external antagonist; pressure is epistemic. Visible price: Marcus forfeits the security of fixed time and accepts perpetual ambiguity—cost is legible in the closing image of the spinning needle.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake is legible by line 3: can Mara transmute absence into bearable truth? One meaningful tightening occurs when the gold flows—this irrevocably commits the coin to a new ontological state, foreclosing return to raw evidence. Price is paid on-page: the coin’s warmth against her palm signals energy drawn from her own night-long stamina (felt cost). Agency is hers alone; no coincidence rescues. If anything, the escalation is modest—no external antagonist—yet within the Accumulative lens the intensification of image (green corrosion → glowing seam) suffices to reweight grief.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—free the ghost or leave him looping—is signaled in paragraph 3. One meaningful tightening: the moment Kael pivots from extraction to laughter, foreclosing the guild-approved method; price is the tear-tracked smile and the tooth’s burn. Escalation is textural—each echo layers guilt until the harmonic break—sufficient under Accumulative lens. Cost is visible on page, no reversal inflation.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will she keep calculating cruelty or switch to calculating mercy—tightens once: the clearing’s geometry offers a single live option, “plant,” that forecloses endless measurement of suffering. Cost is visible: she gives up the only artifact that proved she survived, trading proof for growth.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—recover erased immigrant lives—signaled in paragraph two. Pressure tightens once: the lens reveals hidden portraits, turning abstract duty into specific faces; this deepens rather than reverses, sufficient for Accumulative lens. No coincidences resolve; the vendor’s offer is motivated by grandmother history. Cost is present but light: Mira’s evenings lost to documentation are mentioned, not shown. Enough to enter 8-band, not 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—“will he heed the ghost before the building is erased?”—is signaled in paragraph two and sharpened when demolition clock is mentioned. One meaningful tightening occurs at the dust-line disruption: the discovery forces a choice—profit vs. guardianship—whose price is the forfeited assessment fee. Escalation is modest but sufficient for 700-word scope; coincidence complicates (ghost arrival) but does not resolve. Cost is legible in the final paragraph’s “weightless burden” and his delayed turn to the broken elevator, i.e., the job he will now perform for free.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—escape stasis versus preserve safety—is declared early and tightens with each press-thud that rattles branches. One meaningful deepening: frost patterns translate into a map of her own erased mornings, foreclosing the “safe” option. Cost is legible in the lurching floor and the dissolve of her younger vow. Agency sits with Marina; operator only provides the lever.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: prove the shard is memorial, not mercantile—signaled early via contempt for Vhen’s ledger logic. Tightening occurs when excavation data (shard was already broken) forces Kasimir to abandon vandalism-of-memory thesis and embrace grief-architecture; cost is abandonment of last hope for revolutionary vindication. No antagonist on page, but scholarly dispute supplies coherent pressure. Escalation is textural: each refracted ghost and baroque curve deepens the emotional price of being wrong; final image reconfigures options—he now carries “new kind of revolution” of patience, not overthrow.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaim stolen light—signals early; escalation is the audible wilting of the flower then the visible gold shift. Agency is cerebral: tuning-fork counter-sound + dawn-oil. One meaningful tightening qualifies; cost is conceptual (light restored) rather than a lost option for Aldric.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“find the place where explanations fail”—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens through each failed instrument. No external antagonist needed; the lagoon’s muteness is the pressure that forces her stance crystallization. One visible price: she leaves boots and compass on shore, abandoning measurement itself. Could edge higher if a sharper mid-story obstacle (e.g., a moment of vertigo or oxygen doubt) had raised visceral jeopardy, but the existential escalation is coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: can she evolve her art to honor hidden strata without losing structural elegance? The meaningful tightening occurs when slide-in-hand reframes her driftwood hunt into a quest for layered transparency; this narrows her selection criteria and foreshadows resin casting. Cost is legible: she forfeits GPS ease, embraces slower, ancestral navigation. No external antagonist needed—pressure is internal and accumulative, coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—“why beauty would choose darkness”—is signaled early and compressed elegantly. Pressure escalates only once: the priest reframes darkness as the flower’s sun, collapsing Mara’s opposition. No visible price is dramatized on the page; the cost is conceptual (her old murals invalidated) but not tactile. One meaningful deepening is enough for this length, yet the absence of a micro-forfeit keeps the score sub-7.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. eternal entrapment—signaled in diary cipher and tightened when Sarai demands witness exchange. Agency rests in Malik’s kneel/look; it narrows his future to messenger fate and frees no one, visible cost on page. Pressure escalates accumulatively: each new artifact (driftwood words, bone fragments) thickens moral density rather than causal chain, fitting the lens. No reversal beyond the single parley, but that suffices for 600-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single dominant stake: can anything authentic rise from wish-parasitized ruins? Pressure tightens when Miranda realizes the bottle is a mirror, not a key—foreclosing the easy alchemist shortcut. Escalation is textural: each night adds density to her reconstructed town until others arrive to test the vision. Cost is visible: she trades guild certainty for ambiguous communal labor.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—who curates the city’s emotional memory—tightens when the foghorn’s final silence triggers the ledger’s opening. Marcus’s agency is delayed until adulthood, but the childhood immersion seeds the decisive future choice; the cost is the lifetime spent learning extinct languages to honor that moment.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—restoring seeds’ ability to randomize—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightened when Mara steps into the spiral, trading inherited order for chaotic growth. Cost is legible: the vortex shatters, her grandmother’s unlived futures are spent, entropy is returned to the world. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversals needed. Agency is renunciation rather than victory, fitting Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—lives versus credibility—signaled in paragraph four. One meaningful tightening: the rope thrums minutes before instruments register drop, forcing the manual-or-automatic choice that narrows her options to irreversible override. Cost is visible: stone buttresses crack, her professional future fractures with them. Coincidence complicates (storm arrival) but does not resolve; resolution comes solely from her sustained ringing under catastrophic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—remain or abandon solitude—signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation is textural: each meteor logged adds density to the stillness until the final shower forces a stance crystallization (“beautiful. necessary. brief enough to matter”). No external antagonist needed; pressure is entropic decay + cosmic indifference. Persistent constraint: autopayments could stop tomorrow—visible price is her youth spent, hair greying inside helmet reflection (implied), and data no one will read.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“preserve the weight of unspoken words”—tightens when covenant silence is revealed as ghost-source. One meaningful deepening: reading the letter collapses the false peace option, forces her custodial vow. Cost is legible: she trades isolation for endless witness. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves—the 8-band is secure, just shy of 8.8 because the price is spiritual, not viscerally felt on the body.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes—preserve measurable time vs. surrender to fluidity—are signaled early and tighten once when seven strangers respond to the coded ad; the deepening is textural rather than causal, but the urn fragment’s passage around the circle visibly raises the emotional price under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—beauty found in imperfection—tightens when the torn feather becomes the shared object of memory; the boy’s loss of the kite-made-by-grandma raises the cost. One meaningful deepening: Maren shifts from solitary observation to collaborative witnessing, foreclosing her prior isolation without healing the boy’s grief. Pressure is textural, not causal, fitting the Accumulative lens. A visible price is legible: the feather remains damaged, the kite is gone.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: prove collaborative architecture before death. Pressure escalates via accumulative deepening—each copper wrap and pillar reopened enlarges the living network, making her finite breath the visible currency. No external antagonist is needed; time is the compressive force, though it stays abstract (no calendar markers). The final tightening is the fox beneath the altar—an undeniable index that the network now overrides territorial old rules, forcing her to accept her own obsolescence as caretaker. Cost is legible: her last morning is “too weak to walk,” a direct bodily price for the remodel.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can nostalgia be measured without destroying it?—tightens when Elara admits her data has become longing. One meaningful deepening: “Each journey both deepens and erases the one before” raises the cost of continued returns. Agency remains hers: she chooses tomorrow’s walk knowing footprints will vanish. No external antagonist needed; the pressure is temporal erosion, perfectly coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will the garden truly reclaim the battlefield?—is signaled early and tightens via each seed placed. No huge reversal, but the accretive pattern forces a quiet stance crystallization: he leaves the site to darkness and potential, renouncing further control. Cost is conceptual—the soldiers’ absence is permanent, the reef stays dead—but felt in the image of seeds abandoned to tide and time. Sufficient for 600-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: translate isolation into connection; signaled early via Calder’s “distance killed us” line. Escalation is single, meaningful: cylinder converts despair into six reachable caches, narrowing options from stasis to communal march. Cost is conceptual but legible—Calder’s tears and the irrevitable broadcast of coordinates—so agency and price cohere. No external antagonist or second reversal, but one tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: the impossibility of leaving versus the infinity of staying. Pressure tightens once: each anniversary sketch re-commits her to fatal exile. Cost is legible—cellular lock-in, solitary eternity—though the escalation is more iterative than sharply reversed; a single deeper tightening midway could have pushed higher.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—whether Kael will restore flow of wonder—signals early and tightens when the guardian demands amendment. Single meaningful escalation: placing hollow chess pieces on the board enacts the swap, foreclosing the hoarder path with visible ritual cost. Agency is present; no coincidence resolves tension. Price is felt (trembling hands), yet the world-level stakes of the wrong sky remain more conceptual than visceral, keeping the score just shy of 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—will the unofficial witness survive erasure—tightens when her private alphabet is offered to the archive, narrowing her options from solitary seer to collaborative historian. One meaningful deepening: the chessboard’s missing pawns crystallizes the story’s scale—no small players left to sacrifice. No external antagonist needed; pressure is the city’s memory vacuum. Cost is conceptual but felt: her singular testimony is diluted into shared record.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“will she let the stone make her remember?”—tightens once, when heat forces the burn/implant choice; option to keep hiding is foreclosed with visible cost. Pressure is coherent under accumulative lens: each sensory return (feather, stone, thunder) intensifies density until refraction reweights meaning. No external antagonist needed; internal stakes carry sufficient heat.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—will he find absolution or further proof of failure?—tightens when the cipher spells “FORGIVE,” flipping quest from external maze to internal stance. Agency is intellectual: each decoded thread forecloses alternate interpretations; final refusal to descend pays visible opportunity cost (mystery remains unexplored). Escalation accumulates under Accumulative/Textural lens: density of knots + thunder nears → pattern break when time restarts. No coincidence resolves conflict; resumption is environmental, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“can she achieve forgiveness without surrendering her art?”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and sharpened by the elder’s threat. The refracting sessions deepen tension by publicly undermining ritual authority; each echo overlap raises social cost. One clear tightening: elder orders her to climb anyway, foreclosing escape. Price is legible: she keeps her aesthetic but loses institutional absolution.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—transmute loss before drowning—tightens via the literal oxygen clock; each attempted charm-fit burns precious seconds, escalating felt cost. The mid-scene reversal (click → golden light) forecloses the “instant cure” fantasy and replaces it with generational repair, paid for by Maya’s surrender of an easy victory. Persistent constraint: the acid sea remains lethal; the victory is cognitive, not environmental, keeping pressure alive past the last line.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: can Maren keep her promise to make art that matters before time runs out? Pressure tightens when the mirror cracks and the cave’s temporary eternity literalizes the ticking tide. The shell-mosaic decision narrows her options from saleable harbor views to unseen, perishable gifts, paying the visible price of relinquishing her public identity. Escalation is textural: each chamber’s brighter light intensifies the impossibility of capture until the medium itself must fracture—an accumulative deepening that reweights the stake under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—prove whispers beat shouts—tightens when Thomas reaches for the fog-horn and Mira risks professional ridicule to stop him. Single meaningful turn: scent + heartbeat pulse forecloses the “louder” tactic on the spot; cost is Thomas’s conceded authority. No coincidence resolves; captain’s correction is agency-driven response. Escalation is modest but sufficient for 700-word frame.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—find why loved ones left and whether a counter-path exists—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when the midnight voice reframes the compass goal. The single meaningful turn: realizing the pull is temporal, not spatial, which forecloses any chance of intercepting the migrants in present space. Agency sits entirely with Mara’s iterative building; each salvage beat narrows options and increases material cost. Price is legible: she finishes the device alone, accepting irreversible separation.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—decode stranger’s gesture—communicated by paragraph 2. Escalation is textural: each absent detail (no boat, no footprints, Alpine flower) tightens the puzzle until coordinates convert mystery into tomorrow’s dive. Cost is knowledge-burden: Magnus accepts lifelong custodianship of someone else’s war secret. One meaningful tightening suffices; no reversal needed for this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake = possibility of choosing a different life; signaled early by “promise he couldn’t remember.” One tightening: wall becomes translucent, forcing explicit valuation of unlived selves. Cost is legible—internal vertigo and future exposure risk—but not externally tested; no credible resource loss or irreversible forfeit on-page. Escalation is conceptual rather than tactical; under Causal lens, sufficient but not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single dominant stake—will she reclaim feeling at any cost?—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens through each accumulative image. The meaningful deepening occurs when starlight brands her: knowledge that she is both perpetrator and victim forecloses the option to remain numb. Price is visceral (cold burn, memory assault) and persists into descent. No external antagonist needed; internal pressure suffices. Agency resides in continuing to climb and finally accepting witness. Cost clarity is legible on the page; entering 8.8+ would require an external consequence that alters kingdom politics, which the scope intentionally withholds.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can presence be bottled—signals early and tightens when Mira whispers “Are you truly leaving?” forcing Solène to test the new sphere under witness gaze. One meaningful deepening: the sphere must hold “texture of this twilight,” not mere lumens, raising ontological cost. Agency remains hers; no coincidence resolves. Price is palpable: the finished sphere glows with “amber suspension” of their own faces—once given, it cannot serve Academy profit.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can she keep a coherent self-record before total collapse—signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is textural: each scroll entry thickens the soup of time, narrowing the fantasy that any version will stick. The final sealing of box + scroll is an earned renunciation that forecloses the hope of definitive narrative; cost is the acceptance of perpetual re-writing. Agency is expressed through the micro-choice to keep writing despite knowing its provisionality.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—Elena’s need to assign meaning to breakage—tightens when the hidden crack forces a choice: pristine repair vs. intentional rupture. The screw’s return as necklace converts abstract approval into wearable risk, foreclosing the path of detached technician. Escalation is accretive rather than causal, but the single deepening suffices under lens. Visible price: she pockets no payment and shoulders a client’s grief-tool, altering her professional identity.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.8)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—deliver a lived apology—tightens when the vortex escalates from cold draft to paper storm; the cost (Margot’s public confession via phone deletion) is legible on page. One meaningful deepening: the shift from verbal apology to embodied rewriting. No external antagonist needed; Vivienne’s spectral pressure suffices. Luck never rescues; the orchard’s bloom is framed as response, not reward.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—“observe without flinching”—is signaled early, but pressure is atmospheric, not tactical; the Hiccup arrives as scheduled, not as a cost she risks. No live option is foreclosed; the unify choice is inevitable rather than a narrowing. Escalation is poetic density, not rising cost; the final laughter is resonance, not consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve or breach temporal certainty—is signaled at the lag discovery. One meaningful tightening: counting backward narrows options to “delete seconds or stay ignorant.” The reversal is her active choice; luck only complicates via pre-existing clock anomaly. Cost is visible (blood, vanished seconds) but external stakes (Service logs, world order) remain off-page, capping escalation just below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—can she stop treating attachment as a security breach?—is signaled early and tightens once: the button micro-act forces the trade-off between continued analysis and release. Agency is present; no coincidence resolves anything. Cost is legible but modest—she forfeits nightly rumination and deletes the number; because the story frames this as sufficient renunciation under its own quiet register, the price feels scaled to 700-word Accumulative design even if not viscerally wrenching.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—how to relate to a still-living, self-destructive father—is signaled early and tightened once: from detached calculation to reopened possibility. The lantern beat narrows options by forcing a choice between continued abstraction and present engagement. Cost is legible—she forfeits emotional distance she had weaponized for safety. No external antagonist needed; internal contradiction supplies adequate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve urban loneliness vs. relieve caller—tightens when the callback proves attachment has already formed, narrowing Sarah’s options to betrayal or invitation. One meaningful escalation: first call was secret lapse; second call forces public choice with supervisor-risk now implicit. Cost is visible: she forfeits anonymity and departmental safety, signaled by altered disc timbre “less haunted, more hopeful.” No reversal overload; single turn sufficient under Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving the weight of small moments—tightens when the returned dozen validate that preservation as the price of return. One meaningful deepening: the covenant flips from failed magic to successful witnessing, forcing Maren to recognize her solitude as the steeping cost. Agency is archival attention rather than physical act; the tightening is epistemic, not tactical, fitting Accumulative lens. Cost is legible: her stained hands become the bridge, foreclosing lifelong anonymity.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—loneliness versus mutual aid—is signaled in Mara’s opening rock monologue. One meaningful tightening occurs when the seventeenth fragment arrives and the option to vanish again is foreclosed; the price is the surrender of her anonymity ritual. Agency is collective but still readable: they “choose, finally, to stay found,” a renunciation with visible social cost. Pressure accumulates through each new arrival rather than a single antagonistic turn, coherent with the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—making meaning from cosmic noise—tightens when the signal rewrites her own logs, forcing a choice: resist or participate in the revision. Escalation is textural: each archival overwrite increases density until she accepts co-authorship. The tightening forecloses certainty; cost is the perpetual instability of memory. The turn is single but decisive; entering the 8.8+ band would require a more viscerally felt price (a friendship, a lost record she personally treasured) on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—being remembered vs. accepting presence—tightens when Marina realizes the music is ephemeral yet communal. Agency drives escalation: her mapped drawings become the data that powers the harbor-wide song; her final click consents to transience. Cost is on-page: she forfeits film’s permanence for one luminous night of shared audition. Coincidence only complicates (crowd formation), never resolves. One meaningful deepening suffices; stakes pivot from memory to moment.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—love’s memory vs. institutional erasure—is signaled in the vandalized portrait and escalates with each stolen page: every extraction narrows Mara’s future options. The tapestry-match beat is the visible tightening that forecloses denial; she can no longer unseen the continuum of censored love. Cost is legible: criminal status, exile, possible imprisonment. One beat short of 9 because the external antagonist (authorities) remains abstract; the pressure is archival and existential rather than imminent bodily threat.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—preserve vs. surrender individuality—tightens through each drum strike that visibly fuses neural patterns; final clasp forecloses retreat. Agency stays mutual; no off-stage rescue. Cost is legible: loss of discrete identity, felt in “don’t know where you end and I begin.” Escalation is steady, one meaningful deepening; suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—prove mastery of the labyrinth—tightens when the storm triggers wall-shifts that only the auditory method can survive. One meaningful deepening: the coin is revealed as a sonic key, not a token, forcing Marcus to translate his gait into rhythm—this narrows options and raises cost. Coincidence (woman appears) complicates rather than rescues; his prior ear-work earns the pass. Price is legible: he abandons visual map-dependence for the riskier whisper-path.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—save canals without losing job—signaled paragraph two and tightens once the shutter-map becomes the irreversible protest. Agency is continuous: she decides to signal, decides to stay, decides to walk home still silent. One visible price: she forfeits the chance to testify openly, accepting permanent internal gag. Escalation is linear but sufficient for 750 words; coincidence absent; pressure peaks when the pattern is complete and cannot be undone.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—can a teacher seed civic disobedience without losing her student?—tightens when Miss Chen risks Danny’s withdrawal by refusing to coddle him. Escalation is textural: each disclosure (grotto, numbers growth, window plan) raises the social cost of complicity. Danny’s agency is thin; the final tightening depends on Miss Chen’s micro-gesture, not his irrevocable choice, so the visible price lands on her alone, capping intensity below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—escape versus anchored duty—tightens once: shared touch on bone forecloses solitary flight. Escalation is relational deepening, not external peril; cost legible in Mira’s felt “phantom weight.” Agency mutual; coincidence (whale call) complicates, does not rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—recovering the right to feel grief without performance—is signaled early and tightens when the narration must be relinquished to reach Emma. One meaningful deepening: the flowers shift from relic to witness, forcing the father to drop the script. Cost is legible—loss of the shield that kept him safe during the mandate. Escalation is accumulative rather than causal-plot, sufficient for this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—poetry’s right to remain fluid—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened when Meris physically composes inside the quartz, narrowing options to irreversible renunciation of fixed language. Cost is legible in the final image: she accepts the likelihood of another ban (“They’ll try…”) yet strides on. Agency is pure; no coincidence resolves tension. A crisper visible price (e.g., Kael losing his post) would lift it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—awakening the sleepwalkers—surfaces early and tightens once: Maya must sacrifice her self-interest (keeping the reed) to jolt Tomás awake. The single deepening is meaningful: her gift’s cost shifts from idea to pocketed object, foreclosing future trades. Agency is hers; coincidence (phoenix smoke) complicates but does not resolve. Visible price is present yet modest; a sharper material loss or risk would have pushed this into the 8+ tier.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can intimacy be artificially re-created?—is signaled early and tightens when tonight’s “most ambitious iteration” must work on a live stranger. Agency is accumulative: each layered recording thickens the risk of failure; the volunteer’s frightened arrival forces Maren to expose her private experiment publicly. Cost is legible: she yields sole control of the sound-environment and accepts the possibility of emotional contagion that could destroy her data or her fragile repute. No causal reversal, but density shift suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: can mourning be transformed without betrayal? Pressure tightens when Senna’s shaky hands literalize the risk of failure. Final brooch’s tiny windows foreclose anonymity—Mara must now practice the illumination she preaches. Cost is legible: each crane left in the city re-exposes Mara’s grief, a voluntary reopening.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“decode the circuits or the grandmother’s lifework stays mute”—is signaled at Marcus’s entrance and narrows to “publish the pattern before capital erases it.” One meaningful tightening occurs when Vesper’s tape proves the ratio match; this crystallizes the collaboration but costs nothing on-page (no lost grant, no destroyed data). Escalation is intellectual, not visceral, satisfying the lens yet capping high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are declared early—dreams are being sterilized—but the tightening is intellectual: she compares frames, notices smoothing, decides to act. No archive authority confronts her, no personal risk is levied, so the pressure plateaus rather than spikes. The cost is abstract (“truth has weight”) rather than a concrete forfeiture on the page. Escalation is present but bloodless; the protagonist’s agency is never punished, so the tension feels academic.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can she salvage scientific truth without statistical armor—is signaled by line 3; pressure tightens when she lifts the broken thermometer and realizes fabrication is no longer tenable. The meaningful turn occurs at the keyboard: choosing qualitative framing forfeits fast-track redemption, a price spelled out in the “journals that valued different approaches” line.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—learn the truth about Sarah—signals early and tightens when plant memories reveal a second presence. Escalation is accumulative: each vegetal witness incrementally deepens knowledge until the table’s memory narrows Mara’s options to justice. Cost is legible: she sacrifices physical healing (reopened wrist) and psychological safety (illusion of accidental death). One missed beat: no on-page confrontation with Dr. Venn, so the external pressure stays intellectual rather than immediate; still, the internal tightening is sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can dormant love be returned or released—tightens when the map reveals dispersal, not restitution, as the only live option; this narrowing is the single meaningful turn. Agency is decision: she chooses to scatter the strips, paying the cost of relinquishing reunion. Pressure escalates under Causal lens because each discovery (film → letters → map) forecloses the previous fantasy. Price is legible: she forfeits the consoling illusion that love can be delivered to its first intended.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure tightens once: Celestine’s choice to introduce imperfection forecloses perfect prediction and frees the Keeper; cost is legible (Keeper dissolves, astrolabe goes cold), but escalation is single-beat, lacking an intermediate tactical loss that would push the score higher.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: keep plural futures alive by preventing collapse of the dune’s superposition. Escalation is a single deepening—her song joins the flowers, tightening the ligature between guardian and cargo. Cost is visible: she pays with perpetual vigilance and the one-second leak of the clock. Agency is attention and renunciation rather than reversible decision, fitting Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are epistemic—will he understand the translocations?—and tighten when the nineteenth gear locks in, revealing the forest-as-mind. Pressure is accumulative (pattern density) rather than causal, appropriate to lens. Cost is present but abstract (loss of certainty, former life); a more visceral forfeiture would have pushed this into 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—retrieve dog vs. retrieve self—tightens at each indirect ascent; micro-choice to punch foliage escalates by replacing search with self-interrogation. One meaningful deepening: when she confesses “also lighter,” the want/fear axis flips, foreclosing safe refusal. Guides’ insistence on “without a leash” is the visible price that alters tactics for the final run. Coincidence is absent; escalation is accumulative under textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—understanding the price of survival—tightens when evidence accumulates: discoloration proves others kept climbing; the bolt exposes shared fracture; Silent-Choir’s chord forces her to bear witness. One decisive deepening rather than multiple reversals suits the accumulative lens. Agency is endurance and participation: she keeps climbing, sits, plays. Cost is visible in her tingling fingertips and the unsung anthem that will never resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single dominant stake—restore true lineage—signaled when pellet arrives and tightens once when final rune fragment is placed. Escalation is textural rather than causal-reversal: each inserted rune increases atmospheric pressure until“the fabric of deception begin to sunder.” Graceful collapse works as Resonant Reconfiguration, but the cost is conceptual-social, not personal-physical; protagonist remains unruffled. Agency is steady, not sharpened by a trade-off, so the visible-price gate for 8.8+ isn’t quite cleared, though stakes feel large and elegant.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—decode the ocean’s disappearing paths—signaled early; pressure escalates via pattern accumulation: each data fragment tightens the mystery until the 17-year-early current forces real-time action; agency is intellectual (drop sensors) not existential, so cost is conceptual rather than tactical; sufficient for this length and lens.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake: find meaning after rebellion’s lull. Tightening occurs when the hum forces a binary—old rebellion vs. new sight—with the cost of abandoning prior tactics. Agency is attention/renunciation rather than external fight, fitting accumulative lens. Price is legible: she forfeits the comfort of righteous anger and steps barefoot into unknown frequency. Could wish for one earlier micro-choice that shows tactical alteration under hum; still, escalation coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—evolve tradition or lose it—tightens when decoding the kite forecloses secrecy and the embryo offers irreversible fusion. Agency drives every turn: she chooses dawn descent, chooses to speak the hybrid blessing, chooses to absorb spores. Cost is on-page: “golden spores… sank into her skin,” a price that can’t be refunded. Pressure plateaus once inside the safe cavern; no rising geological or human threat inside the chamber keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: can Mira inhabit a present worth living while carrying unmoving grief? Pressure tightens somatically—each freeze is a beat where cultivation halts—then releases through the pearl method, costing her time, vulnerability, and ultimately the photograph. No external antagonist; escalation is pattern-deepening: more freezes, longer waits, until the final layer allows release. Cost is visible: relinquishing relic, accepting perpetual ache.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—artist’s need to salvage purpose after serial rejections—signals early and tightens when walls literally close. One meaningful deepening: spiral card-layout triggers spatial contraction, forcing faster, riskier choices. Price is conceptual not corporeal: loss of prior aesthetic mode (“would paint differently”) is legible but less visceral than a forfeited object or relationship. Agency is present yet slightly diluted—walls stop because pattern completes, not because she gambles a concrete sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—bring in the killer—tightens when Kael chooses to let the ink pattern complete before arresting her; that micro-delay is the visible price under causal lens. Escalation is ink-driven: each dissolving message deletes an escape route for both hunter and quarry. No external coincidence; pressure is internal—his expanding consciousness is the very thing that prevents a clean collar. Cost is legible: he delivers Vera but carries her temporal insight forward, foreclosing his former absolutism.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. Concord survival—tightens from abstract letter to concrete thaw command; no other options remain after the override. Escalation is causal under the inferred lens: each safety bypass narrows escape routes until scandal is inevitable. Visible price is the logged self-condemnation. No coincidence resolves the conflict; Maren’s agency drives every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—continue the farm vs. surrender it—tightens once: magistrate threat revealed, then Kael’s real desire exposed. Mira’s agency drives the turn; she offers the cutting, not the father. Cost is legible: Kael’s sheathing = acceptance of daughter’s path and loss of his own. Escalation is single but sufficient for 700-word scale; no reversal is required.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—capture the goddess’s raw feeling—remains legible throughout; pressure escalates by texture, not twist: constellation slippage, flower zigzag, spike song rising. Each intensification is an accumulative deepening that reweights the cost of failure: miss the echo and remain stuck with second-hand translations. Agency is contemplative—silence shaped like longing—but still active; no outside savior intervenes. The visible price is the echo itself, now an irreversible implant, foreclosing innocence about curated emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure tightens once: the journalist’s call reopens the father’s orbit of regret, forcing Celeste to decide publish/retract. The cost is visible—she forfeits her above-the-clouds detachment when she points the telescope downward. Escalation is causal under that lens, though the tightening is single rather than deepening; enough for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: silence the dissonance of her own guilt by rewriting corrupted firmware. Escalation is one deepening: grief-code reveals her own dismissed cries → she must tether herself to them. Agency is continuous finger-work on keys while amber warms, narrowing options to full self-incorporation. Cost is visible: empty amber, resolved melody, and her future letter proves the path is irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—collective meaning amid erasure—is signaled in para 1 and tightens once: speech renounced for pattern-feeling forecloses the last mode of recall. Escalation is accretive: each chalk stroke consumes finite pigment and narrows the possible next stroke. The cost is visible—chalk dust on knees, the old man’s hollow eyes—altering tactics (no naming, only feeling). Agency remains hers even as crowd grows; coincidence only complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.1)
    Primary stake—can she end the retrocognitive loop and reclaim the plaza for the erased—is signaled on page 1. Escalation arrives when she deciphers the banned alphabet in the chips, foreclosing the safe option of silence; each spoken name tightens the noose she invites. Cost is visible: regime retaliation now inevitable, her anonymity sacrificed. One minor drag: the loop’s intensity is repeated in similar language three times; the middle iteration could have probed a new physical price to push this into 8.5+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—existence vs. dissolution—signals in paragraph 1 and tightens as each echo-thread risks permanent unraveling. Agency: she elects to dance the encore knowing it will scatter her; cost visible when coin shatters and applause folds into golden light that consumes her outline. One meaningful intensification: arrival of triple-timeline audience narrows her option from “maybe seen” to “forever seen at price of self.”

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“save eight hundred drowning minds”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when Mara locates the “confluence where connections tangle.” Agency: she decides to map, forfeiting rest and certainty. Cost is visible in her exhausted “Tonight…” vow. Slight abstraction: we don’t see one named victim, keeping stakes panoramic rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—will she remain merely observer or become interpretive voice—tightens when alien emotion drifts within reach; refusal costs her former detachment. Escalation accumulates through denser emotional strata; final press of fossil forecloses solitude option under undeniable price. No coincidence; pressure coherent to Accumulative lens. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: prevent the warehouse from ossifying into meaninglessness. One meaningful tightening occurs when the accelerating hourglasses foreclose the option to wait—cataloguing must become public ritual now. Cost is legible: once the echo jar is opened and charts displayed, the archive is exposed to possible ridicacy, dilution, or loss of mystique—yet this gamble is the only remaining path. Agency is accretive rather than explosive, fitting the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—give Sarah’s evidence life before melt—is signaled inside the first 100 words. Escalation is single but meaningful: once Marcus sees the melt rate, the option to “keep hiding” evaporates on-page. Cost is visible: he trades anonymity for collective justice, foreclosing retreat. No coincidence resolves; Emma’s presence is set up by prior tavern chatter, keeping agency protagonist-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake: can meaning be distilled to one truth? Pressure escalates via fog-thickening sensory beats and ticking gutter countdown; silence = deadline. Woman’s agency = disclosure; coachman’s agency = gifting perspective that forecloses her search for single layer. Cost legible: she abandons distill-and-erase quest, he breaks 30-year silence rule—both paid on-page. No reversal beyond micro-turn, sufficient for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“why some places resist change”—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: kindness fragments accumulate until the beekeeper’s speech crystallizes the trade-off. Agency is cognitive (understanding, witnessing) rather than a tactical reversal; cost is conceptual, felt in the final lantern-glow chord. Sufficient tightening for length, though lacking a visible resource loss keeps it sub-exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—can imposed light make life sprout in permanent dusk—signals early and deepens when a neighbor covertly joins. Yet pressure plateaus: each fire-escape visit restates success rather than testing it with drought, vandalism, or mirror theft; escalation is additive, not consequential. The final image reweights possibility but no option is foreclosed, so cost feels prospective, not paid.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—translate isolation into independence—signals early and tightens when the blank book arrives: it demands she keep writing/being rewritten. One meaningful deepening: she realizes multiplicity is expansion, not fracture; this reweights her loneliness into agency under Accumulative lens. No external antagonist needed; pressure is ontological. Cost is visible—she embraces perpetual unfinishedness, shown by the library beginning her next book while she still breathes.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—her anonymity versus belonging—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened when Sena names her complicity. The act of threading her own letter into the spiral is the single decisive turn that forecloses ghostwriter invisibility; the cost is visible in the public exposure of her private fear. No coincidence resolves the tension; the spiral’s existence merely illuminates the conflict already pressing her. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes, acceptable under Accumulative lens, but a sharper micro-cost (a client’s letter she must now refuse?) would have nudged higher.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—prevent city-wide division via hijacked airwaves—is signaled early and tightened when Mara realizes the tricksters are “converging on the radio tower.” One meaningful turn suffices: she flips their game from chaos to pattern-solving by baiting them with her own encoded harmonics, a choice that visibly costs her calm (“she exhaled carefully”). Escalation is causal, not static; each new campus anomaly (colors, circuits, editorial) is a beat that raises stakes until she acts. Cost is conceptual but legible: she trades her anonymity for guardianship, accepting perpetual attention from entities that can bend reality.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaim freedom of movement—signaled in paragraph two and tightened when the disc rotates to reveal hidden channels, foreclosing secrecy. Escalation is accumulative: each organ note increases knowledge rather than danger, but the cost shifts from personal (claustrophobic panic) to civic (she will expose herself tomorrow). No coincidence; the organ is guardian, not deus ex machina. One meaningful deepening suffices for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—awaken dormant empathy to reopen the case—tightens once: the portrait’s completion forecloses Elena’s chance to ever “see” Catherine, trading her private blindness for public recognition. Cost is legible in the final ribbon hand-back and Morrison’s voice-breaking gratitude. Agency is attention and endurance, not confrontation; sufficient for Accumulative lens. No external antagonist needed; pressure is internal-ethical.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—prove reversible exile real—threads every beat; pressure tightens when Kao’s skepticism threatens institutional ridicule, then again when the hatch beneath them becomes the single live option. Cost is legible: abandonment of scientific legitimacy the moment they exit the air-lock. The escalation is single-tier; no second reversal, but the lens is causal and the tightening suffices for 800-word scale.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—permission for trapped beings to resolve—signalled in hitchhiker’s thesis and tightened by Mara’s translation act; cost is her physical exhaustion and irreversible flake loss. Escalation accrues through sensory sharpening rather than option narrowing; pattern break ( world resolution increasing) reweights stake effectively under Accumulative lens. Agency sits entirely in her decision to keep playing; no outside rescue. Missing one on-page obstacle mid-process (no pushback or self-doubt) keeps this just shy of 8+ band for fuller pressure-test.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: can the circle of criminal inheritance be broken? Signal appears in line 3. Escalation is one meaningful tightening: father’s request to learn the markers forces Marco to decide whether to arm his father with the very knowledge that keeps him safe. The price—loss of absolute secrecy—is legible on page. No reversal, but none required; coincidence is absent. Under causal lens, each because-link narrows options until the final standoff inside the sanctuary.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: decode the temple inscriptions without repeating Ashwin’s isolation-driven despair. Tightening occurs when Mara realizes the code is intentionally choral; that knowledge forecloses solo publication and makes shared authorship the only non-lethal path. Cost is legible: Ashwin’s death and the daylily’s brittleness embody the price of refusal. Agency is intellectual—choosing co-authorship—but the beat lands as renunciation of prior identity, satisfying the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—retrieve the apprentice—signaled in para 2. Escalation is situational pressure: spiral tightens, song hammers the frozen moment, scream finally tears loose, dropping body toward water cost is felt. Agency is Maren’s decision to switch from comfort-song to war-song; that pivot reweights stakes from rescue to confrontation with self-lie. Price paid: apprentice’s humiliation and Maren’s solitary exit—both foreclose future ease.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—”write a new covenant”—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: the future’s early arrival collapses prep time, forcing the scar-link gamble. Cost is announced (“we can still guide it”) but not dramatized; no tangible loss (blood, time, memory) is paid on the page, keeping pressure abstract. Escalation is thus conceptual, not visceral—sufficient for lyric mode but not for causal high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—can you return a soul you rented?—is signaled early and tightens when the reversal flops. Agency sits with the Oracle: she initiates the confession, hands over the card, models acceptance. Joy-as-wasps is a visceral price that alters tactics (no second swap). Escalation is single but sufficient; no artificial reversals, just the dawning that residue is permanent.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—recovering epistemic authority—surfaces early and tightens through bottle test; the Ming failure supplies persistent constraint shaping tactics (refuse quick guess). Escalation is one meaningful deepening: shift from factual recital to felt verdict; pressure coherent under situational lens. Cost is legible: he forsakes former identity shield, embracing risk of being wrong again. No reversible reversals, but single turn suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“how to preserve wonder without tomorrow”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when Maris hands the stranger a scroll whose unbuildable lighthouse literalizes the stakes. Agency is accretive: each gear-turn and molten-fish adds density rather than causal reversals, but the final image forces stance crystallization with visible cost (identity metal forever swimming, never arriving). No coincidence resolves tension; the moon’s mechanical pull is accepted fate, not luck. Price is paid in obsolete passports reduced to art; options are conceptually foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—what survival costs the soul—signaled by shrine in paragraph 3. One meaningful deepening: realization that bunker is mausoleum of relinquished beauty tightens his purpose from audit to restoration. Agency is renunciation/acceptance of custodial crown; price is perpetual exposure to others’ grief. Escalation is textural: light density and artifact warmth increase until refusal of old detachment is the only stance left.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—access grandmother’s silenced truth—tightens when cipher coordinates demand precise observation; one mis-mapping would erase the volume. Propagation-delay rule raises cost of error; “many seekers never returned” hints stakes yet stays abstract. No external antagonist, but internal dread (“eyes burned”) and ethical recalibration suffice. Escalation is single-cycle: deeper shelves → warmer book → revelation → renunciation; cost legible in shaken hands and reframed quest.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—truth vs survival of evidence—tightens once: the two futures seen in coffee force her to invent a third (encrypted leak) that costs her credibility. Pressure is legible; cost is felt; no reversal beyond that single crystallizing beat, sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—snatch last spark before dawn—signals early and tightens once when aurora peaks and mirrors must be angled now. Agency is renunciation/endurance: Lyra never abandons her thermal knife-edge; cost is the steady drain of vigilance and the knowledge the beauty will vanish at sunrise. No false escalation; pressure is accumulative luminosity rather than causal reversals. Could use one tactile loss (stiff fingers, cracked oil jar) to push into high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—finding the “source of contentment”—is signaled early and tightens when the woman’s unveiled face collapses the possibility of external resolution. Escalation is textural: each monthly ascent adds rhetorical layers (“vineyard hush,” “antique hairpin”) until the reveal forces a stance crystallization. The cost is conceptual but legible: Keiko must abandon the hope that forgiveness will finish her grief. No causal reversals are required under the Accumulative lens; one deepening is sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single dominant stake—can she abandon black-white certainty—tightens when the keeper reframes the shard’s emptiness as “transformed.” One meaningful turn: handing the shard over, then leaving it. Cost is the forfeiture of her lucrative old identity. Coincidence absent; escalation is internal but legible under Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—imparting the art of vanishing—remains abstract; the only tightening is the student’s half-trance glimpse of “still points,” but no live option is foreclosed and no visible price (fatigue, risk) is paid. Escalation is tonal rather than tactical; pressure plateaus after the first ripple demonstration.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preserve resonance network—signals early; escalation is the deepening recognition that the third tower’s fracture is irreversible without weeks of stillness, foreclosing wandering freedom. Protagonist agency is attention/renunciation rather than physical battle; the tightening is conceptual but legible. Cost is the surrender of motion, paid in the closing turn. No coincidence; pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens. Sufficient for length, though acceleration is gentle rather than sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—proving human effort matters—tightens through accumulating physical cost (cold, pack welts, time) under Accumulative lens; no external antagonist needed. Agency is continuous: each failed spell deepens fatigue and sharpens attention, narrowing options toward pure presence. The meaningful escalation is the moment ordinary limestone answers her breath; options are reweighted, not broadened. Cost is visible on the page—“body grew numb,” indentations carved into flesh—meeting high-band legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: can Mara complete her grandfather’s luminous vow before the tide and ceremony end? Escalation is density-driven: each lamp lit tightens the contrast between sky spectacle and her unseen dive. One meaningful turn—she slips inside the hull—narrows options: retreat is now impossible without abandoning the algae archive. Price is felt: lungs burn, lamp dies, she re-emerges “lamp extinguished,” a literal and figurative loss of light that charges the final re-visioning of lanterns as music.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—immortal loneliness vs. mortal love—tightens once: the atlas discovery escalates from curiosity to inherited curse, forcing the renunciation. Agency is present: Mira’s decision to leave Daniel is dramatized on-page with the crystallizing kiss. Cost is legible: forfeiture of shared future, replaced by atlas-monster grief she must carry. No external antagonist needed; internal pressure under causal lens suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restoring the ocean—tightens through the drip-count pattern; the 7/11 cadence becomes a live clock that forecloses shortcuts. The bell-rebuild is the visible trade-off: hours of tepid magic spent instead of grander spells, tangible price on the page. No coincidence; escalation is purely accumulative until the upward mist reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: will Marcus remain the guardian of erasure or become witness to resurrection?  Pressure escalates through each photograph—one more step toward complicity with memory.  The drought is external circumstance, but the trail forces an internal narrowing: keep watching or keep listening.  Cost is visible when he sits on the cold concrete—he forfeits the clean absolution of forgetting.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—prove the Academy wrong—tightens once when the starling murmuration physically rewrites her formula in mid-air, foreclosing the option to finish by reason alone. Cost is visible: the glowing vial at her breast is a persistent constraint—she cannot publish without exposing her sentimental source. Escalation is purely accumulative: each impossible image (orchard, crystal, birds) deepens density until the cadence snaps into the final note. No causal reversals are needed; the pattern break is the tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake = who will parent the child; signaled in line 3. Escalation is one tightening: the either/or custody question narrows to joint custody plus the jar as living third pole. Cost is legible—Kira admits she will use her numbness as a tool, accepting ethical risk. Agency sits with Kira’s proposal and Clone-Kira’s consent; no coin-flip resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve creative space versus solve tempting puzzle—tightens at seed-ID beat; escalation is one-step but sufficient for length. Visible price: surrender of “the hush of a possibility just born” (future puzzles) to warn others. Coincidence only complicates (anonymous mail) and does not resolve. Cost clarity is high; tactics pivot from solitary curiosity to communal protection.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—restore household sound—is signaled early. Pressure escalates texturally: each gust layers memory-noise onto silence, tightening the felt cost of quiet. No reversal or trade-off is forced; the leaf blower runs out of gas but presents no dilemma, only opportunity. The cost is atmospheric, not tactical—options are never narrowed, only emotions reweighted.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—library survival—signaled in paragraph four; pressure tightens as dream assimilation threatens her ability to act at all. One meaningful deepening: when mist and memories fuse, the option to retreat vanishes—she must either dissolve or break the pendant. Cost is legible: surrender of her sole free form. Agency is renunciation rather than attack, fitting Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—validate or escape her father’s legacy—is signaled early and tightens when she chooses forbidden vivification rites. One meaningful escalation: the paste glowing → living shoots breach the fracture, foreclosing any return to “repair.” Cost is visible—her own blood in the mix, seventeen years already spent. Pressure is coherent under causal lens; coincidence never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“find a non-hollow translation”—is signaled early; the single meaningful tightening occurs when she pivots to “absence rather than presence,” narrowing interpretive options; cost is conceptual (old method abandoned) rather than viscerally paid, so ceiling is mid-8s.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—ferry’s existential cohesion—signals by paragraph 2 and tightens once: phasing forces the merge choice. Agency is clear: Mateo decides to “follow the patterns” and steers the confluence; Torres obeys. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral—the ferry’s perpetual transience is foreclosed—but the price is visible in the sideways sand. No secondary loss (injury, social credit) dramatizes the trade-off, keeping the escalation just shy of the 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are announced early—recover her dissolving memories—and tighten when each loop of sinew forcibly re-edits a past relationship, trading certainty for deeper truth; the cost is visible in the altered memories themselves, though the escalation is more textured accretion than sharp reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can Carta learn to perceive impossible starlight?—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened once: when she hands over the anchor, she commits to potential madness. Escalation is textural rather than causal: each mention of “light that remembers” increases density until the final trench reveal forecloses retreat to surface logic. Cost is visible—the warm anchor against her palm marks surrender of old epistemic tools. No reversals needed under Accumulative lens; one meaningful deepening suffices. Agency sits in attention and acceptance, not confrontation, fitting the somber marvel tone.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—rescue Lily from unseen abuser—is signaled by line 4 (“isolated, manipulated”). Escalation is a single deepening: spectral warning → live bruise; options narrow from “track signal” to “shelter Lily now.” Cost is conceptual but legible: Lily’s bruise and whispered “I thought I was going crazy” make the danger undeniable. Agency sits with Mira’s assurance that reframes the threat, yet the external abuser remains off-stage, slightly softening visceral pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—give Kove posthumous credit—faces a live clock: six hours until flood. Escalation is tide-driven, not character-choice-driven; the tightening is external compression rather than a forked decision she can mis-make. The phase transition forces the camera burst, but agency is reactive; cost is environmental, not moral. Still, the tide’s retreat/flood cadence is coherent and singular, satisfying the 8-band requirement for a visible price that alters options.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—guilt vs. absolution—signaled early; pressure tightens when standard recovery fails and ink ritual becomes last option. Escalation is accumulative: each ink spill deepens stakes rather than reversing them. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral—loss of self-blame—but legible on page. No external antagonist; internal conflict suffices for length.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: porcelain shard moves from relic of failure to emblem of reinterpreted courage. No explicit moralizing; final line’s “whole in its brokenness” offers conceptual repricing. Subtext operates in silence—heartbeat cessation equals acceptance. Ambiguity lingers: Chen’s heroism doesn’t erase Mira’s pain, avoiding tidy redemption.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—save the language—signaled in paragraph two. One meaningful tightening: the diamond overheats, forcing her to complete the work in a single night; time narrows, options foreclose. Escalation is textural/accumulative under the inferred lens: each translated tower adds harmonic density until the canyon itself becomes speaker. Visible price is dramatized in her depleted veins and abraded skin.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—rekindle wonder—faces mechanical order; tightening occurs when the statues physically react, narrowing Mira’s safety. Escalation is textural/accumulative: each resonant note layers risk until the violin fractures. Agency remains hers, but the cost (instrument destroyed, statues mobilised) is legible on-page. One further intermediate obstacle or consequence beat would have pushed higher.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single dominant stake—sneak mail across a drone-patrolled border—tightens once when the null-field is deployed, foreclosing the option of open movement. Cost is tacit: Maren’s own life is “contained” like the storm, visible in final image rather than paid in scene. Escalation is modest but coherent under causal lens; no reversal, yet options narrow decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—proving broken things can sing—signals early and tightens once: the halo fragment either crowns the sculpture or remains scrap. Escalation is quiet but real: the crown’s first spin audibly layers music onto bells, foreclosing the option of leaving the piece static. Cost is felt (endless future labor, the unreachable finish), yet pressure stays internal and situational rather than antagonistic. Sufficient for length, but lacks external test or resource loss beyond time itself.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—“find the place where stories live”—is early and stable; escalation is density-driven rather than option-narrowing. No reversals or tangible losses occur; patrons do not interrupt or threaten failure. The only tightening is the atmosphere thickening and lamplight bending, which reweights perception but not tactics. Cost is conceptual, not visceral—acceptable under Accumulative lens but keeps score mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are clear: find Theo / keep library / not disappear. Pressure deepens sequentially—failed decryption, dawn chases, cave discovery—but the tightening is textural (overlay finally aligns) rather than a live trade-off; disappearance is embraced, not forced, so cost is poetic, not viscerally tested on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—free the idea her sister died for—is signalled early and escalates through one meaningful tightening: the rotating streets erase retreat, forcing Mara to decode or be lost. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral—she accepts dissolution of ordinary space—but the price is legible on the page. Agency is present (she walks the combination herself), yet the locksmith’s off-stage omnipotence lightly dilates pressure. Coincidence complicates but never resolves, satisfying lens guardrails.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“can she keep her memories?”—tightens through accumulation, not causal reversals: each recovered sensory shard raises the cost of hoarding them. The single decisive turn is the pluck: it narrows her option from extraction to ingestion, foreclosing detached documentation. Price is on-page: fungal network surges, memories re-inhabit her body with “sharp-sweet cider” taste. Under lyric/accumulative lens this one intensification is sufficient, but a second visible forfeiture (e.g., damaged research notes) would have nudged into 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: can exile reverse? Pressure tightens when Finn touches the shard and the shadow ripples—knowledge that banishment might be two-way narrows their emotional options. No external antagonist; tension is internal/relational. Cost is conceptual but legible: archivist confesses ongoing fear, Finn commits to reading his own geometry—path foreclosed, new stance assumed.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserve the color of wonder—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens once: the golden-green resists, then flows, narrowing her bodily reserve and bleeding thumb as price. Agency is continuous—every coaxing whisper and blood payment alters the essence’s willingness. No coincidence resolves; the final planting is an irreversible forfeiture of her own future share in wonder. Cost is repeatedly felt (knee ache, chill, fatigue) and culminates in the seed’s charged luminescence she will never taste.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—can the vault’s silence be read rather than feared—tightens once the stone’s rotation is measured; options narrow from preservation to answering. Escalation is textural: dual footage, cracked question-mark, open door—each layer reweights the same stake rather than introducing new threats. The cost is conceptual but legible: she abandons the safety of archival detachment and steps into the literal gap. Agency is present yet quiet—her final act is to walk through the torn map, foreclosing sealed-dread forever.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: give voice to the voiceless, signaled in para 2. Pressure tightens once: ghost’s loneliness becomes intolerable to Moth, forcing mural commit; cost = perpetual nomadism. No coincidence; escalation is density of unspoken needs she accumulates. Agency = encode act; refusal to stay and be celebrated forecloses rest. Under Accumulative lens, cadence shift from solitary listening to city-wide electrical pulse reweights stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: risk feeling vs. safe numbness, signaled paragraph 2. Tightening occurs at each floor reveal; knowledge that captain chose hope escalates pressure. Final turn at tenth floor forecloses bureaucratic safety; cost is immediate—she forfeits warm bed, pension. Agency drives escalation under causal lens; no coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—prove clouds feel—remains abstract but tightens through each cloud specimen; virga supplies the sad micro-cost. No live clock or resource lost, so cost is conceptual rather than visceral; still, the categorizing labor narrows her professional future. Escalation is pattern-deepening, not reversal, coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: can tactile precision transcend face-blindness to birth a personhood on canvas? Escalation is textural—each coin-rub, each failed glance at the painting, thickens the dread that the answer is no. The single meaningful tightening arrives when she adds the star-reflection: an admission that the portrait will never cross the recognition threshold. Cost is conceptual—her method’s ceiling is exposed, foreclosing future commissions of this kind.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—survive while pursuing hidden cartography—signalled early. One meaningful tightening: the moment she matches hopscotch numbers to port sequence and sees the light below; options narrow to covert continuation. Cost is future danger and moral complicity; price visible in her decision to lie to Hendrik. Agency is attention/notation rather than overt defiance, sufficient for 750-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can a ghost prevent social fracture—is signaled in para 1. One meaningful tightening: chalk messages move from barter prompts (“Who has water?”) to mandatory convocation (“Meet at the third arch Tuesday dawn”), forcing physical convergence under floating arch. Cost is legible: settlers relinquish hoarded scraps; Mara relinquishes anonymity. Escalation is accumulative, not causal-reversal, but pattern break at week two reweights stakes cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—humanity’s survival mediated through her ritual—is declared early and tightened once: the 3-minute move to midnight. The on-page pressure is atmospheric rather than tactical; she experiences bruised awe, not external opposition. Escalation is a density shift—repetition of “nested patterns” and “falling dominoes of light” intensifies the abstract cost rather than narrowing physical options. The decision is renunciation: she accepts perpetual uncertainty, a stasis that forecloses escape; price is felt in the final beam’s solitude, satisfying the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“guide strangers before frost/birds kill them”—tightens via visible frost creep and audible wing-beats. One meaningful deepening: the second nut drops mid-flight, forcing recalculation under literal countdown. Price is legible: perpetual bond to the orchard, accepted in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—will she scatter or hoard the ashes—signals early; pressure tightens when foam insight narrows her options to the multi-path ritual. Agency is present: her physical act disperses the ashes and forecloses avoidance. Cost is visible (empty urn, chrysalis relic) but not persistent; no future constraint is seeded. Escalation is single-cycle, sufficient for 600-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—can a past be un-written?—is signaled early; pressure tightens when Vera refuses payment and instead demands the parolee ingest absence, foreclosing the option of simple transaction. Cost is legible in the man’s trembling and the library’s physical shift, but escalation is single-note; no further trade-off complicates the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—prevent collective emotional annihilation—is signaled early (“subsume everything”). Escalation is textural: each tasted memory sharpens the danger of contagion until the final softening. Maron’s agency drives every beat; no coincidences. Visible price is his solitary tear, but the broader cost (will he be infected later?) is only hinted, keeping it from the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—re-weave a fractured valley—tightens once: isolated hums become dialoguing chords. Price is present but soft: the stolen weight is abstract until the final smile; no personal repercussion yet on-page. Agency is hers, yet opposition is absent, so escalation is atmospheric rather than contested. The tightening is meaningful under Accumulative lens—density of song layers—but lacks a visible, felt price that alters her body or status.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—recover lost dreams via neural rewiring—tightens once: the mirror’s spectrum moment forecloses retreat by making the pathways manifest, forcing Elena from observer to bridge. Cost is conceptual but legible: she accepts custodianship of an ocean of unchosen destinies, a responsibility that reconfigures her prior scientific identity. Pressure accumulates rather than reverses, fitting the lyric/accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—harvest the seeds of vigilance before gravity rights itself—is signaled early and tightened by the live one-hour clock. Agency is continuous: she grips, pulls, moves deeper, touches the stone, each act narrowing physical and cognitive options. The inversion’s physics supply escalating pressure rather than external antagonist; cost is the irreversible cognitive burn she carries out. No coincidence resolves the conflict—her final stance is earned endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are poetic (resurrect world-song) but pressure is atmospheric, not tactical; wind and dawn arrive externally, so the tightening is a reveal of success rather than a narrowing of options—no live risk or forfeiture on page—hence escalation stays gentle, accumulative, rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preventing another generation’s binding—tightens when Kavir realizes consent itself is void if silence is unread. Agency drives the escalation: he actively relinquishes strategy, presses flesh to earth, and chooses testimony through the heir. Visible price: eternal outsider status confirmed in final solitude. No cap triggered; escalation is coherent under Causal lens and cost is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—recovering the sister’s voice without violence—tightens when Marlow realizes the clasp is a conversation frozen in metal; the price is her own silence afterward. Agency drives every beat: tuning, speaking, renouncing. Cost is visible: she forfeits immediate knowledge and bears the diary’s weight unopened. Escalation is single-crescendo rather than iterative, adequate at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.5)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—locate the source of orchard resilience—tightens when the echo-vision forecloses all other paths: only the convergence point matters now. Gravity inversion functions as coherent pressure; failure to follow the water stream would mean pod loss, a felt price. The discovery itself is passive (she watches, then pockets), so the escalation plateaus rather than apexes. Add one active trade-off—jettison pod stabilizer to reach the sphere—and this crests 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—prove wonder essential—signaled in paragraph 2; pressure tightens when Council votes to melt bells. The aurora-chisel moment is the meaningful turn: it triggers the cavern response, narrowing options to “record proof or fail.” Cost is legible: Mira risks freezing, forfeits her belief that bells create wonder, and carries data whose authority she can’t control. Escalation is coherent under causal lens; coincidence (chisel strike) complicates, does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—harvest meaning from fifteen-year failure—tightens when silence literally folds. Escalation is textural: quiet deepens from absence to presence, then ruptures. Agency is renunciation/endurance: she forfeits monastery return by stepping through. Cost is legible—driftwood consumed, canyon hush broken, world left behind—but only one tightening beat; flute’s second use merely extends, not complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—map emotional math before the last star dies—tightens as each star wink removes time. The halo fragment’s warmth and the successful equation crystallize a visible price: she trades her last self-bit for data. Escalation is textural density, not causal reversals, fitting the lens; cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake is Kael’s need to deliver without touching, yet each vibration forces tactile social contact; the pattern intensifies until the final reconfiguration accepts permanent entanglement. One meaningful tightening occurs at the ridge summit: dawn threatens aurora, the Keeper hands back the pendant, and the option to remain a detached courier is foreclosed. Cost is visible—he loses schedule purity and accepts lifelong pollinator duty. Under Accumulative lens, the escalation is a density shift rather than causal chain, and it reweights the stake cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—Elena’s last chance for academic legitimacy—tightens when the skeptical gatekeeper offers alliance. Pressure escalates via the frost reveal, not external antagonist; coincidence (frost forming legible images) complicates rather than rescues. Agency shifts: Elena asks for help; Hartley accepts public risk. Cost is legible: Hartley confesses grief-car ownership; both face committee censure.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—retrieve Kenji—signaled in paragraph 4. One meaningful tightening: final thread locks the pattern, forcing the sacrifice. Cost is legible in the crossing and amber pulse. Pressure is accumulative/textural: each shuttle pass adds weight until the fabric itself humes with consequence. No false coincidence; escalation is steady under the loom’s rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—planet-death vs staying to heal—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightened when the council debate is rejected in favour of subterranean conduits. One meaningful escalation: the magician’s memory extraction converts unknown root geometry into actionable forge plan, narrowing options from “try something” to “thread exact channels.” Cost accumulates: stamina, social credit (others think her mad), the silk’s spent magic. Closure crystallizes the stake: first bud proves viability, but the scale of remaining work keeps pressure alive.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—retrieve Mira vs. preserve multiverse—arrives at 25% mark. Escalation is iterative: each 17-min cycle tightens the perceptual vise (copper → honey → ash) until the final conversation collapses the rescue option. The price is dramatized: Kael’s palm bleeds, her map expands “one final time,” and she renounces the shard. Agency is present in the renunciation; luck never intervenes.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—keeping the light/chain alive—tightens when the lamp dies, forcing Vera from observer to participant. Single meaningful turn: she chooses to write, paying the cost of her anonymity. Escalation is causal under lens; no coincidence resolves the problem. Cost is visible: she surrenders her private talisman and her privacy.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—keep the boundary intact—signals early via the clipping quote. Stakes deepen when the light actually bends backward, narrowing Kael's option to perpetual lonely ritual; price is the lifelong sentence of "still laughing, still prophetic." Agency is present—each wick micro-degree is a conscious steering—but externalized in lyric register rather than fraught dilemma, so the cost, while visible, is felt more conceptually than viscerally. Under Accumulative lens the tightening is the single beam that reweights meaning; it suffices for this length, though a second iteration of risk could have pushed higher.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—will Mira master the unwanted magnetism or be consumed—is signaled early and deepens when Chen reveals the heart’s residual listening. One meaningful tightening: the offer to stay forecloses the option of returning to her former anonymity; cost is legible in the forfeiture implied by “the valley filled with mist” below her. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens via intensifying light patterns; no reversal, but deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: prevent maze from becoming sentient archive of unfiltered sorrow; each extraction tightens the threat. Escalation is accretive—branch after branch, sorrow unit after unit—rather than a single reversal; cumulative weight is the pressure. Visible price: dream-amber physically removed, tree returned to “simple wood,” meaning Mara permanently strips the maze of its witness; ethical cost is hers to bear. Agency is continuous; no coincidence resolves anything. Lacks a second tightening pivot, keeping score in low 8s.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—reignite a realm—is signaled early and deepened by communal song-pressure. One meaningful intensification occurs when ribbons tighten around the oak and darkness thins to pearl; options for the world, not Elora, are reweighted. Cost is present—her exhaustion crack in voice—but the price is aesthetic, not tactical; no resource is lost or path closed for her personally. Escalation remains lyrical and diffuse, adequate for Accumulative lens but lacking a visible trade-off that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—how to love without disappearing—signals early and tightens once when the elderly woman reframes the mistake, narrowing Iris’s options to “stay by choosing when to go.” Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens: each paradoxical image (invitation arriving unseen, library larger than physics allows) increases density until the final reconfiguration. Cost is visible: Iris accepts that presence will now include moments of necessary absence, forfeiting the total safety of withdrawal. No off-stage resolution; coincidence (door unlocks) complicates rather than solves.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—how to respond to a city that deletes itself—tightens when Mira realizes documentation alone is complicit stasis. The sunflower seeds foreclose that option, forcing her toward public, vulnerable action. Cost is legible: she leaves the sanctuary of secrecy and accepts the risk that her plantings may be paved over or ignored. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the pattern break (from recording to cultivating) is the requisite intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—documenting vow-decay vs. hope of permanence—tightens through each frequency reading; the 528 Hz outlier is the single decisive intensification. Because lens is Accumulative, escalation is density/pattern break, not external jeopardy; cost is existential, paid by Maren’s rewritten life-mission. Would edge higher if one slide had threatened immediate physical consequence (meltdown, quota deadline) to force a riskier micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—father’s name vs. survival—declared in graf 1; pressure tightens when playback starts and live witnesses might become executioners. Agency sits with Nelle: she triggers the reveal, sets terms, and shoulders exile. Escalation is knowledge-based under causal lens: each sentence narrows Crenshaw’s options until “until sunrise” is his only bid. Irreversible price is legible—her market friendships evaporate by dawn, signaled by faces that “would forget hers by dawn.”

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—“why some people carry weather”—is signaled early and reiterated. Pressure escalates texturally: tastes layer (copper, cardamom, cinnamon, lime, lavender) as aurora brightens, tightening the sensorial noose. Yet the decisive turn hangs on a single spoken insight (“maybe I’m just a messenger”) rather than a choice that costs either sibling anything tangible; the storm dissolves without tangible consequence. No live option is foreclosed; the tightening is aesthetic, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—uncork creativity or remain mummified by perfect recall—tightens when the hidden screaming self-portrait forces Elena to choose: duplicate mother’s erasure or overwrite it. The decisive escalation is the moment she pulls charcoal and attacks the limestone, narrowing options irreversibly. Cost is legible in bleeding fingers and sacrificed anonymity. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative/Textural lens; one meaningful intensification suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—"find where lost conversations go"—tightens when the map proves the Archive exists, then deepens when Mira realizes delivery, not collection, is the remaining path. One meaningful deepening suffices; agency stays hers (she folds the map into her pocket, volunteers). Cost is felt: lifelong exposure to surface lies she must now re-enter. Coincidence (grandmother link) complicates rather than rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can sound replace failed words without losing truth?—is signaled in paragraph two. Escalation is accumulative: each bell’s water-coat deepens undertones, tightening the stakes until perfection is foreclosed. Cost is the ice itself—half gone by dusk—paid on-page. No reversal, but the deepening pattern reweights the premise under Accumulative lens; pilgrim arrival is complication, not resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—end the static prison—is signaled early and tightened twice: the failed miniaturization, then the burial that forecloses erasure. Cost is felt (photo buried, nostalgia accepted), but the price is more conceptual than visceral, holding the score just below the 8.2+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—collective survival vs. developer eviction—announced early and escalates through shared testimony, each beat tightening legal-cultural noose. Agency is collective: Marissa’s decision to gather and reveal evidence forecloses silence; cost is legible in Thomas’s hush and Abernathy’s tremor. One deepening suffices for 700-word span; coincidence merely seeds, never saves.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—free tomorrow’s seventeen—signalled early; each decoded patrol tightens the noose around possibility. One visible cost: she must surface before shift-change, leaving the only safe place, proving the tactic is not consequence-free. Escalation is causal under lens: every decrypted page forces her to invent a riskier medium (first journal, then dance) to stay ahead of interception. No abstract stakes; all on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recover deleted memories—surfaces in paragraph 5 and tightens when flowers spiral toward the heart, foreclosing retreat: enter or abandon quest forever. Agency remains constant: each gravity shift physically tests her commitment, culminating in the irreversible cut. Cost is visible—she trades corporeal life for mnemonic stasis—yet the escalation is single-cycle; no secondary reversal compounds pressure. Still, the one meaningful deepening satisfies short-form bandwidth under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—keep the valley from screaming its buried name—is signaled early and tightens through each fold and whisper. Escalation is textural: density of silence increases until the final release forecloses the prophecy’s awakening. Agency is renunciation rather than confrontation; the cost is her perpetual vigilance and anonymity. No coincidence; pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—will Elena admit her innate “language of decay” and accept custodianship—signals early and tightens when Mrs. Kovac reveals Moss’s hidden grammar. Escalation is micro but decisive: the inscription lie exposed → Elena's confession → seal transfer → city’s audible approval. Agency sits with Elena: she could flee, but opens her hand to the seal’s weight. The cost is conceptual rather than visceral—her camouflage of Latin student is gone—but still legible. One beat, one shift suffices for 700-word scope; pressure lands cleanly under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—keep memory alive without triggering resonance—tightens when the state invitation threatens to standardize her method. One meaningful deepening: the shell whisper grows louder as dawn nears, forcing the decision. Agency is renunciation, not defeat; the price is permanent outsider status. Cost is visible on-page: “the morning star beginning its fade” as she writes refusal.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—village survival vs. personal execution—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the Magistrate appears. The final transfer of the key forecloses the option of ever again pretending the forgeries are unsanctioned; the price is the Magistrate’s impending loss of office. One meaningful deepening is sufficient and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure tightens through Accumulative lens: each shell disclosure layers guilt and responsibility, narrowing Mara's options from private grief to public song. The cost—raw throat, vowed return—grounds the shift; no reversal but a deepening that makes silence unaffordable.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—deliver a mother’s undelivered love—tightens when Maya names Katherine and decides to drive to Evelyn; this single deepening forecloses the option to remain mere salvager. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens: each whisper, dream, candle adds density until the glacier itself seems to exhale cost. No abstract stakes; the price is the ache Maya carries upward in the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: rescue generational knowledge before it unravels. Pressure tightens when the apprentice’s “ruined” net forces Kenji to choose—demonstrate hidden effort or let shame sever the chain. His decision to hand back the half-mended net (visible cost) escalates under Accumulative lens: pattern-break of perfect repair shifts to pattern-reveal of imperfect learning. Enough for 8+ band; lacked a second external consequence (lost catch/ income) that could have pushed higher.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. miracle—surfaces in para 1 and tightens once: the dig choice forecloses her public reputation if she hides evidence. Cost is visible (risk of irradiation, ethical compromise) but not escalated by a ticking counter or antagonist push-back; pressure plateaus rather than spikes. Agency remains hers throughout; coincidence is absent. Sufficient for length, yet that single, level escalation keeps it shy of the 8.8 tier.</answer>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
    <comment>Theme emerges organically: knowledge as double-edged comfort—people need lies to live, experts need truth to matter, and sometimes both needs collide. The final image (clean circle hidden in toxic ground) re-weights earlier orchard reverence without moralizing. Subtextual irony stings: Vera defeats mysticism only to seed a new, gentler myth herself. Complexity stays intact; no tidy moral is pronounced, although the “uncomfortable truth” line edges toward thesis-statement and is the only soft echo.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.6)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: salvage vanishing sound-memory. Tightening occurs when the box’s lullaby emerges—knowledge that the song can be returned to townspeople narrows her option to hoard. Agency: she chooses to gift the box, paying social/story cost. Price visible: surrender of artifact and exposure of her hidden craft.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single dominant stake—protect absolution chamber—tightens through three causal ratchets: key found, outsiders silent-approaching, re-tuning must happen before last light. Agency is continuous: Meris engineers the solution with embodied tools under real clock. Cost is visible: lifelong somatic guardianship; the option of walking away is foreclosed the instant she strikes the fork. No coincidence; escalation is because/therefore linkage under Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—prove lunar mapping’s worth to the council—signaled early. Pressure tightens via weather: freezing rain shifts viaduct magnetics, forcing recalculation; failure means data corruption. No antagonist needed; the lake ice itself becomes the test surface. Cost is visible: numbness, sleep forfeiture, social isolation. One meaningful deepening suffices; the pattern of nightly accumulation makes the final dawn alignment the decisive turn.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (justice for Malcolm vs. career survival) is signaled by line 7. Pressure tightens when Elena spots fresh symbols matching Malcolm’s apartment—this micro-turn forecloses the “accident” theory and forces her to choose complicity or exposure. Cost is visible: she uploads files to journalists before leaving the tunnel, trading seven years of patronage for moral clarity. The escalation is linear, not deepened, but at 750 words one meaningful tightening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake is Eliana’s need to redeem a lethal misjudgment; the tightening occurs when the grandfather’s letter collapses her certainty and forces a public, unpaid restoration. Cost is visible: months of artisan labor donated to the prison that once held Samuel. Pressure is accumulative/textural—each gear she lifts reweights her prior arrogance—rather than external antagonism, fitting the quiet lens.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“hear the bell no one hears”—is signaled early and tightens once: the new pattern locks coordinates, foreclosing retreat. Escalation is accumulative: each kaleidoscope tweak thickens the sensory density until the bell materializes; the price is opportunity cost (she abandons safe scrap-island trade routes). Agency is present but friction-light; no tangible loss or tool breakage occurs, keeping the score sub-8.8. Still, the irreversible launch supplies a felt cost under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—find the disappeared—tightens when 1408 pattern proves invitation, not glitch, forcing her to choose reportage or transcendence. One meaningful deepening: voice files reveal crew uploaded, narrowing her option to join. Cost is conceptual but legible: she forfeits corporeal life for data-immortality. Agency is internal (decision to upload) yet final; coincidence only complicates earlier, never resolves.</question>
    <question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges without sermon: digital afterlife as siren call, the cost of perfect memory. 1408 and patch move from clues to invitation, reweighting meaning at close. Subtext in “sensed absence” and “hollow” implies bereavement technology can’t name. Final image—archive room auto-populates file #18—offers quiet, non-literal answer: memory keeper becomes memory.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: find the thread that dissolves Voss-Henriksen hatred without self-annihilation. Escalation is accumulative: each mirrored glimpse tightens the emotional archaeology until the revelation about Astrid reweights all prior grievances. The price is visibly legible—Maren’s shadows acquire starlight, a permanent texture that constrains future mediation. No reversal is required; the deepening of knowledge is the decisive intensification that forecloses Thomas’s nihilistic path.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is Marcus’s need for Elena to recognize their failure as generative; pressure ratchets through the vineyard parable that redefines failure as destiny. Tightening occurs when the metaphor flips from excuse to gift, narrowing options to acceptance rather than reunion. Cost is felt in their dawn separation and the unspoken forfeiture of a second chance. Agency stays with Marcus throughout; escalation is conceptual but coherent under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—preserve the prophet’s clearings—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: Senna’s recognition that direct scrutiny collapses the spaces forces her to act through sideways attention, a tactical narrowing. Cost is conceptual (eternal maintenance vigil) rather than visceral; the price is legible but not felt in body or resource loss, keeping it shy of 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—can grief be turned into shared future images?—is signaled early. Pressure escalates accumulatively: each added sketch narrows the possibility of private retreat, but no individual faces a fork where completion costs them a concrete forfeiture. The tightening is collective, not personal; hence cost is diffuse, legible but not acute.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—whether to defend or release language—tightens once: the Council looms, the crystal reveals compression, Elara decides to testify. The cost is conceptual (loss of old words) rather than visceral, but it is legible on the page under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“capture the sound of growing older before he forgets it forward”—is signaled in first third. Escalation is Accumulative: each driftwood pointer adds a future loss, compressing possibility until chalk snaps. Cost is visible: chalk dust on fingers, backwards text shrinking to nothing. The tightening forecloses the option of permanent preservation; only temporary monument remains.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—record the moon’s leaving—signaled in opening paragraph; acceleration tightens once with “already infinitesimally farther.” Kenji’s agency: redirect rather than resist; this narrowing choice costs the possibility of stasis. Price visible: he surrenders the hope of freezing moments. Under Causal lens, escalation coherent; no coincidence resolves. Could edge higher if a second resource loss altered tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—father/daughter reconciliation—is signaled early and tightens through the vinyl fragment and ticking trans-Pacific clock. Single meaningful deepening occurs when Maya reframes the task from “flawless goodbye” to “write the pancakes,” shifting Mr. Chen’s tactics from surgical perfection to authentic memory. Cost is present but oblique: the vinyl will never physically fuse, audible in the “tinny” phone Vivaldi; the tearful letter is the visible price. Pressure operates under accumulative lens—each musical metaphor adds weight—yet no live option is foreclosed for Maya, keeping escalation modest.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“where do shadows go?”—is signaled early and tightens into “can I reopen the island’s day-cycle?” The single meaningful deepening occurs when Mira realizes the observatory itself must remember; this narrows her tactic from observation to mechanical realignment. Cost is conceptual not visceral—loss of safe eternal night—but the image of luminous threads makes it legible. No secondary pressure (antagonist, dwindling resource) keeps it just shy of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—retrieve/grieve Iris—signaled in opening line. Single meaningful tightening: warm tooth proves substitution, collapses certainty and forces stance shift. Cost is conceptual—Marianne must relinquish epistemological safety; price is legible on page. Agency resides in decision to accept liminality, not physical combat; sufficient under situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—transmit starlight without fire—signals in paragraph two and tightens when each polished shard must succeed before children arrive. Accumulative pressure: every failed refraction risks retraumatizing the loss; successful light-dance affirms Elena’s question “why stars couldn’t paint the ground.” No external antagonist; tension is knowledge-versus-acceptance, resolved in the crystallized gallery stance. Cost is conceptual—Maren forever exchanges telescopes for lapidary wheels—visible on page.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—Maya’s need to convert passive guilt into active, ongoing atonement—is signaled early and tightened when she decides to share her private archive with Chen, risking renewed public exposure. Escalation is accumulative: each documented drip pattern deepens her investment; the notebook’s arrival forces the final “pay-off” choice under the same lens. Cost is visible—tears that “felt cleansing rather than destructive” show emotional currency leaving her body. The refusal to seek forgiveness keeps the tension taut; the stance crystallizes rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—how to end her novel without betraying the dead—arrives by line 3. Escalation is textural: each apparition tightens the same question until the option space collapses to “the harder third thing.” Agency is cognitive—her realization reweights all prior material rather than changing external terrain. Visible cost is the acceptance of perpetual grief; the tightening would sharpen further if one tactic were physically forfeited, but at this length the cognitive turn suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“will the machine re-awaken the land?”—is signaled early and tightens with each crank; the single meaningful deepening is the golden leaf’s unfurling that proves life response. Cost is present but conceptual (village scorn, grandmother’s death) rather than viscerally felt on page; a sharper physical price (bleeding fingers, collapsing frame) would have pushed higher. Escalation is accumulative/textural: density of fruit and scent, not reversal. Luck (moon alignment) complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can the orchard’s dying electrical life be saved as legible maps—tightens once: after the aurora pass, the paper either burns or records. No external antagonist; pressure is situational/stillness-bound. Vera’s agency is attention-based; she risks her copper plate and 3 years of starlight, forfeiting external validation. Escalation is a single deepening: the orchard’s heartbeat syncs with hers, making the cost of keeping the maps inside the tree felt. No reversal, but the narrowing from possibility to sealed gift is decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“will wonder survive the winter?”—is signalled early and tightens when Marcus decides to spend scarce metal and hours on “impractical work.” Agency is continuous: every mapping session and filed gear narrows his margin of error and risks community scorn. The single reversal is the public reveal: he trades private mastery for collective hope, paying with loss of sole authorship. Cost is visible but low-grade (no hunger or injury), keeping the score shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake is the imperative to transform abstract sorrow into bearable crystals; pressure escalates as each new burden arrives and must be correctly oriented before it hardens. The protagonist’s agency is present in her micro-adjustments—cupping, pooling, aligning—each a small tactic that prevents overwhelm. The final stilling of her hands signals the single meaningful tightening: accumulation halts because she accepts the role of container. Cost is the lifelong forfeiture of leaving the grotto unchanged, now a living reliquary.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—how to house absence without being consumed—tightens once: from paralysis over first cut to acceptance of imperfection. Escalation is accretive: each shaved ring narrows options until the uneven rim forecloses perfection. Cost is legible in the retained bark and the kettle’s scream that marks irreversible completion.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: will Mira keep assembling borrowed purposes or risk the void of her own? Pressure escalates by accretion: each overheard fragment tightens the noose of borrowed identity until the ghost offers the first native memory. The tightening is single but decisive—acceptance forecloses the archive. Cost is visible: the camera wheel—her last external prop—falls.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—save the terminal or let it die—is signaled early and tightens when she chooses to map the water flows instead of cataloguing cracks. One meaningful reversal: the same decay that dooms the building becomes the energy source for its rebirth. Pressure is coherent under causal lens; each new leak she traces narrows her options toward the overnight gamble. Cost is present (career risk, sleepless night) but could be sharper if a live rejection or structural collapse threatened immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—voice vs. silence of her own designs—is signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation occurs once yet meaningfully: the crystals’ hum externalizes her buried ambition, forcing the micro-turn to open the sketchbook; this tightens options because secrecy is now impossible to herself. Cost is visible: the satchel’s weight transfer signals irreversible trade of security for exposure. No second reversal, but at 700 words one meaningful pressure point suffices; cost could be sharper if the resignation letter were physically left behind.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—seeing the hidden architecture—tightens once: the glowing water reveals 3-D schematics, foreclosing literal monument hunting. Cost is felt (she photographs frantically) but external loss (tool, injury) absent; pressure coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve the weavers’ epistemic DNA—surfaces in paragraph four and tightens with each knot: every opened loop risks irreversible loss. The fulgurite’s re-nesting is the single decisive turn that forecloses fame and confirms custodianship; price is the continued solitude implied by the erasing fog. No coincidence, only escalating intimacy with artifactual time. Pressure stays accumulative; a sharper external threat (storm, visitor) could have pushed the score higher.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can the Duchess re-enter her own life?—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens through sensory accumulation rather than external reversals. The single meaningful turn occurs when Maren proposes “simply let yourself be absent until you're ready,” instantly narrowing the Duchess’s options from endless self-explanation to earned stillness; the cost is the sob-squeeze that follows. Under Accumulative lens, density (bitter perfume, unmarked palms, crimson thread) reweights the stake until silence itself becomes the decisive act. No visible loss of money/tool/time keeps this just shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—can flawed genesis produce authentic beauty—tightens once: the egg cracks only after Cael voices doubt, forcing commitment. Escalation is single-curve but sufficient for 700 words: each mechanical component added raises the moral price, culminating in the irreversible hybrid birth. Cost is legible in the bittersweet song that now binds prince and kingdom to a creature “never completely alive in the old way.” No false reversals; coincidence is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake: prove scars can be sung, not hidden. Tightening occurs when Maya pours sand into Elena’s palms—this physical graft forecloses abstract therapy and demands tactile risk. Cost is legible: Elena’s tremble, Maya’s forfeited radio response. Agency remains with protagonist throughout; coincidence absent.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake established at once: can love survive the repeating pattern of sacrifice? Pressure tightens when the Keeper must decide whether to intervene again—agency is decision to share light, not physical scramble. Escalation is accumulative: each echoed sacrifice deepens the moral cost of continued gardening. Price is legible but diffuse (Keeper’s eternal loneliness); a sharper, momentary forfeiture would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—restoring Thomas’s reputation—tightens once when she decides to engrave the bob, trading her public silence for subliminal truth. Agency is accumulative: each carved letter forecloses the option of speaking aloud, culminating in the pendulum’s resumed swing that will broadcast her message forever. Cost is visible—bloody fingertips, exhaustion—and alters her gait toward the sea. Under the accumulative lens, the deepening pattern (inscription upon inscription) reweights stakes without requiring external antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—will Marta keep her cheerful distance or shoulder hidden histories—rises when chess defeat proves her pattern-seeing blind spot, pushing her to the silo investigation. One tightening suffices: realization that “tenderly organized” border marks seven wrongly recorded graves forecloses option to stay detached, exacting tomorrow’s fieldwork cost. Escalation causal under lens; no coincidence rescue. Stakes remain personal yet gain moral weight through grandmother’s legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—can she write a future that survives humanity’s blindness—is signaled in paragraph four. One meaningful tightening: the predictive models flag wishful prose, forcing her to rewrite; this narrows options from “anything possible” to “what the data will allow.” Cost is legible: hours pass, hand cramps, dawn arrives; the price is time and bodily strain. Agency remains hers throughout; no coincidence rescues or undercuts the act.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—restore stories via dust—is signaled early; pressure intensifies when the broadcast shifts to childhood melody, forcing Elena from transcription to physical contact with dust. The tightening narrows options (she must now disseminate the method) and carries a felt price in the aching fingers and solitary labor; cost is legible, though secondary stakes remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: whether comforting illusion (gallery “wholeness”) can survive exposure to curated incompleteness. Escalation is density-driven: each revealed gap (landscape sans sky, levitating fruit) tightens conceptual vise until mask-vision forces re-appraisal. Elena’s agency is the refusal to restore illusion; she scatters the message that exposed it, paying with loss of former purpose. Cost is legible in the chair’s irreversible stillness and her acceptance of perpetual dispersal.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—will the medical record survive?—is signaled early and tightened when Karin warns “they’ll tear down everything.” Marcus’s agency turns on a single beat: surrender exclusive possession to seed a network; that surrender forecloses his isolationist stance. Cost is downstream (risk, labor) rather than on-page payment, but the conceptual loss of solitary purity is acknowledged. Pressure plateaus after the hand-over; no further obstacle complicates the plan, so escalation stays modest.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—can the town’s hatred be unlearned through choral listening—is signaled early and tightens only narratively, not through a visible forfeiture or trade-off on Mrs. Chen’s part. The escalation is accumulative: discordant hums → harmony; because no option is foreclosed for her, price remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.1)
    Central conflict—memory-sharing legality vs. communal truth—announced early, but on-page pressure stays diffuse: no authority figure or ticking clock forces Mara to adapt tactics. One soft tightening: authorities “eventually” notice, but it happens off-page and does not foreclose any shown option. Cost transferred to anonymous growers rather than protagonist. Stakes resonate thematically yet lack a visible price paid by Mara in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether to reinstall generosity at the price of reliability—tightens once when Chen hands over the “gloriously imperfect” schematics. Mira’s inability to soften the public report guarantees future personal cost, supplying a visible price that forecloses the safer path of silence. Agency is intellectual but definitive under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can attention alone resurrect abandoned space?—tightens once: the house’s exhale forecloses her fantasy of ever being welcomed inside. Agency is attention itself; no antagonist is needed. Escalation is textural: density of noticed details (root, marble, glass) accumulates until the hush-drop reweights the stake. Cost is the solitude she double-downs on when she walks back to the tideline, leaving the altar behind.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—will Marina embrace moral ambiguity or cling to heroic tragedy—tightens with each telepathic memory, culminating in the irrevocable choice to surface with the ampoule. The foxglove poison itself is the visible price paid by the architect and now by Marina, who must carry the toxin of truth. No coincidence; the statue waited for someone who could stomach nuance. Escalation is one sustained rise: revelation → anger → understanding → public confession, each step foreclosing simpler stories.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—escape lifelong cowardice—signalled in paragraph 2. Tightening occurs when Castellano declares “stop trying to calculate,” forcing her first non-analytic move; cost legible in post-fall bruised psyche. Agency drives every beat: climb, roll, sideways leap, send. Pressure coherent under causal lens, but only one real escalation; second plateau rather than further spike.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“will the displaced arts survive?”—is signaled early and tightened when flour stores drop and voices fail. The meaningful turn occurs when Celeste repurposes her curatorial tools (lens, museum authority) into insurgent salvage: she trades spectatorship for leadership, narrowing her own safety. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens: each artisan loss (beekeeper, candlemaker, puppeteer) layers urgency until the lens reveals actionable fracture—knowledge that reweights options. Cost is legible: every loaf baked spends finite flour, and the thaw itself risks flooding; still, the beat remains one tightening rather than successive reversals, keeping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“step beyond fate’s design”—is signaled in paragraph one and tested when the yoyo refuses to return. One meaningful tightening: the moment string tension goes slack yet the yoyo keeps spinning, forward time becomes optional; options collapse into the singularity she chooses. Cost is legible: hunger stone cracks, lighthouse empties, she forfeits corporeal life. Escalation is causal under the inferred lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—“see fear clearly to survive it”—is announced early. Single escalation beat: fear is spoken, materialises, is seen small, trapped. Agency is verbal confession; no tactical failure or retry, so pressure spike feels abrupt. Cost is conceptual (she now carries fear in clasp) rather than felt loss; adequate for short length but not multi-layered.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—orchard swallowed or saved—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens once: cloud fractals contract → hourglass → anchor gamble. Agency is pure decision, not luck: Maren’s chord-mapping generates the tactic that forecloses the safe option (staying with surface logic). Cost is visible—physical tilt and the howling vortex that devours an unnamed settlement—so the price she avoids is dramatized. The escalation beat is single but sufficient under short-form lens; no mechanical reversal is required when the first gamble is existential.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—city survival via turtle integrity—tightens when the crack’s spiral path forecloses the option to stay passive. One meaningful deepening: the realization that the watchers are guides, not threats, reweights all prior dread into urgency. Agency remains with Maren; her measurements and whistle blows drive the escalation. Cost is legible in the shell’s literal fracture and her social isolation; no reversal is required under Accumulative lens.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
    <comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of clarity-as-danger: the relentless sun that makes everything visible also blinds the citizens to their creeping doom. The spiral language becomes a quiet metaphor for routes swallowed by false safety. No moral is stated; the final image of the turtle shifting beneath her feet reweights “stay vs. sail” without pronouncement. Subtext resides in the whistle’s grief-note and the crack’s patient geometry—both speak louder than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—publish vs. protect the letter—is signaled early and tightens once: Hawthorne’s consent narrows options. Elena’s agency is rhetorical, not physical; the verbal parallel-drawing persuades, but we do not see her risk tangible loss (career, safety). Cost is societal, not personal, keeping pressure cerebral. Escalation is single-step, sufficient for length, but low visceral charge.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Marcus will merely record absence or allow it to inhabit him—tightens when the unsent letters force the choice: extract (professional distance) or re-inter (empathic fusion). His decision to re-bury them with a witness note narrows future options: he commits to carrying unspoken griefs, a felt cost signaled by trembling hands. Escalation is accumulative: each prior note sealed makes the box’s discovery the pattern-breaking intensification. The tightening is singular but sufficient for the length; however, the external risk (tide, job security) stays static, capping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—“trace honest origins”—is signaled early and escalates as each stamped volume widens the hidden archive. Tightening is intellectual, not perilous: risk of scholarly omission rather than physical danger. One credible cost is the blackout itself, forcing analog labor that enables discovery; felt price is slight but present. Agency is observational—pattern recognition—yet it forecloses her old neutral indexing stance, satisfying lens.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—retrieve / re-integrate Lin’s shadow—signalled in para 1. Escalation is accretive: each crane subtracts one from 1000, a visible tightening. No external antagonist; pressure is the mountain of remaining labour. Cost is felt on every page (time, money, stamina already spent; 853 still to go) and the final image promises no end—only perpetual payment.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominate stake—locating wasted potential—tightens once when the standing wave appears, forcing thruster adjustment. Cost is conceptual: she chooses endless drift over healing, paying with perpetual unrest; the price is legible but not viscerally felt. One meaningful deepening suffices and lands, yet the escalation is more atmospheric than tactical. Agency is present yet abstract—she “continues searching” rather than stakes a new risk.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“will she ever belong?”—is signaled early and tightened when chip reveals her life’s quest is now literal roadmap. Escalation occurs once: abstract loneliness becomes concrete seventeen-site quest. Cost legible: open-ended exile prolonged, sleep sacrificed tonight. Agency is accept/launch, not yet a hard irreversible loss, so peak pressure modest.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—guilt versus atonement—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when Elias appears, foreclosing the option to keep silent. Cost is visible: Mara’s “soul” is priced at the empire she vows to dismantle. Agency sits with Mara; Elias’s arrival complicates but does not resolve. No reversal, but the single deepening is sufficient for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single dominant stake—simultaneous release without bloodshed—tightens once via moon-apex countdown; that deadline narrows options and forces the synchronized step. Cost is visible: Katrin’s lone exposure on the wall, armies’ fingers on triggers. The trust gap is declared more than tested in-scene, so pressure feels administrative rather than viscerally escalated, keeping the score just inside the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: can Marina re-assume responsibility without repeating fatal error? Pressure escalates causally: Amy’s need collides with Marina’s public shame, forcing a now-or-never launch window. No coincidence; the weather turn is external but her decision to go is earned. Cost is paid on-page: she abandons the pole-counting safety crutch and accepts psychic risk of another life in her hands.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—oblivion vs accountability—signaled in line 1. The single meaningful tightening arrives when theInterpreter reveals the time-traveler’s failure: empathy can’t be imported, only chosen; this narrows Marcus’s options to endure amnesia voluntarily. Cost is legible: he forfeits the right to remember, a social/psychic price paid on-page. Agency remains his; no coincidences rescue him.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—keep the brother from final dissolution—surfaces early and escalates through each spice-scented beat; the metamorphosis is the single decisive narrowing of options. Pressure is causal: because the ghost fades nightly, therefore she must pay the price now. The cost is visible (constellation-fur, hollow bones) and irreversible, foreclosing her human future. A hairline deduction: Tam’s warning dialogue slightly front-loads the stakes before we feel them in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will she keep stealing moments or give presence?—tightens once when the cards become windows foreclosing denial. Agency drives escalation: she chooses to spread the cloth, to look, to descend. Cost accumulates: each phantom object (cracked saucer weeping sap) is a viscerable price of hours already forfeited. The final tracing does not erase loss but forecloses future theft, satisfying the visible-price test.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—will accumulated grief be faced or buried—tightens once via Mei’s decision to fire the resonance chamber; cost legible in Akio’s hand-grab anchoring against irreversible aperture, though external antagonistic pressure stays abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single dominant stake—how to keep giving when materially depleted—tightens with every jar opened; the seventeenth and final release permanently forecloses the option to give again in this form. Escalation is textural: cumulative loss of bugs = rising existential cost; the surveyor encounter provides the mid-scene tightening that proves her new currency (direction, not dollars) has life-or-death value. No coincidence resolves the conflict; instead, the planetary dance supplies temporal pressure that makes the final release urgent and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—can the revolution ignite unseen?—is signaled at blackout start and deepens when the sundial angles become a live map. One meaningful tightening occurs: the 3-hour clock (“We disabled the backup systems ourselves”) collapses options and forces distribution now. Cost is collective rather than personal (no named sentinel who might catch them, no ink on Maren’s hands), so pressure stays medium. Agency is shared off-page (Voss already acted), muting the protagonist-driven spike that would punch the score higher.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—decode the pattern or lose the eels forever—tightens with each stone. The seventeenth placement is the decisive turn that forecloses the “restore friction” option; the price is her grandmother’s unarrested slide, now understood as inevitable. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens: color-frequency density increases, aurora brightens, eels form living equation. Cost is unmistakable on the page—“the answer bloom like bioluminescence” with no take-backs.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can testimony survive erasure—signals early and tightens as each vigil converts private rage into smuggled archive. Agency visible: she chooses to wedge poem despite risk; vigil rhythm itself is tactic under pressure. Cost accrues: each 20-minute interval forgoes sleep/safety. No coincidence; storm complicates but does not resolve. Escalation is accumulative deepening rather than causal reversal—sufficient for this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: will violence yield to knowledge? Pressure escalates when Adelaine’s decoding delays the duel, then tightens as collaborative discovery offers a bloodless victory. Cost is legible: Harwick’s white knuckles relax, Adelaine schedules future intellectual “duels,” trading physical risk for ongoing contest. One meaningful turn suffices; no coincidence resolves the standoff.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—beauty from anarchy—signals early and tightens through accumulative beats: each seed planted is a renunciation of future memory. Agency is lyrical but legible: September chooses to plant what October won’t remember, narrowing her own options. Cost is felt: she pays with erasure. Secondary stake—friendship survival—applies quiet pressure; Kai’s laughter anchors her momentarily. No reversal is needed; deepening occurs as moon climbs and each trowel-cut forecloses tomorrow’s recognition. Escalation stays under Accumulative lens; cost is visible in final “futures we won’t recognize.”

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can she re-open a sealed farewell—tightens when the compass spin signals temporal distortion, forcing her to risk the covert splice. One meaningful deepening: the moment she realizes compasses aren’t broken but triangulating across time, her tactic shifts from elegy to engineering. Price is visible: the clock’s resurrection consumes the twenty-year stasis itself; the reunited couple ages before us. Agency is hers alone; coincidence complicates (the dirigible route vanished) but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—cultural memory vs. empirical verification—is signaled early and tightens once: “Either plant it or don’t.” Agency drives the turn; no outside rescue. Cost is legible—irreversible loss of seed and epistemic certainty. Escalation is modest but coherent under situational lens; one meaningful deepening suffices. Could use a sharper mid-scene complication to enter 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: learn how to mourn without recovering the lost ship. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure tightens when each lace motif translates into a literal snip of living branch, making silence material. The visible price is the surrendered fantasy of finding the ship; that forfeit is dramatized on the page when she moves from clutching the compass to setting it down beside the pruned tree. Coincidence is absent; escalation is modest but sufficient for 800-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reconciling catastrophic loss with incremental beauty—is signaled early and deepens through Helena’s shift from mourning absence to finding meaning in residue. Agency is expressed through attention: her choice to document rather than despair narrows options (she won’t flee the mess) and incurs emotional cost (facing what’s irretrievable). The flood complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution arises from her persistent focus under pressure. The single meaningful tightening—abandoning drama for dust—forecloses escapism and crystallizes her stance with palpable humility.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—survival of artistic integrity against erasure—is signaled early and deepens when Vera realizes her medium (charcoal) was weaponized. The escalation is driven by her agency: retracing leads to gunpowder, which forces the climactic confrontation. Cost is legible: she trades silence for justice, binding Galloway but accepting future trials. One meaningful tightening suffices, though the clemency deal slightly softens consequence—still, pressure remains coherent under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—translating silence into music—is signaled early and deepens through protagonist-driven action: Mara chooses to strike the fork, to press her body to panels, to participate in the installation. Each act narrows options (rejecting vocal recovery, embracing non-auditory expression) and carries visible cost (confronting memory, exposing grief publicly). Pressure escalates organically from private ritual to public exhibit, culminating in a Charged Poise where she accepts a new musical language. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from her agency under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—giving rest a permanent address—is signaled early and deepens via Marcel’s realization that burial is impossible; only restoration works. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he chooses to descend, repair, and install the lens. Cost is unmistakable: exhaustion, abandonment of livelihood, and irreversible psychic exposure. Pressure tightens once meaningfully, narrowing options from burial to revitalization, consistent with the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving cultural continuity amid erasure—is signaled early and tightens when anonymity proves insufficient for youth retention. Mara’s declaration is a self-driven deepening that narrows options (exposes network to risk) with clear cost. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each donation layer builds toward the need for visible connection. Sanctions function as persistent constraint shaping all tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—locating unused love—is signaled early and deepens via the breathing exercise, which forces Mei to relive drowning while witnessing love’s transformation. Agency lies in her choice to exhale despite panic, enabling the vision; cost is the surrender of ownership (leaving the tear). Pressure escalates texturally: perfume → sparks → golden threads → refracted blooms, each layer narrowing her need from retrieval to release. Coincidence (meeting the pilgrim) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the healing arises from her willingness to breathe into grief.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—discovering time’s texture—is signaled early and deepens when hyperbolic geometry reveals temporal loops. Escalation is driven by Lyra’s agency: touching the fragment, pressing her palm fully, choosing not to resist backward slippage. Cost is unmistakable: the disintegration of all photographs, her life’s work, erased as physical anchors. The tightening forecloses her former coping mechanism (using images to resist time’s flow), forcing acceptance of recursive existence—a trade-off with profound conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—proving engineered famine—is signaled early and deepens when the arrow’s fletching reveals banned crops, raising the cost of failure. Escalation is driven by Mira’s agency: her decoding narrows options (guards approaching), forcing precise timing. Coincidence (wall demolition) complicates but doesn’t resolve; she exploits chaos, doesn’t rely on it. Final trade-off—planting seeds instead of distributing evidence immediately—forecloses short-term victory for long-term resilience, with cost legible in her solitary labor amid celebrating crowds.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—capturing/releasing the sound of broken trust—is signaled early and tightens when Mira imprints cells, narrowing options to destroy or deploy the crystal. Agency drives escalation: her method of collecting absences leads directly to the forge climax. Cost is unmistakable: destroying the matrix forfeits her only path to “reverse-engineer” her daughter’s love, yet affirms acceptance. The “battered marvel” aurora complicates but doesn’t resolve; stakes remain viscerally felt through gray’s diminishing note.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—understanding one’s role in fate’s design—is signaled early and deepens when moonbeams expose Maya as both thief and subject. The tightening occurs when Celeste reveals the artist has documented Maya’s path, forcing her to reinterpret theft as pedagogy. Protagonist agency drives escalation: opening the jar, following lilies, choosing to walk away. Cost is felt in Maya’s trembling hands and the relinquished satchel—a visible forfeiture that reweights her future.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reconciling fracture without sacrificing integrity—is signaled early and tightens when Marcus recognizes his own metaphor in the glass (“imbalance creates weakness”). His agency drives escalation: choosing to keep the bookmark, then choosing to release it. Cost is felt in years of silence and the risk of further rejection. The deepening occurs internally but manifests physically in the crafted sphere—a fragile offering that forecloses continued isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—exposing genetic weaponization—is signaled early and tightens when Reeves’ call reframes the cast as insurance, not coordinates. Maya’s agency drives escalation: she decodes the smudges, chooses authorities over silence, and accepts the cost of fracturing Emma’s trust further. The deepening isn’t just informational—it’s moral, forcing Maya to weigh betrayal against protection. Pressure coheres under the Causal lens with one meaningful turn that narrows options to exposure or complicity.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—navigating after the last star fades—is signaled early and escalates through the oracle’s agency: she names the three silences, draws the map, departs. Each tightening forecloses options (no roads, no stars, only absences). Cost is unmistakable: the world redrawn, voices stilled, light gone. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—silences compound until the final quiet becomes substance.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—locating the origin of thought—is signaled early and deepens via J-7’s agency: he chooses to touch, play, and finally understand the violin across loops. Escalation is driven by his decisions, not coincidence; each failure (fear, silence, shattering) narrows options until synthesis emerges. Cost is unmistakable: 200 years of labor reframed as essential, not wasted. The Amalgamation Protocol’s recursion is the crucible, but J-7’s persistence pays the price.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—emotional honesty versus protective silence—is signaled early and deepens when Mira realizes the doodles were intentional. The tightening occurs when she chooses to respond not with words but with an image, foreclosing further evasion. Cost is unmistakable: months of missed connection, now traded for vulnerable presence. Agency drives escalation—Mira’s decision to seek the stubs and draw her reply—not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether belonging can be measured—is signaled early and deepens when the vine dresser reveals the husband engineered her doubt. The tightening occurs when Marcus realizes her ritual isn’t about grief but proof: “You’re measuring something else.” Agency lies in her persistent cultivation and his quiet witnessing; cost is visible in poisoned hedges, crimped pipes, and social ostracization implied by luck scores. Pressure accumulates texturally, not causally, fitting the lens, and coincidence never resolves—it’s all earned reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—proving non-linear time—is signaled early and tightens when Kael redirects power at twilight’s peak, narrowing options to one precise intervention. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens: each calibration deepens anomaly awareness until the display forces Venn’s awe. Cost is felt in Kael’s reconfigured identity—from “obliging mechanic” to truth-bearer—but lacks a concrete forfeiture (e.g., burned-out equipment, lost data). Coincidence (Ephemera bioelectric interference) complicates but doesn’t resolve; pressure coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—uncovering Constance’s murderer—is signaled early and tightens when “Moretti” emerges from the stain. Marta’s agency drives escalation: she interprets codes, tests responses with notes, and commits to exposure. The cost is conceptual (challenging institutional myth) and physical (enduring cold, isolation). Coincidence never resolves; the ghost’s clues require active decoding. Final decision forecloses silence with irreversible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—trust in predictive systems—tightens when Mira discovers the oracle suppressed uncertainty, transforming abstract guilt into concrete revision. Her agency drives escalation: pulling logs, rewriting algorithms, creating space for doubt. The cost is visceral (Reeves’ death) and conceptual (shattered illusion of infallibility). Chen’s line “Reeves trusted it completely” crystallizes the moral calculus: blind faith vs. humble wisdom. The final advisory “recommend caution” embodies the narrowed, safer path forward.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the weight of swallowed truth—is signaled early and tightens through radio calls converging on Tommy Reeves and chemical dumping. Marcus’s agency drives escalation: his choice to enter the tunnel, interpret calls, and turn valves deepens knowledge and alters the ghost shift’s manifestation. The cost is conceptual yet palpable: families remain burdened until they speak directly, and Marcus shoulders proxy witness without resolution. Coincidence (radio signal reaching the tunnel) complicates but doesn’t resolve; causality remains intact under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—witnessing change without judgment—is signaled early and deepens through the keeper’s renunciation of archival control. The origami swan’s whisper forces a decisive tightening: she abandons surface preservation to burrow downward, foreclosing her former role. Cost is unmistakable: her physical integration into the archive (“bones would calcify here”) embodies the price of her stance. Escalation is driven by her agency under an Accumulative lens—each layer of descent intensifies her surrender, culminating in Charged Poise where options (preserve vs. dissolve) are crystallized but not chosen, only witnessed.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—nurturing wonder amid fragility—is signaled early and tightens during totality when Thomas risks speech. Escalation is driven by Mara’s agency: her adaptive playing creates space for his emergence. Cost is unmistakable: the emotional risk of shattering his fragile voice, and Mara’s suppressed tears showing how much she has at stake. The single tightening (eclipse peak) narrows options to silence or utterance, fulfilling the Accumulative lens’s demand for density increase and cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving erased human traces—is signaled early and deepens when Catherine’s voice emerges from ash. Miren’s agency drives escalation: her probing of diaries leads to recognition, then ritual mounting. Cost is felt but not overstated: the world remains indifferent, yet her act forecloses despair. One meaningful tightening suffices, and it lands with quiet inevitability under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.2)
    Stakes escalate through Maya’s agency: discovering the microdot forces her to repurpose her entire system overnight, narrowing options to one fragile channel—fortune cookies. Each written message forecloses alternatives (no couriers, no electronics), and the UV seal introduces vulnerability. The dominant stake—protecting intelligence without detection—tightens credibly under Accumulative pressure, culminating in the blink-coded confirmation that validates her method’s success and cost: continued isolation, perpetual vigilance.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—whether Marcus can be saved by redefining existence—is signaled early and deepens when Calloway shifts from exorcism to epistemological intervention. The meaningful tightening occurs when he targets the entity’s foundational assumption (“movement equals life”), narrowing options to a single conceptual pivot. Cost is legible: Calloway risks total failure by refusing traditional combat, and Marcus’s survival hinges on accepting stillness as fullness. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (layering loops, daubing blue), though the entity’s dissolution leans slightly abstract rather than viscerally contested.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—recovering meaning in her work—is signaled early and deepens when Mira realizes her fortunes are hollow. The tightening occurs at the mirrored horizon, where she abandons prediction for translation, foreclosing her old method with visible cost (thirty pages of unsellable compositions). Agency drives escalation: her choice to map memories leads directly to insight. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with dawn’s arrival imposing a natural deadline that sharpens her focus.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—conquering the labyrinth of self—is signaled early and escalates through Kael’s deliberate retracing of avoided paths. Each choice (grief faced, love reclaimed) narrows her infinite possibilities into singularity, with clear cost: loss of temporal freedom. Escalation is driven entirely by her agency under an Accumulative lens—density of memories intensifies until pattern reveals cowardice as the branching mechanism. Final act forecloses escape forever, paid in the ache of grounded knees.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—defeating emotional numbness—is signaled early and deepens through Oskar’s experiment with reversed sound. His agency drives escalation: he chooses to test the needle’s implication, projects filaments of hush, and collaborates with Marie. Cost is legible: thirty years of isolation, the surrender of performance, and the vulnerability of teaching what he cannot hear. The lens-appropriate intensification (density of silence) reweights music itself.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving truth against institutional erasure—is signaled early and tightens when the stranger reveals the zones’ true nature. Marianne’s agency drives escalation: she cross-references data, accepts the satchel, begins mapping. Cost is clear: entry into a clandestine network forfeits her protective solitude. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—grieving what can no longer be sensed—is signaled early and deepened when Dr. Kovač reveals the ultraviolet method. Maren’s agency drives escalation: her trembling decision to uncork the vial transforms passive mourning into active witnessing. Cost is unmistakable: tears fall not from relief but from the bittersweet clarity that love’s scent is gone forever, replaced by fragile light. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence or deflation.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—interpreting transformation in a destabilized world—is signaled early and tightens when Marcus reads Sarah’s escape as ethical evolution. The meaningful deepening occurs when he recognizes her dissolution as success, not loss, reweighting freedom itself. Agency is maintained through his interpretive choices; coincidence (Sarah’s appearance) complicates but doesn’t resolve—he’s already completed his act of witness. Cost is felt in his solitude and the irreversible shift in how meaning is made.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving meaning in a sound-deadened world—is signaled early and deepens when Maya chooses unfinished music over bonfire storytelling. The meaningful tightening occurs at piece 27, when the hush “retreats slightly,” proving incompleteness creates space for communal resonance. Cost is visible: no bonfire, flooded sanctuary, ash-laden air. Maya’s agency drives escalation—her playing alters the environment’s acoustic properties—and the final lullaby’s suspension crystallizes a stance that forecloses neat resolution but reclaims sonic possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—whether to perpetuate comforting lies or offer imperfect truth—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Mara remakes the blotter. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her deeper sensing of amber’s structure catalyzes the ethical pivot. Cost is unmistakable: she sacrifices the clean efficacy of counterfeits for messier authenticity, risking client dissatisfaction and self-doubt. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via sensory and conceptual density, not external obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—recognition for invisible labor—is signaled early and deepens when Marianne shifts from observer to participant. Agency manifests in attention and documentation, foreclosing her former purely transactional stance with felt cost (implied loss of time, reorientation of priorities). Escalation occurs through protagonist-driven choices: returning the envelope, photographing workers, collaborating on the display. No false resolutions; the lighthouse keeper’s near-tears show real emotional consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—belonging versus isolation—is signaled early and deepens when Kael joins the search, shifting from passive yearning to active contribution. The escalation is driven by her agency: teaching Maren and Pico transforms the hunt into communal ritual, narrowing her isolation. Cost is unmistakable: vulnerability in claiming authorship (“tears streaming”) and the risk of rejection. The final choice—to offer her vision of kinship—forecloses her former position at the edge, with the arbor’s embrace as earned reward.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—capturing the echo’s origin—is signaled early and tightens when Vera realizes time is already “wounded.” Her agency drives escalation: borrowing minutes deepens pressure, and releasing them constitutes a decisive trade-off (truth over possession). Cost is felt: temporal scars and the risk of waking the giant. Coincidence never resolves; the bird’s song is environmental texture, not plot convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding ambiguous loss—is signaled early and deepens when the glass eyes generate light and double vision, forcing Elara to confront parallel existence. Her agency drives escalation: placing the eyes, speaking theorems, choosing not to call out. Cost is unmistakable: she accepts permanent uncertainty, trading proof for poise. One tightening suffices—a single, resonant deepening under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—being seen as mattering—is signaled early and tightens through Miriam’s agency: she chooses to rescue, then anonymously donate, the tapes. The escalation is driven by her actions, not coincidence; the power outage complicates but doesn’t resolve. Cost is legible: her continued invisibility is the price of preserving others’ voices. The head librarian’s reverence and the student’s tears confirm stakes were real and met, not abstractly declared.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—whether growth can be forced—is signaled early and deepens through Maya’s failed engineering versus accidental success. The meaningful tightening occurs when she stops pruning on schedule, narrowing her agency to responsive care. Cost is felt in lost plants and abandoned methodology, though not monetized. Escalation is protagonist-driven under an Accumulative lens, but lacks a second concrete reversal beyond the initial shift; one deepening suffices for length, yet prevents 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—threshing meaning from chaos—is signaled early and deepens when the island makes meaning “slippery.” The tightening occurs when the painter shifts from passive observation (painting trails) to active pursuit (following them at night), narrowing her options to engagement or surrender. Cost is felt in her vigil-like insomnia and culminates in the earned insight that survival itself is pattern-making. Agency drives escalation; coincidence (finding Marcus) is contextualized by prior trail-following.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—preserving or relinquishing prophetic control—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency: Mara chooses to interpret the pearl, then confronts its void, then renounces her role. The tightening occurs when the cave itself rebels, foreclosing her old path. Cost is unmistakable: every future she “stole” materializes as shattering droplets. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—density of sonic/shadow anomalies forces stance crystallization without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving meaning against erasure—is signaled early and deepens when Marina chooses to offer the valve, foreclosing her solitary stance. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her “reactive vision” guides her through the crowd to Thomas, altering tactics from passive cataloging to active reconnection. Cost is legible in her trembling hands and admitted inability to “process it all at once.” The tightening—from absence to presence—narrows her path from observer to participant under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—accessing the hidden city—is signaled early and deepens when the conductor warns of unmaking lies. Mara’s agency (“I dare”) drives escalation; cost is conceptual (truth eroding identity) and felt (trembling certainty). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each arrow multiplies stakes without coincidence. Final choice forecloses pure rationality with visible consequence—her name carved in stone.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving unmeasurable ecological knowledge—is signaled early and tightens when whale songs activate ancestral memory. Elena’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to press the tile, endure vertigo, and ultimately transcribe, accepting epistemic rupture. Cost is legible in her abandoned skepticism and tears. Coincidence (whale migration timing) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the deepening arises from her lineage’s prepared repository, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—discovering what lies beyond death—is signaled early and deepens when revealed as Naia’s engineered escape. Pressure tightens causally: fragment pulses → coordinates shift → storm peaks → gap opens. Naia’s agency drives escalation; Cassius reacts but ultimately chooses renewed pursuit. Cost is felt: her half-life ends, his boredom curdles into purposeful grief. One tightening suffices at this length, though the mutiny concept slightly overshadows tactical stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from forged asylum papers (external) to moral integrity (internal), with Mara’s agency driving every turn: she waits, documents, discloses, and offers rehab. The dominant stake—fair trade vs. exploitation—is signaled early and deepens when Mara reveals she’s “actively waiting.” Cost is unmistakable: Vincent’s livelihood destroyed, his identity shattered, yet spared legal ruin. The tightening occurs when Mrs. Kowalski’s payment becomes irreversible, forcing Mara’s hand—pressure coheres under the Causal lens without coincidence or soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving differentiated time against homogenizing silence—is signaled early and tightens through the stationer’s agency: she chooses which frequencies to chart, where to kneel, what to record. The deepening occurs at the maple grove, where reverse proportion reveals time’s expansion, altering her understanding. Cost is visible: her invented histories are acts of resistance against erasure, rendered futile yet necessary by the town’s silence. No coincidence resolves pressure; all insight stems from her methodical attention.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—existence vs. erasure—is signaled early and deepens when Maya shifts from passive drifting to active archiving. The poison label discovery tightens pressure by linking her ghosthood to a buried history. Agency drives escalation: her listening and collecting lead directly to the harbormaster encounter. Cost is felt in her willingness to return to the system she fled—a trade-off between invisibility and belonging.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—decoding her grandmother’s “universal riddle”—tightens when Mira realizes it’s about connection, not proof, forcing renunciation of her professional identity. Escalation is driven by her agency: each bow stroke deepens the reimagined conversation, narrowing her epistemic options until only acceptance remains. Cost is unmistakable: she leaves the cello unfinished, symbolizing surrender of control, yet carries shell and bow—tools of feeling, not measurement. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves tension.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving carnival autonomy against sanitization—is signaled early and deepens when Marina’s dual allegiance forces her to weaponize culture. Her agency drives escalation: graffiti reorganizes community response, narrowing developer access. Cost is unmistakable: she abandons her absorber role to become a covert leader, risking isolation. The “hopeful desperation” tone charges every turn without coincidence resolving pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving the soul of a vanishing place—is signaled early and tightens when Chen discovers the etched message, transforming documentation into testimony. His agency is clear: choosing the crater, mixing chemicals, placing the grain. The 90-minute countdown creates coherent pressure under an Accumulative lens, culminating in a trade-off between scientific detachment and emotional witness. Cost is felt in the extinction of moonflowers and the mountain’s erasure, though escalation relies more on accumulation than a single decisive turn.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—fixing the drone before launch—is signaled early and escalates via the ship’s horn blasts and Voss’s tension. Mara’s agency drives the deepening: she chooses to trust her water-refraction method under time pressure. The cost is felt in lost time, isolation, and the weight of responsibility. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from her skill and sensory adaptation under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—validating a hydrological anomaly—is signaled early and deepens when Mira realizes all rivers converge here. The escalation is driven by her agency: cross-referencing maps, deploying the falcon, interpreting ephemera. Cost is unmistakable: two winters of solitude, professional ridicule implied by Petrov’s “chasing ghosts,” and physical peril on ancient ice. The final choice—to herald properly, not publish hastily—forecloses easy acclaim for methodological integrity, a trade-off that sharpens moral calculus under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring the town’s “heartbeat”—is signaled early and deepens through the bell tuner’s patient intervention. Escalation occurs via accumulating resonance: footsteps → memory → participation → bell repair. The cost is opportunity and time; revival demands daily, communal recommitment. Though the bell tuner’s agency drives change, the townspeople’s gradual joining constitutes earned escalation under an Accumulative lens, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether to harness the ephemeral—is signaled early and deepens when Mara experiences the memories firsthand. Pressure escalates via oxygen countdown and emotional seduction, narrowing options to a binary: save Chen or lose herself. Mara’s agency drives the turn (“forcing herself to pocket the vial”), and the cost—renouncing transcendent knowledge—is felt in every subsequent line. Coincidence never resolves; survival hinges on disciplined refusal.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—validating his father’s truth before time runs out—is signaled early and tightens when boots approach, forcing irrevocable choice. Escalation is driven by Matthias’s agency: he chooses to enter, to fit the lattice, to stay. The deepening (“You’re not escaping. You’re transforming”) reweights the entire premise under Accumulative pressure. Cost is felt: he forfeits the known world, but the price is unmistakable in the closing duality—outside mystery vs. inner reunion.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—repaying a bloodline debt through resonant awakening—is signaled early and deepens when Marcus realizes the bead’s origin. Escalation is driven by his agency: he chooses to plant it and speak forgiveness, narrowing options (no retreat, no half-measures). Cost is unmistakable: centuries of ghostly purgatory end, but only because Marcus sacrifices inherited mystery for mercy. Pressure coheres under Causal lens, with love-as-offering replacing love-as-possession.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reverence through repetition—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: each night she chooses to sleepwalk, embedding cost in violet-silk markers. The meaningful tightening occurs when travelers arrive, proving her work alters external reality, not just internal belief. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies through pattern accrual (threads → network → pilgrimage), not causal reversals. Cost is unmistakable: she leaves, but her absence affirms the labyrinth’s new purpose—wisdom in retracing steps.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reconnecting exiled self to ancestral ground—tightens when Miriam descends into the catacomb, foreclosing passive observation for active restoration. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: she chooses pruning shears over departure, stone-moving over nostalgia. Cost is unmistakable: weeks of labor, emotional vulnerability before villagers, and irreversible commitment. The Accumulative lens intensifies not through plot turns but deepening resonance—each cleared stone raises the price of abandonment.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming authentic identity through vulnerable truth—is signaled early and deepens via the chalk-code system that narrows options to one fragile moment. Escalation is driven by Iris’s agency: she decodes, verifies, hesitates, then acts. Cost is unmistakable: the loss of protective anonymity, the exposure to rejection, the erasure of her constructed self. Pressure tightens through accumulation, not external threat, aligning perfectly with the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving astronomical truth against militarized revision—is signaled early via embroidery’s dual purpose. Escalation is driven by Mirelle’s agency: decoding flame disruptions, charting adjacent possibilities, racing to archive intel. Cost is unmistakable: her reputation as “eccentric” is both shield and cage, isolating her when stakes peak. The tightening at dawn (supply trucks arriving) forces her final micro-choice—delivering the frame—not passive observation. Coincidence complicates (Vas’s interruption) but never resolves; victory hinges on her pattern-reading.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—delivering an unspoken apology—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency: the client reads the letter, engages with the shard, and reclaims the lost moment. Pressure tightens under Accumulative lens: spirits crescendo, moonlight activates the shard, condensation reveals words. Cost is unmistakable—the client endures revisiting her failure, and the resolution offers understanding, not undoing. No coincidence; every intensification stems from her participation.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—uncovering buried truth in a pacific conflict—is signaled early and tightens when Imelda’s encrypted note reframes the coral from curiosity to key. Maricel’s agency drives escalation: she deciphers, recalls context, and resolves action despite physical impairment. The cost is felt (arm in cast, drugged vulnerability) and shapes tactics—she must act tomorrow, not now, accepting delay as risk. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves anything.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—rediscovering authentic joy—is signaled early and deepens when Mara realizes she’s been painting “performative” hope. The tightening occurs at the fresco insight: joy is method, not subject. Agency drives escalation—she chooses to paint light patterns instead of figures, accepting potential failure. Cost is felt: abandoning commissioned expectations for uncertain truth, with no guarantee the square mural will “lift spirits.”

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—certainty versus curiosity—is signaled early and deepens through Lena’s agency: she risks professional norms by probing the wall, then again by withholding her discovery. The tightening occurs when the garden’s transformed sound leads her to hear her own voice prophesying her role, raising the cost of ignoring the mystery. Her final choice forecloses academic recognition but affirms her deeper motive; the price is legible in her solitude amid strangers. Coincidence complicates (the nickel’s placement) but never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—preserving untaxable thought—is signaled early and tightens when Mara reveals seventeen members risk detection by thinking in dead languages. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency: they don’t flee but deepen their resistance by activating Dr. Sato’s butterfly network. Cost is legible: every new initiate warps their neural signature, inviting audit. Though the threat remains external, the protagonists’ deliberate embrace of cognitive deviation constitutes meaningful agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—converting collective grief into breathable oxygen through art—is signaled early and deepens via the poet’s agency: she chooses to weave war, diesel, and broken melodies into verse. The tightening occurs when she reframes the wind’s failure as worthy of inclusion, foreclosing escape into purity. Cost is unmistakable: three centuries without sleep, yet she endures because “that was enough.” Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with each fragment escalating thematic density.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving extinct feelings—is signaled early and deepens when the chime’s fracture forces a trade-off: fidelity to protocol vs. fidelity to memory. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (Miren’s listening, hesitation, decision), not coincidence. The cost—abandoning museum-standard perfection for personal resonance—is unmistakable in her choice to document rather than repair. Pressure tightens once, decisively, under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (restoring trust through irrefutable truth) tightens when Marcus’s arrival forces Mira to choose: repeat silence or risk exposure via Varesh script. Her agency drives escalation—writing the confession is an active renunciation of safety. Cost is unmistakable: confessing Chen’s fraud risks professional ruin, and admitting cowardice exposes her moral failure. The Varesh language’s lie-collapsing mechanic makes stakes visceral—any falsehood unravels the entire apology, raising emotional and textual peril.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—village safety vs. irreplaceable frescoes—is signaled early and deepens when Mira realizes collaboration is the only path. Her agency drives escalation: analyzing glue, measuring channels, drafting a staged floodgate system. The cost is unmistakable—she risks rejection by both factions—and the tightening forecloses unilateral action. Moral calculus sharpens the climax: not choosing between goods but engineering their coexistence under shared labor.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—whether Clara can stop erasing herself and trust enough to be known—is signaled early and tightens when she chooses to build “honest” paper trails. The meaningful deepening occurs when she maps dust motes and recalls her grandfather’s lessons, linking past skill to present courage. Agency drives escalation: her decision to place the meteorite on the sill and return to work crystallizes her stance. Cost is felt in her hesitation about Marcus and the acknowledgment that “the withering would come”—a quiet but real price of staying.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—measuring the distance between presence and absence—is signaled by line three and tightens when Mara reads year twenty-three’s compression. The deepening occurs in her dialogue with Thomas: each question narrows her understanding until she articulates that sacred thresholds are about comprehension, not crossing. Agency is clear—she chooses to write “PRESNT,” transforming inheritance into active stance. Cost is conceptual (eternal proximity without reunion) but undeniable in the wood’s “peace or dissolution” ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—proving the city’s sentience before shutdown—is signaled early and deepens when Senna realizes it’s not reflection but anticipation. The meaningful tightening occurs when translucent residents appear, transforming research into invitation. Agency drives escalation: Senna’s charts lead to insight, which leads to action. Cost is felt in the lost surface life and imminent station closure, charging the final image without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—completing fragmented memory records—tightens when Marina realizes gaps aren’t erasures but active deletions. Her agency drives escalation: each vial drop narrows understanding until the conceptual cost crystallizes. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; tide’s return adds temporal urgency without resolving conflict. Cost is felt in her acceptance that some paths must disappear—a quiet trade-off between omniscience and bearable existence.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—engineering meaning in grief—is signaled early and deepens when Mara’s system fails. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: her precise orchestration sets up the very conditions for her undoing. Cost is unmistakable: intellectual exposure (“terrible at protecting yourself”) and emotional thaw (“genuine surprise warming her chest”). The tide’s return literalizes the cost of control—ephemeral beauty can’t be mapped forever.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving memory against state-enforced amnesia—is signaled early and deepens when the moonstone appears, narrowing options to a single act: embodying the verse. Agency is expressed through attention and endurance; the tightening occurs when Kaleth ingests the artifact, irrevocably altering her physiology. Cost is felt in her irreversible transformation, though the escalation leans slightly on artifact convenience rather than purely internal agency. Still, pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—illuminating value in the mundane—is signaled early and deepens when Martin realizes windows frame lives, not just views. The meaningful tightening occurs when ripple patterns reveal “value wasn’t in the extraordinary, but in attention itself,” foreclosing his prior despair. Agency is subtle but present: throwing stones initiates communion, and his choice to leave (pocketing remaining stones) enacts renunciation. Cost is felt as loss of illusion, though not dramatized as external consequence—hence just below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reconciling salvific duty with paternal failure—is signaled early and tightens when Marcus recalls his daughter’s accusation (“You love those forests more than us”). The deepening occurs when he recognizes he “couldn’t be the universal language between suffering and sense,” narrowing his options to one concrete act: returning home. Cost is felt in the renunciation of his fire-tower identity. Escalation is driven by his agency under an Accumulative lens, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reconciling divergent timelines through mathematical hope—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency: Mira’s choice to overlay spiral and circle patterns directly causes timeline synchronization. The tightening occurs when the tide turns and the gauge spins, forcing a decisive action (placing amber glass) that narrows options to one path forward. Cost is felt in years of failure and the emotional burden of her grandmother’s last words, culminating in the conceptual price of abandoning prevention for appreciation. Coincidence complicates (tide surge) but resolution stems solely from Mira’s pattern-making.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—answering what walls dream—is signaled early and deepens when Maya finds proof they dream *forward*. The film negative forces a decisive reconfiguration: she must accept her role in the architecture’s anticipatory memory. Cost is felt in legacy’s burden becoming purpose; agency lies in her choice to keep listening. Escalation is driven entirely by protagonist action under an Accumulative lens, with no coincidental resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—rekindling cultural imagination through altered reflection—is signaled early and deepens as Vesper races against the bell. Agency is clear: she chooses coded melody over direct intervention, trusting organic spread. The meaningful tightening occurs when the first child echoes the song—proof the method works, raising emotional stakes. Cost is conceptual (spiritual drought averted) and personal (her sister’s absence made generative), though a more tangible forfeiture would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—halting the addition of civilian names to the death list—is signaled early and deepens through the ritual, which forces antagonists to confront abstract war as concrete loss. Escalation is driven by Maren’s agency: she deploys the clipboard twice when talks collapse, each use narrowing options by reactivating shared grief. The cost is unmistakable: commanders crack and weep, and the imperfect treaty is forged only through repeated emotional exposure. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens without coincidence or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—control over water and legacy—is signaled early and deepens when the drought reveals a bird’s footprint, forcing Marcus to confront his buried self. The tightening occurs when he recognizes the echo of extinct birds in his ruin, narrowing his options to destruction or preservation. His release is an act of agency under Accumulative pressure, not coincidence, and carries conceptual cost: his empire’s logic collapses as rain returns. The moral calculus—profit vs. echo—is sharpened without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—breaking silence—is signaled early and deepens when Celestine realizes the palace feeds on suppressed will. The tightening occurs during thread-untangling: one wrong pull risks total erasure, raising stakes with tangible consequence. Agency is clear—her choices drive escalation—and the cost (imminent capture) is felt in the closing laugh amid arriving guards. However, the emperor’s power remains abstract; a sharper on-page pressure (e.g., sorcerer’s presence sensed earlier) would elevate this to 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—ethical storytelling—is signaled early and tightens when Marcus abandons weaponized narrative for “uncomfortable humanity.” The meaningful deepening occurs when he reworks the politician puppet not as villain but as layered human, narrowing his old tactics. Cost is felt in the loss of easy audience validation; escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, though the pressure remains internal and could risk abstraction if not for the charged final image of departure.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—honoring overlooked endings—is signaled early and deepens when monarchs arrive, transforming abstract intent into visceral responsibility. Mira’s agency lies in attention and construction; her choice to build *here*, *now*, forecloses permanence but enables resonance. The cost is felt in the “knot in her chest” and the looming dissolution of her work. Escalation is protagonist-driven: her past (moth wing) informs present action, which culminates in a stance crystallized by butterfly presence.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving ephemeral human utterances against time’s erasure—is signaled early and deepens through Mira’s technical process. Agency resides in her reconfiguration of the rope, which narrows options: she must weave memory *into* form, not merely recall it. Escalation is driven by protagonist choice (humming specific phrases, threading voice into braid), culminating in a trade-off: she sacrifices solitude to release voices into the world. Cost is felt in her tears and departure, not abstractly declared.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding the relationship between choice and destiny—is signaled early and deepens through protagonist agency: pressing seals transforms abstract directive into lived revelation. Escalation occurs via density increase: each interpreted dream tightens the thematic knot until the storm’s arrival crystallizes stakes. Cost is unmistakable: her “tyranny of linear time” dissolves, foreclosing her old way of being. The “precisely playful” universe complicates but doesn’t resolve—she earns insight through action, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the encrypted devotion—is signaled early and tightens when she realizes the alignment recurs in three days, forcing immediate action. Her agency drives escalation: she cross-references charts, waits for shadows, sketches symbols, spends her last money. Cost is visible (exhausted funds, risk of capture) and alters tactics (digging by hand, using borrowed time). Coincidence complicates (regime transition limits guards) but doesn’t resolve—the discovery hinges on her skill, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether Kale clings to or releases inherited resentment—is signaled early and deepens through Mira’s cellular-memory revelations. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: Kale’s resistance gives way to witnessing her brother’s truth, culminating in her active touch that regenerates the pin. Cost is unmistakable—the burden of generations—and forecloses vengeance permanently. Pressure tightens cleanly under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—retrieving a brother lost to boundary-dissolving fog—is signaled early and deepens when Aria realizes the sextant’s return means he’s trying to come back. Escalation occurs through her agency: synchronized breathing isn’t passive waiting but active navigation of dream/reality thresholds. Cost is unmistakable: she endures the risk of dissolution (“boundaries growing thin”) to recreate the boundary he crossed. The tightening—twilight as only viable window—narrows options and forces decisive action.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving generational wisdom—is signaled early and tightens when Lena reveals her incomplete knowledge. Marta’s agency drives escalation: climbing, unpacking the bag, demonstrating the grind. Cost is felt in every beat: lost workshop, strained silence, the physical act of relearning. The cathedral’s persistence mirrors their struggle—coherent pressure under a Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—deciphering nonlinear inheritance to claim her role—is signaled early and escalates via Maya’s failed attempts (pacing, cataloging) until the bath breakthrough. The tightening occurs when she realizes the cameo isn’t spatial but durational, foreclosing escape and demanding participation. Cost is legible: she accepts lifelong stewardship of forbidden knowledge, isolated by broken comms and temporal paradox. Agency drives escalation; coincidence (malfunctioning array) complicates but doesn’t resolve—she earns insight through vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—rescuing the seventeen while preserving their humanity—is signaled early and deepens when Marin realizes they’re not trapped but transformed. The meaningful tightening occurs when she shifts from extraction to negotiation, foreclosing unilateral rescue. Agency is clear: her linguistic skill and “carefully resourceful” planning enable the pivotal act of renegotiation. Cost is felt—the rescued carry irreversible knowledge—but the escalation leans slightly on revelation over physical or temporal pressure; the “three months” timeframe isn’t leveraged as a ticking clock.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reconciling truth amid fragmenting memory—is signaled early and tightens when the card’s color shifts and wall text rearranges. Mira’s agency drives escalation: she chooses which narrative thread to follow, culminating in pulling “the thread that hurt least.” The cost—accepting perpetual ambiguity—is felt in the final fleet of forgotten vessels, though the tumor backstory slightly softens immediacy of present pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—merging fractured timelines—is signaled by the sealed-yet-open door and deepens as Maren deciphers the seal-as-map. Agency is clear: her deliberate reweaving narrows options (only one pattern resolves dissonance) and incurs conceptual cost—she becomes permanently legible to the building’s fables of absence. Pressure escalates texturally: ticking layers, shadow shifts, and architectural fluidity compound until the rope’s new braid crystallizes meaning. No coincidence resolves conflict; the diplomat’s foresight merely enables Maren’s earned labor.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring bearable silence—is signaled immediately and tightens when Kael realizes the stone doesn’t erase noise but expands interstices. His agency drives escalation: interpreting cracks, sitting with the stone, absorbing its resonance. Cost is visible (lantern extinguished) and conceptual (peace requires active maintenance, not removal of threat). Energy beings remain, but the villagers’ capacity to endure shifts decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—proving coincidences are meaningful prayers—is signaled early and deepens when the prism’s break reveals a map. Esme’s agency drives escalation: she overlays charts, identifies intersections, and commits to retrieval. Cost is unmistakable: she bears solitude, physical peril, and the weight of being the last custodian. The tightening forecloses passive guardianship; she must become an active pilgrim. Coincidence (tremor + Red Wanderer) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the solution emerges from her retrocognitive labor and ancestral knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving identity through collective memory—is signaled early and tightens when impossible shadows threaten archival integrity. Elden’s agency drives escalation: her measurement method reveals recursion, forcing her final choice. Cost is unmistakable: she trades curatorship for communion, becoming monument. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies through pattern break (shadows bending time), not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—defying hopelessness through art—is signaled early and deepens via ambient awareness. Pressure escalates when Kael accepts the knot, forcing him to move through fear. The meaningful tightening occurs when he spins the unlit rag, foreclosing passive despair. Cost is visible in his emotional rupture and renewed vulnerability to flame, though escalation leans more on accumulation than protagonist-driven causality.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—navigating grief and absence—is signaled early and deepens through Mira’s accusation and Chen’s deflection. The meaningful tightening occurs when Chen interrupts with “It was your mother’s,” shifting from evasion to vulnerability. Agency is subtle but present: Mira chooses to listen, Chen chooses directness after years of tangents. Cost is felt in their shared silence and the admission of failed presence—a relational price that reconfigures their future interactions without erasing the past.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—breathing vs. survival—is signaled early and deepens when gravity inverts, forcing Mira to choose between retrieving the gilded hush or accepting loss. The thirty-minute clock tightens tactics; her kick upward is agency under constraint. Cost is unmistakable: the shattered sigh-vessel releases emotional devastation that cannot be recollected. Escalation stems from protagonist’s prior choices (collecting silences), not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming silence from trauma—is signaled early and tightened through Marco’s deliberate reduction of sound and motion, forcing Elena into confrontation with her own auditory memory. The meaningful deepening occurs when she names the flatline, and Marco responds not by fixing but by expanding her perceptual field (“Listen now—what do you hear?”). Agency lies in attention: Elena’s choice to close her eyes and listen constitutes a renunciation of passive suffering. Cost is felt in her tear, dropped shoulders, and the fragile hope of “same time next year”—a commitment that forecloses numbness.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—accessing the archive before orbital sunrise—is signaled early and tightens via the ticking clock. Kaida’s agency drives escalation: her research leads to mural, her run back triggers palace recognition, her touch activates the stairway. Cost is visible: she risks everything for memory, not power. However, the autocrats remain abstract; their threat is stated but never dramatized, slightly muting external pressure despite strong internal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming breath from suffocating relationships—is signaled early and tightens when the girl admits she’s hollow. Escalation occurs through Mara’s agency: her past burning informs present teaching, narrowing options to a single path—careful incineration. Cost is unmistakable: scars remain, bridges stay ash, solitude is reframed as space. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; readiness is earned through prior surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—translating crushing pressure into generative force—is signaled early (“pressure could compress... or create beauty”). Escalation is protagonist-driven: Mira’s choice to reply “Yes” deepens stakes, forcing her to wield pyramid-scheme-honed cunning against reality’s breach. Cost is felt in the bolt’s “impossible weight” and past shame made tangible. Coincidence never resolves; parallel selves offer pressure, not solutions.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—moral reckoning for generational theft—is signaled early and deepens when Henrik’s confession reveals an older crime. Cassian’s agency drives escalation: his intuition, technical skill, and decision to act narrow options irreversibly. The cost is conceptual (reparations must be restructured) and emotional (carrying full knowledge of poisoned roots), legible in the final paragraph’s resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reconciling free will with cosmic choreography—is signaled early via the program’s command to “Speak the oath you never finished.” Pressure escalates through protagonist agency: he chooses to read, remember, disrobe, and dance. The meaningful tightening occurs when he unsnaps his breastplate, foreclosing retreat into armor/solitude. Cost is unmistakable: each removed piece echoes as “curtains closing,” marking irreversible commitment to visibility.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—recovering erased kinship—is signaled early and deepens when Miriam finds Isaiah filed under “S” while Samuel’s pleas languish under “P.” The tightening occurs via her agency: choosing to cross-reference ensures no future searcher repeats the clerk’s error. Cost is unmistakable: she cannot undo history but pays emotional labor to rectify its record. Pressure remains coherent under an Accumulative lens—each document intensifies the weight of systemic failure and quiet repair.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving erased truth against manufactured consensus—is signaled early and tightens when the safehouse raid forces Mira to rely solely on the lagoon. Her agency drives escalation: choosing to photograph, then hide, then plan anew. Cost is unmistakable: loss of network, cover identity, and daylight safety. The searchlight’s approach crystallizes stakes without coincidence resolving tension—pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—silencing a prophecy before it harms the family—is signaled early and deepens through Marcus’s realization that truth must be “embraced so completely… it lost its power.” Escalation occurs via his agency: he doesn’t flee or fight but plays the inverse melody, narrowing options to one fragile tactic. Cost is felt in the trembling hands, the decade-long burden, and the irreversible act of unmaking meaning. No coincidence; pressure tightens through accumulated silence, not external force.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—decoding the past to enable repair—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when the moonstone speck triggers deliberate leaf-fall, shifting Miren from observer to participant. Agency is clear: her choice to prod the speck initiates the revelation; her subsequent building of seed mandalas enacts remembrance as repair. Cost is felt in her irreversible transformation and isolation, though the escalation leans slightly on coincidence (the speck’s discovery). Under Accumulative lens, one deepening suffices, but the pressure lacks a second tactical consequence beyond personal change.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—navigating by broken instruments—is signaled early and deepens when Marcus recognizes the pattern of estate pieces. Pressure escalates through his agency: he cleans, follows, enters, studies. Coincidence (mailings) complicates but doesn’t resolve; his choices drive discovery. Cost is conceptual (abandoning functional timekeeping) but felt in his workshop practice. One tightening suffices: the compass pointing to the hidden door forecloses passive collection, demanding action.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—making the weight of a name palpable—is signaled early and deepens through Mara’s alchemical act. Pressure tightens when she chooses not restoration but revelation, foreclosing false hope. The meaningful deepening occurs at the bellows: transmutation becomes truth-telling, not resurrection. Cost is felt in the magistrate’s seventeen-year suspension finally breaking into tears—agency lies in Mara’s decision to deliver unbearable truth wrapped in beauty.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—transforming collection into healing—is signaled early and tightens when Kael risks heresy by laughing. The escalation is driven by her agency: choosing absurdity over extraction deepens the thematic conflict and narrows options (guild orthodoxy vs. compassionate innovation). Cost is unmistakable: emotional toll (tears), physical cue (tooth’s heat), and the irreversible act of releasing rather than collecting. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—can mercy be quantified?—is signaled early and deepens when the old man reveals the regime co-opted her research. The meaningful tightening occurs when Sera realizes her compulsion to calculate is both wound and weapon, and she must redirect it. Agency is clear: her choice to stay and learn forecloses her identity as victim/researcher. Cost is felt in her cracked voice and trembling vulnerability—peace is more terrifying than pain because it demands surrender of control.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—honoring overlooked histories—is signaled early and deepens when Mira realizes translation isn’t conversion but honoring the “between-space.” The tightening occurs when she uses the lens to uncover hidden figures, foreclosing passive interpretation in favor of active recovery. Cost is conceptual yet undeniable: the emotional labor of bearing witness, crystallized in the exhibition’s public reckoning. Agency drives escalation—Mira chooses to document, to display—and the vendor’s guidance complicates but doesn’t resolve; the work remains hers alone.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—recovering what was hidden—is signaled early and tightens when Marcus chooses to follow the ghost over assessing the elevator. His agency drives escalation: climbing, pressing the tile, unwrapping the barrel. Cost is felt in the “weightless burden” and the commitment to find the carousel, foreclosing indifference. While pressure is coherent, the ghost’s agitation lacks tangible consequence beyond urgency; a sharper trade-off (e.g., time against demolition) would elevate stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving knowledge through stasis versus risking loss for lived experience—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the operator cranks the press, forcing Marina to confront her own voice from the first morning. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she doesn’t stop the press, listens to the whisper, reaches for the book. Cost is unmistakable: the “amber” self dissolves, silence shatters, and equilibrium becomes honest chaos. Under the Accumulative lens, each vibration deepens the rupture until the library “wakes,” narrowing options from infinite loops to one irreversible spin.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—redefining how we interpret ruins—is signaled by the chamber entry and deepens when Kasimir rejects Vhen’s economic reading. The meaningful tightening occurs when he recognizes the vase was *deliberately* shattered and mortared: this forecloses his old revolutionary impulse (“smash everything”) and forces a new method (“patient work of reimagining”). Cost is felt: his name is “an embarrassment,” yet he chooses intellectual resistance anyway. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (observation → interpretation → journaling) under an Accumulative lens, with the baroque setting itself applying coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming stolen joy—is signaled early and deepens when the forget-me-not wilts. Aldric’s agency drives escalation: his choice to complete rather than remove the transmutation raises stakes and narrows tactics. Cost is legible in the flower’s droop and the chamber’s burdened echoes. However, the “covenant of rust” concept, while evocative, exerts minimal on-page pressure beyond metaphor—slightly diluting tactical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—finding “the place where explanations fail”—is signaled early and deepens when the compass needle spins uselessly, proving natural law’s uncertainty. Escalation is driven by Mara’s agency: she reads psychometric traces, fills the vial, removes boots. The tightening forecloses return; cost is conceptual (abandoning certainty) and physical (submersion). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each sensory beat reweights the central mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—artistic integrity through engagement with history—is signaled early (“hunting driftwood... storm-gifted shapes”) and tightens when the slide reveals past makers, forcing Maya to choose between solitary reduction and collaborative legacy. This deepening, driven by protagonist agency (she reads inscriptions, reinterprets her practice), forecloses her old path with felt cost: she must now create work that “reveals its own layered meanings.” Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves conflict—the storm enables discovery but doesn’t dictate insight.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding nocturnal bloom—is signaled early and deepens via Father Benedict’s glass analogy, which reframes darkness as context rather than obstacle. The meaningful tightening occurs when Mara shifts from painting defiance to receptivity, foreclosing her prior artistic framework. Cost is felt conceptually: she relinquishes a narrative of struggle for one of belonging. Though coincidence doesn’t resolve anything, the escalation leans slightly on dialogue exposition rather than protagonist-driven discovery, slightly muting agency.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—bearing witness to silenced truths—is signaled early and escalates when Malik chooses shared burden over escape. The parley is a deepening that narrows options: one must stay, one must go. Cost is unmistakable: Sarai’s eternal entrapment and Malik’s lifelong obligation. Agency drives escalation—Malik requests descent, deciphers cipher, accepts parley—and the lagoon’s rules foreclose easy resolution. Coincidence (finding Sarai alive) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the price is paid through deliberate choice.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—transforming hollow magic into honest life—is signaled early and tightens when Miranda realizes the bottle “wasn’t trapped—it was waiting,” foreclosing the option of forced extraction. Escalation is driven by her agency: each night’s memory-work deepens stakes by revealing more potential, culminating in communal rebuilding. Cost is unmistakable: spring arrivals reject “easy consolations,” accepting the labor of truth over illusion. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via pattern break—failed wishes become generative fuel—and the bottle’s warmth pulses only in response to earned imagination.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving emotional residue—is signaled early and deepens when Marcus returns as archivist. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: his childhood touch unlocks prophecy; his adult preparation fulfills it. Cost is unmistakable: Madame Verity’s temporary blindness, Marcus’s lifelong solitude, the city’s forfeited voices. Foghorn’s permanent silence tightens pressure into a decisive reconfiguration of archival ethics.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—reversing entropy to save seeds—is signaled by line 3 and tightens when Mara realizes borrowed time must be spent. Her agency drives escalation: choosing to step into the vortex despite fear. Cost is unmistakable: sacrificing her grandmother’s unlived years. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, deepening through texture until chaos restores growth potential.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—authentic warning vs. automated noise—is signaled early and tightens when Mara overrides the system, narrowing her options to personal accountability. Escalation is driven by her agency: she interprets the rope’s signal before instruments confirm, forcing a trade-off between protocol and lives. Cost is unmistakable: physical danger (cracked buttresses), professional vulnerability, and the weight of eleven past deaths. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—density of wind, silence, and vibration intensifies until action is inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (finding meaning in surrender) tightens through Kael’s active witnessing—each logged meteor deepens her commitment to “flourishing stillness.” Agency lies in renunciation: rejecting scientific extraction for sacred observation. Cost is legible in her shadow (“armored against uncertainty”) versus light (“permeable, present”). No false escalation; pressure accumulates texturally via meteor showers and ritual acts.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—breaking the covenant of silence—is signaled early and deepens when Mara chooses to open the box despite knowing the taboo. This tightening forecloses the path of passive witnessing, forcing active intervention with visible cost: she assumes the burden of keeper-of-words. Agency is clear, pressure coherent, and escalation driven by her perception (“She would not let this box add another ghost”). Coincidence never resolves; the ghosts’ arrival is drawn by pattern, not plot convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving linear time against Fluid Timer ideology—is signaled early and tightens when Mira risks exposure via garage-sale codes. The deepening occurs when seven bookmark the listing, three send coded replies, escalating personal danger. Agency drives escalation: Mira chooses to post, to gather, to speak. Cost is felt in her isolation and the visitors’ vulnerability. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the system works because she built it. One meaningful tightening suffices, and it forecloses safety.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—beauty in imperfection—is signaled early and deepens when the boy’s loss mirrors Maren’s grief. The kite’s snap escalates pressure, forcing Maren from observer to participant. Her agency crystallizes in choosing to share the feather and invite testimony, foreclosing isolation with relational cost. Coincidence (kite loss, drake appearance) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the emotional work is earned through dialogue and presence.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—completing the architect’s vision before death—is signaled early and tightens through Maren’s agency: each rewired branch or opened channel narrows her time while deepening the orchard’s aliveness. Escalation follows Accumulative logic: birds arrive, fox sleeps beneath altar, pillars pulse—each change intensifies the central pressure to finish. Final cost is felt in her immobility yet refusal to stop; no coincidence resolves conflict. Coincidence complicates (diagnosis), but resolution stems entirely from her systematic labor.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding homecoming’s “chemistry”—tightens when Elara admits her artificial pilgrimage has become real feeling, foreclosing her clinical stance. Escalation is driven by her agency: each walk deepens self-awareness, culminating in the renunciation of pure analysis. Cost is unmistakable: her footprints wash away even as she chooses to keep walking. Quorum’s presence applies immediate, relevant pressure without resolving conflict—it mirrors and magnifies her internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming death through life—is signaled early and deepened by the spindle-beak’s instructions. Pressure escalates texturally: more seeds, more languages, more precise placements as twilight fades. Agency resides in attentive listening, not force; cost is the coachman’s solitude and unacknowledged labor. Though stakes remain internal, the narrowing of planting zones (south corner, western posts, middle) creates meaningful tactical pressure under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—translating distance into closeness—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: Mercy’s tracking, Calder’s decoding. The tightening occurs when the cylinder reveals caches encoded in silence, forcing collective action that forecloses isolation. Cost is unmistakable: years of resignation shed, trust reinitiated under risk. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each beat intensifies the imperative to connect.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—mapping time while surviving temporal flux—tightens when Maya realizes she cannot leave without dying, forcing her to transform isolation into vocation. Escalation is driven by her agency: choosing to sketch from multiple time-dilated zones deepens understanding at the cost of permanence. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through increasing density of perception until the final act reconfigures meaning, with biological cost anchoring every insight.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming trust by redefining secrecy—is signaled early and tightens when Kael places his first chess piece, risking vulnerability. Agency drives escalation: his choice to swap secrets, not luck, earns the guardian’s forgiveness. Cost is felt (five lost years, fractured trust) and visible in his shaking hands. Under a Causal lens, each beat narrows options: from hoarding to circulating, from fear to embrace.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving small human gestures against grand narratives—is signaled early and deepens when the archivist validates Mira’s method. The meaningful tightening occurs when their collaboration transforms private ritual into archival act, narrowing Mira’s isolation into shared purpose. Cost is conceptual: they bind living testimony to paper, risking erasure by future regimes. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens, with no coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding “the shape of home”—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: she chooses not to resist the vision, presses the stone into her chest, accepts pain as price. This tightening forecloses her old path of substitution (living in visions rather than flesh) with tangible cost: the feather smokes, the stone burns, her form changes. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each sensory layer intensifies until the mountain itself responds with thunder. No coincidence resolves; all escalation stems from her decision to remember.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—is signaled early and deepens when the decoded message reveals “FORGIVE.” Petrov’s agency drives escalation: his decoding choices narrow options until he must confront whether to seek external treasure or internal absolution. The cost—enduring shame while deciphering—is visible in his distorted reflection and stillness. Thunder’s progression tightens pressure, but resolution stems from Petrov’s interpretation, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—forgiveness through confession—is signaled early and deepens when Mara refracts truth via poetry, forcing the elder to concede the canyon may judge her “fractured truth.” Agency is clear: her impromptu sessions escalate pressure, culminating in the elder’s visit and conditional permission to climb. Cost is felt in her unresolved guilt and the risk of failed absolution. One tightening suffices: the shift from solitary rebellion to communal verse-building raises emotional stakes without overcomplication.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—conjuring meaning before dissolution—is signaled early and escalates through Maya’s oxygen-deprived attempts. The tightening occurs at the 45th pockmark: alignment triggers irreversible transformation, foreclosing brute-force decoding in favor of intentional repair. Agency drives escalation; luck never resolves. Cost is felt in blackening vision and poisoned air, which directly shape her renewed descent with clarified purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—fulfilling a decades-old promise to paint “something that mattered”—tightens when the mirror cracks, forcing Maren off her predictable path. Her agency drives escalation: wrong turn, cave discovery, shell painting. Cost is unmistakable: she surrenders control, audience, and permanence for raw presence. The deepening (from observation to participation) narrows her options irreversibly under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—proving whispers over shouts—is signaled early and tightens when the fishing vessel appears. Mira’s agency drives escalation: she chooses scent over horn, pulse over blare. Cost is felt in Thomas’s stunned silence and the finite garden soil. One minor gap: the ship’s danger feels slightly externalized, but the captain’s inhalation makes the stakes visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—navigating loss in an age of collective amnesia—is signaled early and deepens via Mara’s agency: she chooses to build rather than follow. The moon-phase fluctuation isn’t coincidence; it actively shapes her device’s calibration and tightens pressure as dawn approaches. Cost is legible in abandoned meals, empty chairs, and the sternum-deep tug she resists to forge a tool for “forward.”

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—psychological safety in a truth-ravaged world—tightens when Mira trades isolation for curated risk, foreclosing her old refuge. Escalation is driven by her agency: she initiates the orchard’s opening, observes outcomes, and internalizes their meaning. Cost is unmistakable: she endures emotional exposure (“psychological minefield”) to enable others’ healing. The virus’s constraint (involuntary honesty) forces every interaction to navigate brutal truth, making the relic’s placebo effect a credible pressure valve.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—decoding the stranger’s final gesture—is signaled early and deepens through Magnus’s method of observing gaps, which narrows options (no boat means arrival by unknown means) and raises conceptual cost (inheriting someone else’s secret). The tightening occurs when the key’s coordinates replace speculation with obligation, forcing Magnus into active investigation. Coincidence (the old woman’s story) complicates but doesn’t resolve; agency lies in Magnus’s choice to act, crystallizing his role as keeper of forgotten truths.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—agency over one’s path—is signaled early and deepens when Martin realizes the promise was permission, not obligation. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he follows ants, inserts the chip, then *removes it*, crystallizing his stance. Cost is unmistakable: decades of isolation acknowledged, future uncertainty embraced (“perhaps he would also put a sign…”). The creek’s rise imposes a live clock, tightening tactics without resolving via coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether to reclaim feeling after emotional calcification—is signaled early and deepens through the grotto encounter. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she chooses to enter, touch the starlight, and witness herself. The tightening occurs when fireflies force recall of her moral compromises, narrowing her options to either denial or acceptance. Cost is unmistakable: she descends “terrified of everything she might still become,” bearing irreversible self-knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—revaluing light—is signaled in the first paragraph and deepens through Solène’s rejection of the Academy’s extractive logic. The single meaningful tightening occurs when she confesses her true aim, narrowing her path: she cannot return unchanged. Agency manifests through attention and craft rather than overt action, yet the cost is unmistakable—heresy, exile, the weight of unrepeatable moments. Pressure accumulates texturally but coherently, with Mira’s presence heightening emotional stakes without resolving them externally.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—imposing order on chaos—is signaled early and deepens when Maren recognizes her feral nostalgia as jealousy, not longing. Her agency drives escalation: chronicling dreams professionally stems from lucid control, and writing her own visions is a tactical response to temporal unraveling. Cost is unmistakable: she envies/pities her past/future selves, knowing memory is malleable. Coincidence (grave discovery) complicates but doesn’t resolve; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—maternal lineage versus societal expectation—is signaled early and deepens when Elena connects the stopped clock to Mrs. Kapoor’s breath-holding. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her sensory recalibration under pressure transforms observation into intervention. Cost is felt in the deliberate decision to leave the clock broken, foreclosing easy reconciliation.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—transforming scars into stories—is signaled early and deepens via each rune drawn. Pressure escalates as crystallization threatens failure, forcing Mira to choose between academic discipline and grandmother’s “small magics.” Her agency drives every turn; the cost (reliving trauma) is felt in each memory. The storm’s arrival confirms stakes were real, not abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—atonement for weaponized words—is signaled early and deepens when Margot admits her fear of being “ordinary.” Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she chooses vulnerability over defensiveness, rewriting history despite knowing it can’t restore Vivienne. Cost is unmistakable: deletion of her old article symbolizes professional self-immolation, while the orchard’s doom underscores irreversibility. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens—each gust of paper intensifies emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—witnessing the universe’s final moment without flinching—is signaled early and deepens when Kael realizes witnessing requires dissolution of self. The spiral arbitration forces a meaningful tightening: walking concentric circles merges voices and dissolves absolute truth, narrowing her options to unity or separation. Her choice to walk carries conceptual cost (loss of individual identity), and the approaching Hiccup applies coherent pressure that crystallizes her stance under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding time’s true nature—is signaled early and escalates via Maren’s agency: she chooses to unwind the clocks, despite knowing it defies protocol. The tightening occurs at “forty-seven, forty-six…” when mercury defies gravity and the horizon ripples, narrowing her options to completion or ruin. Cost is unmistakable: bloodied fingers, vanished seconds, and the burden of secrecy. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure deepens through rhythmic counting and physical toll, culminating in a crystallized stance—she will keep the secret—that forecloses her former innocence.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—letting go of a failed relationship—is signaled early via Mara’s compulsive analysis. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: her recognition of nutrient flow in fungal beds triggers the breakthrough. Cost is felt (“constant energy expenditure”) and crystallizes in her decision to delete the number. Under Accumulative lens, pressure tightens via layered imagery rather than causal turns, which fits scope—but lacks a second tangible loss (e.g., social, temporal) that would push score higher.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reconciling love for a destructive father—tightens when symbols reveal “WIDEN YOUR VIEW,” forcing Maya to confront her narrowed perspective. Agency drives escalation: she traverses stacks, interprets scrawls, chooses hospital over isolation. Cost is felt in the “fertile” melancholy—she accepts ongoing pain without resolution. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each symbol deepens the thematic conflict, culminating in a stance crystallization that forecloses her prior certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving urban loneliness via “cultivated estrangement”—is signaled early and tightened when the caller breaches protocol by remembering their prior conversation. Sarah’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to describe the disc’s sound, then to play it, then to prescribe calling his son. Each choice narrows her options (increasing job jeopardy) and deepens thematic stakes. Cost is unmistakable: she risks her livelihood for human connection, crystallizing her stance against systemic alienation. Coincidence (his daughter’s death) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the resolution comes from Sarah’s deliberate intervention.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving meaning in abandonment—is signaled early and deepens when lockets arrive. Maren’s agency lies in her “gently thorough” attention, which enables recognition and thus return. The tightening occurs when figures emerge: not rescue, but consequence of her steadfastness. Cost is felt in her isolation and the town’s decay, now transformed but not erased—the covenant’s regeneration carries the weight of all those lost years.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—loneliness as an unaided disaster—is signaled in Mara’s first line and deepens when Emil reveals the network of isolated relief workers. The tightening occurs when the seventeen fragments touch: not magic, but “permission” to stop moving, forcing a trade-off between autonomy and belonging. Cost is unmistakable: they forfeit the safety of invisibility to build something permanent, crystallized in their return after future disasters. Agency drives escalation—each character chooses to arrive, to combine stones, to stay.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—navigating grief—is signaled early and deepens when the sister’s melody emerges, forcing Sera to confront loss as familiar, not foreign. Agency drives escalation: her decision to follow dissonant notes narrows options from external mapping to internal inhabitation. Cost is felt in the relinquishment of client work for self-mapping, crystallized in Earned Stasis. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens, with no coincidental resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—discerning truth in cosmic noise—is signaled early and deepens when Mara realizes the noise *is* the signal. Escalation occurs through her agency: she cross-references archives, feels the anomaly pulse, and chooses to document rather than resist. Cost is unmistakable: her own logs change, history flexes, and certainty is surrendered. The tightening forecloses her old role (interpreter) and forces a trade-off: stability for participation. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from her actions or the station’s established physics.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—being forgotten—tightens when Theo transforms her private maps into public music, forcing Marina to confront visibility versus permanence. Her agency drives escalation: months of sketching enable the program; her choice to join Theo reconfigures isolation into collaboration. Cost is legible in her tears and “joyful sorrow,” and the dawn-scatter implies inevitable return to obscurity. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from her labor or Theo’s translation.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving forbidden love against erasure—is signaled early and deepens when the Tethyan fresco matches the tapestry, transforming personal mission into historical proof. Escalation is driven by Mara’s agency: each theft built the map; the final documentation crystallizes her stance. Cost is unmistakable: “became a criminal,” “destroyed her reputation,” and the emotional toll of tears amid revelation. The tightening—realizing all stolen works form one message—narrows her path to public exposure despite risk, fulfilling Accumulative lens requirements with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving individual identity versus embracing merged consciousness—is signaled early and deepens through Theo’s drumming, which escalates from unconscious mimicry to collaborative creation. Pressure tightens when the garden reacts to their confusion, forcing a stance. Agency is clear: Theo chooses to drum *with* Marquez, not despite her, and this act forecloses retreat into isolation. Cost is auroral sorrow—the bittersweet loss of separateness—and it’s embedded in the lagoon’s rising spirals, not merely stated.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—proving one belongs by mastering the labyrinth’s hidden logic—is signaled early and deepens when Marcus must choose between instinctive action and disciplined listening. The tightening occurs when he abandons visual navigation for auditory mapping, narrowing options under storm-induced chaos. Cost is legible: years of solitude crystallize into a single rhythmic tap that risks everything. Coincidence (storm timing) complicates but doesn’t resolve; agency drives the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving the canals against erasure—is signaled early and tightens when Marina risks her livelihood to act. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: she initiates mirror signaling, which the guardian answers, co-creating a public testament. Cost is visible in her silenced testimony and looming job loss. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure builds via pattern density, not reversal, culminating in a map of constellations that forecloses invisibility for the displaced.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—freedom to question versus enforced conformity—is signaled early and tightens when Miss Chen reveals the grotto. The meaningful deepening occurs when Danny moves from resignation (“That’s it?”) to agency (“I’ll tell my father…”), then transcends it (“I’m asking you to think freely”). Cost is conceptual but felt: risking paternal disapproval for intellectual autonomy. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, though the “humble rebellion” lacks tangible consequence beyond symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—freedom through self-reclamation—is signaled early (“brutally efficient yet balletic”) and deepens when the scrimshaw reveals the island. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: Mira challenges Kael (“Pirates don't own things”), then chooses detachment. The whale’s call complicates but doesn’t resolve; their joint decision narrows options with clear cost (abandoning duty, inheritance). Pressure coheres under a Causal lens with one decisive tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming authentic grief after state-enforced joy—is signaled early and deepens when Emma names the flowers’ origin, forcing Marcus to confront his performative survival. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: his narration shifts from resistance tactic to vulnerability, culminating in abandoned performance. Cost is unmistakable: years of suppressed emotion crystallize in Emma’s cracked mask and shared silence, foreclosing return to mandated numbness.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming language as aesthetic experience over state-controlled utility—is signaled early and tightens when Meris refuses paraphrase, foreclosing fixed meaning. Escalation occurs through accumulation: humming intensifies, poets approach, boundaries dissolve. The cost is conceptual but legible—the knowledge that once fluidity is remembered, it cannot be unlearned, even if repression returns. Agency is clear, though the opposition remains abstract rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—awakening those trapped by the phoenix’s song—is signaled early via plant arrangements and deepens when Maya trades consciousness for the reed. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: drowsiness spreads, narrowing functional agency until only Maya’s art can cut through. The tightening occurs when she demands payment, transforming charity into barter with moral weight. Cost is felt (scorched world, isolation) but not visibly paid by Maya herself; the story leans on conceptual price rather than personal sacrifice, slightly muting escalation’s bite.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—recovering intimacy’s sonic fingerprint—is signaled early and deepens when Maren shifts from collector to conduit. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: she designs increasingly complex sound environments, culminating in tonight’s “most ambitious iteration.” Cost is felt in her isolation (“few remembered [her name]”) and the risk of exposing her fragile theory to a stranger. The tightening—inviting the volunteer into her sanctuary—narrows her path from observer to participant, with the price being vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming performative grief into authentic expression—is signaled early and tightens when Senna creates her brooch with hidden windows. Agency drives escalation: Mara’s teaching, Senna’s three-week labor, and the mutual climb to the dome are active choices under pressure. Cost is felt in surrendered privacy and reopened wounds, though conceptual price (“withering to bloom”) slightly edges out visceral immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—decoding hidden cultural knowledge before it’s lost—is signaled early and deepens when Marcus reveals his grandmother’s Indigenous collaborations, raising ethical urgency. Pressure escalates via Vesper’s agency: she identifies the circuits as maps, matches ratios, and offers collaboration. The cost is conceptual but felt: anthropology devalued post-crash, wisdom disguised as engineering. One meaningful tightening occurs when they realize the diagrams aren’t failures but encodings—narrowing interpretation to active recovery. Coincidence (Marcus arriving with papers) complicates but doesn’t resolve; decoding is earned through methodical comparison.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—accessing truth vs. preserving humanity—is signaled early and deepens when she learns transcendence demands forgetting “every small perfect thing.” The tightening occurs when she absorbs the child’s doomed innocence, raising the cost from intellectual exile to emotional devastation. Agency drives escalation: her choice to keep absorbing crystals despite grief proves commitment. Final cost is conceptual: she now carries unbearable knowledge that must be shared as caution, not salvation.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving authentic hope—is signaled early and deepens when Sera compares footage, revealing how optimization erodes truth. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses to copy corrupted files, narrowing her path (risking expulsion). Cost is unmistakable: she sacrifices archival conformity for luminous regret’s weight. The “shadow unbound” concept reweights stakes without resolving conflict—it sharpens the moral calculus.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. credibility—is signaled early and deepens when Elena admits her methodology was flawed despite genuine observation. The tightening occurs when she chooses qualitative honesty over statistical fraud, foreclosing institutional validation but preserving self-respect. Cost is unmistakable: professional exile, shattered reputation, and the emotional toll of solitude. Agency drives escalation—her decision to reconstruct research “honestly this time” emerges from internal pressure, not coincidence, under an Accumulative lens where each image (shed skin, broken glass) reweights the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—uncovering who buried Sarah—is signaled early and deepens when plant memories reveal Dr. Venn dragging her. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she tunnels through rose memories, interrogates coffee rings, and presses her scarred palm to the table, each action narrowing options until only justice remains. Cost is unmistakable: her wrist bleeds anew, and closure forecloses healing in favor of confrontation. Coincidence (meteor’s hush) complicates but doesn’t resolve; truth emerges through persistent, painful labor.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—locating and redeeming unused love—is signaled early and deepens when Celeste realizes she cannot return it but must redirect it. The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses redistribution over restitution, foreclosing personal closure for communal grace. Cost is legible: she accepts the irreversibility of lost time. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (search → discovery → reinterpretation → action), consistent with the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity—is signaled early and deepens when Celestine recognizes her own calcification. The single tightening occurs when she chooses intuitive tracing over precision, narrowing options (she cannot both control and create). Cost is visible: the Keeper dissolves, and Celestine abandons inherited rigidity. Agency drives escalation; coincidence plays no role. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, though the stakes’ internal nature slightly softens external tension.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—cultivating futures in a fractured world—is signaled early and deepens when the seeds scatter across superpositions, forcing Maren to trust probability rather than control. The tightening occurs in her vocal “charm,” a high-stakes act that risks failure if misaligned with wave functions. Cost is visible: she remains dreamless, sacrificing personal restoration for systemic renewal. Though pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens, escalation leans more on lyrical intensification than protagonist-driven agency narrowing options, slightly limiting the score.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—accessing knowledge beyond conscious logic—is signaled early and deepens via the hum of insight, which narrows options to intuitive assembly. The meaningful tightening occurs when he fits the gears not by engineering but by “intuition,” accepting the cost of trusting his unconscious over reason. Agency is clear: sleep is his “laboratory,” dream his “methodology.” Coincidence complicates (translocations) but resolution is earned through accumulated trust in non-rational cognition.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming unused courage—is signaled early and tightened when the woman guide reframes the loss (“not your dog... something leashed longer”). Mara’s agency drives escalation: her confession deepens pressure, leading to the pivotal admission of feeling “lighter,” which crystallizes the central conflict between fear and freedom. Cost is felt in the renunciation of control (“without a leash”) and the irreversible step into darkness. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from Mara’s choices under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding the cost of safety—tightens when Rielle sees the bolt and learns Silent-Choir was present, forcing her to confront collective sacrifice. Agency lies in attention and endurance: she chooses to play despite pain, redefining safety as shared burden. Cost is unmistakable: shattered nerves, lost voices, dead children. Escalation is driven by protagonist’s perception deepening, not coincidence, under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving historical truth against genealogical forgery—is signaled early and deepens through Ossian’s discovery of corrupted marginalia. Escalation is driven by his agency: he counters lies not with force but with the rune of drift, narrowing options to a single, elegant unraveling. Cost is felt in centuries of solitary watchfulness, culminating in the evaporation of starlight-water—a quiet forfeiture. Coincidence (ink pellet’s arrival) complicates but does not resolve; Ossian’s choices earn the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—deciphering why vanished routes persist—is signaled early and tightens when the ghost current appears 17 years early. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she cross-references data, interprets rhythm, and commands sensor deployment. The cost is conceptual but legible: humanity’s irreversible imprint on natural systems, witnessed in dead coral and encoded in water. While coincidence (radio call) complicates, resolution stems from her insight, not luck. A slight deduction for the anomaly’s timing feeling slightly convenient rather than pressured by prior choices.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—finding meaning beyond failed rebellion—is signaled early and deepens when the stone circle reframes the conflict from political to perceptual. Escalation is driven by Kess’s agency: she lowers glasses, notices debris pattern, steps into circle, presses palm, aligns symbols—all choices narrowing options toward a new path. Cost is unmistakable: rejection of comrades’ legacy, solitude, and the weight of teaching others to “see differently.” Coincidence never resolves; pressure tightens through accumulated detail under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving tradition through evolution—is signaled early and tightens when the embryo reveals the “genetic bridge.” Naja’s agency drives escalation: decoding, descending, speaking the hybrid incantation. Cost is unmistakable: irreversible biological integration, lifelong secrecy, and burden of selection (“sensing which survivors carried the genetic potential”). Pressure coheres causally without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—transforming survival into cultivation—is signaled early and deepens when the pregnant couple’s presence forces Mira to articulate the cereus’s ephemeral worth, echoing her own losses. This moment narrows options: she could retreat, but chooses witness, crystallizing her stance. Cost is felt in every layer of nacre—“I am alive when they are not”—and the lighthouse’s surrender mirrors her adapted purpose. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her method of stillness actively reweights trauma into beauty.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—artistic integrity versus societal rejection—is signaled early and deepens as each card forces confrontation with denied truths. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: laying out cards tightens the room, accelerating her understanding. The cost is felt in real time—walls closing, books falling—and culminates in the burning of her portraits. This isn’t coincidence; it’s a causal chain of perception under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether to prioritize justice or truth—tightens when Kael chooses to document ink before pursuing. Vera’s challenge (“doesn’t time feel slower?”) deepens pressure by weaponizing shared trauma. Cost is visible: Kael’s arrest order rings hollow against his lingering gaze at the ink. Escalation stems from protagonist agency—his conscious wildness lets him read what others miss—and culminates in a stance that forecloses neither path cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. stability—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Maren overrides safeties, narrowing options from passive archivist to active rebel. Escalation is driven by her agency under Causal lens: reading archives → receiving letter → choosing one Testimonial. Cost is unmistakable: “ending her own life as she’d known it.” Moral calculus between collective safety and historical justice sharpens the peak choice without false equivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving meaning in a broken world—is signaled early and deepens when Kael admits the magistrate’s demand (a lie that reveals his true ask). Mira’s agency lies in renunciation: she refuses to cede the farm, redefining “hunting” as nurturing. The escalation is subtle but decisive: from whispered care to direct confrontation to quiet invitation. Cost is felt in what’s unsaid—Kael’s buried grief, Mira’s awareness of his deception—and crystallized in his blade staying sheathed.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—catching the goddess’s unfiltered echo—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency: Mara shapes silence deliberately, driving the garden’s response. The meaningful deepening occurs when constellations shift, raising conceptual stakes (architecture of night itself breaking). Cost is unmistakable: the echo rewires her neural pathways, a permanent internal alteration. Pressure coheres under Accumulative logic—density and pattern break reweight longing as a viable lure.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. legacy—is signaled early and tightens via Celeste’s agency: she cross-references archives, deciphers coded notes, and reinterprets her father’s retraction as a dare. The meaningful deepening (“he’d been strategic”) narrows options to one: publish or betray his ghost. Cost is unmistakable—her father’s life, her isolation—and crystallizes in the Charged Poise of dawn approaching as she writes. Coincidence (Marcus’s call) complicates but doesn’t resolve; her intellect drives escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—translating unheeded cries—is signaled early and deepens when Vera realizes the firmware’s corruption stems from her own accumulated guilt. The tightening occurs when she chooses to rewrite her constellation, not debug code, foreclosing her past self’s evasion. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens: each layer of sound intensifies emotional pressure until the amber’s use becomes inevitable. Cost is unmistakable—the wasp completes its flight only after she answers the call she ignored.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—resisting total erasure through creative witness—is signaled early and deepens when the crowd arrives, transforming private ritual into communal anchor. Moth’s agency drives escalation: she chooses silence over naming, pattern over panic, presence over flight. Cost is felt in every worn chalk nub and unspoken word. The tightening—“Don’t speak it”—forecloses verbal recovery, forcing reliance on fragile, visual resonance, which crystallizes the story’s moral calculus: some meanings survive only in form, not fact.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving memory against erasure—is signaled early and tightens through each spoken name, which actively fractures the regime’s control. Layla’s agency drives escalation: refusal to burn, then refusal to forget. Cost is felt in her trapped consciousness and mechanical body, now repurposed at great personal risk. The final gathering of survivors crystallizes stakes without resolving them—regime will return, but meaning has shifted irreversibly.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—proving existence through witnessed performance—is signaled early and tightens when Margaux realizes only a final dance can anchor her unraveling self. Agency drives escalation: she chooses to perform in the garden, uses the coin, and dances to “lure possibility,” directly causing the temporal cascade. Cost is unmistakable: she sacrifices singular consciousness for fragmented eternity, paid in the bow that shatters the coin. Coincidence complicates (lost child, nostalgic man) but doesn’t resolve; resonance stems from her deliberate act.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—freeing 800 minds tangled in telepathic noise—is signaled early and tightens when Mara realizes she can *see* the pathways. Her agency drives escalation: she doesn’t wait for a cure; she devises a method through somatic markers.

Coincidence (the storm) complicates but doesn’t resolve; solution arises from her altered perception.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—translating emotional truth for future humanity—tightens when Maren discovers non-human sentience, forcing her to expand her mission beyond human memory. Her agency drives escalation: she extends consciousness, presses the fossil to the wall, and redefines mapping as dialogue. Cost is legible in her relinquished anthropocentrism (“loneliness of deep things”) and the irreversible fusion of self with stone. Coincidence never resolves; the caves’ sentience responds only because she first perceives it.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving meaning against accelerating forgetting—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Mara realizes cataloging must become communion. The deepening (button patterns revealing collective prophecy) narrows options: passive archiving fails; only active sharing slows time. Protagonist agency drives escalation—Mara’s choice to display the echo jar reconfigures the warehouse’s purpose. Cost is unmistakable: the abandonment of sterile order for vulnerable connection, crystallized in the hourglasses’ deceleration. Coincidence never resolves; insight emerges from labor.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—honoring Sarah’s promise by preserving truth before it melts—is signaled early and tightens under spring’s deadline. Marcus’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to descend, recruit Emma, and document the codes. Cost is felt in lost time, risked trust, and the emotional toll of re-engagement. One meaningful deepening occurs when he realizes the snow is a map—not geography but networks—shifting his understanding and raising stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.2)
    The dominant stake—whether a life’s truth can be reduced to one layer—is signaled early and deepens through the woman’s confession. Pressure escalates via ambient awareness: the coachman perceives her anxiety before she speaks, and the fog strips away pretense. The meaningful tightening occurs when she reveals the needle, forcing the thematic pivot. Cost is unmistakable: she abandons her quest for a singular truth, accepting multiplicity—a renunciation with emotional weight earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding why kindness preserves against entropy—is signaled early and deepens when the beekeeper reveals the oasis’s temporal anchor is ethical, not mystical. Pressure escalates through the protagonist’s own recognition (“She did know…”) and culminates in a Charged Poise: she chooses to carry the lantern’s truth into the wasteland, foreclosing retreat into ignorance. Cost is felt in the contrast between oasis harmony and external desolation. Agency is internal but decisive—her epiphany alters her future practice (“slowly, gently”) with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—bringing light/growth to a light-starved community—is signaled early and deepens through Mira’s realization that her gardening is a form of locksmithing. Pressure escalates accumulatively: each garden tended, each mirror adjusted, builds toward the discovery of a neighbor’s seedlings, proving her system works. Cost is felt in the dead rosebush and the inherited burden of care, though the “quivering hush” remains slightly abstract. Agency is clear: her choices directly enable the neighborhood’s tentative renewal.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—translating isolation into unprecedented independence—is signaled early and deepens through Mira’s engagement with extinct memories. The meaningful tightening occurs when the new book declares her a “bridge,” foreclosing the path of self-perceived fragmentation. Though pressure is internal, it’s coherent under an Accumulative lens: each memory cataloged intensifies her dual existence until the final reconfiguration. Cost is felt in her solitude and the burden of extinction, though a more visceral trade-off would elevate this further.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—finding the thread that connects longing—is signaled early and deepens when Margot recognizes her ghostwritten letters in the installation. The meaningful tightening occurs when she shifts from observer to participant, foreclosing her identity as mere vessel. Cost is felt in her throat tightening and the vulnerability of offering her own secret. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens: each object she sees reweights her understanding until action becomes inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preventing cosmic-induced societal fracture—is signaled early and escalates coherently: lab anomalies → campus blame → city-wide threat. Mara’s agency drives the key deepening: her self-composed track isn’t reactive but a tactical gambit that narrows options (risking direct confrontation). The cost is felt in the “ethereal grit” of scrutiny and implied ongoing burden. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure tightens via pattern density (laughter-like circuits, impossible colors), culminating in a trade-off: temporary stability bought through personal exposure, not luck or coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming hidden knowledge of free movement—is signaled early and deepens when the Key proves conceptual, not physical. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: Mara follows sound despite terror, traces the disc, photographs it. The organ doesn’t resolve; it instructs, making her active interpreter. Cost is felt in sustained psychological strain and the irreversible shift from seeker to bearer of truth. Coincidence (organ playing) complicates but doesn’t solve—she must still act.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—awakening dormant empathy to solve a cold case—is signaled early and deepens when the evidence box vanishes, raising the cost of failure. Elena’s agency drives escalation: her interviews extract emotional architecture, not facts, and her method forces witnesses to remember feeling before face. The tightening occurs when the portrait’s ambiguity becomes its power, triggering three confessions. Cost is felt in Elena’s isolation (inability to recognize Morrison’s relief) and the irreversible surrender of forensic certainty for emotional truth.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—proving reversible exile is real—tightens when Mira reveals the wound-door is *beneath the station*, transforming abstract research into immediate, dangerous action. Agency is clear: she chooses descent despite dread, and Dr. Kao’s shift from skeptic to documentarian shows pressure altering stance. Cost is legible in Mira’s “spongey dread” and the implicit risk of non-return. The jet stream’s collapse isn’t coincidence; it’s the precondition that makes the wound-door accessible, escalating from historical curiosity to urgent test.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—granting passage to pixelated beings—is signaled early via the hitchhiker’s request and deepens when Mara decodes the scaffold. Escalation occurs through her agency: observing, interpreting, then playing. Cost is felt (aching arm, irreversible awareness) and shapes tactics—she must translate visual pattern into sound. Coincidence (wind fluttering wrap) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from her skill and choice to play.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—breaking generational cycles—is signaled early and deepens when the father appears. Marco’s agency drives escalation: he doesn’t wait but offers an alternative shaped by his preserve work. The tightening occurs in his line “some circles can be broken,” which reweights the father’s fatalism. Cost is unmistakable: the father must relinquish his identity as highwayman, symbolized by touching the bills “staring back” like ghosts. Pressure remains coherent under Hybrid lens, with no coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—decoding inscriptions to avoid Ashwin’s fate—is signaled early and deepens when they realize the priests designed knowledge for collaboration. The meaningful tightening occurs when Elias matches Delta Cephei’s period to Mara’s grief symbol, shifting from translation to healing. Protagonist agency drives escalation: Mara shares journals, Elias offers partnership. Cost is felt in Ashwin’s death and their own prior isolation, now renounced through joint authorship—a trade-off made visible in the closing act of writing together.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—freeing the apprentice from self-inflicted paralysis—is signaled early and deepens when Maren realizes he was cultivating flesh-eating seeds, raising moral stakes. Escalation is driven by her agency: she shifts from grandmother’s method to war-song, forcing the scream. Cost is visible—the seeds’ destruction, the apprentice’s trauma—and the tightening (from gentle song to hammer-like notes) forecloses passive rescue. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from character choice under coherent magical rules.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—navigating a future that arrived too soon—is signaled early and escalates via the broken covenant. The tightening occurs when they abandon prior visions to “heed what’s happening now,” forcing reliance on scar-linking. Cost is legible: the ordered topiary dissolves into soil, symbolizing surrender of individual prophetic control. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves tension.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—trading melancholy for happiness—is signaled early and escalates through Marcus’s physical unraveling (“swallowed wasps”) and Rebecca’s off-stage consequence, which tightens pressure. The Oracle’s revelation forces a decisive deepening: joy cannot be worn like clothing. Agency lies in Marcus’s final choice to accept wholeness, foreclosing the path of barter with felt cost. Coincidence never resolves; escalation stems from prior causal choices under a coherent Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—professional credibility—is signaled early and deepens when the Ming vase failure metastasizes into existential doubt. The crate’s arrival tightens pressure: now he must appraise under scrutiny, forcing a trade-off between factual armor and intuitive trust. Cost is unmistakable: his reputation is already gone, but risking further shame by trusting feeling carries emotional peril. Agency drives escalation—Marcus chooses vulnerability despite fear.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding consciousness transition—is signaled early and deepens when the seed sprouts instantly, forcing Emilia from observer to participant. Her agency drives escalation: planting triggers the tremor, touching yields insight, biting commits her to legacy. Cost is conceptual (grief transformed, not resolved) and visible in her vow to catalog fruits. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each sensory beat tightens the thematic coil until closure reweights everything.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder amid temporal stasis—is signaled early and deepened when the visitor confesses lost aspiration. Maris’s agency drives escalation: she chooses random scroll selection, pours molten identities, reframes loss as honor. Cost is unmistakable: documents of future selves are destroyed to forge new meaning. Under Accumulative lens, pressure tightens via textual density (gears + tides + forge) converging in the mobile’s charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—what survival costs—is signaled early and deepens when Marcus realizes bunkers extract soul, not just supplies. Pressure escalates through the shell’s confessions, forcing Marcus to choose between inventory and testimony. Cost is visible: he abandons clinical detachment at professional risk. Agency drives escalation—his reading unlocks the cave’s response—but the “glowing” mechanism borders on convenient magic.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness through re-engagement with truth—is signaled early and tightens via Maya’s deepening river immersion, culminating in the center-wading beat where she risks physical and emotional instability. Agency drives escalation: her methodical notation, graffiti responses, and map metaphors narrow options toward confronting the forgiveness paradox. Cost is unmistakable in her raw, unmedicated vulnerability and the irreversible shift from observer to participant. Coincidence never resolves; all pressure stems from her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding why humans make devastating choices in solitude—is signaled early and deepens when the cipher reveals not coordinates of crime but of unspoken love. The tightening occurs when documentation becomes an act of preservation rather than evidence-gathering, narrowing options from legal restitution to emotional inheritance. Agency drives escalation: her methodical note-taking alters perception of the library’s geometry. Cost is felt in the trembling hands and irreversible loss of simplistic moral clarity, though the confidence man’s absence slightly softens external pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—authenticating stolen heritage before proof vanishes—is signaled early and tightens relentlessly. Elena’s agency drives escalation: reading futures, choosing falsification, encrypting truth. The cost is unmistakable: personal ruin versus institutional erasure. Under an Accumulative lens, each plant’s whisper deepens moral pressure without resolving it mechanically—coincidence complicates (dawn deadline), but Elena’s choice crystallizes stance.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving transient beauty against decay—is signaled early and deepens as aurora responds to the girl’s presence. Lyra’s agency drives escalation: placing the chip, warming oils, positioning mirrors. Each act narrows options (too much warmth slackens features; dawn approaches). Cost is unmistakable: this beauty exists “now” but “will fade with the dawn”—a trade-off Lyra knowingly accepts. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: density of light, pigment, and ritual intensifies until climax.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—finding contentment’s source—tightens when Keiko admits last month’s “understanding” failed, forcing deeper inquiry. Agency drives escalation: her observation of fishermen reframes acceptance as practice, prompting the woman’s hairpin removal. Cost is felt in Keiko’s realization that forgiveness didn’t “solve everything,” crystallizing in the Charged Poise of descent—she carries the quest forward, foreclosing resolution but gaining purpose. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens via recurring motifs (clouds, offerings) that narrow options to continued seeking.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reconciling moral certainty with human complexity—is signaled early and tightens when Mara admits she “never asked about the nephew’s age.” The meaningful deepening occurs in dialogue with the keeper, where wind chimes model nuanced decision-making, forcing Mara to confront her binary rigidity. Agency drives escalation: her choice to “unhook” certainty leads directly to redefining her vocation. Cost is felt in her throat tightening and the relinquished shard—concrete losses that alter future tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—transmitting fragile knowledge before forgetting—is signaled early and tightens when the student asks, “Will you forget this?” The researcher’s agency drives escalation: she times revelation to his readiness, using pond patterns and trance to deepen understanding. Cost is unmistakable: she teaches what she’ll soon lose, and the magnetic alignment ensures this moment cannot be repeated. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each ripple, hum, and whisper intensifies the central tension.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving resonant navigation—is signaled early and deepens when Kael diagnoses the tower’s fracture. Agency is clear: his appraising triggers understanding, which compels repair. Cost is felt (“weeks of careful work”) though not yet paid; under Accumulative lens, one meaningful intensification suffices. Coincidence (ravens scattering) complicates but doesn’t resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (finding sacred meaning in obsolescence) tightens when Maren’s failed “mist walking” deepens her resolve, narrowing options to pure presence. Agency drives escalation: her repeated attempts, not luck, trigger the keystone’s glow. Cost is unmistakable—numbness, isolation, rejection of spell-generators—and crystallizes in Charged Poise: she chooses lingering luminance over blinding efficiency. Coincidence never resolves; the grandmother’s journal enables but doesn’t dictate the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—completing her grandfather’s luminous vow—is signaled early and tightens when Mara chooses secrecy over extraction, preserving the archive underwater. Agency is clear: her months of preparation, wetsuit beneath coat, and photographic documentation are deliberate tactics shaped by tidal timing and social invisibility. Cost is legible in isolation and deferred recognition; the memorial’s skyward gaze enables her downward transgression, making time a live pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—surviving universal contraction via resonance—is signaled early and tightens decisively when static bursts reveal backwards instructions. Mira’s agency drives escalation: she interprets interference, deciphers the alignment imperative, and teaches others, foreclosing passive oblivion. The cost is legible in Kael’s weeping vision and the irreversible dissolution of individual minds into seed patterns. Pressure coheres under the Causal lens, with each discovery narrowing options toward transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—choosing love that endures versus love that consumes—is signaled early and tightens when Mira sees Daniel’s hopeful eyes and foresees his aging. The deepening occurs in her vision of “a thousand years of watching him age,” which narrows options to renunciation. Cost is unmistakable: she crystallizes joy into grief, walks away, and carries dragons. Escalation is driven entirely by her agency under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—restoring cosmic balance—is signaled early and tightens via Emris’s realization that the sea is “oversaturated.” His agency drives escalation: interpreting drip patterns, crafting a clapper, applying “measured pulses” of magic. Cost is unmistakable: exhaustion, near-shattered devotion, social isolation. The final act forecloses passivity; balance resumes “not abundantly,” preserving consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving or witnessing lost meaning—is signaled early and deepens when Eleanor demands shared witnessing. Marcus’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to follow, sit, listen, and finally ask for stories. The tightening forecloses his prior stance of dutiful forgetting, with cost in emotional vulnerability. Autumn rains loom as irreversible pressure, making this temporary resurrection urgent. Coincidence (drought) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from human choice under constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—harmonizing reason and wonder—is signaled early and deepens when the orchard shudders upon crystal retrieval, raising the cost of failure. Lyra’s agency drives escalation: she trusts starling patterns over pure calculation, a choice that narrows her options to intuition-guided action. The visible price is her professional exile (implied by secrecy) and emotional vulnerability (handkerchief as talisman). Coincidence complicates (orchard’s instability) but never resolves; success stems from her trained yet open perception.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving truth under institutional pressure—is signaled early and tightens when Command demands revision. Vera’s agency drives escalation: she defends her notation, invokes the predecessor’s failure, and re-explains her system. The cost is felt in her isolation and the bite of the buckle; the deepening (Command’s personal intervention) raises emotional stakes without coincidence. One meaningful turn suffices, and it forecloses compromise.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—custody of their daughter—is signaled immediately and deepens via Kira’s emotional numbness versus Clone-Kira’s overwhelming feeling. The tightening occurs when Kira admits she doesn’t love the child, raising the cost of joint custody from logistical to existential. Agency drives escalation: Kira proposes “complementary opposites” as a lived philosophy, not passive compromise. The court’s demand for simplicity contrasts with their complex reality, making the final stance a high-cost renunciation of societal norms for relational authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—protecting creative autonomy—is signaled early and deepens when Margot recognizes sabotage. The meaningful tightening occurs when she links the seed to business closures, transforming curiosity into threat. Her agency drives escalation: research, insight, then decisive refusal. Cost is unmistakable: she must now divert energy to warn others, and the “peace” she earns is shadowed by awareness of ongoing danger. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming sound from suffocating silence—is signaled early and escalates via Martin’s solitary ritual, then deepens when Sarah enters, forcing a shift from private catharsis to shared vulnerability. The tightening occurs when Martin hands her the blower: a live option (isolation) is foreclosed. Cost is felt in cracked voices, tears, and the machine running out of gas—visible prices that alter later tactics (they must return tomorrow). Protagonist agency drives every escalation; coincidence never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—protecting the Codex from cultists—is signaled early and deepens when the pendant becomes a wound in reality. Maris’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to grasp it despite fracturing across dimensions. Cost is unmistakable: possible dissolution, memory loss, or eternal statue-hood. The single tightening—pendant’s pulse triggering dimensional homesickness—narrows options to destruction or surrender, with no coincidence resolving pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—Cassia’s need to transcend inherited failure—is signaled early and tightens when she chooses forbidden rites over sanctioned methods. The escalation is driven by her agency: grinding moonstone, mixing blood, whispering vivification rites. Cost is unmistakable: she risks corruption and exile to achieve authenticity. The break in the crozier isn’t random—it’s political—and her response redefines what authority can be, deepening stakes beyond mere repair.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—decoding meaning in stellar death—is signaled early and deepens when Mira discards assumptions, narrowing options to one radical method. Agency drives escalation: her choice to seek silence, not signal, creates the breakthrough. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: she forfeits institutional validation for a truth only she can verify. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens, with lunar perigee tightening the window.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—preserving the ferry’s existence—is signaled early via the phasing stern rail. Pressure escalates causally: empty hourglass → timeline collision → vanishing vessel → need for merger. Mateo’s agency drives the turning point (“we need to merge the timelines”), narrowing options from repair to radical fusion. Cost is felt in the loss of the ferry’s liminal identity, crystallized when passengers disembark unaware—the crew alone bears the memory of transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding how memory reshapes connection—is signaled early and deepens through Marina’s weaving, which narrows her options to engagement or withdrawal. Agency is clear: she chooses to weave, accelerating as insight floods in. Cost is felt in every erupted memory (father’s tremor, sister’s altered expression) and crystallized in the final renunciation of fixed truth. Pressure escalates organically under the Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the core tension.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—learning to navigate by impossible starlight—is signaled early and tightens when Current-Through-Stones reveals “water-memories” and edge geometry. Carta’s agency drives escalation: she requests demonstration, journeys to the trench, and actively traces constellations. The deepening forecloses her old worldview with conceptual cost (abandoning flat-chart navigation). Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, culminating in Charged Poise: two species poised at the edge of mutual understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—saving Lily from coercive control—is signaled early via the note and photo. Pressure tightens when Mira maps emotional frequencies, revealing textbook isolation. The meaningful deepening occurs when Lily appears bruised, transforming theoretical pattern into urgent reality. Agency is clear: Mira’s choice to call shelters forecloses passive tracing, but the cost (emotional labor, confronting danger) is felt, not stated. Coincidence (Lily arriving just then) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the real work begins after the pulse stops.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—documenting Kove’s discovery before the flood—is signaled early and tightens when the tide retreats (phase transition), forcing Mara to stay despite rising danger. Agency lies in attention and endurance: she chooses witness over escape, paying the cost of psychological strain (“claustrophobia clawed”). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; coincidence (tide timing) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the beings appear because of her prepared sensors and Kove’s groundwork.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—fetching wisdom from failure—is signaled early and deepens when Mira shifts from seeking forgiveness to understanding. Escalation is driven by her agency: after standard recovery fails, she innovates using chaos theory and ink patterns, narrowing options to one fragile method. The cost is palpable: sleepless labor, emotional exposure, and the risk of confirming her guilt. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via sensory isolation, heartbeat rhythm, and iterative ink spills until the files reassemble—a decisive deepening that reweights her entire moral framework.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving the Velathi language through non-verbal translation—is signaled early and deepens when Sarielle realizes birds respond to her echo-sound synthesis, escalating agency from observation to orchestration. The meaningful tightening occurs when she presses the diamond to bone, transforming passive hope into active harnessing. Cost is unmistakable: her copper veins dim, fingers wear smooth. Protagonist-driven escalation under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding the harmony vs. exposing it—tightens decisively when Voss’s laugh reframes her mission from vengeance to belonging. Agency drives escalation: Maya chooses to lift the receiver, pocket the arrowhead, and ask about second returns. Cost is unmistakable: her “fortress of skepticism” collapses, sacrificing career and identity. The harmony’s gravitational playfulness isn’t just lore—it manifests in the arrowhead’s behavior, raising stakes through tangible anomaly.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reawakening magic in a mechanized world—is clear from the first paragraph. Pressure escalates as Mira’s music spreads, affecting citizens, silencing factories, and stirring statues. The tightening occurs when she chooses to play the dangerous melody despite knowing the risk, culminating in her violin’s destruction. Cost is felt (broken instrument, crumbling statues weeping gold) but could be sharper in personal consequence beyond symbolic loss.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—defying borders to sustain human bonds—tightens when drones force reliance on “absence,” narrowing tactics to choreographed voids. Maren’s agency drives escalation: discovering drone weakness, deploying null-field, trusting Samir. Cost is visible in seventeen reunions versus perpetual risk; the “thunderstorm” delivery embodies trapped power yearning for release, mirroring all residents’ constrained lives.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—transforming brokenness into song—tightens when the halo fragment completes the crown, narrowing options from repair to revelation. Protagonist agency drives escalation: he chooses to sing, to solder, to push the crown into motion. Cost is legible in “hands stained with age and work” and three years of solitude. Coincidence (wrong turn) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the oasis enables but doesn’t dictate his purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—accessing the geometric locus of stories—is signaled early and deepens when Cordelia enacts her theory at 4:17 AM. The tightening occurs not through external opposition but internal risk: she gambles credibility and sanity on an unproven model. Cost is legible in the patrons’ startled vulnerability and Cordelia’s isolation; her success doesn’t resolve loneliness but reframes it as shared wonder. Agency is clear: her deliberate walk and whispered equations drive the escalation, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—capturing a runaway dream—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when Mara realizes Theo’s method requires *becoming* untethered, not just observing. The deepening occurs at the sea stack: “Dreams run when you stop believing” reframes the quest from retrieval to participation. Protagonist agency drives every escalation—she chooses to race islands, overlay photos, enter the cave—and each step forecloses return to ordinary life. Cost is unmistakable: she trades the library (and solid existence) for luminous impermanence, crystallized in her shimmering body.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—freeing the truth trapped by collective fear—is signaled early and tightens when the nexus shifts, forcing Mara to choose between resistance and surrender. Her agency drives escalation: she decodes the ribbon, walks the coordinates, and enters the space. Cost is felt in the dissolution of spatial certainty and the burden of inherited responsibility. The locksmith’s warning (“Fear keeps secrets sealed…”) sharpens the moral calculus, framing bravery not as absence of fear but as action despite ontological disorientation.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—recovering vanishing childhood memories—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Vera chooses to consume rather than document the mushroom. This act, driven by her agency, reweights all prior effort: preservation fails, but ingestion succeeds. The cost is felt in the irreversible shift from archivist to participant. Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens—each recalled sensation deepens the thematic weight until the final trade-off becomes inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reversing exile—is signaled early and deepens when Finn whispers, “My parents said I needed ‘fixing.’” The tightening occurs when the archivist upends the tea cup: a ritual that narrows options to interpretation or rejection. Protagonist agency drives escalation—she chooses vulnerability (“They exiled their fear onto you”), forcing Finn’s shift from skepticism to annotation. Cost is felt: her admission of continued fear forecloses the safety of invisibility.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder’s color—is signaled early and tightens when the essence resists, forcing Mara to sing and coax rather than command. Escalation is driven by her agency under Accumulative pressure: each sensory detail intensifies the fragility of the task. Cost is felt in bodily toll and the irrevocable blood offering. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; success hinges on ancestral method and personal creativity.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—freeing trapped silence—is signaled early and deepens as each knot yields a name. Escalation is driven by Maren’s agency: her deliberate pace, her acknowledgment of each name, intensifies the release. Cost is felt in the fisherman’s solidifying regret and the sanctuary’s new burden. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure builds via density (layered names) and cadence shift (from fragmented to stable), culminating in dissolution with emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—interpreting silence versus fearing it—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the shifted stone reveals the vault’s active role. Maren’s agency drives escalation: her comparison method yields knowledge that forecloses passive preservation. Cost is unmistakable: she trades archival control for embodied risk, stepping into the henge’s gap. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with one meaningful deepening (the fresco’s update) that reweights all prior assumptions.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding “the physics of letting go”—tightens when Elena realizes finding ≠ understanding. Her agency drives escalation: photographing, writing, then choosing not to take the globe. Cost is unmistakable: she abandons professional validation for emotional truth. The deepening occurs via her notebook confession, which narrows options toward renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to the voiceless—is signaled early and deepens when the ghost in code emerges, raising the stakes from human longing to nonhuman sentience. Moth’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to paint the ghost’s message despite its strangeness, narrowing her path to continued solitude. Cost is felt in her transient existence and the burden of perpetual translation. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the ghost’s gratitude is earned by her precise, risky act.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—emotional survival through connection vs. numb routine—is signaled early (“faces blank with routine sorrow”). The single deepening (goggles revealing diary text) narrows options: Maren must choose between institutional safety or vulnerable engagement. Cost is felt (rejecting promotion = social risk, emotional exposure) but not fully dramatized; we’re told she’ll “descend,” yet the fortress master’s pressure remains off-stage. Agency is clear, but the opposition lacks teeth—escalation relies on internal realization, not external complication.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—validating atmospheric memory—is signaled early and deepens when Elena connects cirrostratus to her grandfather’s death. Agency manifests through attention: choosing to categorize clouds despite professional risk. The tightening occurs when virga transforms from “unbearably sad” to proof of lingering impression, foreclosing her prior grief. Cost is felt in her isolation and potential career sacrifice, legible in the retrieval drone’s pending arrival that threatens to end her epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—capturing a person without seeing them—is signaled early and deepens when the coin proves insufficient. The meaningful tightening occurs when she realizes “precision wasn’t enough,” foreclosing technical perfection as sufficient. Agency drives escalation: her frustration leads to gazing skyward, which inspires the final act. Cost is unmistakable: she preserves truth but not the building or her illusion of adequacy.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—charting forbidden knowledge—is signaled early and escalates through Celeste’s agency: noticing luminance, decoding hopscotch, cross-referencing logs. The tightening occurs when she realizes Mara’s fate and chooses subterfuge over reportage. Cost is unmistakable: survival demands performance of obedience while pursuing truth, crystallized in her vow to ask “innocent questions.” Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens, deepening via pattern recognition rather than external confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—stabilizing fractured reality—is signaled early via multiplying eclipses and crystallized texts. Escalation is driven by Miren’s agency: each gear repair deepens stakes (third gear missing = irreversible damage). The tightening forecloses “perfect repair,” forcing translation over precision—a trade-off with visible cost (imperfect rhythm). Coincidence never resolves; rust, warping, and absence are obstacles she overcomes through skill and inheritance.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—communal survival versus fragmentation—is signaled early and escalates causally through Mara’s orchestrated exchanges. The tightening occurs when colonists move from suspicion (“Could be a trap”) to tangible cooperation (metal scraps traded, meetings arranged). Cost is visible: poisoned soil, eroded trust, wasted time. Mara’s agency drives every escalation; coincidence never resolves conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—humanity’s survival via probabilistic intervention—is signaled early and tightens when the Clock demands “three minutes closer.” The keeper’s agency manifests through precise, high-cost choices (e.g., weaving influence into politicians’ hesitations). Escalation is driven by her actions under Accumulative pressure, not coincidence. Cost is felt in “trembling hands” and “bruised awe,” though the abstract scale slightly distances visceral immediacy—preventing full 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—guide travelers before frost/birds claim them—is signaled early and tightens when Maren must interpret the nut under duress. Escalation is driven by her agency: assembling coordinates from landscape cues while time runs out. Cost is visible (frost forming, birds descending) and conceptual (inheriting a curse that demands sacrifice). Though tension peaks cleanly, the tightening lacks a single decisive trade-off beyond time pressure, holding it just below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—translating grief into reconnection—is signaled early and deepens when Maya recognizes Leah’s path wasn’t recklessness but artistic pursuit. The meaningful tightening occurs when she shifts from scattering ashes in one channel to five, foreclosing her isolation. Cost is legible: she must re-enter relationships she abandoned, a vulnerability shown, not told.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—access to a pre-fallen self—is signaled early and deepens when Vera reframes “beginning” as absence rather than location. The tightening occurs when she incises darkness, transforming abstract longing into ritual action. Cost is unmistakable: the man must drink collected darkness, surrendering his search for origin to embrace potential. Escalation is driven by Vera’s agency under an Accumulative lens—each gesture intensifies thematic pressure without false resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—containing leaking remorse before it subsumes all joy—is signaled early and escalates via Maron’s analysis of tidal pools and descent into the pavilion. His agency drives every turn: he chooses to touch, to knead, to smooth. The cost is palpable in his brittleness, near-submersion, and the exhausting labor of boundary-holding. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens—density increases until the ice melts not by magic but by his sustained attention. Coincidence never resolves; only his trained skill and courage do.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—reconnecting isolated communities—is signaled early via silent silos. Escalation occurs when Mara acts alone (“waiting for consensus would have meant calcifying”), attaching the weight to force dialogue. This deepening narrows options: she forfeits institutional trust for communal harmony. Cost is visible (historical society confrontation) and the grain’s “vigorous” response validates her agency under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—giving voice to murdered aspirations—is signaled early and deepens as Elena becomes a conduit for others’ memories. Escalation occurs through her agency: modifying the mirror, positioning it, adjusting it again. Each step narrows her path toward becoming a bridge rather than a builder. The cost is felt in the “quaking reverie”—a body destabilized by accumulated consciousness—but remains conceptual rather than visceral, slightly muting the price.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—accessing forgotten knowledge through threshold effects—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when Lyra reenters the grotto during inversion, narrowing her window to harvest combinations. Agency is clear: her prism mind actively refracts sequences others can’t see. Cost is legible in her lifelong isolation as keeper of secrets. Escalation follows Accumulative logic: density of luminous numbers increases pressure until the decisive harvest.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (“create music in a silent world”) intensifies through protagonist agency: Maren’s method—analyzing stress cracks—drives every escalation, from salvaging the insulator to tuning the ensemble. The deepening occurs when collective resonance emerges, narrowing options to a single path: play until the world responds. Cost is unmistakable—physical toll and the risk of failure in a mythic endeavor—and crystallizes in dawn light with birds as witnesses. Coincidence never resolves; success stems from empathy-as-method.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—validating the covenant through unspoken truths—is signaled early and deepens when Kavir realizes consent requires acknowledging suppressed pain. His agency drives escalation: emptying his strategic mind to feel silences narrows options (he can’t testify; she must). Cost is unmistakable—his exile, her inheritance—and crystallizes in her ascent toward duty. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=9.2)
    The dominant stake—recovering connection without violating silence—is signaled early and deepens through Marlow’s escalating attempts, culminating in her tuning frequencies as an act of empathetic agency. The meaningful tightening occurs when she shifts from demanding access to requesting forgiveness, narrowing her goal to one requiring patience, not force. Cost is unmistakable: seventeen years of estrangement, unanswered questions, and now the discipline of waiting even after the lock opens. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—cultivating serenity within perpetual motion—is signaled early and deepens through Mira’s bodily sacrifice (enduring stench that worsens her sensitivity). Agency is clear: she chooses daily exposure, burns incense, ties herbs, yet refuses to abandon the bloom. Escalation is protagonist-driven: each journal entry documents rising cost (“racing thoughts slowed”) until climax where she opens windows, inviting social risk. Coincidence never resolves; the flower’s properties are established upfront, not invented at bloom.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—finding the source of resilience—is signaled early and deepens when the arrow tip hums and water defies physics. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she kills the engine, follows the stream, and descends to the convergence. The Inversion isn’t coincidence but a necessary condition that intensifies water flows and reveals the echoes. Cost is conceptual yet legible: understanding resilience requires surrendering linear time, and the recovered sphere implies future responsibility. One meaningful deepening—the revelation of temporal layering—narrows her worldview permanently.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preventing future silent catastrophes—is signaled early and tightens when Chen reveals the 48-hour convergence of global shipping routes. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she adapts methods, reinterprets data, and transmits findings worldwide, narrowing options from explanation to intervention. Cost is unmistakable: the weight of her father’s unresolved death becomes fuel for systemic vigilance. Coincidence complicates (algorithms arranging containers) but never resolves—resolution stems from her pattern-reading under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving beauty as survival necessity—is signaled early and deepens when Mira realizes awe “oxygenates blood.” Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: she chooses descent, interprets the cavern’s response, strikes the ice. Cost is conceptual (threat of melted bells) and emotional (isolation of belief), crystallized in the Council’s initial ash-tasting dismissal. The tightening moment—when creation begins above and hush reveals itself—narrows options to one decisive act: ringing not to guide, but to testify.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding the flute’s purpose—is signaled early and deepens when Maren realizes it’s not for *this* world. The tightening occurs at the flute’s first note: air folds, options narrow to return or step through. Cost is visible in the ash of spent driftwood and the forfeiture of her old life. Escalation is driven entirely by Maren’s agency—no coincidence—and the moral calculus (duty vs. discovery) sharpens the final choice without false balance.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—mapping emotion’s mathematics to save the stars—is signaled early and tightens when the halo fragment delivers new emotional residue. The operator’s agency drives escalation: she chooses which identity to borrow, how to arrange ambiguous type, and presses the fragment twice to extract meaning. Cost is unmistakable: another star winks out mid-work, and her original self is gone forever. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—density of feeling increases until equations crystallize.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—delivering the pendant intact—is deepened when the object itself compels deviation, forcing Kael to choose between protocol and resonance. Each encounter tightens pressure: vibration → kneeling → accepting seed → receiving flute → summit revelation. Cost is felt in lost time, broken rules, and identity shift. Agency drives escalation; coincidence introduces characters but Kael’s choices shape outcomes.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—proving objects absorb emotion—is signaled early and deepens when Hartley’s personal grief becomes empirical evidence. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: Elena brings the prism; Hartley chooses to witness rather than deny. The cost is felt in Hartley’s inability to sell the car and his admission of guilt over his wife’s death. This isn’t coincidence—it’s emotional pressure forcing a stance that reconfigures scientific and personal truth.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—retrieving Kenji at personal cost—is signaled by the grandmother’s dying words and deepened by the amber bead’s lore. Pressure tightens when Mariko learns completion means taking his place; this forecloses return, raising emotional and existential stakes. Agency drives escalation: her faster weaving, use of hair/spider silk, and final step are all active choices. Cost is felt (“never quite returned whole”) but could be more viscerally dramatized in the crossing moment.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—saving the planet through reconnection, not escape—is signaled early and deepened when Mira chooses labor over council debate. The tightening occurs in the mine: she must trade the silk’s memory to complete her plan, sacrificing her only heirloom for uncertain gain. Cost is felt (her exhaustion, isolation) and shapes the final image. Luck (magician’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the awakening succeeds because of her forged conduits, not his magic alone.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reuniting with Mira vs. preserving multiversal integrity—is signaled early and tightens decisively at the shard’s hum. Kael’s agency drives the escalation: she *chooses* to reach across layers, forcing the confrontation. The trade-off is morally sharp (one sister vs. infinite variations) and carries conceptual weight. Cost is legible in her clenched hand and deferred decision—no coincidence, only consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving anonymous connection amid isolation—is signaled early and deepens when the light dies. Vera’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to write, transforming passive witness into active guardianship. Cost is unmistakable: she sacrifices her reticence, exposing her “cargo” of loneliness. The stakes tighten because/therefore: Marcus’s collapse → her promise → her confession. No coincidence resolves tension; the helicopter arrives only after her decisive act.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—maintaining the boundary between past and future via the green beam—is signaled early and escalates when Kael realizes his laughter summons storms that test his control. The tightening occurs at the climax: aligning the wick not only warns ships but “projects… instructions into the fabric of morning itself,” raising stakes from navigation to temporal integrity. Cost is legible: Kael’s accidental prophecy isolates him, yet he persists, knowing failure means “temporal uncertainty.” His agency drives escalation—every adjustment steers meaning, not just light—and the storm’s approach forces his final, resonant act.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—learning to bear Yuki’s listening gift—is signaled by line 3 and deepens when Chen reveals the heart “casts a different shadow.” The tightening occurs in Mira’s request (“Can you teach me?”), which narrows her path from passive recipient to active apprentice. Cost is felt: she must risk being consumed by others’ grief. Escalation is driven by Mira’s agency under an Accumulative lens; pressure coheres through light/shadow motifs without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—processing accumulated human sorrow—is signaled early and deepens as each extracted dream reveals layered grief. Pressure escalates texturally: more dreams, heavier measurements, increasing physical exhaustion. The meaningful tightening occurs when Mara realizes trees are becoming “something between wood and consciousness,” raising the cost of inaction. Agency is clear: she chooses extraction over avoidance, and each act forecloses leaving sorrow trapped. Cost is felt in her soaked body, pre-dawn fatigue, and the irreversible release of dreams—but luck never resolves conflict; healing requires moonlight, labor, and intention.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—rekindling communal hope in endless night—is signaled early and deepens via the weaving ritual. Escalation is driven by Elora’s agency: singing, crushing fruit, swaddling light. Cost is unmistakable: physical exhaustion, emotional vulnerability (“weight of forgetting threatened to crack her open”), and the risk that the song might fail. The shift from individual labor to collective awakening tightens pressure meaningfully under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reconciling empathy with presence—is signaled by line three (“avoiding gatherings… compassionate distance”) and tightens when Iris confronts her sister’s wedding ghosting. The library encounter deepens stakes by reframing withdrawal not as kindness but self-deception. Protagonist agency drives escalation: she chooses to enter, confess, and accept the book. Cost is felt in the sister’s ongoing silence and the “overwhelming static” she still risks by staying; the final image implies continued struggle, not resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—how to respond to collective forgetting—is signaled early and deepens when Mira confronts the archivist’s alternative. The meaningful tightening occurs when the old woman reframes loss as fertile ground, forcing Mira to choose between chronicling absence or cultivating presence. Agency is clear: Mira’s decision to plant seeds forecloses pure archivism with visible cost (she’ll no longer just record vanishings). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, intensifying through layered sensory anomalies until the final trade-off crystallizes without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving luminous vows against oblivion—is signaled early and tightens when the anomalous slide defies archival logic. Maren’s agency drives escalation: her measurement choice reveals the vow’s resilience, forcing reconfiguration of her life’s work. Cost is felt in physical stiffness, emotional risk (tears), and conceptual upheaval (“proof that meaning could survive”). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; one decisive deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—protecting her father’s name and exposing Crenshaw’s betrayal—is signaled early and deepens when Nelle reveals the recording. Escalation is driven by her agency: she doesn’t just present evidence but engineered its distribution (“three copies... if I didn’t return”). The tightening occurs at playback, narrowing options to mutual annihilation or truce. Cost is felt in moral burden (leveraging dead men’s suffering) and relational severance, all under coherent situational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding why earth elects weather-carriers—is signaled early and deepens when Mira proves the compass tracks them. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her taste-tests and ring-twisting narrow options until the needle settles on Kael. Cost is unmistakable: Kael relinquishes his “curse” identity, trading isolation for purpose. The forests’ election timeframe adds subtle pressure but isn’t clock-tight; however, the single meaningful deepening (compass function revealed) suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether memory imprisons or liberates—is signaled early and deepens when Elena discovers her mother’s hidden self-portrait. The tightening occurs when she chooses to draw on the cave wall, foreclosing her old clinical approach with visible cost (exhaustion, bleeding hands). Escalation is driven entirely by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens: each drawn face intensifies emotional release. Coincidence (the summons) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the resolution arises from Elena’s decision to transform pain into wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—finding where candor goes—is signaled early and tightens via Mira’s physical revulsion to lies. Her descent escalates pressure coherently: each level down strengthens her body as she moves away from systemic dishonesty. The archive confrontation forces a crystallized stance: preserve or deliver? She chooses the latter, accepting ongoing labor with visible cost (carrying unsent truths into a lying world). Agency drives every turn; coincidence never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—recovering pre-Silence truth through sound—is signaled by line 3 and tightens when the imperfect tone reveals “unbearably human” complexity. Mira’s agency drives escalation: she chooses imperfection over calibration, altering tactics mid-day. Cost is visible in the dissolving ice (irreplaceable archive) and abandoned pursuit of “perfect tones.” Coincidence (pilgrims arriving) complicates but doesn’t resolve; their awe validates her shift.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—escaping static prison of guilt—is signaled by line 3 and tightens decisively when miniaturization fails, forcing confrontation with the uncontainable photo-memory. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: collecting → miniaturizing → burying. Cost is unmistakable in the irreversible burial and acceptance of “fragmented wholeness.” Magnetic shifts externalize internal disorientation, making chaos both environmental and existential.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving home/community against predatory development—is clear by paragraph 2. Pressure escalates coherently: sealed mailboxes → pattern recognition → discovery of legal evidence. Marissa’s agency drives the turn: she convenes, interprets, leads to the mailroom. Cost is felt in vulnerability (“locked mailboxes,” hospice-bound Mrs. Chen) and implied future legal battle. Coincidence (locket donation) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from communal action rooted in prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—liberating encrypted messages to free minds—is signaled early and tightens via Elara’s innovations (dance syntax, vulnerability-as-armor). Escalation is driven by her agency: decoding patrol patterns, choreographing escapes. Cost is unmistakable: she risks capture to descend nightly, and tomorrow’s prison break hinges on her poem-schematic. The regime’s ignorance of the dice’s purpose creates ironic pressure, but resolution stems solely from Elara’s earned skill, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—retrieving deleted memories—is signaled early and tightens when Maris chooses to cut into the heart, foreclosing return to the surface world. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she interprets flower patterns, enters the pool, acts on her suspicion. Cost is unmistakable: her physical disappearance and the diviners’ inability to trace her. Gravity fluctuations serve as both symptom and pressure, narrowing movement options throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving smoothed hush against prophetic chaos—is signaled early and escalates through protagonist agency: she decodes, crafts, and ritually counters the oracle’s words. The tightening occurs when she chooses not to prevent but to *reconfigure* the prophecy, transforming flight into dream-of-flight. Cost is legible: eternal solitude, unthanked labor, and the burden of cosmic containment. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens—density of silence increases until it blankets the valley—and coincidence never resolves tension.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—whether Elena will acknowledge her inherited language—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Mrs. Kovac reveals, “You already know Latin.” The escalation hinges on protagonist agency: Elena’s admission about her grandmother shifts the dynamic from evasion to collaboration. Cost is felt in her loss of plausible deniability and assumption of intergenerational duty. The “interrogation” by buildings reframes architecture as active antagonist/ally, raising stakes beyond personal curiosity to moral obligation—all coherent under the Hybrid lens.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving love without contagion—is signaled early and deepens when the envelope forces Mira to choose between legitimacy and control. Her agency drives escalation: studying resonance structures, fragmenting memories, then rejecting standardization. Cost is unmistakable in the closing lines: “never be anything but hers” implies eternal isolation, paid for independence. The garden’s very design (quarantined fragments) proves stakes are viscerally felt, not abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—freeing the village from the Governor’s cruelty—is signaled early and deepens when the Magistrate reveals his own complicity and risk. Mei’s agency drives escalation: her final forgery forces the Magistrate’s hand, crystallizing his stance. Cost is unmistakable: he sacrifices position and possibly life; she accepts ongoing treason as vocation. Pressure tightens through one decisive turn that forecloses safety for both.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—why some echo and others vanish—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the shell reveals “The ones who echo are the ones who were heard.” Mara’s agency drives escalation: she descends, presses deeper, traces glyphs, and finally sings. Cost is felt in her hoarse voice and the burden of future teaching. The deepening shifts knowledge (solitude = oblivion) and narrows options: she must now ensure others are heard.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—delivering truth to Evelyn—is signaled early and deepens when Maya names Katherine and reveals Evelyn’s existence, forcing the ghost’s anguish into actionable urgency. The meaningful tightening occurs when Maya shifts from listener to messenger, foreclosing passive witness in favor of costly intervention. Agency is clear: Maya’s method (dream-tracking) led her here, and her choice to drive to Halifax is earned, not coincidental. The cost—bearing another’s grief across decades—is felt in the “familiar ache” and the weight of the ruined globe, charging the final beat without mechanical resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—transmitting hidden patterns—is signaled early and deepened when the apprentice’s tangle forces Kenji to translate tacit knowledge into action. His agency drives escalation: choosing to teach via whisk analogy and moon-path untangling, not lecture. Cost is legible—the girl’s shame, his lament for lost nuance—and crystallizes in her new intentionality. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure builds through layered images until the final reconfiguration feels inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—truth versus myth—is signaled early and tightens when Vera uncovers Project Stillpoint, forcing a trade-off: expose the science or preserve the miracle. Escalation is driven by her agency (reassembling, triangulating, digging), not coincidence. Cost is unmistakable: she sacrifices her debunker identity’s purity to protect hope. The deepening—from curse to accident to guarded truth—narrows options until only one ethical path remains.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—allegiance to ancient shadows versus comfortable daylight—is signaled early and tightens when the prophet directly addresses Elara, forcing a binary choice. Her agency drives escalation: she rigs a mic, speaks back, and declares her stance. The cost—permanent exile from “soft certainties”—is felt in her reflection on years of isolation and crystallized in her final vow. Pressure accumulates texturally via signal clarity and storm intensification, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—translating generational silence into song—is signaled early and deepens when Cosima trades poems for repair lessons, narrowing her path to redemption through craft. The tightening occurs at noon: coaxing the mechanism demands physical skill born of poetic discipline. Cost is unmistakable: social invisibility, bread bought by pennies, grief held in jars. Agency drives escalation; coincidence (finding the box) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the lullaby’s restoration is wholly earned by her hands and breath.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preventing sonic absolution from propagating—is signaled early and tightens when the intruder boat appears. Meris’s agency drives escalation: she doesn’t wait but races to rekey the frequency, using her expertise under pressure. The cost is legible: she sacrifices autonomy by fusing the key to her pulse, making herself the lock. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies through rising resonance (“key now singing against her palm”) and spatial threat (boat approaching), culminating in a stance crystallization that forecloses misuse with irreversible personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—redefining vigilance—is signaled early and tightens through Ren’s nightly tracking, culminating in the moon-viaduct alignment that proves atmospheric interference can be measured. Agency is exercised through attention and endurance, not confrontation; the cost (physical toll, social isolation) is felt but not melodramatic. Escalation occurs via deepening insight, not external pressure, fitting the Accumulative lens. One meaningful tightening suffices, though a second micro-turn (dawn obscuring the viaduct) would elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—truth versus institutional corruption—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Elena chooses to leak evidence. The promotion Reeves arranged becomes the pivot that escalates danger, and Malcolm’s death proves the cost of defiance. Elena’s agency drives the deepening: her empirical method leads her to the chamber, forcing a choice that forecloses her prior path of compliance. The cost—professional retaliation—is felt in Reeves’s stretched silence, making stakes visceral without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether damaged things deserve second chances—is signaled early and deepens when Vittorio’s letter reframes corrosion as patina. Eliana’s agency drives escalation: her past judgment foreclosed Samuel’s hope; her present choice reopens possibility, albeit posthumously. Cost is unmistakable: “months” of labor, the weight of complicity, and the prison donation that transforms the heart into a witness to systemic failure. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each revelation intensifies the moral burden without coincidence resolving tension.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—ringing an unheard bell—is signaled early and deepens via algorithm recalibrations that narrow options (workshop becomes launchpad). Agency is clear: Mal’s tweaks generate stronger signals, culminating in active departure. Cost is felt in the mentor’s death and workshop’s vulnerability, though escalation leans more on accumulation than causal tightening. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; signal emerges from her persistent action.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—uncovering where the disappeared go—is signaled early and tightens when Elena discovers the Perihelion link. Her agency drives escalation: cross-referencing patches, decrypting Folder 1408, choosing to join rather than report. The cost is unmistakable: she forfeits her identity (“archived herself”) and human connection (lying to Rawlins). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each data fragment deepens mystery until the song’s revelation crystallizes her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—mediating hatred without losing herself—is signaled early and deepens when standard methods fail. Maren’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to enter the forbidden mirror room, uses the shard, interprets glimpses. The tightening occurs when she realizes the conflict stems not from fishing rights but shared grief over Astrid—a revelation that forecloses easy solutions and demands emotional translation. Cost is felt in her trembling hands and transformed shadows.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding the hum of endings—is signaled early and deepens through Vera’s aid work. Pressure escalates via agency: she chooses to listen rather than seek cure, narrowing her path to presence. Cost is felt in postponed healing and acceptance of dissolution. The tightening is subtle but decisive: from fear of slipping reality to finding “windborne and clean” solace in transience.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding the value of their failed relationship—is signaled early and tightens through Marcus’s vineyard analogy, which narrows options from reunion to mutual recognition. The meaningful deepening occurs when Marcus reframes failure as “perfect,” forcing Elena to confront her own buried intent (“That’s what the rest of the letter said”). Protagonist agency drives escalation: Marcus’s decision to summon her and his parallel-drawing catalyze the turn. Cost is unmistakable—Elena’s tears, Marcus’s years of solitude—and the final image forecloses romantic reconciliation while honoring its legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving spaces of un-prescribed gathering—is signaled early and deepens as clearings “fade.” Escalation occurs through Senna’s agency: she doesn’t create but *recognizes* pockets of potential in conversational pauses, then consecrates them. Cost is visible: the clearings require ongoing maintenance and communal trust, foreclosing any permanent solution. The tightening is subtle but decisive—without her intervention, the architecture of pause dissolves. Coincidence plays no role; pressure coheres entirely through character-driven attention.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—imagining beyond collective grief—is signaled early and deepens when Margot declares, “They need you to finish them.” The meaningful tightening occurs when participants transition from passive observers to active co-creators, foreclosing resignation. Cost is felt in Maria’s tremor and Josef’s lost pension, though the escalation leans on communal participation rather than individual agency under pressure. Under the Accumulative lens, this suffices, but protagonist-driven escalation is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving meaning amid linguistic collapse—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes children aren’t losing language but compressing it. The meaningful tightening occurs when she activates the resonator and sees the pattern: this insight forces her toward testimony despite terror. Agency is clear; escalation is driven by her experimentation, not coincidence. Cost is felt in her isolation and the irreversible shift from observer to witness.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—capturing the sound of growing older before forgetting it—is signaled early and tightens through the chalk-writing sequence, which narrows options as memories slip and space shrinks. Protagonist agency drives escalation: arranging driftwood compass, documenting losses, writing until chalk crumbles. Cost is unmistakable: he accepts he’ll forget his own monument, yet builds it anyway. The tidal longing isn’t resolved but crystallized, with opportunity cost made visible in every backward-written word.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—capturing the ephemeral before it flees—tightens decisively when Kenji shifts from restoring old parameters to anticipating change. This deepening forecloses the path of memorializing stasis, forcing a trade-off: precision now serves flux, not fixity. Cost is legible in the “bittersweet recognition that everything beautiful eventually reaches for its own escape velocity.” Agency drives escalation: Kenji’s choice to restructure the array transforms pressure into data, aligning with the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reconciliation before death—is signaled early and deepens when Rebecca’s delayed arrival forces Mr. Chen to choose between perfection and authenticity. Maya’s intervention (“Write her what you just played me”) escalates pressure by narrowing options to one vulnerable act. Cost is unmistakable: he risks rejection to voice love imperfectly. Protagonist agency drives every turn; coincidence (Rebecca’s flight) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the letter does.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding where shadows go—is signaled early and tightens when Mira realizes the observatory itself is part of the sealed awakening. Escalation is driven by her agency: adjusting the orrery, aligning arms per runes, completing circuits. The cost is unmistakable: she must permanently alter the mechanism (and her own role) to restore balance. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; insight emerges from accumulated observation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming her daughter through relinquishing certainty—is signaled early (“stopped believing… never stopped forgiving”) and tightens decisively when Iris reveals others remain trapped. The escalation is driven by Marianne’s agency: her choice to enter the maze, then to believe the tooth, then to say “Teach me,” each narrowing options (burying illusion → embracing fracture-work). Cost is unmistakable: she must abandon the grave she tended for ten years, and the final image implies lifelong labor in “between-places.” Pressure coheres under Hybrid lens—causal choices accumulate textural weight (“bone setting for the between-places”).

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—sharing celestial beauty without fire—is signaled early and deepens when children arrive, raising emotional risk. The meaningful tightening occurs when Maren shifts from private ritual to public teaching, foreclosing retreat into grief. Cost is felt in every smoothed edge (“safe for small hands”) and in the unspoken burden of memory. Agency drives escalation: she chooses to display, to instruct, to continue—each act narrowing the path back to isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reconciling guilt through action rather than passive observation—is signaled early and deepens when Dr. Chen arrives with Jenna’s notebook. Maya’s agency drives escalation: her confession, sanctuary-seeking, and willingness to receive truth narrow her path from isolation to shared witness. Cost is felt in vulnerability (“protected vulnerability cracked open”) and irreversible exposure to judgment, yet she chooses connection anyway.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—how to honor loss through narrative—is signaled early and deepens via each cameo encounter. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: she actively collects hopes, leading to the decisive renunciation of easy binaries. Cost is unmistakable: choosing memory over forgetting is “sharp-edged and terrible.” Pressure tightens once, coherently, under an Accumulative lens, culminating in a Charged Poise where options are reconfigured with emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—combating cultural forgetting through embodied ritual—is signaled early and deepens via Cassian’s mechanical replication of ancestral song. Escalation is driven by his agency: threading the vine, tuning chambers, turning cranks. The cost is felt in his isolation (“the village thought him mad”) and crystallizes in the silent machine post-dawn: success demands dissemination, not hoarding. Coincidence (the 19-year alignment) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the remedy works only because Cassian built the conduit.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—translating the land’s heartbeat into enduring maps—is signaled early and deepens when auroral light activates the paper, forcing Vera to remain motionless for hours under physical duress. This endurance forecloses alternatives (e.g., fleeing cold, using starlight for warmth) with felt cost: exposed fingertips, frozen stillness. Agency lies in attention itself, and the single tightening—aurora triggering recording—narrows options to pure reception. Coincidence (natural light) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Vera’s preparedness earns the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserving intangible resilience against material blight—is signaled early and tightens when Marcus chooses reconstruction over rationing or fire-building. The meaningful deepening occurs at the climax: activating the timer transforms private obsession into shared epiphany, foreclosing his isolation with visible cost (years of solitude, corroded tools repurposed). Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, though the “wounded season” could exert sharper tactical constraints. Agency is clear: Marcus’s reverse-engineering drives every escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—understanding the patterns to escape the trap—tightens when she realizes she *is* the trap, transforming agency from flight to endurance. Each burden’s arrival escalates pressure, but the decisive deepening occurs when seventeen crystals lock into place and her hands still: a Charged Poise where options reconfigure. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits freedom for function, bearing witness instead of weaving escape. Protagonist agency drives every turn; no coincidence resolves the core conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether to freeze or release Roland’s unfinished legacy—is signaled early and deepens when Margot reads his journal entry about lions and “crystallized time.” Her agency drives escalation: choosing tool, rejecting lion/head/memorial for bowl, leaving bark intact. Cost is unmistakable: she accepts incompleteness (“finished and unfinished both”) as the price of presence. Pressure tightens coherently under Accumulative lens—each raindrop, ring, whisper narrowing options toward charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reconciling with eroded ambition—is signaled immediately and tightens through each overheard fragment, culminating in the ghost’s approach. The meaningful deepening occurs when Mira realizes negotiation is futile; acceptance is the only path forward. Cost is unmistakable: she abandons her identity as collector (camera wheel lost) and surrenders the hope of return. Escalation is driven entirely by her agency—listening, collecting, choosing to reach out—not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—whether the terminal is destroyed or repurposed—is signaled early and deepens when Lena discovers the evolved drainage system, narrowing options from documentation to intervention. Escalation is driven by her agency: mapping flows, drafting hydroponic turbines. Cost is legible in the dawn email sent “anyway,” knowing rejection is likely. Coincidence (finding sextant) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the real turn is her choice to reinterpret decay as resource. One meaningful tightening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reconciling with abandoned invention—is signaled early and deepens when she confronts her fear aloud. The tightening occurs when the crystals respond, transforming passive regret into active creation. Agency drives escalation: her whispered confession triggers the resonant turn, and her sketching enacts change. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits security, status, and fifteen years of professional identity to pursue uncertain mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding Viktor’s “architecture of lies”—tightens when the sundial activates the canal’s glow, foreclosing Mira’s old paradigm. Agency is clear: her counterclockwise rotation initiates the turn. Cost is conceptual but felt: she must abandon presence for absence. Escalation is driven by her intuition, not coincidence, aligning with the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving vanishing knowledge—is signaled early and deepens as each knot reveals encoded wisdom. Escalation is driven by Mira’s agency: she coaxes knots open, photographs findings, and chooses restoration over extraction. Cost is felt in physical endurance (kneeling in snow, breath clouding) and existential weight (“infinitely patient with time’s own knots”). While pressure intensifies texturally rather than through overt conflict, the stakes remain viscerally tied to cultural loss and personal vocation.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—mapping the distance between self and life—is signaled early and tightens when Maren challenges the Duchess to “stop explaining.” This deepening forces a trade-off: perpetual performance of absence versus risking return. Agency lies in renunciation (of justification), with cost made visible in the Duchess’s eroded “lonesome splendor” and unused hands. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each sensory detail (roses, thread, ship) intensifies the weight of exile.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming beauty in a mechanized age—is signaled early and deepens when Vashira warns the phoenix will be “never truly wild.” The tightening occurs when Cael chooses flawed genesis over purity, accepting bitter sweetness as necessary. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (assembling the incubator), and cost is visible in the creature’s hybrid form. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, though the external threat (excavation) slightly dilutes focus.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—proving scars can sing—is signaled early and deepens through Maya’s choice to give away her grandmother’s coin, foreclosing private ownership of healing. Pressure escalates via Elena’s resistance (“Your father destroyed so much”) and Maya’s vulnerable response, culminating in shared immersion. Agency drives every turn: Maya initiates the ritual; Elena chooses to follow. Cost is visible in Maya’s enduring shame and the relinquished coin.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—liberating trapped memories—is signaled early and tightens when Mira must choose between skepticism and cosmic patience. Her agency drives escalation: each breadcrumb requires interpretation, culminating in the constellation sequence. Cost is felt in her relinquished certainty and the city’s reclaimed voice. Coincidence (geese pausing) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the box opens only through her precise, earned action.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—protecting what we love—is signaled early and deepened when the Keeper reframes sacrifice as part of a meaningful pattern. Pressure tightens once: from mechanical doom (gear) to emotional revelation (“you already do”). Agency resides in the Keeper’s choice to intervene and the daughter’s reach, though the mother’s arc leans passive. Cost is felt in the abandoned gear and the near-loss, though the resolution leans on external aid rather than protagonist-driven reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding collective grief—is signaled early and deepens when Marcus reveals the poems were “practice” for loss. The tightening occurs when she realizes her work isolates grief rather than connects it, foreclosing her old method. Protagonist agency drives escalation: she chooses to reread the ribbon, asks “Show me how,” and ultimately writes her own verse. Cost is unmistakable: Marcus fades, and she inherits the burden of mentorship, altering her artistic identity permanently.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—restoring shared balance through truth—is signaled early and deepens when Maren shifts from maintaining time to embedding testimony. The tightening occurs when she chooses to engrave the pendulum, foreclosing anonymity and risking communal judgment. Cost is unmistakable: physical pain, emotional exposure, and the surrender of her role as neutral timekeeper. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence intervenes—her hands alone reshape justice.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—uncovering obscured identities—is signaled early and deepens when Marta shifts from decoding symbols to grasping intention. The tightening occurs in her epiphany about “shape of intentions,” which narrows her method and raises emotional stakes. Agency drives escalation: her alignment of letter and tapestry yields coordinates. Cost is felt in the burden of inherited truth, though slightly abstracted rather than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—writing a future that prevails against “comfortable blindness”—is signaled early and deepens as predictive models flag her wishful thinking, forcing tactical adjustments. Agency is clear: Maren rewrites based on data, not luck. Cost is felt in physical strain and intellectual surrender, though the absence of external opposition slightly softens escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reviving narrative memory—is signaled by “story famine” in paragraph 2 and tightens decisively when Elena realizes lyrics are instructions, not fragments. Her agency drives escalation: she decodes, touches dust, and chooses to transcribe the method. Cost is unmistakable: she assumes risk of distribution, moving from private witness to public catalyst. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each luminous particle deepens the thematic and tactical commitment without coincidence resolving tension.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. comforting illusion—is signaled early and tightens when the mask reveals partial images. Elena’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to wear the mask, interpret the ash, and redefine her ritual. The cost is conceptual but visceral: loss of faith in preservation, permanence, and frames. Coincidence (chair stopping) complicates but doesn’t resolve; insight arises from her active engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving empirical truth against myth-making—is signaled early and deepens when Karin reveals the council’s narrative. Marcus’s agency crystallizes in his refusal to join factions and his counter-proposal: a decentralized network. The meaningful tightening occurs when he shifts from hoarding to distributing knowledge, foreclosing his solitary purity at the cost of potential betrayal. Pressure remains coherent under the Hybrid lens, though the escalation leans slightly more on dialogue than physical stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving harmony amid societal fragmentation—is signaled early and tightens through Mrs. Chen’s method: transforming discordant hums into music becomes the literal and metaphorical escalation. The cost is felt in what’s lost (community center, grandmother’s craft) and what’s risked (facing Mr. Patterson, the twins’ prejudice). Agency drives deepening: Mrs. Chen chooses specific participants, guides tonal adjustments, and reframes the rosette’s meaning. The climax—a fragile, collective chord—narrows options: they must now carry this practice beyond the library, with no guarantee of success.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming memory as shared truth—is signaled early and deepens when Mara realizes commercial food carries “fear” and “desperation.” The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses quiet dissemination over spectacle, accepting perpetual risk (“authorities eventually noticed”). Agency is exercised through attention and renunciation: she forecloses safety to cultivate beauty, paying the price in vigilance. Escalation is protagonist-driven—each shared fruit expands the rebellion—and cost is unmistakable in the girl’s nervous arrival and Mara’s constant pruning under threat.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—restoring wonder through purposeful inefficiency—is signaled early and deepens when Chen admits he “taught them to hoard.” Mira’s agency lies in truthful witnessing, which forecloses denial. The escalation is causal: optimization → hoarding → cascade failure. Cost is felt in the darkened city and cold metal bees.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—houses needing witness—is signaled early and deepens when the Kettering house responds to Mara’s offerings. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: each object placement tightens the thematic pressure until the house “exhales,” foreclosing Mara’s prior isolation with the cost of lifelong responsibility. Coincidence (dumped orris root) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from her method. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—historical truth vs. comforting myth—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Marina grasps the architect’s sabotage. Escalation is driven by her agency: discovering the ampoule triggers the statue’s revelations, which force her to reframe justice itself. Cost is unmistakable: she inherits the architect’s burden, knowing her testimony will shatter public innocence. The oxygen gauge’s red tick adds visceral pressure without resolving via coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming intellectual courage—is signaled early and tightens when Castellano reveals the dice’s chip as essential to true perpetual motion (“dynamic instability that somehow maintains itself”). This deepening forces Mara’s climactic renunciation of calculation for action, narrowing options from endless climbing to decisive lateral movement. Cost is unmistakable: three years of stagnation and the terror of potential cosmic consequence (“ruptured the fundamental forces”). Escalation stems from protagonist agency—her choice to roll the dice triggers the mentor’s appearance and subsequent insight.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—proving kindness persists across time—is signaled early and deepens via moon-sparked daydreams that narrow Mara’s focus from personal insomnia to collective memory. Agency drives escalation: each brushstroke is a tactical choice under pressure of erasure. Cost is felt in bodily depletion (“hollowing her out like a gourd”) and the risk of painting forbidden scripts. Coincidence (moonlight) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from sustained attention.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving culture amid displacement—is signaled early and tightens when the freeze traps them. Celeste’s agency drives escalation: she organizes artisans using museum logic as survival strategy. Cost is unmistakable: bread shaped for the dead consumes scarce flour; thawing risks failure with no backup. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each custom deployed forecloses passivity.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (overthrowing fate’s inevitability) is signaled early and escalates through Maren’s agency: her modifications to the yoyo deepen the conflict, narrowing options to a single threshold moment. The cost is unmistakable—her physical dissolution—and visible in the cracked stone and silent yoyo. Coincidence (the tide) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the reversal stems wholly from her labor. One meaningful tightening (reassembly with clock gears) forces the ultimate trade-off: transcendence for existence.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (understanding fear’s nature) tightens decisively when Margot unbosoms herself, narrowing options from flight to confrontation. Protagonist agency drives escalation—her speech forces fear’s manifestation. Cost is felt in the clasp’s burn and psychological toll, though the advisor’s deus ex machina risks undercutting causality slightly. Still, fear’s exposure stems from Margot’s action, not external aid.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—survival via interpreting hidden currents—is signaled early and tightens when fractal clouds demand immediate action. Maren’s agency drives escalation: her chord-building forces a trade-off between surface instincts and backwards faith, foreclosing passive waiting. Cost is felt in the hour-long countdown and communal vulnerability. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each struck tree intensifies acoustic density until tactics crystallize (“drop western anchors”).

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—prevent shell-shatter and city-collapse—is signaled early and tightens as the crack advances. Agency resides in Maren’s attention and action: measuring, interpreting, sounding the whistle. The meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the gate’s rust imprisoned them *against* the turtles’ need to move—a conceptual reversal that reweights all prior data. Cost is felt in the Council’s dismissal and the city’s willful blindness; escalation stems from protagonist insight, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. national myth—is signaled early and tightens when Hawthorne admits guardianship. Elena’s agency drives escalation: her argument about other democracies forces his reconsideration. Cost is legible: Hawthorne risks societal destabilization; Elena bears the weight of potential backlash. The trade-off (comfortable lies for complex truth) sharpens the moral calculus without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving meaning against erasure—is signaled early and deepens when Marcus shifts from official surveyor to secret archivist. The discovery of the letter box escalates stakes by introducing a counter-archive of hidden pain, forcing a moral choice: extract or honor context. His agency drives this turn; he photographs but reseals, accepting the cost of carrying unspoken stories. Under the Accumulative lens, this deepening reweights the entire mission: preservation isn’t recovery but respectful witnessing.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restoring honest origins—is signaled early and deepens when the stamp reveals a suppressed press. Escalation is driven by Mira’s agency: she cross-references, locates the journal, applies the stamp to authentication sheets. Cost is visible: working in blackout, on unstable floors, with only lamplight; the storm above underscores fragility. While pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens, the tightening lacks a foreclosed option—she gains knowledge but sacrifices nothing tangible beyond comfort, slightly muting stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reuniting Lin’s shadow with her dreams—is signaled early and deepens through each crane folded. Pressure tightens not via external opposition but internal compulsion: 853 cranes remain, then 852. The “descends while ascending” paradox embodies the central tension between loss and hope. Cost is unmistakable: Mei trades all she owns, then her peace, for a ritual whose success hinges on quantum uncertainty—a poignant, credible endurance under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—locating the moment potential becomes loss—is signaled early and deepens when Mira detects the anomalous standing wave, narrowing her focus from abstract theory to actionable coordinates. Agency is expressed through attention and instrumentation; her choice to pursue the signal forecloses passive mourning. Pressure escalates texturally: quantum fluctuations → probability clouds → unused potential → standing wave. Cost is felt in Vahedi’s quiet doubt and Mira’s isolation, though a more tangible sacrifice (e.g., overriding safety protocols) would push this into the 9+ range.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—decoding the frequency of belonging—is signaled early and deepens when the chip reveals seventeen trails. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she inserts the chip, launches drones, and commits to retrieval. Cost is felt conceptually (her isolation now has purpose but demands continued solitude) and physically (dispatching drones into night). Coincidence introduces the pilgrim but doesn’t resolve; Mara’s method earns the path forward.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—truth versus profitable lies—is signaled early and deepens when Elias appears, transforming abstract guilt into visceral accountability. Mara’s agency drives escalation: her past choice (rewriting Elias’s lineage) directly causes present consequences (parents’ deaths, his confrontation). The tightening is decisive: she must choose between continuing her “sieved hush” or dismantling it. Cost is unmistakable—lost years, dead parents, shattered identity—and crystallizes in Elias’s demand: “end it.”

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—returning prisoners without bloodshed—is signaled early and deepened by the commanders’ distrust (“What if they run?”). Katrin’s agency drives escalation: she leverages celestial predictability to force cooperation, turning abstract apology into actionable protocol. The cost is visible in her exhaustion and isolation; she pays it repeatedly. One meaningful tightening occurs at the moon’s apex, where options narrow to simultaneous release or perpetual stalemate. Coincidence never resolves; only human choice under pressure does.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—navigating grief without repeating catastrophic error—is signaled early and tightens when Amy reveals her sister’s death, forcing Marina to confront shared vulnerability. The meaningful deepening occurs when Marina admits she should’ve “trusted more than one system,” transforming navigation from technical act to moral stance. Cost is unmistakable: launching means risking new failure, yet staying ashore perpetuates stagnation. Agency drives escalation; coincidence (Amy’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can one escape a self through forgetting?—tightens when the baseball reveals even time travel can’t outrun moral failure. Marcus’s agency shifts from passive seeker to active chooser (“I choose to try”), foreclosing the path of absolution-through-amnesia. Cost is conceptual (carrying failed hope) and spatial (leaving the past in the depths). Escalation is driven by revelation, not action, fitting the Accumulative lens, though the Interpreter’s exposition slightly softens the turn’s immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reforging connection beyond death—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Mira chooses transformation, foreclosing her human identity. Escalation is protagonist-driven: crushing spices initiates irreversible change, narrowing options to a single path. Cost is unmistakable (“you won’t be my sister anymore”) and woven into every beat. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure deepens via scent-thickening and bodily unraveling rather than external opposition, which fits the situational intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming stolen time—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: her card reading forces confrontation with three ghosts of neglect, each narrowing options until only descent remains. The meaningful tightening occurs at the Shattered Cup vision, where lost time calcifies into weeping sap, making abstract regret tangible and irreversible. Cost is unmistakable: she abandons her identity as cartomancer, clutching only cloth and cards as relics of what must be left behind. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with no coincidental resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether to confront humanity’s locked-away grief—is signaled early and tightens when Akio challenges Mei’s work. Her activation of the resonance chamber is a decisive deepening that narrows options: success means facing the shadow, failure means letting it die unmet. Cost is unmistakable: emotional gravity literally grounds her when doubt arises, and the final act risks psychological annihilation. Agency drives escalation; coincidence plays no role.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding transformation’s texture—is signaled early and deepens when Mara releases the first bug and guides the lost man. The meaningful tightening occurs when she gives away her last possessions (the bugs), narrowing her options to pure potential. Agency is clear: her choices drive the escalation, not coincidence (the surveyor’s arrival complicates but doesn’t resolve). Cost is felt: total material relinquishment, yet the story avoids tidy resolution by leaving her walking toward an unknown next need.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—sparking silent revolution—is signaled early and tightens when Voss confirms they disabled backups, raising cost (complicity now irreversible). Maren’s agency drives escalation: her decision to complete the sundial in darkness transforms passive resistance into active coordination. The blackout isn’t coincidence but co-conspirator, narrowing options to a three-hour window that forces immediate action. Cost is unmistakable: exposure means disappearance, yet she paints anyway.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—decoding the pattern to prevent eel dispersal—is signaled early and tightens when visions reveal two futures. Korin’s agency drives escalation: each stone placement narrows options (e.g., placing the silver “seven dots” stone commits her to the spiral). Cost is unmistakable: her grandmother’s death from frictionlessness haunts every move, and failure means losing “the last remnants of the old world’s logic.” Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—density of pattern, not causality, raises stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—truth-telling under repression—is signaled early and deepens via Mara’s shift from personal grief to collective cartography. Agency drives escalation: she chooses vigil structure, rarefies language, and risks contraband distribution. Cost is unmistakable: UNRELIABLE branding, exile, the weight of unspeakable loss. The storm’s “furiously tranquil” paradox mirrors her internal pressure, narrowing options to disciplined resistance or surrender—she endures, foreclosing silence.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—intellectual integrity as life-or-death—is signaled early (“philosophy for cowards”) and tightens when Adelaine refuses to duel until decoding Bellini, raising personal risk. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her choice to read, not fight, forces Harwick into collaboration. Cost is visible (mechanical arm as past-duel consequence) and conceptual (abandoning violent resolution). The deepening—music replacing swords—narrows options irreversibly, fulfilling lens-based escalation with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—beauty amid chaos—tightens when seed discovery forces action with cost (ephemeral effort, forgotten joy). Protagonist agency drives escalation: Mara chooses to plant despite knowing her October self will lose this memory. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; coincidence (wildflowers on fence) complicates but doesn’t resolve. The trade-off—temporary creation vs. permanent recognition—is crystallized in Kai’s soil-tamping and Mara’s improvised poem.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake (reclaiming lost time) intensifies through one decisive deepening: the shift from playing for strangers to weaponizing nostalgia via film splicing. Agency is crystallized in her choice to insert wedding photos and clock faces between frames—a trade-off sacrificing ritual constancy for risky creation. Cost is felt in the husband’s “temporal displacement” voice and obsolete luggage; the world bends, but not without scars. Escalation is driven entirely by her strategically creative act under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving cultural memory—is signaled early and tightens via the monsoon clock, dream evidence, and Prem’s challenge. Kima’s agency drives escalation: her interpreted dreams narrow options from skepticism to “luminous doubt,” forcing a trade-off with irreversible cost (seed lost either way). The deepening—“truth and wish aren’t always opposites”—emerges from embodied experience, not coincidence, and crystallizes stance under Accumulative pressure. Moral calculus sharpens the peak choice: protecting memory requires embracing the “empirically whimsical,” with cost felt in every hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—understanding inherited silence—is signaled early and deepens via Takeo’s decoding of the lace, which narrows Mira’s path from searching for answers to tending what remains. Agency emerges in her hands-on work with the cutting, guided by the lace’s “instructions.” Cost is felt in the relinquishment of literal truth for cultivated meaning. Escalation is subtle but sufficient under Accumulative lens, though lacks a decisive reversal beyond insight.
