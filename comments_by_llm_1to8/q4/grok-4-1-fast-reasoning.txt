  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—recovering Elena's pulsar research through the dust patterns—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, escalation is summarized rather than dramatized: "Day by day, the mirrors' clouded surfaces decayed gradually" compresses what should be a pressure-filled process into a passive observation. No reversal tests Elena's commitment; the dust works as hypothesized without resistance, and the climactic publication ("Reviewers marveled") is told rather than shown. Agency is present in Elena's decision to gather dust and rig the spectrometer, but these choices do not foreclose a visible alternative or carry an on-page cost—wingless butterflies survive, her data is refined, and success arrives without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake (exposing the smuggler network / finding purpose) is signaled early but never tightens into a forced trade-off. Elara encounters no live obstacles after the opening attack; the ledger's secrets unfold without resistance, and the final confrontation is resolved in a single summary sentence with no visible cost or tactical adaptation. Coincidence (frost patterns align "eerily" with ledger gaps) enables discovery rather than protagonist agency under pressure. No persistent constraint shapes her choices or the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—resurrecting harmony from The Hush—is signaled early but remains abstract until the group gathering. The sole on-page complication is Kai's rage; it arrives late and is resolved within two beats via a fork choice with no prior setup cost. No meaningful tightening forecloses a live option: Elara succeeds without trade-off, and the "finale" is a declared triumph rather than a choice under pressure. Agency at closure is performance, not renunciation or decision with visible price. The piece reads as outline-like sequencing—and-then she gathered, and-then she struck—without escalation under any inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake (silencing distress signals to grant permanent rest) is signaled early and sustained. Pressure escalates through the iterative prism placement—each shard ignites, silences an echo, emboldens Elias, and intensifies swirling specters clawing at his robes. The library's trembling and final lattice convergence narrow options toward the climactic choice. The cost is visible: Elias's body is pulled into the glow, his weariness lifted as he merges with the lens to become the eternal beacon. One meaningful deepening reweights the dominant stake under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—community survival under sanctions through anonymous giving—is signaled early and tightens as enforcers sweep near and Lena's basket becomes heavy with risk. One meaningful reversal occurs when Tomas shifts from skepticism to ringing the bell himself. Yet the escalation relies on summary ("sanctions tightened") rather than a dramatized on-page choice that narrows options or imposes a visible trade-off. Lena's frozen mid-run moment gestures toward cost but resolves immediately ("shadows held"), deflating the pressure before the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.7)
    Dominant stake (find where unused love is stored) is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias encounters Mira's wound and decides to use Kwan Yin's tear in the camera obscura. The escalation is driven by Elias's agency under an Accumulative lens, yet the cost is abstract: no live option is foreclosed, no trade-off dramatized—Mira heals, Elias gains clarity, sparks merge. The resolution feels awarded rather than earned through renunciation or endurance with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—escape the retrocognitive trap—is signaled early, but pressure remains static: visions "assault him unbidden" and "the trap held firm" are declarations without on-page escalation or narrowing. No reversal or complication tests Elias's commitment; he stumbles upon the halo fragment and immediately "knows instinctively" it will solve the problem, then enacts the solution without failure or trade-off. The cost (fragment disintegration, photograph dissolution) is visible at closure, but Elias never chooses between competing goods or unavoidable harms—the cost simply happens as byproduct of success. Agency reads as performance rather than decision under pressure; coincidence (finding the fragment) enables resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake (smuggle seeds to exiles) is signaled early but remains abstract; we never see Elara weigh competing costs or face a trade-off that narrows her options. The Wall's fall arrives as external coincidence rather than pressure she generates or responds to with agency-driven escalation. Her escape—toppling a shelf, snapping chains—reads as competent execution without visible price or forfeiture. The story declares high stakes ("starving exiles," "prophesied fall") but never tests Elara's commitment on the page with a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—forging a device that captures betrayal's sound—is signaled early and drives all action. Pressure accumulates through the regeneration timeframe ("mere hours to work," "cells divided faster"), but the escalation is temporal rather than conflict-driven; no meaningful obstacle or reversal tests Elias's commitment. He collects absences, heats the forge, strikes the spiral, pours in memory, and succeeds. The cost at closure (tears, memory no longer torment but tool) is emotional and told rather than dramatized through a choice that forecloses an alternative path. Agency reads as execution of a plan rather than alteration or renunciation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—obtaining the portrait to decode destiny—is signaled early but never genuinely threatened; Elara encounters no meaningful opposition or forced trade-off. The toppled jar provides a complication but immediately grants additional power rather than narrowing options. Escalation reads as sequential discovery (panel, portrait, jar, glyphs, visions) without a tightening that forecloses a live alternative or imposes felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=3.9)
    The dominant stake—crafting sanctuaries for inquiry—is signaled early but never tested by opposition, scarcity, or doubt. Elias completes five spheres in sequence without reversal, failed attempt, or tactical adjustment. No on-page tightening narrows his options; no cost is paid. The conflict is declared ("behold!" narration) but not dramatized through pressure that forces a trade-off or alters his stance.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming her erased identity—is declared early but never tested through on-page choice; Elara simply reacts to Harlan's arrival. No meaningful escalation occurs: the seashell instantly solves the cipher, Harlan conveniently arrives at the perfect moment, and the resolution cycles through three attempts in the final paragraph without landing on earned causality. The "vulnerability is power" claim is asserted ("her phobias not chains, but the key") but never dramatized as a trade-off with visible cost. Coincidence (seashell hum, Harlan's fear, timely yacht) resolves rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—navigating endless night—is signaled early. The oracle's method (reading silences) is explained and demonstrated in two beats, but no reversal or tightening occurs; Elara absorbs the lesson without resistance or trade-off. The map emerges through passive observation, not protagonist choice. The ending declares "renewed" and "pact" but shows no on-page price or foreclosed option; the pressure remains static rather than escalating to a decisive moment.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake ("to find where thoughts come from") is signaled early and pursued across the loops, but escalation is conceptual rather than pressure-driven—each loop reveals another layer without narrowing options or forcing trade-offs. The piece offers a single deepening (loops 1–7 converge to the final insight), which fits the length, but the protagonist's agency is passive: the violin "urged continuation" and loops "unfolded around him." No visible cost alters tactics; the janitor resumes sweeping unchanged except for internal "weight of amalgamated wisdom," which remains abstract. Under the Accumulative lens the convergence provides a tightening, but without felt cost the stakes remain declarative.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—thawing Mira's mistrust—is signaled early but never tested by a live trade-off. Elias prepares tickets and places them; Mira picks them up and the doodles "ignite," unlocking her realizations without agency or cost. No reversal or tightening choice narrows options; the resolution arrives via symbolic projection rather than protagonist decision. The final "embrace" is gestured, not earned by pressure that forced a sacrifice or foreclosed a path.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—proving the maze's worth before demolition—is clear and signaled early. The council's arrival provides a ticking clock, and the ritual at the fountain is a meaningful pressure point. However, escalation is more revelation than tightening: Elias performs his ritual, the scanner jumps, and the council retreats without friction or cost. No trade-off is visible; no live option is foreclosed. The protagonist's agency is embodied in the polish action, but the resolution feels granted by the garden rather than earned through a difficult choice under fire.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—proving sideways time—is clear and present throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara engages the lever, but the escalation is thin: no live obstacle forces a tradeoff, and the "subdued awakenings" effect arrives without resistance or visible cost to Elara. Lirren's skepticism evaporates instantly; no consequent loss (stamina, social credit, tool failure) alters later tactics. Agency at closure is present but the price is conceptual rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—deciphering Elara's final message—is signaled early and remains coherent. The piece delivers one meaningful tightening when Elias slashes the lantern to flood the program, narrowing his options and raising immediate cost (the foundation cracks, waters rise). However, the escalation feels somewhat opportunistic: the grate, waterproof case, and score appear without prior foreshadowing, reducing the sense that protagonist agency drove the pressure. The ending reconfigures his stance ("ignited, ready to disrupt"), but the cost is asserted more than dramatized in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—finding the weight of the swallowed truth—is signaled early and coheres through the fever recovery and illustration ritual. The berry's burden tightens her internal pressure, but the climactic realization (the cartographer's death) is recounted rather than dramatized as a live choice that forecloses options. One meaningful deepening occurs (acceptance of cumulative fatalities), yet the cost remains more stated than viscerally enacted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.2)
    One dominant stake is signaled early (find the weight of swallowed truth tied to the mill collapse). The radio-confession sequence tightens pressure once, but the peak turn—Jax realizing he'd dialed in—is more reveal than escalation driven by his agency. The wheel-turning finale forecloses a path (truth expelled, remorse released) yet the cost is abstract ("lighter," "buoyant in release") rather than a visible trade-off. Coincidence (radio callers, psychic show timing) complicates but also resolves, diluting earned escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—"to witness change without judgment"—remains declared rather than tested. No antagonist, obstacle, or internal conflict opposes the keeper's journey; the earth and refuge cooperate, and the swan's method succeeds without reversal. The piece lacks a meaningful tightening or turn that narrows options: the keeper begins with his vow and concludes with its fulfillment, unchanged. Cost is implied thematically (endless solitude) but never lands as a visible forfeiture or trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—helping Lila reconnect through music and memory—is signaled early, and the eclipse provides one meaningful tightening (the hush forces intimacy, the corona's glow enables the locket reveal). However, no live option is foreclosed: Elias doesn't risk losing the locket's significance to him, and Lila's acceptance carries no visible price—she simply receives comfort. The story tells us "this moment would root deep" without showing what she's trading (her silence? her privacy?) to accept the gift. Agency reads more as offering than as decision under competing pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—collecting wall-stories—is signaled early but never escalates or narrows options. Thorne probes the sealed chamber and unearths diaries without facing opposition, trade-offs, or reversals. The diaries' revelation (dragons, axis tilt, human dreamlessness) adds information but does not force a decision or foreclosure. The ending reprises his original activity with no visible cost or altered tactic. No on-page reversal or tightening deepens pressure under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake (Elias's desire to escape stagnation and become "unseen maestro") is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when he discovers the specs and decides to act, but the escalation is declarative rather than tested. No reversal: his plan succeeds without friction, error, or adaptation. The spies' arrival and the authorities' response are coincidental conveniences that resolve rather than complicate. The closure lacks visible cost; Elias wins unambiguously, with locals cheering and no hint of moral price or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—prevent the possession's completion—is signaled early but never tightens into a visible trade-off or escalating cost. Elias layers loops and paints runes without encountering failure, resource depletion, or a moment where one tactic must be abandoned for another. The shadow "recoils" and "fragments" in response to rhetoric, but no reversal tests Elias's commitment or alters his approach. Agency is present in his repeated actions, but the final "victory" is declared rather than earned through a choice that forecloses a path or pays a felt price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—conducting unheard symphonies—is declared early but never tested by opposition or a trade-off; Elara simply executes her ritual without friction. No reversal or tightening narrows her options; the dawn arrives on schedule, the shell works as intended, and the crowd applauds. The "before exhaustion hits" timeframe is mentioned but never pressures her choices—she completes the performance and only then collapses. Coincidence (dawn's timing, the spontaneous appearance of listeners) enables rather than complicates, and no visible price alters her tactics mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake ("conquer the labyrinth of self") is signaled early but never tested by a credible on-page reversal. Elias encounters alternate timelines and shadow-selves, yet none force a difficult choice or trade-off—he simply "dodges," "phases through," and "retraces." The final confrontation with the doppelganger resolves in a single sentence without visible cost or a narrowing of options. Pressure remains static rather than escalating under the inferred Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake (defeat numbness) is signaled early, and pressure accumulates through the discovery, mending, and ritual orchestration. However, the escalation remains additive rather than narrowing options—each step succeeds without complication or trade-off visible on the page. The climax ("numbness fled, defeated by the power she'd unleashed") tells the resolution instead of dramatizing a choice or visible price, and the phrase "the act of enthralling others reigniting her core" offers psychological explanation rather than scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—verify the rogue zone's existence while preserving meticulous integrity—is signaled early and tightens when the message reframes her storm logs. However, the escalation relies heavily on Elara's internal cross-referencing rather than external resistance or a trade-off that narrows live options. The follower and the pigeon both function as clues rather than active pressures, and the final decision to withhold her findings lacks a dramatized consequence that would elevate cost legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—discovering time's texture—is signaled early and persists. The beings' pattern-unveiling creates a sequential deepening (first layer: knotted tapestry; second: binary fork; third: integration illusion), yet no tightening *forecloses* a live option. The "impossible choice" is presented in the second layer, but Elias circumvents it via wordplay ("Not sever, but integrate") without visible trade-off; the beings approve instantly, and he emerges empowered. Under the Accumulative lens, escalation should show a cadence shift or cost that reweights the stake—here the progression feels additive rather than compressive. No persistent constraint (time, stamina, social cost) shapes his tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: unbinding the chronic hush through shared fragments. The ritual escalates as survivors contribute offerings (giggle, sigh, half-scold, boat's creak, half-song), and Lir weaves them into music, each fragment pressing back against the hush. The tightening occurs when Lir reaches his own offering—his father's incomplete tale—risking vulnerability and "letting the echo harbor the pause," which cracks the hush and triggers "survivors add[ing] their threads." Agency is present (Lir's violin work and the choice to share his father's story), and the visible cost is the empty bowl and the acknowledgment that "the chronic hush endured, but softer now." The escalation is meaningful but the final cost feels slightly muted; the hush's persistence dilutes the sense of irreversible change.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—completing Mira's transformation via the final elixir—is signaled early and pursued across beats (selecting the petal, rubbing it on amber, channeling the charge). One tightening occurs when her transformation accelerates ("Now," she gasped) and he must act immediately. However, pressure never narrows options or forces a trade-off; Elias performs his craft without friction, and the resolution (pocketing the spent petal, watching her fade) costs him nothing visible on the page. Agency is demonstration, not decision under competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (reconnecting the locket to its origin, then recognizing Mira as benefactor) is clear, but escalation is minimal—Elias tracks an address, knocks, and the revelation unfolds through dialogue summary. No live option is foreclosed; Mira agrees to friendship without visible friction or cost. The coincidental envelope solves rather than complicates, and the "cycles" concept is declared rather than tested under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—Elara's desire to weave herself into community—is signaled early and maintained. The shared search provides a throughline, but escalation is diffuse: "days blurred," "bonds tightening," "group swelled" are summary moves rather than on-page reversals that narrow options. The arbor discovery feels like arrival rather than a turn that forces a trade-off. The final sculpture is completed without visible friction or resource cost (no mention of time pressure, physical exhaustion, or competing artistic vision). One tightening occurs (the group crests the ridge and finds the arbor), but the agency is collective drift rather than Elara's decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—reaching the Echo Cradle before the giant wakes—is clear, but pressure does not escalate through protagonist agency. The sculptures resist in one beat, then dissolve; no reversal or deepening narrows options or forces a visible trade-off. The giant's stirring yawn arrives as atmospheric deadline rather than a consequence of Elara's borrowing, and the closure bypasses cost by allowing her to "seal her book" without dramatizing what she sacrificed from the nap or her future.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.5)
    Dominant stake—reuniting with Elowyn or understanding her vanishing—is signaled early and sustained. The embedding of the glass eyes constitutes one meaningful action, but escalation is thin: Thorne's choices are unopposed and the narrative flow is more ritual than conflict. No reversal or deepening tightens options; the "faint hum" and "visions" arrive as reward without visible trade-off or cost that alters subsequent moves.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Elias's drive to become visible—is signaled early and tightens when the woman's sob pulls him from hiding. His decision to include the tape fragment (a personal relic) raises emotional cost, and stepping into her flashlight beam forecloses his years of anonymity with visible price. The woman's acceptance lacks a counter-beat or complication, softening escalation slightly, but the turn is protagonist-driven and meaningful under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—immersing in plant life to study behaviors—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates (warmth → prickling → staggering → rooting), but each stage is a passive intensification rather than a choice that narrows options. The final metamorphosis completes without Elias renouncing or trading off a live alternative; he simply becomes plant, and the text declares "thrived" and "harmony" without showing what competing path was foreclosed. No visible price at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—threshing meaning from survival—is signaled early and sustained. The rain-trails discovery provides one meaningful tightening that narrows Elias's focus, and the exchange with Mira offers a visible trade (painting for brooch). However, the exchange itself feels more cooperative than costly; no live option is demonstrably foreclosed on the page. Under the Accumulative lens, the pressure coheres through layered imagery, but the final act lacks a sharp price that charges the image with undeniable weight.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=4.8)
    Dominant stake: Thorne seeks to revive barren fields; secondary: Elara's fate. The pearl's discovery is coincidental, and the forces' awakening lacks causal grounding—Thorne dislodges a stone, then shadows stir without clear because/therefore linkage. The possession sequence is asserted rather than dramatized as a tightening choice with visible tradeoff. No meaningful escalation under pressure; Elara's "resolute breath" replaces struggle. The ending distributes the pearl to Thorne, but no on-page cost alters tactics or forecloses a live path.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake is clear: mend the harbor's fractured community. Escalation proceeds through three trumpet intervals that deepen crowd response (gasps → cheers/sobs → lit faces), fitting the Accumulative lens. However, no on-page reversal or tightening forecloses an option—Elias encounters no resistance, resource limit, or internal doubt that he must overcome. The cost (what he risks or loses by blowing the valve) remains invisible, and the crowd's transformation is told rather than tested through a conflicting choice.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—finding the fortress—is signaled early but never tested by genuine obstacles; every barrier (grate, bricks, gates) vanishes when Elias uses the punch, reducing escalation to a procession. No on-page reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off; coincidence (the punch always works, arrows always point correctly) drives resolution. The final return ticket erases any cost, and the protagonist's agency is passive—he follows arrows and punches air. Visions of "phantom passengers confessing silenced scandals" are told rather than dramatized, and the "mysteries unraveled" remain abstract. One tightening might be the descent into deeper realms, but without visible price or altered tactics, pressure flatlines.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—whether to investigate the tile and honor the fisherman's grief—is signaled early but never genuinely tested. Elara's vow to transcribe is made alone without opposition or trade-off, and the tile warms and "unlocks" memories through plot convenience rather than protagonist struggle. The fisherman's return with tears provides an emotional beat but no escalation; visitors arrive and receive pages without friction. One tightening (skepticism cracks) occurs, but the cost is told rather than shown in a constrained choice.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake—"what happens after goodbye"—is told repeatedly but never tested on the page. Elowen's "intrigue" escalates through assertion rather than through narrowing options or raising cost. The fragment's curse enables the mutiny without friction or trade-off, and the resolution ("eternity fragmented—not ended, but reborn") lacks visible consequence or earned reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake (political asylum/survival) is signaled early and coheres throughout. One meaningful tightening: the 247-second patrol interval and the precise 03:17:42 gap. Eli's agency drives the breach (calculating, waiting, acting), and the method (waiting actively via math) shapes tactics. Yet escalation is thin—no reversal or complication between finding the ink and succeeding. The vapor solves the problem it introduces (rigid thinking) without costing Eli a trade-off; coincidence (the patrol gap aligning exactly) enables the breach rather than a decision under conflicting pressures. Cost at closure is implied (fleeing, asylum declaration) but not felt on the page as a foreclosed path or visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Thorne's drive to collect and refract textures of time—is signaled early and deepens when the lamp's hum shifts to reveal the town's silence. The tightening moment ("Now, the hum pierced his restraint, dragging forth the town's unraveling") narrows the emotional field and forces a recognition. However, the resolution lacks on-page agency: Thorne binds the notepad and places it in the labyrinth, but the town's revival happens off-stage without dramatized cost or trade-off. The escalation reads as an internal deepening rather than a choice that forecloses a path, and coincidence (the wind, the mist, the figures emerging) resolves the external stake without protagonist action at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.1)
    One dominant stake is signaled early (discover memory texture / reclaim erased identity) and the tidal cycles provide patterned pressure, but escalation remains atmospheric rather than causal—fragments accumulate without forcing trade-offs or narrowing options until the final paragraph. The label discovery offers one reversal (un-erasing the protagonist's history), yet it arrives abruptly and resolves without visible cost: the wanderer "smiled into the fog" without renouncing a live alternative or paying a felt price. No on-page choice forecloses a path; the ending reconfigures understanding but lacks the agency-driven tightening required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—decode the universal riddle—is signaled early and drives Elias to the observatory. The ritual with shell and cello constitutes one meaningful deepening as hums peel riddle fragments, but no on-page reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off. The climax delivers the riddle's core through performance rather than protagonist agency under external pressure; the voices are reimagined echoes, not antagonists. The resolution ("gloomy cheerfulness his true north") is a realization asserted in summary, with no visible cost paid—no tactic altered, no path foreclosed—weakening escalation legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (stopping privatization via community reorganization) is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Kai reveals the contracts and the timeline narrows to weeks. However, the escalation unfolds via summary montage ("graffiti secrets evolving," "rafts realigned") rather than on-page reversals that test Elara's commitment. The resolution is told as fait accompli ("reorganization had saved the spirit") without dramatizing the cost or showing what Elara or the community forfeited. Agency is present but the final outcome lacks a visible price that alters later options.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—photographing the relic before mining operations erase it—is signaled early and sustained. Oxygen depletion provides a tightening constraint that forces the timed-message strategy. However, the escalation is logistical rather than driven by protagonist agency: Elias waits for dawn and rescue rather than making a choice that narrows options with felt cost. The resolution (rescue arrives, photo succeeds) lacks a visible trade-off; no live option is foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake (repair the drone before anchor clears) is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: the captain's plea and the rising chain clanks create urgency. Yet the escalation is atmospheric rather than tactical; no failed attempt, resource scarcity, or apprentice mistake forces adaptation. The patch succeeds on first application without visible cost (time, material, or error). Closure lacks a trade-off or foreclosed path; success and serenity land without sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake (finding the rivers' source) is signaled early and coherent throughout. The accumulative pattern of clues (falcon, phrasebook, glass) adds density but does not force a trade-off or narrow options; Harlan moves from clue to clue without meaningful resistance or cost. The departure is prepared but not earned by a tightening that forecloses a live alternative. No visible price is paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake (revive Perivale) is signaled early, but pressure never escalates: Elias encounters no failure, adaptation, or trade-off. His first fork strike immediately triggers ghost footsteps, and subsequent actions (pacing, striking again) proceed in a frictionless success cascade. No reversal narrows options; the spectral townsfolk cooperate without complication. The ending resolves via his uncontested action with no visible price paid—no stamina cost, no personal renunciation, no failed alternative—reading as convenient magic rather than earned escalation under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—claim the gathered hush before oxygen runs out—is signaled early, but escalation remains largely atmospheric. The perfume vial solves the panic problem the moment it appears, converting terror into "serene resolve" and enabling Lirael to unsnarl the hush without visible trade-offs or failures. The oxygen alarm "shrieked faintly" and the gauge "hit critical," yet these do not force her to abandon steps or improvise; she completes every phase and surfaces intact. Under a Causal lens, the vial's convenience and the lack of a forced sacrifice or narrowed option weaken pressure; under Accumulative, the final orb claim and rescue arrival feel more like plot confirmation than a choice that reweights prior cost.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is clear: achieve hush/redemption before bodies are discovered. Escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as density increase (copperlight → hovering shades → father's face → core void → release), but no beat forces a trade-off or narrows Elias's options—he moves linearly deeper without resistance. The timeframe ("before they find the bodies") hangs as abstract menace; no guard patrol or sound cue tightens the clock on the page. The cost (bodies hidden, guards oblivious) is told at the end rather than tested in scene, so the pressure feels more atmospheric than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dominant stake—reuniting across lifetimes—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through repeated hauntings and the venom's euphoric advance, but no reversal or deepening occurs; each cameo is a repetition, not a tightening. The climax is passive: venom "unraveled his mortal coil" without a choice that narrows options or a visible trade-off. No cost legibility: what live option did he foreclose? Escalation is atmospheric repetition, not causal narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"carving a path from ruin to reverence"—is declared but never tested by a live on-page dilemma or escalation that narrows options. Elara's sleepwalking removes agency from the peak sequence, leaving no protagonist-driven reversal or choice with visible cost. The resolution (luminous tapestry, villagers ascending) is summarized rather than dramatized, and the "broken precedents dissolved" outcome arrives without trade-off or price legible on the page. Pressure is static from entry to dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dominant stake (restore lost faith) is signaled early but never tightened or tested. Elara excavates for fourteen days without obstacle, doubt, or competing pressure. Each discovery (satchel, staff, sundial base) adds thematic resonance but does not narrow options or raise cost. The final rebuilding is achieved through methodical assembly with no reversal, trade-off, or visible price. Agency is present (she decides to rebuild) but the decision costs nothing and forecloses no path.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: prepare a coded letter for a whistleblower before mailing. Pressure coheres (urgency, scanning for enforcers) and one tightening occurs when she pauses to check for tails. Yet coincidence does not complicate, and the protagonist's agency—drawing chalk, sealing wax, tucking the letter—reads as methodical execution without a reversal or trade-off that forecloses an option with visible cost. The ending lands as readiness rather than a decision under fire, keeping escalation modest.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—warning the queen to prevent the coup—is signaled early. However, escalation is weak: Elara completes the chart without meaningful reversal or on-page cost that narrows her options. The courier's arrival is coincidental convenience, and slipping the chart into his satchel requires no sacrifice or risk dramatized on the page. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen or reweight; here it remains static from midpoint to end. No tightening choice forecloses a live path with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—reconnecting with Thorne via unsent apologies—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the labyrinth's resistance and the spirits' songs, but no on-page reversal forces Elara to trade one good for another or alter her tactics under cost. The shard warms, the spirits cooperate, and Thorne appears when evoked; coincidence (the spirits' empathy, the shard's moonlight pulse) resolves rather than complicates. The vision of Thorne turning away is a micro turn, yet it does not foreclose a path—Elara pushes deeper without visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (decrypting the child's fears to graft new meaning) is signaled early. The decryption sequence provides one meaningful deepening: each revelation ("Mama's shadow," "Coral brain dreams," "Untie me") layers anxieties and tightens emotional pressure. The unknotting of the string is a micro turn, but agency is interpretive work rather than a decision with visible trade-off. No live option is foreclosed on the page; the whispered vow asserts resolution without demonstrating cost.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—rediscovering joy—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or cost. Elara encounters no friction: the fragment reveals its secret willingly, the light-painting succeeds immediately, wraiths approve, buds hint on branches. One micro-tightening occurs when she lifts the fragment, but no reversal or deepening narrows her options. The accumulative lens requires a cadence shift or reweighting that forecloses a path; here, all moves add without subtracting.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—transforming Lena's certainty into curiosity—is signaled early and drives the single extended beat of bewitchment. Escalation proceeds through nested layers (first/second/third awakening), but each layer is delivered to Lena rather than earned through her resistance or Elias's adaptation under pressure. No reversal: Elias encounters no obstacle, Lena offers no meaningful counter-move, and the hobo nickel functions as intended without cost. The resolution ("Let's find out together") bypasses the question Lena posed and provides no on-page evidence of what Elias sacrificed—time, social trust, the garden's equilibrium—to achieve his goal.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dominant stake (untaxed thoughts) declared early but never tested by an on-page choice that narrows options. Elias's patterns "grow bolder" in summary; no dramatized tightening forces a trade-off. The greenhouse standoff assembles chaos (drones, beetles, rebels) but Elias does not decide between competing goods or pay a visible price; "the warp held" and seeds scatter without foreclosing any path. Escalation is asserted via intensifiers ("chaos peaked," "trembled") rather than earned through protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—achieving sleep or "blossom armistice"—is signaled early but never tested by on-page reversal or tightening that narrows options. Elowen encounters the postcard without struggle, performs a rite without friction, and sinks into sleep without visible cost or forfeited path. Pressure remains rhetorical (stacked metaphors, repeated phrases) rather than escalatory under the inferred accumulative lens. The final resolution is asserted ("Sleep's blossom armistice bloomed fully") rather than earned through protagonist agency or a dramatized trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake (preserve forgotten names before they dissolve) is signaled in paragraph five and persists throughout. However, pressure does not escalate under the Accumulative lens; each wing presents the same ritual without new obstacles or trade-offs until the tube cracks wider in the final wing. The tube's final shattering is presented as external exhaustion rather than a choice Elara makes under competing pressures. No reversal or tightening narrows her options mid-story; she completes her quest in all four wings, and the "cost" (tube destruction, Lirien's name faintly captured) arrives after success rather than forcing a renunciation or stance crystallization. The price is told ("foxglove tears") but not dramatized as a choice that forecloses a live alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—restore trust before dawn—is signaled early and sustained. The scroll-unsnarling sequence offers escalating inscriptions (four vows) that tighten the magical knot and raise the symphonic reveal. Yet the escalation is additive rather than narrowing: each promise loosens another cluster without setback or visible cost. Thorne's skepticism dissolves passively once the magic proves her fidelity; no on-page reversal forces Elara to choose between competing goods or suffer a tactical loss.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—flood control versus sacred preservation—is signaled early and maintained. Elias's discovery of the envelope provides one meaningful turn that narrows his options, and the clan arrival tests his solution on the page. However, the escalation is largely internal and cerebral; no external antagonist pressures him, and the clans' skepticism dissolves instantly upon reading the letter. The cost of his choice—"eternal vigilance"—is stated rather than shown as a forfeited path or tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=4.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve songs via chip balance—is signaled early but never tested on the page by a live obstacle or trade-off. The fraud revelation could tighten options, but Lila's forgiveness arrives in the next scene without visible friction. The confession pigeon and the chip's final hum are told outcomes, not turns that narrow tactics. No price is paid for the fraud; the ending grants Elias and Lila "trust fully relearned" and "balance held" without foreclosing a path or extracting a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—reuniting with father—is signaled early, but pressure never tightens through protagonist agency. The logbook and compass discoveries are passive finds; Elowen hesitates once ("Close the distance, lose the light") but crosses anyway without visible price. No reversal, trade-off, or foreclosed path; the maze "resolved below" and father simply waits. The ending grants reunion without cost, violating the story's own rule about sacred thresholds demanding sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—Elara's quest for belonging—is signaled early but never tested by a meaningful trade-off or reversal. The encounter with Theo unfolds without friction; both characters align immediately around the feather's meaning. The firefly appearance is coincidental and resolves the emotional question without protagonist agency driving the change. No visible cost or foreclosed path appears on the page; the vigil simply delivers insight without sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (why paths disappear) is signaled early and maintained, and the bird's arrival introduces a reversal that shifts Elara's approach from solo conjecture to seed-pattern reading. Yet the escalation is gentle: no option is foreclosed, no visible price paid—she simply gains an answer. The "before memory fades" timeframe is invoked but never tightens decisions on the page. Under the Accumulative lens the piece deepens understanding, but lacks a moment where agency forecloses a live path with on-page cost, capping the score below strong execution.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—orchestrating serendipity to reignite creativity—is signaled early, but escalation is thin: Jasper scatters pieces, one lands, strangers talk. No on-page resistance or reversal tests his plan; the bishop simply works. The coincidence (lanky man with pawn tattoo and carved queen in pocket) resolves the problem without prior setup, undercutting earned pressure. Agency belongs to chance, not protagonist choice. The cost (Jasper slipping away unseen) is implied but not felt as a trade-off that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—complete the cosmic verse—is signaled early but never tested by a competing cost or trade-off. The anchoring is imposed by coincidence (stepping on the speck) and resolved by coincidence (observing gaps releases it); Elara's agency is limited to waiting and looking. No on-page reversal narrows her options; the "panic" beat deflates immediately when the anchor spontaneously reverses. The final act (inking Kai) proceeds without friction or visible price; exile is declared "complete" but no path is foreclosed with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake—"to reveal how the everyday harbored treasures"—is signaled early but remains abstract and is never tested by meaningful opposition or cost. No on-page reversal narrows Elias's options; the ripple patterns deliver visions without forcing a trade-off or foreclosing a path. The "shift ahead" (tempest) is only backdrop, never pressuring his present choices. Agency is passive (he receives visions) rather than a decision or renunciation with visible price, and the ending restates his intent without demonstrating that anything has been risked or lost.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—Elias seeking to "translate pain into a universal language"—is abstract and never tested by live opposition or cost. The encounter with Lena offers an opportunity for escalation, but she accepts his wisdom without friction; no reversal, no trade-off emerges. The vow "I'll fight smart, like you" is unearned by prior pressure; coincidence (her sob) delivers the pupil, and the resolution is pedagogical summary rather than a choice that forecloses an option. One deepening (shared memory) occurs but lacks visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—revitalizing hope across timelines—is signaled early but never narrowed by a credible reversal. Each trial balloon succeeds incrementally without setback; shadow timelines ("sterile logic without dream") appear as thematic contrast, not on-page opposition that forces Elara to adapt tactics. No moment where her pattern fails and she must choose between resilience variables or sacrifice one timeline to save another. The grand balloon's ascent and "serene upheaval crested" are declared victories without visible cost or a live option foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the family secret and deciding what to do with it—is signaled early and tightens through discovery. The revelation (ancestors engineered quakes) raises moral cost and Elias's decision to voice the truth rather than destroy evidence is a meaningful turn. However, the escalation is largely through information gain rather than a choice under competing pressures; the vines "reclaiming" and "judging" feel more symbolic than a concrete obstacle that forces a trade-off. One tightening is present, but the cost at closure is more conceptual than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—sustaining Elowen's form via borrowed heartbeats—is signaled early, but no on-page tightening narrows her options or forces a trade-off. She sings, children's dreams respond, she absorbs heartbeats, and mirrors shift: a linear sequence without reversal, escalation, or visible price. The lullabies succeed without resistance; no credible loss (time, stamina, ethical cost) alters her tactics. Agency is absent: she performs a ritual as scripted, not a decision that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—ending the Forever War—is signaled early and remains coherent. One tightening occurs when Elara lights the braziers and delegates approach, but escalation relies on summary ("one by one") rather than a dramatized reversal that narrows options. The spectral boy's appearance is ornamental; it does not alter Elara's tactics or force a visible trade-off. Cost at closure is told ("life's blood sealing") without showing what tactical path or relationship she forecloses.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—absolution through preserving the huia's echo—is signaled early but remains abstract; the piece declares sentiment and guilt without showing a live internal conflict that tightens options. The kneeling and placement constitute one meaningful action, meeting minimal escalation for this length, but no reversal or cost-bearing choice narrows Elias's path on the page; he walks away unburdened ("the release lightening his step"). Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen through pattern or cadence shift; here the repeated thunder motif and crack-map recurrence create texture but do not force a trade-off or foreclose an option with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake—defying the lullaby—is declared early but never tightened by opposition or cost. Elara encounters no resistance: threads slip free without struggle, the crowd's serenity "cracks faintly" but does not escalate, and her success is assured from the outset. No reversal or complication tests her commitment. The resolution is delivered by authorial decree ("the lullaby faltered") rather than protagonist agency with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—whether to continue subversive puppet shows—is signaled early. Pressure does not escalate; Elias begins serene and remains serene, with no on-page pull toward the bars or audience thrill that he must overcome. The puppeteer's cruelty to a patron is recounted, not dramatized, so the ethical breach feels distant. The decision to "reverse course" and halt the shows is declared but carries no visible cost in this scene: no audience waiting, no income source named and forfeited, no identity crisis embodied. Under the Accumulative lens, we need a deepening that reweights the stake with felt cost; instead we see assertion of transformation without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—honoring overlooked histories—is declared but never tested. No reversal, tightening, or deepening alters Elara's options; she completes each structure without impediment and departs satisfied. Wind loosens the first knot as scripted transience, not as pressure that forces trade-off. The monarchs' dwindling is told backdrop, not an on-page constraint that narrows her tactics or charges her final gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—preserve forgotten names—is signaled early and pursued without opposition. No reversal occurs; Elara threads the card, twists the rope, and succeeds in one unbroken arc. The "action: illuminate" is the climax, but no live option is foreclosed and no price is visible on the page beyond atmospheric tears. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful intensification (the braids locking, hum stirring) occurs, but escalation does not narrow her choices or raise felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—why paths choose walkers—is signaled early but never tightens into a forced tradeoff. Elara's journey from bunker entrance to pod to exit proceeds without meaningful resistance; the directive *tells* her the answer, and she accepts it without cost. The foresight/hindsight flashes (mother's fall, future storms) illustrate rather than complicate her present action. No on-page reversal narrows her options; the "transcendence" unfolds as a given rather than an earned escalation. The dream-realm whispers function as exposition rather than antagonistic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake (seal the covenant) is signaled early but never pressured by impediment or trade-off. Each beat (tile discovery → overlay → cipher → rift → vow) unfolds without reversal; no live option is foreclosed. The piece gestures at external pressure (rebel scouts, regime collapse) but this never intersects Ezar's actions or forces a sacrifice. Agency at closure is a recitation that succeeds immediately, with no visible cost or tactical shift. Under the inferred lens (hybrid causal-accumulative), one meaningful tightening is required; here the beats accumulate density but do not narrow options or raise price.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—teaching Thorne to release resentment—is signaled early and sustained. However, escalation is largely atmospheric rather than driven by protagonist agency: the music box does the work while Thorne passively receives. The single tightening (cellular memories intensifying until Thorne "understood") occurs, but no visible price is paid on the page—resentment "dissolving like mist" tells the release rather than showing a concrete forfeiture or tradeoff. Thorne never makes a choice that forecloses a path; he is acted upon throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—recapturing the runaway dream of his wife—is signaled early and pursued through the mirror ritual. Pressure accumulates via the Accumulative lens: reflections multiply, synchronized breathing pulls the apparition nearer, and "boundaries dissolved" at the climax. However, no meaningful tightening or trade-off forecloses a live option; Elias's plan succeeds without visible cost, complication, or reversal. The dream's resistance ("hovered just beyond the mirror's edge") is resolved by further repetition of the same tactic rather than an escalating constraint that forces a harder choice.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—bridging generational wisdom and mending the breach—is signaled early and tightens when Lila returns declaring "quartz eyes failing across the valleys." The storm and rotted beam raise immediate danger, forcing collaboration. However, the resolution feels earned more by the bag's contents appearing at the right moment than by protagonist choice under impossible trade-off. The quartz repair succeeds on first attempt without visible failure or tactical adjustment, softening escalation. One meaningful tightening is present (Lila's return and the shared climb), but the cost at closure is relational and emotional rather than a hard-won tactical victory.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—cataloging and understanding nonlinear inheritance—is signaled early but never tightens into a trade-off or foreclosed option. Elara inquires, receives cryptic answers, and engraves the cameo without encountering resistance, cost, or a moment where one path closes to open another. The "brightened disquiet" recurs as mood rather than escalating pressure. Agency at closure is asserted ("ready to inquire eternally") rather than dramatized through a visible renunciation or decision with on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=3.9)
    The dominant stake (find the Library of Unlearned Lessons) is declared but never tested with meaningful opposition—the "rescue missions" unfold as three identical puzzles solved by looking up the answer in the diary. No reversal or tightening occurs; each obstacle yields instantly to Elara's skill. The guardian confrontation, which should be the peak pressure point, dissolves into summary: "she uncovered leverage" and "unveiled the Library" without on-page negotiation or cost. Agency is entirely procedural. The "carefully resourceful" inventory moment promises scarcity but supplies never run out or constrain tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake—reach the garden—is clear and sustained. The thread-weaving method provides structure, but each binding (clown, lovers, sailor, acrobats) feels additive without escalating cost or forcing trade-offs. No reversal narrows Elara's options; she collects threads in sequence until the archway appears. The reunion with her twin is achieved without visible sacrifice or a choice that forecloses another path, so pressure accumulates without tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—clarifying the fables' absences—is signaled early and tightens when Elara recognizes the need to "merge the physical artifact with the ethereal voids." However, the escalation is primarily cognitive puzzle-solving; no live option is foreclosed with visible cost, and the merge itself is executed without resistance or trade-off. The resolution feels procedural rather than agency-driven under pressure, capping the score in mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—reclaim harmony before the energy beings unravel the world's fragile hush—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening: discovering the spiral node where vibrations converge narrows her target and intensifies the conjuring attempt. The Mapkeeper's agency (positioning stone, channeling will through mapped paths) drives the bloom's emergence; coincidence does not resolve. The cost is legible (eternal vigil, wary energy beings, fragile truce), though the beings' withdrawal feels passive rather than forced by a hard choice. Under the Accumulative lens, the escalation reads as density increase and cadence shift rather than causal narrowing, which is acceptable, but the lack of a moment where her method visibly risks failure keeps this from the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—prove patterns versus dismiss as chaos—is signaled early but never tested on-page by a competing pressure or tradeoff. Elara's visions guide her without error; no reversal tightens options. The "coincidence of winds" that clears clouds at the exact alignment resolves the problem externally, undercutting protagonist agency. One meaningful escalation (scavenging → etching charts → climbing the core) is present but the cost of rekindling is told ("wept," "visions confirming") rather than felt in a forfeited path or altered relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving collective memory through shadow-reading—is signaled early but never tested. Each monument conjecture unfolds without opposition, error, or competing pressure; the Archivist encounters no friction, makes no trade-off, and faces no moment where success or failure hinges on her agency. The final doubt is posed and answered within two lines, yielding no felt cost. Under the Accumulative lens, one expects density increase or pattern break to reweight the stake; here the pattern merely repeats, and the ending affirms rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—pierce the starless void with fireworks to defy hopelessness—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful turn occurs when the mosaic reveals the blueprint, narrowing Elias's design from improvisation to replication. However, escalation is thin: the discovery arrives without complication, the construction proceeds smoothly, and the launch succeeds on first attempt with no visible cost or trade-off. Villagers emerge in wonder, but no prior tension is paid off; the ending distributes satisfaction without forecloses a path or demonstrating what was risked.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—Mira's need to understand her transition—is present but never tested by a choice or reversal that narrows options. Elaron's action (placing the cicada, observing tangentially, delivering the metaphor) advances knowledge but does not escalate pressure or force a trade-off. The vision sequence describes futures rather than dramatizing a present decision with cost. The conversation resumes "lighter," but no path has been foreclosed and no price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—harvesting the gilded hush—is signaled early and pursued through the inversion window. The gravity flip and vine-compression moment tighten pressure briefly, but the noise-weaver's arrival introduces conflict that evaporates without cost (Elara "was gone"). The ending asserts archive growth and emotional shift without on-page trade-off or foreclosed option, leaving escalation functional but unearned at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake ("teach silence how to comfort") is signaled early but never tested. Elias's method succeeds on first attempt without reversal, resistance, or complication; the children comply immediately, Mira gasps in wonder, and the scene concludes with gratitude. No tightening forecloses an option, no visible price alters tactics, and the protagonist's agency amounts to demonstration rather than struggle. Escalation is absent under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.5)
    Dominant stake (find the stairway, claim the throne) is signaled early but never escalates into a trade-off or tightening. Obstacles (undergrid tunnels, drones, trapdoor) are bypassed in sequence without forcing Elara to sacrifice a resource, abandon a plan, or endure a visible cost. The drone encounter—"she deciphered a mural's riddle, using the flake to etch a counter-frequency… cloaking her presence"—is solved off-page without dramatized attempt or failure. The throne's "warning" and "testing her soul with visions" are told, not shown; no on-page choice narrows options or reweights tactics. Pressure remains flat; coincidence does not complicate but corridor-clears.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—maintaining sanctuary versus yielding to encroachment—is signaled early and tightens when the ring materializes and her voice threads the veil. The protagonist's act of heating the ring is agency-driven and forecloses reunion, but the escalation mechanism (how his act forces her first breath) relies on metaphor rather than dramatized consequence. One meaningful turn occurs (ring heats, threshold stabilizes, her presence recedes), yet the cost to her—"gasp of fresh air, the first unassisted breath"—is told rather than shown in embodied struggle. The price is conceptually legible but lacks visceral immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=4.0)
    The dominant stake—translating pressure into diamonds to heal pyramid-scheme trauma—is signaled early but never tested on the page. No reversal, complication, or forced trade-off materializes; Elias receives texts, affixes the bolt, and success follows without resistance. The glitchy messages escalate in urgency ("volunteer now or loops eternal") but this is told tension, not dramatized pressure that narrows his options. Agency is minimal: the texts instruct, Elias complies, and the mushrooms perform the transformation. No visible price is paid; the final distribution plan is announced rather than enacted with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.5)
    One dominant stake is clear: uncover the hidden truth and decide the dynasty's fate. However, escalation is minimal—Elias encounters no obstacle or trade-off until the documents are revealed, and then he immediately resolves to burn them. The standing-wave discovery is coincidental rather than earned by agency. No tightening narrows options; the cost (dismantling estates, erasing names) is told in summary rather than dramatized. Under a Causal lens, pressure should force a narrowing choice; here, it delivers a convenient solution.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—"capture the shape of possibility"—is signaled early but never tested by a concrete tradeoff. Pressure is atmospheric (reality shifts, air thickening) rather than choice-driven; no reversal forces Elowen to weigh competing costs or lose a live option. The unsnapping releases threads and visions without dramatized resistance, reading as a sequence of unlocks rather than escalation under the inferred lens. The ending grants "mastery" with no on-page price—his silence becoming "legend's voice" is narrated triumph, not a visible forfeiture or agency-driven turn that would demonstrate stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—Eleanor's desire to magnify small kindnesses and illuminate unknown histories—is signaled early and sustained. The discovery of the letter provides one meaningful deepening that reweights her purpose. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens is modest: the find doesn't narrow options or impose a trade-off; it simply affirms her existing motivation. The ending declares renewed purpose without demonstrating what tactical choice or live path is foreclosed. One tightening is present but the cost remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake (preserving truth against regime indifference) is signaled early but never tightens through protagonist agency. "When plans unravel" promises escalation, yet Elias's solo journey to the lagoon encounters no meaningful obstacles—drones are "evaded" in summary, and the puddle-map guides him passively. The climax delivers a cache that solves his isolation problem without prior cost or trade-off; comrades reappear via hologram, and the broadcast network activates conveniently. No on-page reversal forces Elias to choose between competing goods or accept a visible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.1)
    Dominant stake—silencing the prophecy—is signaled early. Escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as intensifying description (dewdrops cascade, mist thickens, prophecy "fights back") but no on-page reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off. The saxophone's "negative space" method and Elias's whispered hush are asserted to bind the prophecy, yet the prophecy's resistance is told ("murmurs rose," "code unraveling") without dramatized pressure that alters his tactics. The ending smile and departure lack visible cost; the "faint tremor" is atmospheric, not a consequence that reweights his stance.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=3.6)
    A single dominant stake is signaled early (decode leaves to mend the arbor), but no on-page tightening or reversal narrows options or raises cost. The sylph's emergence grants Lir immediate allies and clarity rather than complicating his path, and the resolution ("gather forgotten seeds") is delivered via exposition rather than earned through protagonist agency under pressure. Coincidence (the leaf falling "today") triggers the climax, not Lir's decisions. No visible price is paid, and the ending summarizes success without dramatizing a trade-off or foreclosed alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can embrace unpredictability—is signaled early and tightens when coincidence becomes pattern. Pressure accumulates through layered clues (watches, compass, greenhouse, chest) rather than a confrontation with clear alternative paths. The final journals reweight the goal from treasure to philosophy, but no on-page decision forces Elias to sacrifice a competing want or resource. Under the accumulative lens one deepening suffices, yet the cost remains conceptual rather than felt in tactics or relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (redeem Thorne's name and free him) is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the first coin-spin tilts Libra's scales downward, revealing the name's crushing weight, but Elara's response—mixing volatile opposites, tracing cracks—meets no resistance or complication. The second spin balances without cost, and Thorne's release feels granted rather than earned by a trade-off. The ritual's success arrives as resolution, not a choice that forecloses a path; no visible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake: capturing and healing Harlan's lost soul. The story signals this early and maintains focus, but pressure is static—Elara pursues, plays, and succeeds without meaningful resistance or cost. There is no on-page reversal or tightening that narrows options; Harlan's final laughter feels like the natural endpoint of Elara's method rather than a hard-won turn. The pursuit is described as relentless, yet no obstacle forces Elara to adapt tactics or sacrifice something tangible. The ending's "bittersweet burden" is told rather than dramatized with a visible, felt price at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—discovering the mathematics of mercy—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No on-page reversal narrows her options; she intends to remember, she remembers via convulsions, she reads etchings, she rises. The trauma flashbacks are sequential exposition, not escalating pressure that forces a trade-off. Agency at closure is absent: the forest "computed her release" and she simply "rose," with no visible cost or path foreclosed by her decision.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—unfastening the lens to preserve histories—is declared but never tested by on-page opposition or cost. Elara "approached," "scanned," "whispered," and "unfastened" in a sequence of unopposed actions; no reversal, no tightening choice, no visible trade-off. The "eternal instant" framing implies suspended time, yet this also flattens escalation: nothing narrows options or raises stakes because the outcome is preordained from the opening. Pressure is asserted ("her heart raced") rather than built through agency under constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: discover what the ceiling hides, release the trapped ghosts. Pressure accumulates through observation (dust patterns, ceiling cracks, ghost gestures) toward the grate reveal, but escalation is linear—each clue leads to the next without a reversal or complicating choice. The mainspring barrel's discovery and the key inside provide a tightening, yet Theo never risks anything or trades one good for another; he simply completes the task. The ghost moans and vision provide emotional color but do not force a tactical shift. Cost is implied (burden lifts fractionally), but the stakes remain intellectual curiosity rather than a high-wire moral or survival calculus.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—Elias's desire to "compress eternity"—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when the frost scribes "rupture" and Elias acts, but the escalation is atmospheric rather than driven by protagonist agency facing narrowing options. Coincidence (the frost's decree) initiates the turn; Elias's choice to uncork feels more like fulfilling a script than risking a live tradeoff. Cost is conceptual (the library falls) but not personal or felt on the page in a way that forecloses Elias's own path.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—Elias reclaiming revolutionary purpose via the shard—is signaled early and pursued through the heist. One meaningful pressure point occurs when he enters the vault and lifts the shard, but the escalation from theft to destruction happens off-pressure; no on-page reversal forces the pivot. The scholars' pursuit ("burst in") arrives too late to test Elias's commitment in real time. Cost is legible (shard destroyed, narrative dispersed) but the tightening lacks a live choice under competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake (reclaim stolen light, save daughter) is signaled early, but escalation is flat: Elias diagnoses the frequency clash and applies the fix without resistance, error, or competing pressure. No meaningful reversal or choice narrows options; the covenant's rust threat dissolves the moment he acts. The protagonist's expertise removes rather than creates friction. One tightening occurs (rust flakes away → light floods in), but no visible price is paid—stamina, risk, or forfeiture—that would meet the band guardrail for 8.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=4.6)
    One dominant stake—finding the realm beyond logic—is signaled early but remains abstract and never tested by opposition or trade-off. The compass visions gift Elara the solution; no reversal or tightening narrows her options. Pulling the three hinges occurs without friction; the expedition guardians approve her arrival rather than challenge it. The lagoon "claimed" the prior explorers but poses no threat to Elara. Resolution is passive: she collects essence, ascends, and continues her quest with "newfound weight" but no cost legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—escaping isolation after GPS failure—is signaled early. The magic lantern discovery provides a reversal, but no meaningful escalation follows: Mira and Kai offer techniques and blueprints without demanding a trade-off or testing Elara's commitment. The resolution (a lantern-sculpture compass) solves the problem the slide introduced, not one Elara helped create. Luck (finding the slide) provides the solution rather than protagonist agency narrowing options or forcing a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding why flowers bloom at night—is signaled early but never tested on the page. No reversal, tightening, or deepening narrows Elara's options; each glass layer she uncovers adds information without consequence or cost. The climactic "dawning" realization arrives through reflection and metaphor rather than protagonist agency: Elara does not choose, renounce, or endure anything that forecloses a path. Pressure remains flat across the arc, and coincidence (the inherited postcards, the cathedral's proximity) enables discovery without struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—uncover the purge's hidden toll—is signaled early and tightens once when Elias must prove lineage via debris-oath, narrowing his options under duress. The guardians' demand and his compliance constitute one meaningful turn, and the cost (eternal entrapment if he fails) is declared but only felt obliquely. Escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as density increase (searing visions, debris rearrangement) rather than because/therefore linkage. Agency is undercut by spectator framing ("compelled to witness," "trapped vision"), and the resolution hinges on spectral approval rather than protagonist decision, capping the band near mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"to reimagine an entire civilization"—is declared early but never tightened by an on-page reversal or cost that narrows options. Elias conceives, the essences solidify, and the town revives in a single unbroken arc with no setback, complication, or visible price. The phantoms' temptation is waved away in one line; no competing desire, no stamina drain, no material or social sacrifice alters his tactics. Closure delivers the outcome announced at the outset, with no felt trade-off or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—archiving emotional patterns—is signaled early and remains coherent, but escalation is minimal: Elias performs his ritual, the shaving emits a prophecy, and he ponders his next oath without a meaningful tightening of options or visible trade-off. The prophecy arrives via the artifact rather than through Elias's agency under pressure, and his final pondering ("not to record, but perhaps to immerse himself") reads as contemplation rather than a forced choice with legible cost. One micro-turn exists (bubbles to coherent utterance) but it deepens texture rather than narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: reopen the vortex or lose the lineage's borrowed time. One tightening occurs when Elara positions the cap and places seeds to bind the vortex's edges, narrowing the path to a single ritual method. Yet the escalation is largely procedural—she performs steps without visible tradeoff or a moment where she must choose between competing goods. The ending declares victory ("proving preservation's triumph over decay") without showing what she gave up or what path she foreclosed. Accumulative lens allows this, but the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—warnings for brewing storms—is signaled early and Elias's choice (bell over siren) narrows options with a stated consequence (villages heed the bell, allowing calm action). However, the escalation is declarative rather than dramatized: the microclimate anomaly appears on cue at midnight, the glue has conveniently dried, and no live complication forces Elias to weigh competing costs in the moment. The storm "breaks against the clouds" but villagers respond off-page; we are told they thrived, not shown a trade-off or near-miss that tests his method. Agency exists but feels illustrative of a pre-set thesis rather than forged under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—finding strength in vulnerability—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. The on-page action (tracing star paths, empathizing) does not narrow options or impose a visible cost; Elias's memories surface without altering present tactics. The story delivers a moment of realization but no tightening that forecloses a path. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is required; the ending asserts bloomed strength without demonstrating a trade-off or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—preserving the covenant's silence to allow oasis renewal—is signaled by midpoint. Pressure deepens when the recluse realizes the pact binds him perpetually, not just the ghosts. However, escalation is driven by ghost instruction and the box's mechanics rather than protagonist agency or a forced trade-off. The recluse never chooses between competing goods or pays a visible price that alters later tactics; he complies and accepts. The ending's "heavier with fresh purpose" is told rather than dramatized, so cost legibility is muted. Under the Accumulative lens one meaningful tightening is sufficient, but agency and on-page cost clarity fall short of higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding time's texture—is declared early but never tested by a live choice that narrows options. The garage-sale message method appears mid-story yet does not create a reversal or tightening; responses "trickle in" off-page and guide him to rediscover the fragment without cost. Opening the capsule and pressing the fragment to his chest are passive actions; no want conflicts with fear, no trade-off is visible. The ending announces a new role ("weaver") without showing the price of broadcasting or the tactical shift that dispensing fragments will demand.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—launching the repaired kite as an act of "tending" beauty—is signaled early but never escalates. The string snaps, yet Elias feels "anticipation" rather than loss, immediately defusing pressure. No meaningful reversal or tightening occurs; repair materials are conveniently at hand, and the mended kite flies despite asymmetry. Agency is present (he chooses to repair) but the action forecloses no path and incurs no visible cost; onlookers arrive only to affirm his success.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—fostering interspecies respect—is declared in exposition rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or on-page resistance. Elias encounters no opposition; trees "trembled as if sensing," stone "hummed back," and pilgrims arrive post-mortem to instantly accept the revelation, collapsing any potential escalation. The wiring proceeds as planned across "days... weeks" in montage summary with no reversal, setback, or trade-off that forces a tactical pivot. Cost is asserted ("pain clawed his gut," "body weakened") but never shapes a choice—he completes the work on schedule, and the ending rewards him with immortality ("his spirit lingered") rather than a visible forfeiture. Coincidence drives closure: pilgrims simply show up because "the orchard thrummed," not because Elias's agency made their arrival possible or necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—decode alien homecoming chemistry—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through footprints, rival data, and the trio's arrival, but escalation is largely off-stage (drone hacks, illicit scans) or summarized. The tower activation delivers data passively via projection; no on-page choice narrows Elara's options or forces a trade-off. The ending reweights the concept thematically but does not dramatize a visible price—formula acquisition happens without loss, making the tightening more conceptual than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—restore the concord, let garden reclaim battlefield—is signaled early and coheres. One meaningful tightening occurs when the birds' calls guide Thorne to "where blood pooled deepest," narrowing his method. However, the escalation is informational (deciphering tablet, understanding birds) rather than pressured choice; Thorne never confronts a trade-off, obstacle, or cost that alters his tactics. The resolution unfolds as ritual completion rather than protagonist agency under duress, and the visible price (departing, no return mentioned) is implied rather than dramatized with forfeited options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake (translate distance into closeness) is signaled early and drives the trek. One meaningful tightening occurs when the riddle solution points to Mira's location. However, the trek itself faces no reversal or tactical complication—Elias walks, finds her, and accepts her changed state without visible forfeit of an alternative path. The reunion offers emotional closure but no on-page price that narrows future options; "no more distance" declares resolution rather than dramatizing what was sacrificed to achieve it.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—navigating isolation post-shutdown—is signaled early but never tightens meaningfully. The discovery of the rift is not a reversal earned by protagonist choice; it appears as Elara sketches, and she immediately accepts it without friction or second option. No visible price is paid for entering the rift (station abandonment is pre-existing, not a cost she incurs), and the final beat ("she stood on alien soil") lands as fulfillment without trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake (realign the stars by swapping the queen) is signaled early, and the "wrong sky" frames urgency, but on-page escalation is minimal: Elarion approaches, lifts the piece, endures visions, laughs, smashes the corrupted queen, and succeeds. The visions and tendrils are declared obstacles but do not narrow options or force a visible trade-off—he treats horror as "a riddle to unravel" and the resolution is nearly immediate. One tightening occurs (swap triggers alarm, visions assail) but the cost is not legible; no live alternative is foreclosed, and the protagonist's agency does not visibly shape the outcome under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—Thorne's need to unbind the penumbra to reclaim his archive—is signaled early and drives the ritual. Pressure accumulates as each spelled word draws the penumbra closer to the chessboard, but escalation is textural (words layering, whispers multiplying) rather than a tightening that forecloses options or raises a visible cost. The penumbra's detachment feels inevitable rather than hard-won; no reversal or tactical adjustment tests Thorne's commitment. The final act—spelling "unbind"—is a completion of the ritual, not a decision under duress that alters tactics or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: recover the shape of home. The stone discovery and glyph-tracing provide progression, but escalation is iterative rather than tightening—each glyph unlocks more without raising visible cost or narrowing Elara's options until the final beat. The climax states that "home was the labyrinth itself" but does not dramatize a trade-off or a live consequence. Agency is present but feels guided by the stone's mechanics rather than Elara's contradictory choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—self-forgiveness—is signaled early and sustained, but escalation is metaphorical rather than tactical: Elias decodes threads, traces chess notation, and "winnows ruthlessly," yet these actions do not narrow live options or impose a visible trade-off. The climax is a mental realization ("to winnow the self-pity from necessity") followed by a chess metaphor ("pawn to king seven"), with no on-page reversal or felt cost that forecloses a path. The resolution occurs in his mind while the external world simply resumes, and the story tells us he is "no longer exiled in spirit" rather than dramatizing a choice with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—disrupting the elders' forgiveness ritual—is declared early but pressure does not escalate causally. The poetry sessions accumulate verses (Accumulative lens), yet no on-page reversal forces a trade-off or narrows Elara's options; "elders' spies" appear passively and do not intervene. Closure asserts that "the ritual would falter" and "truths would never unify again," but these outcomes are told, not shown. No visible cost or agency-driven choice at the ending reweights stakes; Elara's final smile and dream state victory without dramatized consequence or sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—survival and meaning-conjuring—is signaled early, but escalation is ornamental: the acid sea "surges" and "devours" in repeated assertions without narrowing options or forcing trade-offs. The five pockmark matches proceed identically (trace, narrate, glow, memory montage) with no complication or cost; the protagonist never hesitates, risks a wrong match, or sacrifices anything tangible. The statue's climactic opening and barge-lifting arrive via coincidence (the charm fuses to the core) rather than protagonist agency. No on-page reversal or tightening alters tactics; pressure is declared ("oblivion loomed") but not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: to fulfill the hidden promise by completing the painted seashell in the oasis, preserving the memory of lost youth and love. The pressure accumulates texturally—mirror cracks signal fate's impatience, twilight descent to the caves, wrong turn, oasis discovery—but there is no meaningful reversal or tightening choice that forecloses a path. Elias kneels, paints, completes, raises the shell, and witnesses the holographic visions in sequence; the "reveal" is a completion, not a decision under pressure. The cost is conceptual ("temporary eternity … destined to dissolve") and narrated rather than dramatized through a visible trade-off or renunciation. One textural deepening (faded oils to completed design) is present but agency remains observational at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—proving whispers beat shouts to win Mira back—is signaled early but resolved by the vial's magic rather than Elias's agency or a trade-off that tests his claim. No meaningful escalation occurs; he simply uncorks the vial, whispers, and Mira arrives without friction, doubt, or complication. The heat wave's prior violence is told in summary ("shouts had shattered glass") rather than dramatized, and the ending cost is invisible—Elias recorks the vial "tenderly" with no visible sacrifice or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—calling the lost home—is signaled early and tightens through the nightly build sequence. Escalation reads as density increase: moon phases align, calls grow denser, the structure rises, culminating in the beacon's ignition. The closure image (villages flickering, returnees drawn) forecloses the path of isolation with cost (his tears, his ongoing solitude). One weakness: external voices script each step, reducing the protagonist's on-page trade-offs; the cost of his labor (exhaustion, scars aching) is told more than dramatized in a pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—psychological safety versus involuntary truth—is signaled early and drives Elias's choice to insert the eye. One meaningful tightening occurs when he tests the occlusion on Lira and Thom, narrowing his path forward. However, escalation is compressed: the ritual itself lacks visible resistance or complication, and the cost is reflected upon rather than paid in a forfeited relationship or immediate consequence. The closure reconfigures his stance but does so through internal monologue rather than a dramatized turn.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—decode the stranger's gesture—is signaled early and drives the investigation sequence. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elias realizes the gaps encode shared isolation rather than betrayal. Agency is present: Elias chooses to probe absences, then to pin the boutonnière and own the vigil. Cost is conceptual (foregoing solitude for sentinel duty) but legible in the final image. Escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as density increase via layered memories, though the middle "he began to investigate" beat summarizes rather than dramatizes pressure, softening the tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—honoring his father's promise—is signaled early but never tested by a live on-page trade-off. The rising creek provides urgency in the cavern sequence, yet Elias never sacrifices, risks, or loses anything concrete to reach the Doorway; the ants' trail is followed without error or cost. The closure asserts fulfillment ("promise dissolved") without showing what path was foreclosed or what price was paid.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—ending the dreams' tyranny—is signaled early and pursued through the climb. The ascent itself tightens physical peril (thinning air, jagged stone), and the grotto offers temptation ("power unbound"). Yet the pivotal choice—touching the pool—arrives without visible trade-off or consequence in the moment; the "sacrifice" and "vengeful grace" are asserted in summary rather than shown as a foreclosed path. One meaningful tightening occurs (the council's warning → defiant climb), but agency at closure feels narrated rather than enacted with legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—capturing "density of presence"—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or complication. Lirien arrives with the solution already prepared, pours her palette into the shell, and the alchemy succeeds without reversal or trade-off. Thorne's grin and the glowing pearl constitute announcement rather than earned tightening. No live option is foreclosed, no visible price paid, and coincidence (the nexus "approving," the secret "igniting" the alchemy) resolves the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: distilling chaos into narrative, signaled early and sustained. The jealousy-triggered flight is a meaningful deepening that reweights Elara's relationship to her past selves, and the mid-air inscription on the scroll tightens pressure. Yet the resolution—landing, scroll complete, ready for the next dreamer—feels more like a return to baseline than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Under the Accumulative lens, the cadence shift is legible, but the price paid (what does she lose by accepting this cycle?) lacks the sharp edge required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—repairing the clock and uncovering its story—is signaled early but escalation remains minimal: Elara encounters the screw, infers its history through reflection, extracts it, and completes the repair without friction or tradeoff. No live choice narrows options or forces a visible cost. The Miriam flashback provides thematic weight but does not test Elara's agency on the page. Under an Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is required; here the screw's identification reweights meaning but does not compel a decision with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—pass the rite or face exile—is signaled early, and the crystallizing scars provide escalating physical pressure. The quill invocation and rune inscription constitute protagonist agency. Yet the sequence feels additive rather than narrowing: each scar inscription succeeds without complication, and the final state grants both "transformed scars" and guild triumph with no visible trade-off. The piece delivers one meaningful tightening (scars crystallize, she must act) but the resolution does not foreclose a path or exact a legible price.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake (deliver apology before the trees are cut) is signaled early, but escalation is thin: Elara simply uncorks the bottle, Theo appears, she speaks, he forgives. No reversal or tightening choice narrows her options; the "imperfect miracle" flickers bulbs and scorches paper without imposing a trade-off or visible price that alters her stance. The orchard deadline never pressures her actions on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.8)
    The dominant stake—unifying the cosmos—is declared early, but escalation is absent. Elowen opens the dictionary, reads entries, walks outward/inward, and the universe unifies without reversal, tightening, or cost. The "hiccup" functions as an arbitrary clock rather than a pressure that narrows options. No live decision forecloses a path; the final dozen paragraphs loop through synonyms for resolution ("illusions unraveled," "fractures knit," "unity endured") without demonstrating agency or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding the erratic horizon readings—is signaled early, and the key insertion creates one meaningful tightening when visions flood and the clock projects holograms. However, the escalation lacks a genuine tradeoff; Elias faces no resistance, danger, or cost in his investigation. The resolution (withdrawing the key, logging the correction) happens without sacrifice or consequence, and the statement "no more eminently peculiar keys needed" tells rather than shows closure. Agency is present but pressure dissipates rather than tightening toward the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—Elena seeking to understand and responsibly honor her father's legacy—is signaled early and sustained. The subway traversal provides forward motion, but each scrawl simply points to the next step without complicating her path or forcing a trade-off. The climactic discovery of the manuscript does not narrow options or test her commitment; she decides to publish it "responsibly" without dramatizing what she gives up or risks. The escalation reads as a linear reveal rather than a tightening under pressure, and the cost at closure is told rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Elias's mission to teach severance as renewal—is signaled early and the accumulative design shows Mira moving from desperation to resolve. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias hangs up mid-plea, foreclosing the bond. Yet the escalation reads as a told trajectory rather than on-page pressure that narrows live options: Mira's vulnerability "peaked" off-stage, her final call arrives pre-resolved ("not in desperation, but resolve"), and Elias's satisfaction bypasses any visible trade-off. The "endless loop" frame suggests iterative cost but the closure beat itself shows no new constraint or forfeited path—just a smile and the next caller, implying stasis without felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—renewing the covenant with her deceased partner—is signaled early. Pressure remains static: Elara follows a ritual sequence without meaningful resistance or cost. The "gently thorough" layering of petals and the steep action unfold as planned; no reversal tests her commitment. The climax (spectral form rising, covenant sealed) is gift rather than earned alteration. The piece declares weight ("the weight of small moments") but does not dramatize a trade-off or foreclosed option on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake (cure for loneliness) is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the rock is passed and stories are exchanged, narrowing options toward communal bonds. However, the escalation is told in summary ("rumor chains ignited," "each touch sparked reciprocities") rather than dramatized beat-by-beat with visible tradeoffs. No live choice forecloses a path with on-page cost; Elias's shift from elusive to lingering is declared but not earned through a decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (reach the stillpoint to chart inner depths) is signaled early but pressure remains environmental (following the trail) rather than a tightening that forecloses options. The rival's warning ("devours the unworthy") introduces doubt but Elar presses on without a visible trade-off or tactical shift. The climax is a vision-gift rather than a choice under duress; the ring's purpose is "fulfilled" passively. No credible loss (time, stamina, tool failure, or social cost) alters tactics mid-journey. The ending renunciation (removing the ring) carries no prior resistance or cost-preview, reading as ceremonial rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=4.4)
    The dominant stake—correcting the planting mistake—is signaled early, but escalation is absent: Elara grasps the pen, unbends it, writes edits, and each edit succeeds without complication or cost. No live reversal or tightening narrows her options; the anomaly "shudders," "softens," and "settles" in a smooth downward arc. The piece gestures at "balance" and "new contingencies" but never dramatizes a trade-off or price on the page—colleagues are saved, isolation becomes brief, and Elara feels only "strange comfort." Agency is procedural (she writes) rather than a choice between competing goods or unavoidable harms.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—Finn's desire to be remembered—is signaled early but never tightened by a live obstacle or forced trade-off. Elara proposes disruption, they perform, and the crowd converts instantly; no reversal, no tactical cost, no adaptation when initial methods fail. The claimed "joyful sorrow" and tears are told outcomes, not pressures that narrow options. Agency is absent: the protagonists act, but nothing on the page resists or costs them a visible price before the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—fulfill Theo's promise to preserve the archive's knowledge—is signaled early and sustained. The trail of artistic creations provides a sequence of discoveries that tighten focus, and the vandalized portrait moment ("piecing the slashes like a puzzle") narrows her path. Yet escalation relies on revelation rather than rising opposition; once Elara finds each clue, the next appears without cost or trade-off. The vault discovery resolves the quest but no on-page choice at closure forces her to sacrifice an alternative path or endure a visible price. Agency at the end is renunciation of arson-fueled destruction in favor of guardianship, but the shift is told ("her volcanic tenderness a hearth now") rather than dramatized through a decision that forecloses options.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Elara's refusal of "scripted docility" and her drive to realize the shared dream. Pressure escalates through drumming intensity (thighs, harness, air, water) and culminates in Kai's resurrection and their submersion. The tightening narrows options—she must act tonight, under starlight, before handlers arrive—but the cost is more poetic than tactical. Handlers' alarms appear late as external threat without prior setup, reducing earned tension. Agency is present but the reversal feels partially granted by the lagoon's magic rather than fully earned by prior sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—proving whispers outlast shouts—is signaled early and tested on the page. One meaningful tightening occurs when Harlan's shouts scatter while Elias's whispers arrive intact, narrowing the race. Yet the escalation is largely environmental (storm effects) rather than protagonist-driven trade-offs; Elias encounters no credible loss or tactical cost. The unlock at the Heart feels like applying prior knowledge rather than a high-stakes choice with visible price. Harlan's forfeit is recounted, not dramatized as a felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—teaching darkness the value of stars—is signaled early but remains abstract and declarative. Umbra's presence poses no active opposition or escalating cost; the weaving proceeds without setback, error, or tactical adjustment. The ending asserts transformation ("Umbra's form softened") without an on-page reversal or choice that narrows options. Agency and felt price are absent, failing the escalation test under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—to plant "forests of second thoughts"—is signaled early but remains metaphorical rather than tested by on-page opposition. No credible antagonist appears; the Council guards "pause" without dramatized consequence. The synchronized displays constitute one meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens, but the rebellion's success is summarized ("seeds had taken") rather than shown through a visible price or narrowed option. Coincidence does not resolve, yet agency is passive: Elias orchestrates without friction, and the ending asserts rather than earns transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.6)
    One dominant stake is signaled early: freedom from the tethered life. The scrimshaw's discovery is the inciting incident, and the whale's call provides escalation, but the middle lacks meaningful tightening—no live option is tested or foreclosed. The rope-cutting climax is a physical task rather than a choice under competing pressures. The Cataclysm's prohibition on violence is told but never tested on the page; we see "words clashed like swords sheathed in velvet" but no moment where the mystic fog constrains a choice or forces a tactical adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—cultivating lightness in grief through performance—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the whittling and narration cycle, but no on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows live options; the protagonist begins performing and ends performing with the same commitment. The mercy-killing backstory adds moral weight but remains a static frame rather than a present dilemma. The final talisman-gathering registers as deepening rather than a turn that forecloses a path, meeting the Accumulative lens minimum but lacking visible agency cost.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.8)
    Dominant stake signaled early: to stride through boundaries once thought sacred. No meaningful tightening occurs; the poet paraphrases verse, boundaries yield without resistance, and he crosses successfully in a smooth escalation with no reversal or trade-off. The ban's lifting removes the only potential obstacle before the story begins, leaving no on-page antagonistic pressure. Agency is present (he chooses to paraphrase) but cost is absent—nothing is risked, lost, or foreclosed. The tremor of certainty functions as confirmation rather than a complicating turn.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—awaken Mira—is signaled early and pursued through plant-code communication and the phoenix barter. Escalation occurs when the phoenix counters Elias's plea by demanding his sight, forcing a trade-off. However, the resolution undercuts pressure: Elias's "innocently cunning twist" (blowing an imperfect note instead of offering sight) bypasses the announced cost without visible sacrifice, and the phoenix accepts for reasons that feel thematic rather than motivated ("deeming the imperfect melody worthier than stolen clarity"). The final image restores collaboration without on-page loss.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.5)
    One dominant stake is signaled: to reclaim connection's texture. Pressure accumulates through chamber progression, and small reversals appear ("hollow" laughter forces lens adjustment; grief "lances" her). But escalation is atmospheric rather than tactical—no live option is foreclosed, no resource spent, no relationship altered. The pilgrimage is declared "artificial" yet operates as ritual without genuine obstacle. Cost at closure is thematic ("scarred, resonant grit") rather than a visible forfeiture that narrows her future.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—reviving fading stars—is declared early but never tested by opposition or scarcity. Elara's method (crafting origami with coordinates) succeeds without friction, failure, or tactical adjustment; each figure works, stars respond, no reversal tightens options. The inferred lens (Accumulative) requires density increase or cadence shift that reweights cost; instead, "nights blurred" summarizes repetition without dramatized deepening. Agency is execution of a preordained solution rather than choice under competing pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—mapping cultural patterns to warn against future manias—is signaled early and restated at closure. Theo's arrival and letter confession introduce new information, but the pressure remains expository: he recounts the grandmother's foresight, Elara responds by executing the tarot method, and the spread reveals a resurgence pattern. No live decision narrows options or imposes a visible trade-off; the characters move from question to answer without tactical friction or cost. The "inherited duty" is accepted without dramatized resistance or forfeiture, and the final image declares success ("map reborn") without on-page consequence that alters their stance or world.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake—"to pierce the veil of history's lies"—is declared early but remains abstract throughout. Elara's "early attempts failed miserably" and then she "adapted" by "shunning routine," but these moves are summarized in a single paragraph without on-page reversals that narrow options or raise cost. The pagoda's repulsion and later acceptance occur off-stage between summary beats. The final choice to "scatter her own nostalgia's atoms" is told rather than tested; no prior complication or trade-off makes this decision feel constrained. Escalation reads as tell-only intensifiers ("anguish clawed her," "torrent of atoms") without causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—preserve hope's shape—is signaled early and the shadow's spread creates rising pressure. The video-comparison method provides a concrete tightening beat. Yet escalation is largely declarative: "The library trembled, petals curling inward" tells rather than shows resistance. The stone ritual resolves the problem without meaningful reversal or trade-off dramatized on the page; we learn the outcome ("orbs steadied") without witnessing Elara navigate cost in real time. Agency at closure is passive transformation rather than a decision that forecloses a live option with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—reconstructing fragile convictions—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. Elara's process is metaphorical ("shedding layers") without on-page escalation or a choice that narrows options; each layer peeled feels like reiteration rather than a turn that forecloses a path. The decision to alert authorities tomorrow is mentioned but not dramatized, leaving the peak moment as resolved reflection rather than a tightening under pressure. No reversal or trade-off with visible cost appears; the chameleon's regeneration parallels her arc but does not force a decision.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—learning to read scars for closure—is signaled early, but the escalation feels more thematic than tactical. The tunnel action narrows her path physically, yet the plants' guidance removes much of the decision weight; she follows their directions rather than making agonizing trade-offs. The coffee-ring divination and reopened surgical wound suggest cost, but the wound's consequences (pain, bleeding) don't visibly alter her tactics or force a renunciation. The letters provide emotional closure, but the discovery feels handed to her rather than earned through a choice that forecloses a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—finding where unused love is stored—is signaled early and shapes Elara's climb and contact with the film. Pressure accumulates through sensory layering (lyrics searching, thunder syncing, visions blooming) but there is no visible tightening or choice that forecloses an option. She finds the box unopposed; the discovery itself is the event. The "unused love" migrates into her without cost or struggle, and the final projection is resolution without trade-off. One deepening (discovery of Eliza's letters and their spatial echo) is present, but escalation is atmospheric rather than driven by protagonist agency or narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (freeing trapped creativity) is signaled early, but pressure remains static: Elara traces falling stars repeatedly without a reversal or tightening that narrows her options. The resolution (creativity surges upon waking) is declared rather than earned by a choice with visible cost; rest is prescribed by the auroras rather than chosen against competing needs. No trade-off or forfeiture appears on the page, and the iterative structure (meteor after meteor) lacks escalation under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: to cultivate sparks in unlit corners, signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the guard lifts the clock and "purpose blooms within," narrowing his role from passive freight-tender to active nurturer. The archive's awakening ("visions cascade") presents a reversal that changes his knowledge and options. Agency is present but operates at a symbolic register—"charms," "wave functions bend"—rather than through concrete forfeiture or physical trade-off. The cost is conceptual (dreamless stasis breaks) but not viscerally felt on the page. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, and the final image reweights the opening state, but the escalation lacks sharp on-page friction or a moment where the guard must sacrifice one live option for another.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming mental wilderness—is signaled early but never tested through genuine on-page dilemmas; Elias follows the hum passively, and "probable miracles" (ferncoil bridge) remove obstacles rather than forcing trade-offs. The unraveling-the-wire act at the corewheel reads as a single low-friction move with no visible cost or alternative foreclosed. The escalation consists of thematic deepening (arboreal symphonies reveal suppressed memories) rather than a choice that narrows options or changes knowledge under the inferred Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dominant stake—finding unused courage—is signaled early but never tested by a trade-off or narrowed choice. The guides lead Elara through loops without visible cost or tactical shift; doubt is mentioned ("when doubt made her falter") but not dramatized as a reversal that changes options. The tidal pool revelation is handed to her rather than earned through protagonist agency. No on-page price alters tactics; the journey accumulates atmosphere but not escalating pressure under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding the cost of safety—is signaled early. The bolt discovery provides one meaningful tightening, but Elias's decision to remain after the revelation lacks agency-driven escalation; he witnesses Thorne's grief and mirrors it without a visible trade-off or foreclosed path. The "nerve regeneration complete, not just nerves, but soul" resolution is declared rather than earned through a choice that alters tactics or options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—unmask the pretender—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates through the drift of loyalty and spies drawing nearer, with one meaningful tightening when the final book reaches the pretender during coronation. However, the climactic sundering is told ("truths cascaded—forged scrolls exposed") rather than shown, and Lirion's own agency at closure is observation rather than decisive action. The cost is conceptual (empire's graceful collapse) but summarized, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—discovering why shipping paths disappeared—is signaled early and pursued through assembling data fragments. Pressure accumulates as Elias gathers holodisks, aligns overlays, and incorporates core samples, but the escalation is methodical rather than urgent; no live obstacle or ticking cost forces trade-offs. The revelation that reefs destabilized gyres is a knowledge gain, not a choice that forecloses an option, and the broadcast decision feels like sharing knowledge rather than paying a price. One meaningful deepening occurs when he realizes "not end, but metamorphosis," reweighting his witness role, but the cost remains conceptual rather than visceral on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake ("discover meaning") is signaled early but remains abstract; no on-page tightening forces a trade-off or narrows options. The stone circle's hum resolves the rebellion's lull without Elara making a decision that costs her something visible—she kneels, receives visions, and the problem solves itself. Coincidence (ancient relic conveniently broadcasts the signal) drives the outcome rather than protagonist agency. No meaningful escalation under any lens; pressure is declared ("gnawed at her," "doubt") but not dramatized through choices that alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—evolve tradition to prevent ecosystem collapse—is signaled early but remains abstract until the final paragraph. The single tightening occurs when the plants reveal the kite's instructions and Mira chooses to unseal the embryo, but no live option is visibly foreclosed; the councils' rigid customs are mentioned but never dramatized as immediate opposition. The cost (shattering the amber seal, merging fluids with the spring) is physical but its emotional or relational price is absent—no council member protests, no ally questions her, no personal fear surfaces. Pressure coheres under the Causal lens but does not narrow options before the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: processing trauma without erasure. The freeze is a clear tightening (wind-whine narrows her world to survival response), and the decision to share the photograph with the visitor marks a shift. Yet that final choice arrives without visible prior friction—Elena's move from solitary freeze to mentorship feels smooth rather than forced by an on-page dilemma or cost, weakening escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—restoring Elias's artistic vision—is signaled early, but pressure never tightens through protagonist agency or a reversal that narrows options. The tarot cards and threads are untangled without cost or complication; no on-page obstacle resists him, no choice forecloses an alternative. The "walls closing in" reads as atmospheric metaphor rather than a live constraint that forces a trade-off. Under the inferred Accumulative lens, the pattern lacks a meaningful deepening or cadence shift that reweights the stake with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding time's warp in crisis—is signaled early but remains conceptual; the scene pressure comes from Mira's disappearance, a secondary event. Elowen's agency at the key turn (crushing the drone, stepping into the ink) is reactive and lacks a visible trade-off or cost on the page. The void journey replays past crisis imagery but does not narrow options or force a choice. Mira's explanation ("Crisis inks the soul…") tells the answer rather than dramatizing a discovery that changes tactics, and the return happens off-stage without earned consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—whether to transmit the letter and awaken the networks—is signaled early and remains coherent. The glitching monitor provides an on-page reversal, but Elara's decision follows swiftly without a visible tightening of options or a trade-off made legible. The consequence (alarms topside, scandal, network awakening) is declared in future tense rather than dramatized as immediate cost. No persistent constraint (stamina, tool, social credit) shapes her tactics; the safeguards are overridden with "archivist's intimate knowledge" in a single beat. The escalation reads as assertion rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—preserving the farm—is signaled early, and the looter intrusion provides one escalation. Yet Elara's agency is undercut by the roses' autonomous action (thorns trip, pollen calms) rather than her own difficult trade-off. The sheathing of the dagger is framed as a vow but costs her nothing on the page; the plants immediately validate her choice. No visible price (stamina, injury, lost time, social consequence) alters her tactics or charges the final image. The escalation reads as setup → magical resolution rather than protagonist-driven tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=5.1)
    Dominant stake (catch the goddess's echo) is signaled early. The constellations' disruption provides a tightening moment when the echo surges forth. However, escalation lacks protagonist-driven trade-offs; the echo "darted" and Elias "tracked" with "fisher's instinct," then succeeds by voicing silence. No on-page cost or foreclosed option accompanies the capture. The story tells us he "hauled gently" and secured the prize without visible sacrifice or friction.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—defending her father's legacy—is signaled early, but escalation is flat. Elara faces no meaningful opposition; Thorne's reversal is immediate once she begins her proof. The "proof by contradiction" tightens logic on the page but does not force Elara to sacrifice or trade off competing goods. Coincidence does not resolve, but neither does protagonist agency drive the key turn—Thorne simply capitulates. Cost at closure is conceptual (redemption for the empire) but not felt in Elara's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—hushing Elias's guilt over the baby's death—is signaled early but never faces a genuine test or tightening. The letters provide complete instructions, the amber slots in "instantly," and the firmware "whirs" to completion without complication or agency-driven choice. Coincidence (finding the letters, the lab's temporal warp folding his satchel into reach) resolves rather than complicates. No visible price is paid; the resolution is asserted completion rather than earned through a trade-off that forecloses a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—transforming communal fracture into emergent hush through Elara's art—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure escalates when the group's confessions peak and threaten ritual collapse, then Elara interjects with the mandala's resonance to achieve the hush. However, her agency in the climactic turn is passive: the mandala "begins to spread" the hush on its own via acoustic magic rather than through a high-cost choice she makes under duress. The tile flake introduces new information (past confessions) but Elara's decision to place it at the center lacks visible sacrifice or foreclosed alternative. The resolution feels authored for thematic effect rather than earned through protagonist struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—freeing the plaza from Kael's rule via aberrant mercy—is signaled early. One tightening occurs when Elara whispers the new name, forcing retrocognitive floods to hit Kael. However, the resolution depends on the tessera's mystical pulse rather than Elara's agency under pressure; she kneels, touches, whispers, and the magic does the rest. No visible trade-off or foreclosed path appears; Kael's tears and the survivors' tentative approach declare change without on-page cost. The piece tells us "aberrant mercy reigned" rather than showing what was sacrificed to cradle empathy in steel.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake is Elena's recovery from despair/scandal. One tightening occurs when she steps onto the stage and sings, allowing synesthetic echoes to show alternate timelines. Yet this moment lacks visible cost or trade-off; she simply participates and the orchard responds favorably. The ghost's urging ("Join me") presents an invitation but no противоstand resistance or consequence. The resolution—booking a new gig—is recounted as fait accompli without on-page negotiation or forfeiture of another path.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—proving whether post-pill telepathy is real or illusion—is signaled early and tightens through three exposures, each raising the test's rigor. The blind test meaningfully narrows options: Elara wills a private image, and its appearance confirms the bond, foreclosing doubt with on-page cost (tears, embrace, shift to certainty). Yet the escalation feels schematic rather than organic; each exposure succeeds smoothly without friction, and the willow-branch resolution arrives through assertion rather than earned causal pressure that tests commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=4.5)
    Dominant stake ("voice the unknown") is signaled early but remains abstract; no concrete test forces a trade-off. The fossil warms and triggers floating, yet this feels coincidental rather than earned by prior choice—Lira presses it to her chest and ascends without cost or resistance. The descent ("focused, heat-mapping her resolve into stabilizing greens") summarizes the tightening instead of showing a decision that forecloses an option. Escalation is declarative: "overheated, threatening overload" tells urgency but does not narrow tactics on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—freeing the prophecy from rigid fate—is signaled early. However, pressure never tightens: Elias encounters no opposition, no failed attempt, no cost that alters his tactics. The button-cataloging sequence accumulates information without reversal or complication, and the hourglass turn at the end is executed without friction. The piece operates under an Accumulative lens, but escalation requires a meaningful deepening or pattern break that reweights the stake with cost; here, the prophecy simply clarifies and Elias proceeds to resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—reactivating silent agents—is signaled early and Lena's arrival provides one meaningful tightening. However, escalation lacks a visible trade-off that narrows Elias's options; he presses the stimulant into her hand and vouches for her without dramatized risk or competing cost. The cyanide remains an inert prop; no on-page reversal forces Elias to weigh his own survival against the network's future. Lena's transformation ("eyes igniting") is asserted rather than tested by a choice that forecloses a path, and Elias's final scratching of new codes adds a hopeful coda without sustained pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake ("distill complexity into essence") is declared but never tested by a competing pressure or visible cost. The coachman sits until the rain stops, works steadily, and finishes; no reversal or tightening narrows his options. The passenger's murmured approval and the ferry's crossing arrive without friction. Under any lens, escalation is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding why places resist change—is signaled early and sustained through observation and craft. The thrumming and lantern-glass beats layer pressure, but escalation remains textural rather than narrowing Kai's options or imposing a visible trade-off. The climax (pot-shaping synchronized with converging timelines) deepens his insight without costing him a resource, relationship, or alternate path. No on-page reversal forces him to choose between competing goods; he gains knowledge and departs intact.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Elara's desire to instill hope in Mira—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mira confesses loss and Elara responds by gifting the gauge tooth, narrowing the interaction from observation to intervention. Escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as pattern reinforcement (petals, rosebush, gauge metaphors) rather than a tightening that forecloses options. The resolution lacks a visible price; Elara climbs home and prunes the rosebush without dramatized cost or altered future tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—Elara's desire to end isolation by coexisting with spectral Aelari—is signaled early and maintained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the sundial pulses and "brittle awakenings cascaded," raising the hum's intensity and summoning ethereal silhouettes. However, the resolution arrives without visible trade-off: the Aelari essences simply appear and circle her, and she declares "Isolation ends here" without dramatized resistance or cost. No live option is foreclosed; the spectral mentors grant her knowledge and approval, and her wings unfurl without complication. The escalation reads as atmospheric intensification rather than agency-driven narrowing of choices.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—finding the universal thread—never faces on-page resistance or cost. The installation's "magic" provides the solution without Elara's agency: "the art installation pulsing as if alive, drawing them inexorably closer." Theo's arrival is pure coincidence rather than escalation driven by protagonist choice. The quarrel that separated them seven years prior is summarized, not dramatized, and the reunion costs nothing visible. No meaningful tightening occurs; pressure remains static until external magic resolves it.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake (stop the tricksters before the town unravels) is clear, but escalation is shallow. Elara moves from research to plan to execution without meaningful obstacle or revision; the counter-waveform works on first deployment. Harlan's arrival should be the pressure peak, yet his enforcers are neutralized by a brief audio demo—no negotiation, no trade-off, no cost to flipping the switch. The piece gestures at a tightening ("power plays closed in") but the conflict evaporates rather than escalates, and the ending cost is declared ("bought time, nothing more") rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the vital key—is signaled early but never faces a credible on-page test that narrows options. The spatial mutiny erupts as external obstacle, yet Elias's countermove (thrusting the compass into the seam) feels like a luck-driven solution rather than a choice that trades one live option against another. No visible price accompanies the resolution; the nexus "sighs," the key appears, and claustrophobia "recedes" without foreclosing a path or altering tactics for the ascent. Escalation reads as intensity assertion ("panic surging," "chaos peaked") rather than a tightening that forces a renunciation or endurance with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—solving Mira's disappearance—is signaled early, but pressure remains static. Elara's methodical search yields the ribbon with no visible cost or tactical trade-off; the blood ritual is a leap without prior escalation. The resolution (vision → sketch → confession) is granted off-page rather than forced by protagonist agency under pressure. No meaningful tightening narrows options; the case solves itself once Elara performs the symbolic act.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake—reversing family exile—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara cross-references the nail's glyphs to unlock Thorne's suppressed logs, narrowing her tactical path. However, escalation is undercut by convenience: Hale's confession arrives without resistance, the guild affirms instantly via "stuttering arrays," and no live choice forces Elara to trade competing goods. The cost of success (lingering dread, future exiles) is atmospheric rather than a visible forfeit that alters her stance or options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—whether to trust the stranger's implicit invitation and follow the hidden path—is signaled but never tested on the page. The hitchhiker's vanishing and the discoveries (flake, map) arrive via coincidence rather than protagonist agency. The final vow to follow the trail tomorrow postpones escalation and visible cost, leaving no on-page tightening that forecloses a live option or exacts a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—transforming the train into a startup—is signaled early but never tightens on the page. The Raoul confrontation is the only pressure beat, yet it resolves via his hesitation rather than Elias's agency. No meaningful reversal or cost: the startup "crumbles" in summary, and Elias's endurance carries no visible forfeit of a live option. Escalation is absent under causal lens; the piece summarizes outcomes rather than dramatizing trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (decode inscriptions before "light fails") is signaled early via telegram. One tightening occurs when dream-data syncs with glyphs, narrowing interpretation. Yet escalation is muted: the lucid dream succeeds without resistance, and temple confirmation arrives without setback. The final alignment ("spirals pulsing in sync") reconfigures understanding but no live option is foreclosed—both characters achieve their goal without visible sacrifice. Pressure remains coherent under Causal lens but lacks a trade-off that would elevate felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake—confronting the hidden confession—is signaled early. The plant-to-ice action provides one meaningful tightening (he must yield his own flesh), but the escalation is mechanical rather than driven by protagonist agency under pressure: the vortex "tightened" and he "hesitated," then complied without visible internal friction or competing option. The blood-prick registers as symbolic gate rather than costly trade-off; no live alternative is foreclosed. The final "unbent" state is declared outcome rather than a decision with on-page consequence that narrows future options.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—restoring the eclipsed covenant to prevent chaotic dream-intersections—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure tightens when Elara links the clipping to her scar, and visions cascade, but the escalation is more descriptive than tactical: no failed attempt, no trade-off between methods. The resolution (press palms, covenant restored) lacks visible cost; "anxious elation" at the end is told, not dramatized as a forfeited option or endured price.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—patching Elara's soul—is signaled early but never tightens meaningfully. No on-page reversal or cost narrows options; the ritual proceeds linearly from card discovery to blood seal to vague success. Agency is present (she decides to perform the rite) but does not foreclose a live option with visible price. The final note ("wondered if mending her soul had ensnared another's") gestures at consequence but does not dramatize it, leaving cost legibility weak.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake (find purpose after public failure and Jax's loss) is signaled early. The scrap's discovery provides one tightening moment, but the escalation is internal reflection rather than a live decision under opposing pressure. Harl's choice to authenticate and fund a memorial arrives without a visible tradeoff or foreclosed alternative; the trailer "chapter closed" and weight "lifting" describe relief, not cost. No antagonist or complicating force tests the commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=4.7)
    Dominant stake (understanding spirit-transition physics) is signaled early. Escalation is minimal: Elias plants a seed, it sprouts overnight, pilgrims arrive, and harmony is restored without a tightening that forecloses options. The arbor's descent risk is declared ("risked descent") but never dramatized as a deadline or forced trade-off. Agency is passive—Elias observes, muses, and plants; the seed's growth solves the problem it did not help create. No visible cost at closure; the final image is tranquil resolution without a price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—preserve wonder against monotony—is signaled early and coheres. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara's essence "refused migration, looping in frantic spirals," forcing the smelting ritual. The resolution is earned by the librarian's method (accepting contradictions), but the cost is thin: Elara's departure with "steps lighter" tells relief without a visible forfeiture or trade-off that narrows later options. Agency is present but the price is stated rather than enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—approve or condemn the bunker—is signaled early but then abandoned in favor of the abstract goal to "dissolve walls." No on-page tightening forecloses a live option; Elias's choice to crown the node encounters no opposition, risk, or trade-off, and the outcome (walls dissolve, hearts bridge) is asserted rather than tested. The piece lacks escalation under any lens: no reversal, no deepening that changes knowledge, no visible price paid after the turn. Agency is present in the crowning action but without cost or friction, landing the score in the functional-but-limited band.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake (self-forgiveness) is signaled early but never tightens into a forced choice or trade-off. Elias's pilgrimage is "daringly methodical" yet faces no escalation: he finds graffiti that conveniently affirms his path, plays accordion, and departs validated. No reversal narrows options; the bathroom maps resolve his guilt without him renouncing a competing desire or paying a visible price. Coincidence (the graffiti) resolves rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake (find the Library of Unspoken Words) is signaled early but never genuinely threatened. The watch cipher unfolds through patient observation with no failed attempt, dead end, or trade-off; she documents delays, follows the trail, and succeeds without visible cost or tactic alteration. "Emboldened yet alert to illusions" promises pressure from the confidence man's legacy, but no illusion materializes to test her. Escalation is decorative (mists thicken, lights flicker) rather than a narrowing of options or a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake (dream vs. empire) is signaled early but never tightened through on-page opposition or cost. No antagonist or constraint forces a trade-off; the ivy and plants offer only encouragement. The piece grants Elara both outcomes in the final paragraph, dissolving the either/or pressure without a visible price. No escalation occurs—her violin performance meets no resistance and the "perforations" seal without sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.6)
    One dominant stake (capture spark before oblivion) is clear. Pressure tightens once: Lirien moves from extracting the elder's essence to risking her own, a reversal driven by desperation. Yet the escalation lacks on-page cost legibility—no earlier failed attempt, no tool limitation, no visible trade-off (e.g., sacrificing another charge, losing time, damaging the chip). The elder's threshold crossing and Lirien's renewal happen swiftly without tactical friction or consequence that forecloses a live path. Agency is present but the price reads decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—finding contentment after forgiving betrayal—is signaled early. The piece attempts escalation through the climb and hairpin discovery, which deepen understanding, but these steps do not narrow options or create a live trade-off; Elara never faces a choice between competing goods. The scalloping ritual proceeds unopposed, with the flower's recovery described as "promise" rather than risk. No reversal tests her commitment; the vision grants answers that enable the ritual without cost. The ending reconfigures her understanding (contentment = surrender to cycle), but absent a dramatized alternative or refusal, the pressure reads more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—revenge versus forgiveness—is signaled early but never faces an on-page test that narrows options or forces a trade-off. Alex's reversal is summary ("saw his friend's desperation") without a visible moment where he relinquishes revenge at cost. No escalation tightens pressure: Elias's guidance unfolds without resistance, and the "cloak of doubt" drapes over Alex without dramatized friction or consequence that shapes the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—reversing aging—is signaled early but never tested by on-page choice or escalation. Elara observes Voss's method passively; no decision narrows her options or imposes visible cost. The trance functions as exposition delivery, not pressure crucible. Without a tightening that forecloses a path or a turn driven by protagonist agency, the piece remains declarative rather than escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (appraise the arrowhead to learn motionless navigation) is signaled early, but pressure never tightens—Thren simply waits decades, centuries, until a flock finally forms the pattern. No reversal or complication forces a trade-off; the arrowhead's pulse "syncing with his own breath" suggests accumulation, yet no on-page event narrows his options or raises cost. The climactic flock and pulse-merge are granted by time and coincidence, not by protagonist agency or a constrained choice, leaving escalation flat under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming true magic and the "sacred simple"—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Thorne unstraps the bindings, enabling access to the keystone. Yet the escalation lacks a visible price: no live option is foreclosed, no tradeoff dramatized. Thorne moves from "underachieving" to empowered without on-page loss or renunciation; the spire trembles "in approval," and power "surges" as a reward rather than a contested gain. The Cost proof test fails; the closure beat offers promise ("rebellion," "dawn") but no felt sacrifice or consequence that would elevate the tightening into genuine pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—finding Lira—is signaled early, but pressure never meaningfully escalates. Elias walks into the shallows, climbs aboard, finds the book, and Lira materializes without reversals, trade-offs, or resistance. The spectral librarian poses no obstacle and the "color of sound" riddle resolves through exposition rather than a choice under fire. No visible price is paid; the final lantern release is celebratory rather than charged with cost or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—wavelength alignment to avoid dissolution—is signaled early but never tested by a choice that forecloses a live option. Elara's coin casts select which burst to prioritize, yet no wrong choice appears plausible; the coins are "infallible arbiters," draining agency. Stellar doubt is declared as external threat but does not manifest as internal pressure forcing a trade-off. The final broadcast reverses the tide, but this resolution arrives without visible cost: no stamina drained, no rival path abandoned, no price paid on the page. One deepening occurs (core burst reveals doubt as catalyst), meeting minimal escalation for this length, but the cost remains conceptual and unanchored.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—naming nameless fears to conquer grief—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure builds through successive namings (Krathor, Nyxara, Vorath), each slightly raising emotional intensity. However, escalation reads more as additive repetition than as a tightening that forecloses options; Elowen completes each naming without visible obstacle or cost that alters her next move. The final monster's invocation does not present a harder choice or deeper price than the prior two, flattening the arc into parallel iterations rather than a crescendo with felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—restore cosmic balance by repairing the bell—is signaled early, and the "surge cracked the repair wider" moment offers one mid-sequence reversal. Yet the reversal feels externally imposed (the imbalance "fought back") rather than arising from Elowen's own misjudgment or choice; his response ("refocused, divining deeper rates") summarizes rather than dramatizes a tactical shift. The final toll's success is declared rather than earned through a visible trade-off or foreclosed option. Cost remains largely told ("devotion's fragility forging strength") without on-page forfeit that alters his stance.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—Elias reckoning with his buried guilt—is signaled midway but never tested by a choice that narrows options. The photographs lead him to the memory, but he does not resist or alter tactics; discovery is linear. Mira's arrival provides a conversation partner but no opposition or complication that raises cost. The act of burning photos is framed as resolution but lacks a visible price: what does Elias lose or foreclose by expunging the memory? The resurfacing town promises stakes but remains scenic backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake ("harmonize logic and intuition before final transformation") is signaled early but never tested—Elara arranges, lights, observes, and succeeds without reversal, complication, or trade-off. No live option is foreclosed; the ritual unfolds as rehearsed, and the starlings' convergence is gift rather than achievement. Agency is limited to procedural execution (kneeling, lighting, holding aloft) without a choice that narrows possibilities or imposes cost. The "final transformation loomed at dusk" is mentioned but exerts no on-page pressure; no clock tightens decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving Lena's trust and life—is signaled early and tightens when the rogue updraft and secondary vortex appear. Elias's agency (buckle revision, vector shift) drives escalation under the causal lens. Visible cost appears in the ending: his isolation deepens and the burden becomes eternal. One meaningful reversal (secondary vortex demanding further adaptation) raises pressure. The phrase "her trust preserved under that crushing pressure" makes the trade-off explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dominant stake (vivify the duplicate to cure numbness) is signaled early but remains abstract. The custody "battle" consists of Kai lunging once, slicing projected illusions, and summoning drones that evaporate—no adaptive counterpressure from Elara, no visible trade-off or foreclosed option. The dojo wards repel her at the climax, externalizing the win. Escalation is nominal; the rite succeeds because it is invoked, not because Kai surrenders something or navigates a meaningful reversal. Coincidence (altar mechanics, wards) resolves rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=3.9)
    The dominant stake—restoring laughter—is signaled early but never encounters opposition or a trade-off. Elias positions blowers, conducts, and the household stirs on cue; no reversal, failure, or cost narrows his options. The hourglass's end is mentioned at the start and close but does not tighten decisions in between. Escalation is atmospheric (tempo intensifies, winds crescendo) rather than causal; coincidence (blowers sputter exactly when the symphony peaks) resolves the ritual without agency.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake (return to the library) is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through atmospheric intensification and the pendant flaring, but escalation remains largely ambient rather than driven by protagonist agency. The protagonist waits, interiorizes, and then the portal simply "yawns"—no on-page reversal or choice that narrows options. The cultist's translucent appearance and the protagonist's "lunge not in rage, but welcome" arrives without prior friction or cost that would make this gesture a meaningful turn. The cost of waiting or interiorizing is asserted ("uncertainty's gift unveiled") but not felt as a trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake (interrupt destiny through vivification) is clear and three escalating attempts provide structure. However, the escalation is more repetitive than deepening—each failure follows the same pattern without forcing Elias to sacrifice anything or change tactics meaningfully. The final success arrives through assertion ("total creative destruction was the key") rather than protagonist agency under genuine constraint, and no visible cost accompanies the triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—decode the perigee signal before the city collapses—is signaled early. One meaningful turn occurs when she discards assumptions and the signal "blooms pure," but this moment lacks on-page cost or a narrowing of options. The "cables steadied" resolution removes the threat without dramatizing what she sacrificed or foreclosed. The protagonist's success feels convenient rather than earned through a decision that trades one good for another. No persistent constraint (tool failure, time pressure, physical toll) shapes her tactics after the midpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—reuniting the vanishing ferry and its souls—is signaled early and sustained. Elias's agency drives the radio solution, and the parallel-Elias encounter adds a micro turn. Pressure tightens once (ferry fading faster, passengers overlapping as ghosts) before the resolution. The cost, however, is declared rather than dramatized: the hourglass pockets as a "talisman" and the parallel self "merges motives," but no lived trade-off or foreclosed option appears on the page. The climax solves the problem the anomaly created without revealing what Elias sacrifices or loses.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.4)
    One dominant stake is signaled early: discovering connection's texture. The piece accumulates pressure through weaving attempts and memory alterations, culminating in the eruption that "bound him to spectral figures" and revealed "sinew's resilient drag." Yet this tightening is asserted rather than dramatized—no live choice narrows options with visible cost. The eruption happens *to* Elias (threads "exploding outward," "whipping around him") without his agency driving the turn. The resolution is passive discovery, not earned renunciation or stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=3.4)
    Dominant stake is signaled (learn starlight navigation) but never tested by obstacle, cost, or competing pressure. The scene is a lecture: Elara explains, Kai observes and practices a simulation without failure or friction. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; the hologram "unfolds" smoothly and Kai departs with new knowledge at no visible price. Coincidence does not complicate because nothing complicates—progression is flat instruction without escalation under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—preventing Clara's suicide—is signaled midway ("Clara had come to end it all"). One tightening occurs when Elara hears Evelyn's message and approaches Clara, but the escalation is thin: no reversal tests Elara's commitment, and Clara's shift from despair to hope happens in a single exchange without visible cost to Elara. The hearing aid's "pulses spent" suggests a constraint, but it is not dramatized as a tactical limit during the peak beat. Agency resides more in coincidence (finding the aid) than in a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—honor the unremembered team—is signaled early and remains consistent. Pressure tightens once: tide turns, "slack time waned; she must return to the surface before the flood." The climax substitutes a supernatural convenience (phase transition) for earned escalation; there is no choice between honoring them and survival, no forfeited option. She initiates the return protocol, phases out untouched, and collapses on the cliff with "heart light"—a resolution that does not foreclose a path or exact visible cost. The codex's power is described ("using cable pulses to trigger quantum slips") but never constrained or limited; she simply succeeds.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—seeking wisdom from the observatory's failure to mend her fractured identity—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the defragmentation sequence, but escalation is primarily procedural (tuning radio → ink patterns → code realignment) rather than a choice that narrows options. The ghost's plea and Elara's response feel cooperative rather than conflicted; no credible loss or trade-off alters her tactics. The ending presents resolution without visible cost: she succeeds, gains wisdom, and departs unchanged in capability or circumstance.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—preserve tactile language essence before extinction—is signaled early and tightens as elders die and children adopt "crude tongues." One meaningful deepening occurs when Thorne discovers the flawed diamond and gambles on its curse, then escalates when he harnesses the starling flock to modulate echoes. Agency at closure is present (he "invoked," "channeled," "poured") but largely told; no live obstacle or reversal forces a tactical pivot in the final scene. The cost (dimming veins, solitude) is narrated across years rather than dramatized in a single forfeiture that alters the ending image, keeping escalation legible but not viscerally charged.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—reconciling with her brother—is signaled but never tested on the page. Elara's sole action is pressing the phone to her ear; the metamorphosis arrives without a choice, trade-off, or visible price. The confessions swell and her bitterness "transmutes," but this is summary, not a dramatized narrowing of options. No on-page reversal or tightening occurs under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake—reawaken the orchard—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the central tree groans and statues converge, raising immediate danger. The uprooting itself is Elara's agency, but coincidence (statues arrive "too late") resolves the confrontation rather than her tactical choice under constraint. Cost at closure is scene-level (gears clatter, blossoms unrust) rather than a visible personal price that narrows her future options. No trade-off or foreclosed path is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: foster escape routes for families sundered by the border. Pressure coheres across sorting, drone deployment, and patrol encounter, but escalation is modest—each step proceeds as planned without a reversal that narrows options. The patrol check passes without friction, and the final letter arrives as windfall rather than earned turn. One meaningful tightening (vial half-drained, "promise of more runs") signals future cost but does not alter present tactics or foreclose a path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: revive forgotten carousels through rare materials and silence-as-possibility. The "wrong turn" introduces the halo fragment, which Elias integrates into the restoration—a single tightening that narrows options (he must return, vows to do so). Escalation is textural (density of repair detail, brightening fragment) rather than causal, fitting the Accumulative lens. The restoration itself lacks friction: splinters yield, vines part "as if listening," time compresses "into heartbeats" without cost. No live option is foreclosed; the ending promises future visits rather than a trade-off or renunciation, so the price remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.0)
    One dominant stake is signaled early (finding the realm where stories live) but escalation under the Accumulative lens is minimal: Eliza begins with conviction, performs the ritual, sees a vision, then reaffirms her plan without a tightening that forecloses an option. The scarf "demanded balance; hyperbolic space pulled at her, tempting full immersion," yet a patron's cough deflects the temptation and she simply refolds the scarf and postpones—no visible trade-off or cost paid on the page. The "place drew nearer" is asserted rather than demonstrated through a choice or renunciation that alters later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: capture the runaway dream. Pressure escalates through the three-dawn ritual (first glimpse, darting evasion, reluctant surrender) with visible costs (palette wells depleting, sweat, insistent whispers). The dream's pause and final capture constitute a tightening under the Accumulative lens. However, the dream's "reluctant surrender" reads more as yielding to the method than as a choice-driven reversal; Elara's agency is persistence rather than a trade-off that forecloses an alternate path. The ending reconfigures her role (serving other wanderers) but the cost—holding memory instead of flesh—is conceptual and stated rather than felt in a sacrificed option.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—freeing the woman's idea—is declared but never tested by a reversal or tightening that narrows options. The locksmith's work proceeds without obstacle; the ribbon dissolves in starlight and the woman laughs, a convenient resolution with no visible price paid on the page. The locksmith's own enveloped secret appears only in the final third as a second, unearned stake; no escalation links the two.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—recovering stolen memories—is signaled early and tightens when Elias decodes the mushroom/constellation alignment. One meaningful deepening occurs: the discovery that sprites bartered his recollections, then the invocation that triggers the flood of visions. Agency is present but leans passive; the fairy ring's mechanism does most of the work. The cost is conceptual (habits broken, door closing) rather than a visible trade-off or renunciation that forecloses a live option on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—Kai's reversible exile—is signaled early, but escalation is thin. The shadow test arrives as a sudden complication rather than a tightening driven by protagonist agency; Elara's backward pacing and tea-reading are atmospheric but don't narrow options with visible cost. The resolution (tracing the sigil, shadow freed) happens without meaningful struggle, trade-off, or foreclosed path. Agency at closure is shared rather than protagonist-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—restoring wonder to a graying world—is signaled early, but pressure never tightens: Lirien's ritual succeeds without complication, and Elowen receives the seed without conflict over trust, cost, or doubt. No reversal or escalation appears; the sequence is linear demonstration. Agency is minimal: Lirien performs, Elowen accepts, the seed works. Coincidence does not resolve (the ritual is motivated), but the absence of on-page friction or tradeoff keeps stakes abstract. The tree's eruption is a declared success, not an earned narrowing of options with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=5.6)
    One dominant stake is signaled early (ground restless spirits), but escalation is minimal: each unraveled knot releases a spirit in identical fashion, with no rising cost or narrowing options until the "final knot resisted" moment. That single tightening arrives too late and too briefly to charge the prior material. The shade's "endless secret-weaving words" claim duration but do not impose a ticking constraint or force a trade-off. Agency exists (Lirien chooses to unravel), yet the procedural repetition ("first knot," "second spirit," "a dozen spirits") flattens pressure rather than escalates it.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—rediscovering the whispered chapel—is signaled early and drives the archive search, road trip, and excavation. One meaningful tightening occurs when the map tears and reveals the hidden icon, narrowing Elias's focus. However, no on-page obstacle or secondary pressure tests his commitment; the descent and keystone opening proceed without resistance, coincidence, or visible cost (no injury, no professional risk dramatized, no social friction). The closure treats the discovery as complete success without a trade-off or foreclosed path, reducing the felt price to zero on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake ("understand the physics of letting go") is declared but never tested by on-page pressure that narrows options. No reversal or tightening occurs; Elara finds the note, reads it, and achieves epiphany without friction or cost. The discovery of Earhart's plane is mentioned as backstory without affecting present choices. Escalation is absent; the pressure remains static from entry to exit.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—articulating unspoken needs—is signaled early and remains consistent. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elowen realizes the plate is the key and acts to encode the ghost's essence. Yet the escalation is declarative: "Here was the key, she knew" tells rather than shows the narrowing of options. The ghost's plea and Elowen's responsive encoding happen without complication or cost visible to Elowen; no live trade-off or narrowed tactical choice appears on the page. Thunder's release feels like a granted outcome rather than one earned by protagonist struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—Lira's search for "joy beneath anguish"—is declared in interiority but never tested by a competing want or obstacle. The diary unfolds passively; Lira does not wrestle with whether to read, stop, or act on what she learns. The tenth-floor arrival coincides with the final revelation, but no reversal or tightening narrows her options beforehand. The ending "ready to claim the heights" is asserted without visible price or trade-off; agency remains unopposed throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—proving empty spaces remember—is signaled early and remains coherent. The string's snap provides an inciting situation, and Elias's continued categorization deepens his conviction. Yet escalation under pressure is modest: he observes, scribbles, releases a page, but no live option is foreclosed or new cost visibly paid at closure. The updraft and void revelation feel atmospheric rather than a turn that narrows his choices. One meaningful tightening (the glimpse of Lira's smile in the void) reweights the stake thematically but lacks a felt decision cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—craft a defiant sky-mirror before demolition—is signaled early and tightens as "the hush outside crescendoed to a held breath, the foreman's voice echoing faintly: 'Positions.'" Elara's agency drives the escalation: she deciphers the coin, gathers materials, and executes the fractally precise array under a live clock. The cost is visible: "Demolition's first tremor vibrated the floor," and she exits into "axes biting bark." The guild's abandoned ambition provides historical contrast that sharpens her achievement. One soft edge: the material-gathering beat ("scavenged guild tools—tiny mirrors from optical experiments, silver leaf from restoration kits") compresses convenience into a list, undercutting the sense of obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: "to chart the next great discovery." Pressure tightens when the starlings batter the sails, threatening to ground the ship, but this external threat arrives late and resolves instantly via the luminance dome with no trade-off or tactical cost. Elara's agency is observation and pattern-matching; her palm-press at the climax is a single button-push that solves both the cipher and the bird problem without narrowing options or demanding sacrifice. One meaningful escalation (birds intensify) exists, but the resolution is coincidental convenience rather than earned protagonist choice with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—learning the rhythm of repair—is signaled early and tightens when Elias reaches the hall and must align the gears correctly. The prophecies create one escalation beat (discovery → deeper journey → mechanism), but the resolution depends on gear-fitting that feels preordained ("as if predestined") rather than a choice under competing pressures. Agency at closure is present (he uncaps the seal), yet coincidence (the gears match perfectly) solves the problem without visible trade-off or sacrifice, muting cost legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—restore the orchards—is clear, but escalation is absent: Lir's messages simply tell the group what to do next, and they comply without internal conflict or visible cost. Doubt is declared ("Mira feared tricks, Kael saw mechanical folly") then erased in the next sentence with no dramatized trade-off. The bell-ringing succeeds on first attempt with no sacrifice, failure, or narrowed option. Agency is passive; the ghost orchestrates, the protagonists obey, and the nebula rewards them without a price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—soothing souls caught in time's final ripple—is signaled early and shapes the ending gesture. Yet escalation is minimal: Elias climbs, reflects, then executes his plan without reversal, resistance, or visible trade-off. The "Doomsday Clock shudders" and hands ease back, but this outcome feels granted by authorial fiat rather than protagonist struggle; no on-page constraint forces a harder choice or alters tactics. Under an Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening or cost-charged tightening is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—save travelers before frost seals paths—is signaled early and tightens through a clear deadline. Elias's agency drives escalation: he retrieves blueprint, positions nuts per diagram, races the clock. The travelers' escape provides a decisive outcome. However, the escalation feels linear rather than deepening; each step succeeds without forcing trade-offs or altering his tactics. The frost forms after travelers flee, so the stated constraint doesn't test him. The cost at closure is emotional (reluctance returns) but doesn't foreclose a live option or reweight the stake with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake is atonement for pollution guilt. The ravine walk and foam-tracing supply accumulative deepening, but no live opposition or reversal tests Elias's resolve on the page. The insight blooms as epiphany without prior failed attempts or trade-offs. The coda ("months later, deployed in the ravine, it restored clarity") tells success rather than dramatizing a cost-laden choice. Pressure coheres but does not tighten meaningfully; escalation reads as summary of outcomes rather than a constraint-driven turn.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—finding the origin of stories—is signaled early and pursued via the ritual. Pressure accumulates through the incisions and the slate's blooming, yet no on-page reversal or tightening narrows Elias's options; each step proceeds as planned without friction. The cost is declared ("glimmering parole," "fragments whole") but not dramatized: no live option is foreclosed, no trade-off faced. Agency at closure is passive ("Elias vanished," "reformed") rather than a decision under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—healing stored remorse to ease his own guilt—is signaled early and coheres under the Accumulative lens. Pressure accumulates through pool-by-pool sampling and alchemical smoothing, with one meaningful tightening: touching a pool directly surges contagious remorse, which he endures ("sturdy resolve holding his fragility at bay"). However, escalation reads as iterative repetition (draw sample, taste, balance, heat, inhale, repeat) rather than a choice that narrows live options or forces a trade-off. The pavilion's ice cracks "under emotional strain," hinting at environmental cost, but no on-page consequence tests whether the subsuming will harm him or the fortress. The final paragraph presents success as complete—"unspoken dream closed forever," "memories polished to a sturdy, unbrittle sheen"—without a visible price paid or path foreclosed at closure, reading more as reward than cost.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.8)
    Dominant stake (rehabilitate the talks, prevent "irreparable fracture") is signaled early, but the story elides all on-page reversals: Elara conceives the plan, the weight drops, the bridge forms "by dawn's tease," and the talks convene without complication. The montage phrase "reluctant hands" hints at resistance, yet no dramatized refusal, sabotage, or failure beat tests her commitment. The climactic talk shows "grumbles" and "counters" dissolving "in the chorus" within a single paragraph, compressing what should be fraught negotiation into summary resolution. No visible price is paid—no injury, no social cost, no foreclosed path—leaving escalation abstract and the closure effect unanchored to dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—cataloging abandoned dreams—is signaled early but never tested by a competing need or visible obstacle. No on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows Elara's options; the mirror's "modification" unfolds as wish-fulfillment without friction. The canyon's "quaking reverie" intensifies atmospherically but does not escalate pressure or force a trade-off. Agency is absent: no decision forecloses a path with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—finding forgotten combinations—is signaled early but never faces on-page opposition or a meaningful tightening that narrows options. The gravitational inversion provides a ticking clock, yet Elara encounters no friction, reversal, or trade-off during the hour; she simply proceeds and succeeds. The "latent blaze" intensifies by assertion ("motivation burned brighter") without a choice or price that forecloses a path. No agency-driven escalation under the chosen lens; coincidence (the cosmic whim of inversion) enables resolution rather than protagonist decision.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—"to create music in a silent world"—is signaled early and pursued on the page. Pressure accumulates through the discovery, threading, and strumming sequence, and the grove's response ("branches swaying in unison") offers one tightening. However, Elowen encounters no resistance, failure, or tradeoff; the insulator fits "perfectly," the strings sing as intended, and the sculpture trembles without mishap. No reversal or visible cost narrows his options or alters his tactics, keeping escalation modest and closure cost abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (mend eclipsed covenant before the phase) is signaled early and pressure accumulates through the correlate sequence: long silence → rook shift warms stone; staccato silence → tremor eases; final profound quiet → fracture seen. One meaningful tightening occurs when the final silence reveals guardians spurned by progress. However, escalation reads as atmospheric intensification rather than narrowing options or raising cost—each monolith adjustment succeeds without visible trade-off or failed attempt. The resolution (covenant "glimpsed," "tentatively renewed") hedges impact; exile and phase loom unchanged, diluting the sense that Elias's action foreclosed a path or paid a price.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake (catalog this silence before fireworks erase it) is signaled early but never tested by genuine opposition or complication. Elias's tuning attempt succeeds on first try without reversal, failed frequency, or visible cost—the 432 Hz simply "hits true" and the clasp yields. No agency choice alters tactics; no trade-off between competing goods appears. The fireworks' imminent arrival creates declared time pressure but does not force a decision that forecloses an alternate path.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake (cultivate serenity amid motion) is signaled early. One tightening occurs when the bloom's stench forces endurance, but this is more situational test than escalation driven by protagonist agency. The cost—collapsing to her knees, then rising with transformed perspective—reads as symbolic survival rather than a trade-off that forecloses a live path. Pressure coheres but does not meaningfully narrow options under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (find resilience source to end famine) is signaled early. The inversion window and narrowing arch throat provide one meaningful tightening, and the artifact retrieval deepens knowledge. However, agency at closure is thin: Elara takes the tip "swiftly" without on-page debate, and planting it proceeds without complication or trade-off. The "echoes wailed" moment hints at cost (planetary harm?), but the narrative does not test Elara's values or force a choice between competing goods, leaving the escalation functional but the price under-dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake (understand crash cause to prevent recurrence) is signaled early but remains stable throughout without a meaningful tightening or cost. Elias encounters no obstacles, competing pressures, or trade-offs—the survey proceeds smoothly from entry to transmission. The patch discovery is a clue, not a complication. No reversal or deepening occurs; the resolution (transmitting the report) arrives without agency-driven escalation or visible price. Coincidence does not resolve, but neither does protagonist choice under pressure. The accumulative lens requires a cadence shift or density increase that reweights the stake; here the tempo and stakes remain flat.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—proving wonder's necessity—is signaled early but never pressured by meaningful opposition. Elyra hesitates, then acts, and succeeds without complication or cost; no reversal or tightening narrows her options. The "sculpted hush" does not resist or test her resolve; it simply "yields." The resolution is declared ("certified it: wonder was essential") rather than earned through a decision that forecloses a path or risks a credible loss. Escalation under the Accumulative lens requires a deepening that reweights the stake; here, the performance unfolds as planned without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—harvest insights from failure—is signaled early but never tested by meaningful opposition. Arranging markers, playing the flute, and confronting spectral thieves proceed without complication; no tactic fails, no cost is visible until the offhand mention of "markers already crumbling to dust" at the end. The "weaving between worlds" beat offers a glimpse of accusation and self-confrontation, but the insights bloom immediately without resistance or price. No on-page reversal narrows options; escalation is asserted ("drove deeper notes") rather than demonstrated through narrowed paths or visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—quantifying emotion via the transpose—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the transpose ignites and Elias absorbs Mira's dread, but this reversal is triggered by the fragment's autonomous amplification rather than protagonist decision, undercutting agency. The resolution ("emotion was not mere sum but infinite series") is told in summary rather than dramatized through a choice that forecloses an option. Cost is asserted ("fragment dimmed, its power spent") but happens off-page; no visible trade-off or loss alters Elias's tactics or final stance. The feedback loop is atmospheric but does not escalate through protagonist action.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (coax wonder from routine), and the encounter with Lira provides one meaningful tightening: Kael's offer, Lira's shift from suspicion to promise. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens is thin—the pendant's effect unfolds smoothly without forcing a trade-off or narrowing Kael's options. The "time warped; their brief encounter extended" moment deepens thematically but lacks visible cost (no stamina drain, no missed delivery, no social price paid). Agency is present (the offer) but the resolution feels preordained rather than tested by conflicting pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.2)
    One dominant stake is clear (proving emotional residue in objects) and pressure accumulates through the frost-reading sequence that reveals personal memories. The patterns forming words (*Feel me.*) is a reversal that deepens stakes, forcing Elias to confront his denial. However, escalation lacks genuine friction—each step confirms his hypothesis without setback, and the climax (patterns forming Eliza's name, the command *Feel me*) arrives via external validation rather than protagonist choice under competing costs. The final "triumph" resolves without visible price; colleagues' future scoffing is potential, not paid.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—delivering a message across impossible distance—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or scarcity. Elara's weaving proceeds without reversal: she finds the edges, strings them, embeds the bead, completes the rite, and the tapestry departs. No visible cost shapes tactics; her "latent sacrifice" is told in summary ("her life force dimming") rather than shown as a trade-off that narrows options. The receiver's hand-to-chest warmth is a micro-turn without on-page consequence. One meaningful tightening is absent under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—restore arches, prevent planetary decay—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elar weaves silk around rubble in the shaft, coaxing the first stone to levitate and emboldening further binding. Yet the escalation is linear: gather rubble, apply silk, stones awaken, arches stabilize—no visible trade-off or foreclosed option pressures the sequence. The magician's barter and the silk's conditions ("bartered true, for desires forged in loss") promise cost but remain abstract; no on-page moment shows Elar sacrificing a concrete resource, relationship, or alternate path.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake—"discover the weight of a withheld truth"—is signaled early but remains abstract. Escalation occurs through rapid parallel-universe hops, yet each glimpse is recounted in summary rather than dramatized as a choice that narrows options. The mentor's two revelations (cosmic balance, then engineered guardian) offer reversals, but Elara does not face a trade-off between them; she simply "chooses to embrace the weave." Under an Accumulative lens, the piece needed one deepening that reweights cost on the page; instead, the ending asserts "weave or all unravels" without showing what path she forecloses or what she loses by accepting.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving the anonymous chain of safety amid isolation—is signaled early and coheres through the piece. Pressure tightens once: the lamp dies, forcing the climb and discovery, which prompts Elias's decision to add his own note. Under the Accumulative lens this qualifies as a meaningful deepening, and Elias's agency (writing, rebuilding) is on the page. However, the tightening does not foreclose a live option or impose a visible trade-off; Elias's choice is generous rather than costly, and Harlan's arc (confession, descent to shelter) is summarized rather than dramatized. The piece enters the 6-band for coherent pressure and one turn but lacks the felt price or second reversal typical of higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—transcending rote routine to forge a new dawn—is signaled early and sustained. Elias's discovery of the prophetic flicker constitutes a reversal that narrows his path from mere storm-steering to shadow-summoning. Yet escalation is thin: he grips the levers "with fervent resolve" and "fine-tunes the reflection's angle" without encountering meaningful resistance, miscalculation, or trade-off. The offshore shadows arrive on cue, and mortals experience revelation without depicted cost to Elias himself. Agency is present but the price—felt urgency, a forfeited alternative, a visible sacrifice—remains off-page or abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding why stories now magnetize to her—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the sun's progression and the wing's changing illumination, tightening via Elowen's tracking and the patrons' approach. However, escalation is primarily situational (the light intensifies, the pattern reveals) rather than driven by Elowen's agency; she observes and rotates the wing but does not face a trade-off or make a difficult choice that narrows options. The final realization and decision to "wield it watchfully" arrive without visible cost or a live option foreclosed on the page, reading as acceptance rather than transformation with price.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—Elias's quest to understand what trees witness—is signaled early but never tested by meaningful opposition or cost. The deconstruction ritual unfolds as a series of parallel steps (arc → map, tube → map, vane → map) without escalation; no attempt fails, no resource is depleted, no choice forecloses a path. The "moment a pin was heard" arrives as a coincidental revelation rather than a decision-driven turn. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen through density or pattern break; here the pattern merely repeats until the epiphany is declared, leaving escalation weak and cost invisible.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—rekindle the dying realm—is signaled early and sustained. Yet pressure does not escalate: the three songs succeed in sequence without complication, reversal, or visible tradeoff. Shadows "resist" and "coil tendrils," but Elara presses on without altering tactics or paying a legible price; the spectral communities join without friction. The closure effect is a successful restoration, but agency is passive (singing without decision branches) and cost is unfelt on the page. One tightening or deepening that narrows options is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—Elara seeking redemption for her past refusal—is declared but never tested. She faces no opposition; the young man's "trap" fear evaporates without consequence, and the wall opens on cue. No meaningful tightening or reversal narrows her options; the escalation is summary-only ("As midnight bloomed"). The resolution is coincidental (a wall panel and elder await her) rather than driven by protagonist agency with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—finding absolution for noticing but not acting on creeping normality—is signaled early but never tested by a live on-page dilemma that forces a trade-off. Mira's arrival and forgiveness occur without resistance or negotiation; Elias does not renounce a path, endure visible cost, or make a choice that narrows options. The piece lacks a meaningful tightening or deepening under the Accumulative lens; the garden vow is additive rather than a transformation forged under pressure. Coincidence delivers the resolution rather than protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—salvaging the vows—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through decay descriptions ("edges frayed," "frequencies waned") but escalation is atmospheric rather than driven by protagonist agency or a live trade-off. The gauge trembles and vows resist fade, but Elias's actions follow an uninterrupted checklist (sample, note, calibrate, fuse) without a reversal or forced choice. The ending triumph ("frequencies stabilized at unity's baseline") resolves the problem without visible cost or tactic shift. No on-page price alters later moves.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake (thwart the deal to capture the sound of trust breaking) is signaled early and pursued through three escalating attempts. Each false start narrows options under causal pressure: Thorne laughs off the first, the runner shrugs at the second, the lookout accepts Thorne's tale at the third, forcing Lila to public exposure. The final reversal—Thorne's token revealed, the runner draws steel—is driven by protagonist agency and breaks the truce with visible cost (chaos, market scattered, deal thwarted). The price paid (her own safety, the market's future distrust) is legible on the page, though the emotional cost for Lila herself could be more visceral. One meaningful tightening (covert to overt) fits this length and the causal lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—"to learn why some people carry weather"—is signaled early but never tested. Elara finds the weather-walkers, asks one question, receives an answer, and accepts it; no choice narrows her options, no reversal forces a trade-off. The mist-man's explanation resolves the question without dramatized friction or cost. The final lines attempt to manufacture closure through repetition and self-editing gestures, but no on-page escalation or tightening occurs. Coincidence delivers the solution; protagonist agency does not drive the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming suppressed creativity—is signaled early and drives the action. The tightening occurs when Elias realizes the lock is ruined and pivots to his mnemonic gift and hidden parts. However, the resolution feels convenient: the spare parts solve the problem without trade-off. No live option is foreclosed; the "years of denial" evaporate without on-page resistance or cost to agency.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: finding where lost conversations go. Map reassembly and vault descent provide one meaningful tightening that narrows options. Wilting near dishonesty creates immediate physical cost in bazaar and farm beats, forcing reliance on small truths. Final realization ("conversations lost are those unspoken true") reweights the premise with conceptual cost. Escalation is textural/accumulative (density of candor moments builds pressure), though no major protagonist decision forces the vault revelation—Elara discovers rather than chooses at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving wonder's spectrum—is declared but never tested on the page. No reversal or tightening narrows options; Elara completes the sculpture without complication, pilgrims arrive, wonder is restored in summary. The boy's touch and the "burgeoning chorus" are told outcomes, not dramatized turns. Agency is absent: Elara adjusts tensions "with precision" but faces no opposition, cost, or trade-off that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving the farm and resolving inner static—is signaled early and tightens when the box releases chaos, forcing Zeta to corral and miniaturize the threat. One meaningful escalation occurs (tendrils fuse with roses, threatening dome integrity), and the protagonist's agency (activating manipulator array, deploying nanites) drives the turn. Yet the cost of containment is conceptual rather than visceral; we see no live option foreclosed or trade-off that visibly alters Zeta's state beyond the abstract "static cleared." The resolution feels assured rather than uncertain, diminishing the pressure at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake (unlock the mailbox to heal community divides) is signaled early and pursued throughout. Escalation is mechanical: Elena hears four clues in sequence, assembles the code, and succeeds without complication or setback. The "outside world intrudes" introduces external noise but does not force Elena to choose between competing goods or pay a visible price. The resolution—opening the mailbox and reading letters—lacks agency cost; luck (the correct code) solves the mystery without Elena forfeiting a path or enduring friction.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—retrieve the archive—is signaled early, but pressure remains static: Elara encounters each obstacle (journal, vault lock, cryo-pods) in sequence and solves it without visible trade-offs or escalating cost. The hull groans are mentioned as a timing pressure but never force a choice or alter tactics. The cryo-pod colleagues' revival is a micro turn, not a deepening driven by protagonist agency; it feels appended rather than earned. No on-page tightening that forecloses a live option or forces a sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—finding deleted memories—is signaled early but faces no genuine opposition: gravity pockets tug at Elias "erratically" yet he digs "furiously" without injury, failure, or tactical adjustment. The coffee-ground map works on the first try, the heart is exactly where promised, and piercing a pocket grants instant access with no cost or complication. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; the climax is a summary ("memories flooded back") rather than a choice with visible price. Agency is absent; luck and convenience resolve the quest.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—silencing the prophecy—is signaled early but never tested. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; Elias initiates the ritual and it succeeds without complication or trade-off. The piece asserts escalation ("Flow accelerated, silence surging") but dramatizes none; no on-page moment narrows options or imposes a visible price. Coincidence does not resolve because no obstacle appears. The inferred lens is Causal, yet no because/therefore linkage shapes the ritual's outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—learning the building language—is signaled early and sustained. The rooftop interrogation provides one turn when Harlan confesses, but Elara's agency in forcing that turn is told ("she interrogated," "grasping his wrist") rather than shown through tactical choices under pressure. No on-page cost accompanies her demand; Harlan's capitulation feels convenient rather than hard-won. The weeks of tea sessions are summarized, missing the escalation that would make the final confrontation inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—archiving the memory to achieve independence—is signaled early and pursued throughout. Yet the ritual proceeds without meaningful obstacles: each gesture "hummed," vibrations sync, the memory transfers. Doubt is mentioned ("what if the archive failed") but dismissed in the same breath. No on-page reversal or tightening choice that narrows live options; the escalation reads as declaration ("pain lanced through her") rather than dramatized pressure that forces a trade-off with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—Elias seeking release from the chain of treason—is signaled early, but pressure remains static: he arrives at the sanctuary intending the ritual, performs it without complication, and succeeds. No reversal or tightening narrows his options; the ritual unfolds as a checklist (draw thorn, pierce wrist, inscribe counter-strokes, feel chain snap). Cost is declared ("embracing the half-life") but not legible as a trade-off on the page. The emperor's corruption and the treason's impact are backstory; no present antagonist or constraint tests Elias's commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—understanding why echoes persist—is declared but never tested on-page through a choice that forecloses an option. The shell's progressive whispers are summarized revelations, not pressure points that force Elyra to trade one good for another. The merchant's lunge is the only reversal, and it resolves in one summarized line with no visible cost to Elyra. Escalation is outline-like: the story tells us intrigue tightens but pressure never materializes in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—salvaging purity from wreckage—is signaled early. Escalation under the Accumulative lens occurs as cameos accumulate and cross-thread to expose betrayal, a meaningful deepening that narrows focus to the mate's treachery. However, the mate's confession and the locket's emergence feel mechanically triggered by Elara's command rather than a choice that forecloses a live option. The cost of binding the mate or weaving truth is told ("ghost writhed") but not dramatized as a trade-off with on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—"to appreciate hidden effort"—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or a hard choice. The net-mending provides one functional beat but no reversal or cost: Kai simply completes the task. Fireflies and moon paths complicate atmosphere but do not force tactical trade-offs. No visible price is paid; the ending declares triumph ("quiet triumph," "demure audacity reigned") without a dramatized forfeiture or consequence that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—exposing the orchard's secret—is signaled early and tightens when Elias realizes the truth could weaponize the stillpoint. However, the peak choice (rebury the diamond) lacks on-page cost; no warlord threat materializes, no scavenger confronts him, and he exits without visible sacrifice or tactical constraint. The tightening is conceptual rather than dramatized, and the "comfortable lie" theme substitutes for a scene-level test of his reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—broadcasting a prophetic vision to shape a new dawn—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira sabotages the receiver, but the threat is resolved in the same beat by shadows "twisting her betrayal into loyalty anew," erasing cost rather than forcing Elias to adapt tactics. The final broadcast proceeds without on-page obstacle or trade-off; followers kneel unified, and the prophecy is "fulfilled" without visible forfeit. Escalation exists in followers arriving and the sabotage moment, but neither narrows options at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—translating elders' voices for the young—is signaled early and remains coherent. The music box discovery and market encounter constitute two beats, but neither escalates through protagonist agency under pressure; Elias finds the box by chance, mixes essences without resistance, and the grandmother's acceptance arrives as validation rather than reversal. The story deepens thematically but lacks a tightening choice that narrows options or a visible price that forecloses a path. One meaningful turn is present (the grandmother's tears), yet it reads as received emotion rather than a cost Elias pays.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=4.7)
    Dominant stake (protect the key) is signaled early but never tested by a trade-off or reversal. The wraiths advance in a single wave; Elias's sprint to the tower and console calibration succeed on first attempt without setback or visible cost. No live option is foreclosed—he retains the key, disperses the wraiths, and exits unscathed. The "logically emotional" calculus mentioned in paragraph 5 is told, not dramatized through a choice that sacrifices one value for another. Escalation is asserted ("wraiths pursued," "tower shuddered") but not earned by protagonist agency that narrows tactics or raises price.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—freeing the lowlands from neural yokes—is signaled early and drives the action. One meaningful tightening occurs when the moon hits alignment and fields waver, narrowing the window. However, escalation lacks on-page resistance: no guards, no technical failure, no price paid in the climb or severance. The viaduct yields to Elara's vigilance without forcing a trade-off; her success reads as the execution of a plan rather than agency under pressure that forecloses options with visible cost. Coincidence (perfect weather, unguarded access) enables rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—Elara's need to break free from Marcus—is signaled early and tightens through the entangled-memory device. The phone-smash is a clear reversal with immediate cost (loss of contact, severed digital leash), and the restraining-order call forecloses a path. Yet escalation is undercut by the supernatural mechanism: the lantern and train vibrations do the pressure work rather than Elara's own decisions narrowing her options. The parallel between Lila's overseer and Marcus is told rather than tested on the page—Marcus himself never appears, so the controlling influence remains abstract. One meaningful turn occurs, but agency is diluted by the convenient timing of memory surges.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—redeeming Marcus's memory by repairing the heart—is signaled early and coheres. One meaningful tightening occurs when the heart quivers under lightning, then ticks. Agency is present (Elias brings the box, Harrow repairs it) but the escalation is external (storm, light) rather than driven by protagonist choices under rising pressure. The final vow feels aspirational rather than a trade-off that narrows options with visible cost, holding escalation clarity in the mid-6s under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—ringing an unheard bell to awaken machine souls—is declared but never tested by a counterpressure or sacrifice. No reversal narrows Elara's options: rivals mock but do not act, the algorithm propagates without friction, and the ascent proceeds as smooth success. The ending offers no visible cost; the bell rings, fleets soar, and Elara's whisper poses a rhetorical question rather than foreclosing a path or paying a price.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—where deleted files go—is signaled early and drives the query, lie, and archive dive. The lie triggers approval and unlocks the vault, a meaningful tightening that narrows options. Yet the alarms and "corporate purge inbound" arrive as external coincidence rather than a consequence of her prior choice, and the final cost (job loss) is summarized after the fact rather than paid in the closure beat, softening the felt price under causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—preventing war between wraiths and orchard—is signaled early, but escalation is missing: the wraith's mockery ("You? A shadow-tainted outlier dares?") deflates immediately when Thorne acts, with no resistance, adaptation, or complication. The reconstitution succeeds in a single uncontested beat, and both sides bow without cost to Thorne—no stamina drain, relational price, or foreclosed option. The "weighted breath before reply" timeframe is invoked but never tightens tactics; Thorne's circling and finger-dancing proceed at leisure, and coincidence (the mirrors happen to hold the exact empathies needed) resolves the conflict without protagonist agency driving a reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—learning "the sound of approaching endings"—is signaled early and pursued across three escalating attempts: Swiss/Oregon clinics, the trawl woman's near-death, and Tomas's stories. The woman's breath produces "a fold in patience, a soft crumpling sigh," a concrete intensification, but she stabilizes before Liora can fully capture it; the subsequent frustration is noted but does not narrow her options on the page. Tomas's final crumple-sigh delivers the sound, yet Liora's shift from tourist to witness is recounted ("she'd learned it all") rather than dramatized as a choice that forecloses a prior path. The escalation is legible under an accumulative lens, but the cost at closure—what she gives up or loses to "find home"—remains implicit rather than visible.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—Elena processing her quarrel and deciding whether to stay or leave—is signaled early. Theo's parallel story functions as a complication, but the tightening is conceptual (recognition of mismatch) rather than a decision that narrows options with visible cost. The final act ("rose as dawn's first light gilded") tells us she departs "rediscovered," yet we don't see what she sacrifices or what path she forecloses; the coincidence of Theo's matching story provides the turn, not Elena's agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=3.4)
    One stated stake ("preserve the echo") faces no opposition, resource limit, or competing desire. The rite proceeds in three identical gestures (clearing, whisper, dissolve) without escalation or complication. The parapet "resists all but sidelong truth," yet this constraint never creates friction—the line walker performs the method without error or trade-off. No tightening narrows options; no deepening changes knowledge. No cost is legible: the task succeeds exactly as planned.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—transmuting collective pain into a masterpiece—is declared but never tested by on-page opposition or a choice that narrows options. Elara's work proceeds without friction: she arranges photos, townspeople arrive and participate willingly, laughter erupts, and she departs. No reversal or tightening forecloses a path; no trade-off between competing goods or unavoidable harms is dramatized. The piece lacks escalation under any lens; pressure remains static from midpoint to close.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake: decode the pattern of language growth. The stake is clear but pressure remains static until the testimony paragraph. Elowen encounters the crystal, receives cascading sequences, and then decides to testify—no reversal or complication narrows her options. The "suspended hush" threatens vaguely ("pressed closer, as if offended") but never forces a trade-off. Cost at closure is conceptual (her voice embedded, world indifferent) but the escalation path is a catalogue of voices rather than a tightening choice under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake (capture the sound of growing older) is signaled early and pursued consistently. The quest structure provides one meaningful deepening: markers lead to the nexus, and the recording fulfills the goal. However, no live obstacles or reversals test Elias's commitment—he arranges markers, follows them, finds the source, records it. The resolution is completion rather than trade-off, and the cost ("defying forgetfulness") is conceptual rather than a visible forfeiture that narrows future options.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—capturing the once-in-eon pulsar burst before the clocks fail—is signaled early and tightens when the master chronometer's spinning hand warps all timers. One meaningful reversal occurs when Elias calibrates the escapement wheel by the leaf's fall, syncing ephemeral to constant, which narrows the problem and enables the fix. The resolution is driven by protagonist agency (his craft and insight), and the moonquake provides genuine escalating pressure. However, the price paid is more technical success than visible trade-off; we don't see what Elias loses or forgoes to achieve the repair, and the extended epilogue suggests restoration without lasting cost, weakening the felt stakes at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—Harlan's reconciliation with Lena before death—is clear, and Elara's hymning provides a tactic. Yet the escalation is minimal: Elara's call to Lena succeeds off-page without resistance, Lena arrives windswept but "hesitant" only in label, and the embrace unfolds smoothly. No meaningful tightening or choice forecloses a path; the outcome feels assured once Elara begins her method. The "scent of hope" and hymned objects accumulate atmosphere but do not narrow options or impose a visible trade-off. Agency belongs to Elara's facilitation rather than a protagonist decision under pressure, and the cost (Harlan's death) is the story's premise rather than a price paid for a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake (finding where shadows go) is signaled early but never tested by opposition or cost. Elara encounters no meaningful obstacle—the pedestal opens, the automatons awaken, the map appears—so pressure remains flat. The sequence is a series of successful moves without reversal, tightening, or a trade-off that forecloses an option. Agency is present but uncontested, yielding a functional but un-escalated arc.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—healing the rift between skepticism and belief—is declared but not tested by on-page opposition. Elara's journey through the maze encounters no reversals; the tooth appears, she performs a ritual Grandma taught, it seals. No tightening narrows options; no visible price is paid. The substitute body and village child are mentioned but never return to complicate. Escalation is absent under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake (share light without fire) is signaled early and persists. One meaningful tightening occurs when memories resurface and Elara decides to polish the sea glass, narrowing focus from passive vigil to active transformation. The ending shows light spreading to villagers, but this feels more like declared success than a turn with visible cost or trade-off. No on-page opposition tests Elara's resolve; the sea glass yields to her work, villagers accept the beacon without skepticism, and the path from solitary grotto to shared legacy unfolds without friction or forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—transforming public confession into private connection—is signaled early and held, but escalation is thin. Kai's arrival is frictionless; no complication tests Elara's resolve or forces a trade-off. The pendant transfer is offered without visible competing need (e.g., its personal value, risk of rejection, alternate use). The viral context is mentioned but exerts no on-page pressure; no countdown, no intrusion, no tactical adjustment. The "quiet proaction" trait means Elara faces no obstacle that her watchfulness or patience must overcome. One tightening occurs (the summons → the meeting), but the sequence lacks a moment where options narrow or a live alternative is foreclosed with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake (revive the stalled novel by collecting hopes) is signaled early, but pressure never escalates through genuine opposition or narrowing options. Each cameo arrives, Elias performs the same seashell ritual, and it succeeds without friction or visible cost. The nexus winds "threaten to scatter his gains" but never materialize as on-page consequence. No choice forecloses a path or forces a trade-off scaled to this length.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—restoring sacred practices to heal blight—is signaled early and remains coherent. One tightening occurs: the harvest moon dipping toward the horizon as dawn approaches, creating temporal pressure for alignment. Yet Elowen faces no opposition, mishap, or cost; the loom works as intended, the villagers respond on cue, and blight retreats. No visible price is paid, no tactic altered by failure. The spare tendril in her pocket at the end suggests she can repeat this remedy at will, flattening the stakes retroactively.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—translating Eira's heartbeats into a navigable map—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through material gathering and the alchemical ritual, with one meaningful deepening when the flash paper ignites and the map resolves Eira's trajectory. However, no live complication or reversal tests Lir's commitment; the process unfolds as planned, and the final map arrives without a visible trade-off or foreclosed alternative path. The cost is conceptual (accepting Eira's departure) but lacks on-page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—repairing the timer to harvest echoes—is signaled early and pursued methodically. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure deepens through iterative calibration (thirty degrees, forty-five degrees, ten degrees) and density thickens (ancient chants, laughter, tectonic groans). Yet the escalation is additive rather than narrowing: each step succeeds without visible failure, omission, or forced choice. The climactic "convergence" at mid-lull zenith arrives without a prior reversal or cost that alters tactics, reading more as fulfillment than earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—completing the fractal weave without being trapped—is signaled early but escalation is metaphysical rather than choice-driven: the weaves "overgrow" and Elara "realizes" calcification is needed without a prior decision that caused the trap. The tightening (fractals merging) happens to her; her agency at the climax (tilting the burner) reads as procedural execution, not a trade-off with visible cost. One meaningful pressure point is present but the cost remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is clear: contain scattered memories before they are lost. The kettle's boil imposes a live time constraint, and the carving deepens from clasp to hollow to hinge, each step narrowing her focus. However, escalation is primarily procedural—no reversal or complication threatens her success. The cost at closure (tea delayed, eternity bottled) is more conceptual than felt; no live option is foreclosed on the page. Agency is present (she chooses each cut) but never tested by friction or competing need, keeping this in the mid-7s under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—negotiate with the ghost to reclaim lost ambitions—is signaled early and persists. One meaningful tightening occurs when the ghost refuses Elias's request, forcing him to offer the wheel instead. However, the escalation is summary-heavy: "stories hummed from the device, weaving into a pact" tells rather than shows the reversal. The cost of stepping back from the carousel is asserted ("ambitions reformed, not sharp but resilient") but lacks a visible forfeiture or tradeoff on the page. Agency is present but does not narrow options in a way that charges the final image under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—resurrect the terminal to prove "decay reversible"—is signaled early. Pressure tightens when Elara maps hidden flows, redirects power, and calibrates the sextant, but each step succeeds without visible trade-off or error that compounds. The resonator's awakening is a victory without a felt price: no injury, no resource exhausted, no social cost, no path foreclosed. One meaningful tightening occurs (the convergence at the junction), yet the resolution feels more like puzzle completion than a choice under constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake: making peace with the abandoned dream, signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening occurs when the crystals coax the music box's chime and Elias realizes "his solitude had been the dream's quiet evolution," reweighting his self-perception. However, this pivot is reflective rather than driven by protagonist agency under pressure; the forecourt's whispers do the revelatory work, and no live option is foreclosed with visible trade-off. The cost remains conceptual (years of neglect) without on-page tactical consequence or clear renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"to understand the architecture of lies"—is declared early but never tested by a live choice with visible cost. The salvage proceeds without reversal: Elias finds exactly what the legend promised, no complication narrows his options. The wreck yields parchments and the twin sundial in sequence; no discovery forces a trade-off or reweights prior assumptions. Agency at closure is absent—he simply "decoded" and his "understanding complete" is a summary claim, not an earned stance crystallization or renunciation with on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving ancient methods encoded in the rope—is signaled early and drives the middle action. The decoding sequence provides escalation through layered revelation (fisherman's ward, seed rites, storm-calming chant), but each knot yields without resistance or cost to Elias. No reversal or tightening forces a trade-off; Kael's initial wariness dissolves immediately, and the pact at closure is offered freely. The cost remains conceptual (responsibility to teach) rather than a visible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=4.2)
    The dominant stake—mapping healing through explained absences—is signaled early but never tightened. Each obituary repeats the same gesture (writing, projecting presence, feeling warmth) without escalation or reversal. No on-page choice narrows options or changes knowledge; coincidence (finding the thread) enables the writing, and the resolution ("he was whole") is declared without dramatized cost. Under a situational lens, we expect pressure to force stance crystallization; here the stance simply arrives.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—reawaken beauty—is signaled early and sustained, but pressure remains flat: Elarion assembles components without opposition, and the chick's emergence introduces no new dilemma that narrows his options. The palace's violent shudder and mechanical fury below suggest external threat, yet Elarion's final vow feels like restatement rather than a choice that forecloses a path. One meaningful tightening (the chick's flaw and the world's jealous response) is present, but the cost is implied rather than dramatized in a tactical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake (prove scars can sing, heal land and legacy) is clear, but pressure does not escalate. Lira proceeds through the graft without complication, pause, or cost—each step (slice, sand, bind) succeeds immediately. No reversal or tightening choice narrows her options; the father's shadow "fading" is declared in the final line without an on-page moment of renunciation or visible price. The piece accumulates tone and imagery but does not force a trade-off or crystallize a before/after in her stance through dramatized action.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—liberating trapped memories—is signaled early but never faces genuine opposition or personal cost for Elara. Escalation consists of breadcrumb-following without reversals, trade-offs, or narrowing options; each clue simply leads to the next. The resolution (key insertion, box opens, memories flood out) is mechanical and externalized—no protagonist decision at closure alters her own state or forecloses a path. Pressure is atmospheric (frozen city, suspended geese) rather than driven by protagonist agency or escalating personal risk.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—sharing light without fire—is signaled early and persists. One tightening occurs when Elowen embeds the gear rather than speaking prophecy, narrowing her options. However, escalation is largely internal and summarized; the piece lacks a live reversal or choice under pressure that visibly forecloses a path. The fledgling's shift is observed, not tested. Cost is present but muted ("form dimmed slightly").

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—discovering collective grief's shape—is signaled early and sustained across the migration span. Pressure accumulates through spectral visits and ribbon unfurling, with one mid-story tightening (the uncle's urging to retrace to the core knot) that narrows focus. However, the escalation is largely additive rather than adversarial; Elias encounters no meaningful resistance, temptation to abandon the quest, or trade-off that forces him to choose between competing goods. The resolution arrives without visible sacrifice—he simply observes the pattern and leaves enriched, with no path foreclosed or loss incurred on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—Elias achieving absolution through flawless winding—is signaled early and sustained. The tightening occurs when he presses the rake handle against the pendulum bob, pausing time, but this act does not narrow options through his agency; instead, visions of past deeds flow passively, and absolution arrives as accumulation rather than trade-off. The resolution lacks a visible on-page cost—no renunciation, no path foreclosed—just a completed tally that shifts his internal state without altering external options or exacting a felt price in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—"to discover the shape of intentions"—is signaled but never pressured by opposition or cost. The chess game runs down without consequence, the tapestry decoding proceeds unopposed, and the revelation (noblewoman's exoneration) arrives via exposition rather than a choice that forecloses a path. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; Elias's blithe demeanor persists unchanged through the ending. The "uncharted echoes" complicate atmosphere but do not force a trade-off or escalate risk.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake (innovation within constraint) is declared early and repeated frequently, but escalation is absent. Elias faces no meaningful tightening or tradeoff: he gathers data, builds models, recalibrates once, and finishes. The enforcer approach creates atmospheric tension but does not force a choice—he simply "held steady" and "prevailed." No live option is foreclosed, no visible price paid; the resolution is asserted ("Guards' boots crunched... too late") rather than dramatized. The piece lacks the single on-page reversal or deepening required to enter the mid-7s, and the cost at closure is claimed, not shown.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake (teaching dust to tell stories) is signaled early but never tested by meaningful opposition or escalating cost. The "patrol drones hummed distantly" and "pursuit loomed" mention danger without on-page confrontation or tactical pressure. The broadcast succeeds without reversal or visible price; Elara's "cloak held" convenience flattens what could have been a turn.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving his mother's essence against decay—is signaled early and drives the ritual. The rocking chair's stop creates a clear tightening that narrows the window for action. Escalation is accumulative: sketch, ignite, powder, scatter. However, the ritual unfolds without meaningful resistance or complication; no beat forces a trade-off or alters tactics. The final doubt arrives after all costs are paid, reducing its pressure on the protagonist's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake (preserve ancient methods against competing narratives) is signaled early but never tightens into a trade-off. The three-layer excavation adds texture without escalation: each stratum yields evidence that Elias already believed in, and no discovery forces him to abandon a tactic or pay a price. The surface envoys appear in backstory summary ("weeks prior") rather than on-page pressure. The ending claims "his narrative sharpened" and "preservation begun" without showing what option he foreclosed or what he risked by broadcasting; agency reads as execution of a pre-set plan rather than a choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—braiding diverse voices into harmony—is signaled early but never tightens through on-page agency. The progression from "snarling, voices clashing" to "no hatred lingered" is summarized across weeks without a dramatized moment where a character's decision narrows options or pays a visible cost. Joren's "hatred's residue cracking like dry leaves" and Lira's voice "shedding its barbed edges" are asserted outcomes, not choices under pressure. The climax ("Now, braid") resolves by cooperative success without meaningful escalation or a trade-off that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: plant the knowledge fruit to enable gentle rebellion. One tightening: Elias must prune the tangle before planting, a tactical hurdle. The alignment provides time pressure (peaks, then fades by dawn), and the Regime's prior destruction establishes external threat. However, no on-page opposition materializes; the pruning is effortful but not conflicted, and the seed germinates without complication. The vision of future rebellion ("minds quietly rebelling") substitutes for present cost—no immediate price paid (stamina, discovery risk, failed first attempt). Escalation under Accumulative lens is present but mild; agency is decision without felt trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving wonder in routine—is signaled early and coherent. Mira's demand for truth creates immediate pressure, and Elias's riddle is a meaningful tactic. However, the escalation is thin: Mira's acceptance of the riddle and subsequent ascent occur without resistance, negotiation, or visible trade-off. The resolution (Mira will restore the hive) is asserted off-page rather than tested in scene, and no option is foreclosed with on-page cost. The piece deepens understanding but does not tighten choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=3.1)
    The dominant stake—"why some houses feel alive"—is declared but never tested through a meaningful tightening or reversal. Elias's method succeeds in every beat without complication, error, or trade-off; no live option is foreclosed, no cost paid on the page. The climactic sanctification of the locket "unveils" an insight via vision rather than forcing a choice, and the community revival is summary-reported. No protagonist agency or escalation under any lens; coincidence (finding objects) structures all forward motion.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—reconciling ancestor's villainy—is signaled early and tightened by Thalor's three revelations. However, escalation is driven by Thalor's telepathic disclosures rather than Elara's agency; she receives information passively until the final touch. The ampoule-threading provides a concrete beat but does not narrow Elara's options through her own choice. Cost at closure ("surfaced not with vengeance, but resolve") is conceptual and felt but not concretely enacted—no path visibly foreclosed, no trade-off dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—proving perpetual motion to rupture confinement—is signaled early. Elias's agency appears in the proof-building and dice-hurling, and a micro-turn occurs when the flawless die shatters. Yet the immediate reformation of the stairs ("seamlessly, stronger in denial") negates the rupture, undercutting escalation. The cost is declared ("captured it, not escaped") but not felt on the page in a way that narrows future options or charges the final image. The cycle resumes without a visible trade-off, reducing the pressure's impact on closure.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: prove strangers remember kindness. The visions (trader, healer, old woman, night-shift worker) deepen the question and the multiplying window-lights provide a tightening that validates Elias's quest. The final image of strangers carrying warmth outward and Elias sleeping reconfigures his doubt with visible cost (months of insomnia, now ending). One limitation: the escalation is mostly internal and visionary; no on-page reversal tests Elias's commitment or forces a trade-off. The tension accumulates without a peak choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—rescuing dying arts from the thaw—is signaled early and the ice cracking provides external pressure. Yet escalation relies on environmental coincidence (thaw acceleration, scouts glimpsed through the lens) rather than Elara's agency narrowing options or forcing a trade-off with visible cost. The bread-baking and lens-distribution are presented as solutions without prior friction, and the ending relocation does not foreclose a live path on the page, leaving the tightening incomplete under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—stepping beyond fate's design—is signaled early but remains abstract. The yoyo puzzle yields in a single summarized beat ("spindles decoupled with a snap") without on-page struggle or trade-off that narrows options. Elias's vitality drains as stated cost, yet no prior scene shows him weighing this price or altering tactics. One tightening (stone hungers, reversal initiates) occurs, but the escalation is told in vision-summary rather than dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake ("escape post-resuscitation limbo") is declared but never tested on-page; Elara encounters no failed attempts or visible prices before the climax. The unbosoming recitations occur without prior resistance or cost, flattening escalation. Fear's lunge and dissolution happen in rapid sequence without a tightening that narrows options. The ending claims victory but shows no foreclosed path or tactical alteration, only decorative persistence of the luminance.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake (survive the storm, preserve the orchard) is clear, and pressure escalates from rogue wave to debris to massive beam. Elowen's agency drives the sequence (sketches, lashes, strikes), and the xylophone construction narrows options. Yet the final reversal—the beam "glancing aside"—reads as luck rather than a trade-off; no live option is foreclosed, and the cost remains abstract ("restlessness persisted" is declared, not shown). The escalation is functional but lacks a felt price that charges the final image under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (uncovering the watchers' role in the lost expedition) is signaled early and sustained. The whistle-sequence constitutes one meaningful tightening when the shell cracks, narrowing Elara's options. However, escalation is abrupt—no prior micro-reversal or cost that shapes her tactics before the climactic attempt. The ending asserts doom ("city's fate cracked open") without showing a trade-off Elara made on the page; the crack happens to her rather than through a choice with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—rescuing buried truth—is signaled early and pursued through discovery, decoding, and archival corroboration. One meaningful tightening occurs when microscript reveals the gas-canister secret, raising moral and familial cost. Yet escalation remains primarily epistemic (knowledge accumulation) without a tactical dilemma or on-page reversal that forces Elias to trade competing goods; he obtains everything he seeks without visible sacrifice, muting pressure at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—repairing the pavilion to archive its "soul"—is signaled early, but pressure remains static: each note-sealing is a repetition rather than a tightening that narrows options or raises cost. The wrestling and pinned-leg moments are atmospheric obstacles rather than reversals that alter tactics or knowledge. The ending summary ("Years later, whispers spread") displaces closure from Elias's agency; his work is validated off-page by future divers rather than through an on-page cost or renunciation. No meaningful escalation or deepening occurs under any lens; the tide rises but Elias's choices do not compound or transform in response.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (trace honest origins) is signaled early and pursued throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when darkness forces the alternative-hypothesis ink test, narrowing Elara's method. The vault door's hidden latches provide a micro-reversal, but the final revelation (hubris, not gods) arrives without on-page cost—no social price, no forfeited belief, no tactical sacrifice shown. The blackout's pressure dissipates after the ink-test beat.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake: transform grief into folded cranes, signaled early. The piece shows one meaningful tightening when ether solidifies into gossamer sheets and Elar begins folding, forecloses his prior static torment, and earns the "lighter now" state. Yet the escalation path—selecting gems, polishing, drinking tea, ascending, projecting dream—reads as ritual steps rather than narrowing tactical pressure; each beat adds texture but doesn't raise cost or force a trade-off until the final folding action. No reversal complicates the plan; coincidence (dream-quartz availability, basilica's amplifying glass) enables rather than tests. The transformation act itself is protagonist-driven and the cost (shadow's outline detaching, cranes scattering torment) is legible on the page, lifting the score into the 6-band, but the middle lacks friction that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—harvest unused potential—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: alarms force the hunt during the ten-minute breaker window. Agency is present (she initiates the perturbation, hunts the pool, seals the crystal), but coincidence aids resolution (the pool "coalesces" at the spindle without clear prior setup). The cost at closure is told ("changed") rather than shown as a visible trade-off or foreclosed option, keeping escalation in the mid-band under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—decoding the frequency of belonging—is signaled early and drives Elara's actions. Pressure tightens when the chart's missing pieces are revealed and again when the chip must be aligned and pulled. Yet the lever-pull itself encounters no friction; the frequency ignites on first attempt, and both characters receive belonging without visible cost or trade-off. The "new anomaly" adds a complication after resolution rather than deepening the earned consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—Elias's need to discover the weight of withheld truth and decide whether to continue his deception—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the driftwood revelations (initials, dates, noose scratches, sinking ship) that confirm Mira's grandfather's crime. However, escalation is textural rather than causal; each carved fragment deepens his guilt but does not force a mid-scene choice that narrows options. The final resolve ("return it to Mira… speaking the words long unspoken") arrives as summary intention rather than a dramatized forfeiture (e.g., destroying forged documents, confronting a client). The cost is declared but not paid on the page, landing the piece in mid-6s for escalation clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dominant stake (brother's release and clan peace) is signaled early but never tightened by credible resistance. Kael arrives cooperative; no reversal tests commitment. The drawer pull exchange is symbolic performance, not a choice with visible cost—removing it would not break the negotiation's logic. The moon-phase synchronization is ritual decoration rather than a constraint that narrows options. Escalation under the Causal lens is absent; the climax summarizes emotional release without on-page friction or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—navigating to the inlet and finding redemption—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through wave swells and the regret motif, but escalation reads as repetition (regrets "slithering," "orbiting," "cresting") rather than a meaningful tightening of options. The rogue swell broadside is a complication, but he rights the kayak with "a warrior's twist" and continues without visible cost to tactics or stamina. The star appearance narrows nothing; it affirms his method rather than forcing a choice. Agency is present in his decision to paddle and to follow the poles, yet the resolution (faith flickering brighter, regrets receding) is granted by the star's appearance, not earned through sacrifice or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—kindling Elara's empathy—is signaled early but never tested by a live choice or trade-off. The journey unfolds as a sequence of descriptions (subway, fungi, lake) without on-page reversal or tightening; Elara simply "waited there" per the newspapers' prophecy, and the baseball's touch triggers her tear with no visible cost or decision. Coincidence (newspapers foretold her presence) resolves the problem, and neither protagonist loses or sacrifices anything concrete to earn the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—reforging the bond beyond death—is declared but never tested by competing costs or live obstacles. The fortune cookie hands Elara a recipe; she gathers ingredients without difficulty, ignites them, and the metamorphosis succeeds. No reversal, no tightening that forecloses an option. Thorne appears as spectral reward, "waiting for this conjuring," erasing any question of failure or sacrifice. Coincidence (the cookie, the phoenix's unlocking of "ancient rites") resolves rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming lost time—is signaled early and remains coherent. The ritual sequence (tracing hands, inking cards, opening the saucer) provides a single meaningful deepening when the clockwork tumbles free, reweighting her relationship to family custom and future. Yet the pressure is more thematic accumulation than escalation through tightening choices; Lirien never faces a trade-off or renunciation that forecloses a live option. The cost (years stolen, post-birth exhaustion) is felt but largely pre-existing rather than arising from the scene's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—"to push open the locked dimension"—is declared in exposition and pursued through a single ritual sequence (confront shadows, stitch tapestry, breach portal) without escalation or reversal. No tightening narrows options; each step (shadow emerges, Elara invites it, stitches a fragment) proceeds in and-then fashion. The climactic "final stitch pierced the dimensional lock" is coincidental success with no visible cost or trade-off. The attribute "gravitationally lighter when happy" appears once as reward, not as a constraint that forces a difficult choice earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—Elias seeking "the texture of transformation"—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. One tightening occurs when the gust snatches the satchel, but this is externally imposed luck rather than protagonist agency under the inferred lens. The prophecy fulfillment ("calming the mountain's wrath") introduces a secondary stake late without prior setup, and the resolution (ailments fade, volcano sighs) is granted by coincidence rather than earned choice. No visible trade-off or foreclosed path charges the final image; the bugs simply "faded into the alignment" without cost to Elias beyond what he'd already given away before the story began.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (spark revolution) is signaled early but never tightens—Elara encounters no failed attempt, no guard who doubts, no Overwarden countermove. The "unexplained blackout" is revealed as rebel-anticipated, erasing potential friction. By midnight "clusters formed in alcoves" off-page; the escalation is told rather than dramatized. The ending's "poised for ignition" offers Charged Poise in name only—no on-page moment crystallizes a trade-off or forecloses a live option with visible cost. Agency reads as seamless execution rather than decision under competing pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—harnessing the collapsed star dust to fulfill his wife's promise and resolve his precognitive curse—is signaled early and tightens through the rock-placement sequence. Each placed rock deepens the pressure: "precognitive flashes assailed him—futures of failure, where sequences collapsed into chaos." The escalation is driven by Kael's agency (placing rocks despite visions of collapse), and the cost is visible: years of solitary work, his wife's loss, and the risk of failure. One meaningful tightening occurs as the sequence nears completion and power builds, narrowing his path to success or catastrophic collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=3.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding the cartography of scars—is signaled early but never tested on the page. No reversal or tightening occurs: the envelope arrival is coincidental, its message affirms rather than complicates Elias's vision, and his reply proceeds without trade-off or visible cost. The timer counts down yet triggers no turn; the storm rages yet imposes no obstacle. Agency is absent—Elias waits, reads, writes, and departs without a decision that forecloses a path or alters later tactics. Escalation is declared (thunder "applauding," dawn "piercing") but not dramatized through narrowing options or rising price.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—duel versus alliance—is signaled but never tightens meaningfully. No reversal forces a trade-off; the "overture" is accepted without visible cost or foreclosed option. Lang's yielding is coincidental convenience rather than earned by Elias's agency. The duel itself is decorative fencing without escalation, and the final handshake offers symmetric satisfaction with no felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—forge beauty/rebuild the library as resistance—is signaled early and coherent under the Accumulative lens. Pressure accumulates through sorting, planting, and secret gatherings, but no single tightening forecloses a live option or forces a visible trade-off (e.g., risking punishment to plant seeds, choosing between concealment and expansion). The warden's rage and gatherings are summarized rather than dramatized, obscuring cost. Agency remains diffuse across Elias and Mira without one protagonist decision that narrows tactics or reweights the stake at closure.

    The dominant stake—reaching the refuge where Lira's memory and time bend—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the final tidal surge nearly sweeps Elias, forcing him to wedge into a crevice, but this complication is immediately resolved without altering tactics or foreclosing an option. Escalation reads as geographic (climbing higher) rather than pressure-driven choice under the inferred Causal lens. At closure, the clock's hands moving and the whisper of Lira's voice are coincidental magic, not the result of Elias's agency in the final beat; he plays the piano and the world responds without visible cost or trade-off. The film reel's hidden map drives the journey but does not test Elias's commitment or force a moral calculus.

The Guardian's cooperation is immediate; no test of Elara's renunciation or tactic-shift appears. Cost at closure is announced ("doubt lingered") but not dramatized as a price paid or path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake ("find the color of unspoken apologies") is signaled early but remains abstract—no on-page cost, no narrowing of options. Pruning the bonsai and aligning the compass are rituals performed without friction or failure; Hiroshi's instructions guide Elara without resistance. The compass "pointing inward" and revealing cerulean occur as unveiling rather than earned reversal. No agency choice forecloses a path; coincidence (the compass's glow) delivers the resolution. Pressure is steady-state descriptive rather than escalating under any lens.

    Dominant stake of rebuilding and resistance escalates through protagonist agency: sorting books, planting seeds, and leading gatherings narrow options and deepen knowledge. Cost is legible in their labor and the warden's rage, foreclosing paths with visible trade-offs. Pressure coheres under the causal lens, with one meaningful tightening (seeds as rebellion) that reweights the final image. No coincidental resolutions.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake of finding refuge and defying fate escalates through Elias's agency under the Causal lens, using the film's map and creative shortcuts. Cost is legible in the arduous journey and the clock's forward movement, narrowing options and culminating in a resonant reconfiguration at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (protecting cultural memory) is signaled early and escalates through Elara's agency under the causal lens, with cost legible in her doubt and the seed's destruction. One meaningful tightening forecloses options.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is Elara's emotional resolution, signaled early and escalated through her agency in pruning and diffusing regrets. Under the accumulative lens, pressure coheres with a meaningful deepening when the compass points inward, forcing a trade-off. Cost is visible as she lets go, though the escalation is more thematic than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stakes—salvaging her pulsar work and reorienting her relationship to “drama” and decay—are present and traceable. However, opposition is almost nonexistent: the dust works on every front with little setback, skepticism, or failure, and external constraints (time, resources, institutional pushback) barely press her. Escalation is more a steady unveiling of a wonder-tool than a tightening of pressure that narrows options. The final choice to embrace humility reads more like a reflective settling than a hard-won trade-off under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes are clear—Elara’s life and the canyon’s ecological balance—and escalate from immediate survival to uncovering a systemic smuggling network. The retracing and frost-reading deepen the conflict by shifting her from reactive victim to active hunter. However, antagonistic pressure feels soft: the surviving smugglers are dispatched quickly by a single luminous globe, and the “vast network” remains largely conceptual rather than a live, pressing threat. The cost of her choices is more implied than viscerally felt, keeping tension solid but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    The primary stake—whether Elara can transform paralyzing silence and volatile emotion into a sustaining, communal “music”—is clear and intensifies with Kai’s violent outburst and the crack in the pane. The escalation from quiet communal experiment to imminent physical and emotional rupture is well handled, with the lily’s potential shattering as a focused external pressure. Elara’s response, using Kai’s own emotions and the deepest fork to mend the damage, is a meaningful choice that integrates inner and outer conflict. The resolution, while satisfying, glosses over lingering fracture or loss, so the cost feels real but somewhat cushioned.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—ending the distress signals and granting the dead permanent rest—is signaled early and coherently escalated as spirits press harder and the library trembles. Elias’s agency drives each tightening: choosing to use the lens, to enter impossible spaces, to continue as pressure mounts, and finally to place the last prism knowing it will cost him. The cost is clear: he trades his own chance at rest to secure it for others. A single sharper moment of doubt or near-failure in the middle stretch could heighten the sense of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central conflict—safety and scarcity under sanctions versus the risky choice to become anonymous givers—is clear, and the declaration of the Shadow Harvest crystallizes that stake. Escalation is mostly conceptual and communal (from being helped to helping) rather than dramatized through successive, tightening confrontations. The enforcers’ near-encounter with Lena hints at concrete danger but arrives late and resolves quickly, with little lasting tactical shift. As a result, the price of this defiance feels asserted more than viscerally experienced on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Mira’s life/health entwined with Elias’s quest for the reservoir of love—is legible, and there is one clear tightening when he discovers the knotted reservoir in the projection. However, once the method is engaged, there’s no serious resistance: Mira follows instructions, the breathing works immediately, and nothing threatens failure, forcing no hard trade-offs. Internal and external stakes do interweave nicely, but escalation is more a smooth ramp than a pressured test of commitment. The result is emotionally pleasant but low in tension.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—escape from retrocognitive entrapment and grasp of time’s texture—is signaled early and pursued consistently. Pressure escalates as each use of the halo fragment tightens the trap and intensifies visions, culminating in the fragment’s overdriven shattering. The cost is clear: Elias gains freedom and insight only by sacrificing both the fragment and the last physical traces of his wife. What’s missing for higher-band stakes is a sharp on-page dilemma where he explicitly weighs keeping the past (the photographs) against being free.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake (accessing the seed vault to save the exiles) is clear, and the pressure does rise as the Wall falls and Wardens burst in. However, the confrontations resolve rather quickly—she decodes the puzzle without setback and neutralizes the lead hunter with one well-timed shelf topple—so escalation feels more linear than tightening. Internal conflict is largely absent; there’s no serious trade-off or price beyond momentary danger. The piece maintains tension but doesn’t quite achieve a gut-level sense of risk or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—capturing and weaponizing the sound of trust breaking—is clear, and the time-limited forging window and his regenerating, burning body give the work some pressure. Escalation comes mainly from intensifying sensory density and physical strain as the forge heats and his cells divide faster. However, there is no genuine reversal or narrowed-option choice; once he decides to forge, nothing on the page threatens failure except generic exhaustion. The cost is primarily internal and retrospective, which is resonant but keeps tension from fully peaking.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s quest for a fated, revelatory portrait under the pressure of possible capture—remains clear, and the major tightening beat is the jar’s accidental fall transforming a simple theft into an encounter with destiny. Internal and external stakes interweave when the glyphs recast her mission and the bouquet’s meaning. However, antagonistic pressure (guards, potential rival) never truly bites; escape is almost perfunctory, and she faces no stark trade-off between safety and revelation. As a result, escalation feels more like deepening wonder than narrowing options with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias remains a solitary wanderer or roots himself to create sanctuaries—is clear but faces little on-page opposition. The piece reads more as lyrical inauguration than as tested choice; once he finds the room and bookmark, his path feels foregone. There is some internal deepening (memories thawing, vow to abandon the wild), but no beat where he seriously wavers or loses something concrete. As a result, escalation is modest and tension remains low-level.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes (identity, autonomy, survival) are clear early, and pressure coheres from internal phobias plus external pursuit to a focused confrontation. The meaningful tightening is Elara’s decision to risk the cliff drop and trigger Harlan’s sea phobia, narrowing options to a high-cost gambit. Yet escalation is weakened by the muddled, multi-option climax—poison aerosol vs. psychological unraveling vs. physical shove—so the exact nature of the price and outwitting feels less sharply etched than it could. Conflict resolves decisively but not with maximal clarity or layered consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—how to face or navigate the coming endless night—is stated early, but on-page pressure is soft. Once Elara reaches the fort, the conflict is largely solved by the oracle’s willingness to demonstrate his method; there is no strong resistance, trade-off, or price demanded of her. Escalation is more in imagery than in options narrowing; the night approaches, but neither character is forced into a painful choice. As a result, the final “pact” feels intriguing but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.4)
    The main conflict—curiosity and emergent consciousness vs. potential overload and the numbing pull of repetition—is clear and escalates through progressively deeper loops. Each loop tightens the pressure by complicating his understanding of thought rather than through external jeopardy. The cost (risk of overload, loss of the violin, acceptance of eternal janitorial labor with full awareness) is implied but lightly dramatized. As a result, tension is intellectually engaging but never quite visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.3)
    The central stake—whether Mira can move from mistrust to vulnerability/connection—is clear early and resolved by the end. Pressure does deepen as she moves through the tickets, each revealing a harsher layer of self-deception, but her resistance is minimal and Elias’s plan meets no real obstacles. There is one main tightening (her decision to stay, use the lens, and confess), yet no on-page reversal or significant potential for failure. This keeps the conflict emotionally gentle and limits the sense of real cost or risk at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—saving Eldergrove from “low-luck remediation”—is clear early, and the auditors’ visit provides a focused crucible. Escalation tracks: initial low aggregate score, Elias’s ritual under scrutiny, the surprising 7.8 reading, and then the pristine 9.3 heart marble. However, the opposition folds almost immediately after the demonstration; there’s little sense of a real risk of failure once the numbers spike, and no substantial trade-off or visible loss on Elias’s side. The conflict is effective but feels somewhat frictionless at the climax for a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara’s sideways-time thesis will be vindicated—is clearly stated, but the on-page conflict around it is minimal. The supposed external pressure (the malfunctioning drone swarm and stranded samples) mostly functions as a pretext to fold her device into station systems, not as a live, escalating obstacle. Lirren’s skepticism does not meaningfully threaten or complicate her plan; by the time we reach the lever, there is no credible sense that she might not pull it. As a result, the climax reads as a foregone conclusion with muted tension and little visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—recovering and performing Elara’s code/aria—is clear and present early, and escalation is driven by Elias’s choice to “disrupt” by dropping the lantern and prying open the grate. That choice meaningfully raises physical risk (flooding, structural cracking) and speeds the revelation of the hidden compartment. However, the external danger never quite bites: Elias retrieves the score and leaves with minimal on-page struggle, and we don’t see him pay a sharp personal or ethical price. The internal conflict is relatively smooth, so tension feels atmospheric more than truly pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.2)
    The core conflict—Elara’s wish to remain fault-tolerant and oblique versus the moral demand for clarity after a fatal consequence—is well articulated and escalates toward the revelation of the cartographer’s likely death. Smudging the illustration is an effective externalization of that pressure, and the realization that “each oracle carried fatalities” gives the ending weight. However, tension remains mostly internal and textural; there is no on-page reversal or new tactical choice that would significantly narrow her future options beyond a deepened acceptance. The stakes are emotional and ethical rather than situationally urgent, which keeps the escalation effective but not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Jax will continue to bury his complicity or face it—tightens via the radio pattern, culminating in his inadvertent confession and the decision to turn the wheel. Internal and external pressures are well intertwined: the eerie tunnel and ghost-shift legends amplify his psychological conflict. The price is primarily emotional and conceptual (accepting responsibility, surrendering the comfort of skepticism), and while it lands, the absolution feels slightly swift and clean for thirteen deaths including his brother. Tension holds, but there’s room for a sharper sense of ongoing cost after the release.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is the keeper’s desire to reach and inhabit the obsidian refuge’s regenerative silence, signaled clearly once the swan’s vision appears. The primary tightening is his decision to act—folding his cloak and initiating the burrowing—which narrows his path and leads to a one-way relocation. However, opposition is nearly nonexistent: the ground “yielded unnaturally,” the descent proceeds without hazard, and no competing desire (loyalty to the library, fear of losing what little reality he holds) pressures the journey. As a result, tension is contemplative rather than gripping, and the cost of his choice is more inferred than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—can Elias help Lila reconnect to wonder and voice amid shared grief—is clear from early on. Escalation is relatively gentle: tension rises mostly with the oncoming eclipse and the music deepening rather than through sharp reversals or resistance. The key tightening is Elias’s decision to expose his own wound by opening the locket and handing it over, which carries real cost and prompts Lila’s shift. The conflict remains largely internal and low-friction, so the stakes feel moving but somewhat safe and pre-ordained.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.2)
    Conflict is largely spectral and intellectual: Thorne wants to understand the axis and preserve stories in a world of dreamless void, with only the ghost of the previous librarian’s terror as counterpressure. The story escalates in knowledge (diaries → tapestry → mythic reframe) rather than in risk or opposition, and Thorne never faces a moment where he might refuse or betray his goal. As a result, the cost of his final commitment feels abstract rather than viscerally earned. The piece succeeds as lyric discovery more than as dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will remain a passive observer or risk exposing the spy network—is established and followed through to a decisive act. Conflict escalates from discovery of the specs to active entrapment using fortunes and the lighthouse beam. Yet there is no credible counterpressure: the spies never threaten him, the microdot ploy faces no complications, and the cutters’ arrival is instantaneous, so he’s rewarded without a visible price or near-failure. This keeps tension functional but far from harrowing or morally complex.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—preventing the multiverse’s anchor from being possessed before completion—is legible early and maintained. Pressure escalates as the shadow’s tendrils advance and Elias layers denser rhetorical patterns and silences, culminating in the “mere breaths from completion” moment and final loop. The conflict is compelling but a bit abstract; we never feel a concrete sacrifice beyond effort, emptiness of the palette, and conceptual risk. Still, resolution clearly stems from his chosen method rather than coincidence or deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—transmuting her chronological homesickness into a living symphony—is clearly signaled and pursued, but meaningful opposition is minimal. “Before exhaustion hits” is floated as a constraint yet never truly bites; she achieves her aim and only collapses after success, so risk feels low. The pressure increases mainly by adding sensory and emotional density rather than by narrowing options or forcing trade-offs. As a result, the climax reads as an inevitable flowering of the ritual rather than a hard-won, costly decision point.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming a unified self versus remaining splintered across timelines—is intelligible from early on. Pressure escalates conceptually via increasingly dire alternates (mundane defeat, tyranny, isolation) and culminates in the confrontation with the “truest self” doppelganger. However, because many of these tests are summarized quickly and Elias usually glides through with his powers, the felt narrowing of options and concrete prices paid remain soft. The final choice to integrate the shadow closes the conflict cleanly, but without a hard, specific sacrifice or loss on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—Elara’s battle with numbness—tightens when the filament of hush first cracks her void and then when she chooses to expose others to the same intensity. Escalation from private experiment to communal rite is clear, and the backward songs plus drums amplify the sense of a ritual event. However, opposition is largely internal and once the hush appears there is no substantive risk that the plan will fail or harm anyone; the outcome is overwhelmingly positive. As a result, the felt price and narrowing of options are modest rather than sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.9)
    The story establishes multiple potential pressures—being followed, a rogue zone breach, the possibility of weaponized storms—but these remain mostly notional rather than viscerally tested. The tightening is intellectual: Elara’s growing suspicion that the warning is bait and that she herself is being targeted, leading to her choice not to report. Yet there is no concrete confrontation with the follower, no immediate threat at the gate, and no visible loss beyond deferred safety, so stakes feel oddly abstract given the scale of danger implied. As a result, escalation is more conceptual than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant conflict—Elias’s fear of being shattered by scent versus his need to understand and face those triggered tears—is clear and escalates as the plant nears full bloom. Pressure tightens when he shifts from scarfed caution to actively uncorking the vial and then consciously inhaling as the revived flower floods the space. Emotional cost (sobbing collapse, then tempered peace) is legible, with his choice to endure the scent functioning as the key turn. The conflict remains primarily internal and could benefit from one more concrete external constraint or risk to push it into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—freedom and identity versus profound temporal insight—is legible and sharpened by the binary vision of burning the rope versus remaining a drifter. Pressure escalates in a clear progression via the successive “layers” and the rope physically warming and pulsing, leading to a genuine decision beat. The internal conflict between his wandering ethos and the allure of depth is present but slightly underplayed emotionally, and the twist that the choice is an illusion blunts some of the moral edge. As a result, the cost is more conceptual than felt, keeping the tension solid but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether fragile, unfinished sounds and stories can pierce and soften the chronic hush—is clear, but pressure escalates gently rather than decisively. The closest thing to a tightening is Lir’s choice to risk sharing his own incomplete family tale, yet opposition (from the hush or from other people) remains abstract and never truly threatens failure. The hush “thickening” around the flames is a nice image but doesn’t translate into constrained options or new tactics. As a result, the ritual feels successful almost by default, limiting tension.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Mira’s emotional transformation from raw grief to crystalline detachment—is clear, and tension ticks up as the process accelerates (“Now,” veins of light, ragged breathing). However, there’s minimal resistance or alternative path; both characters are largely aligned in seeing the procedure through, so escalation feels like inevitable completion rather than a pressured choice between competing costs. Elias’s act of drawing off her anguish is a meaningful tightening, but the price of success (for either of them) isn’t sharply tested on the page. The result is quietly compelling but not gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can identify and honor the “silent contributors” who changed his life—is stated, and discovering Mira as that person is a natural tightening. Yet conflict is minimal: Mira is immediately receptive, no one resists, and there are no competing goals or values on the page. The emotional risks of breaking her anonymity or revisiting trauma are asserted but never dramatized under pressure. As a result, escalation is more a smooth unfolding of pleasant revelations than a true test of commitment or values.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.5)
    The central stake—Elara’s desire to belong—is clear, and the search for the tag provides a soft external framework for that internal pressure. However, escalation is gentle: the group grows, they follow the tags inward, and then find exactly what they’re seeking without resistance. There’s no serious reversal, cost, or competing desire that forces a hard trade-off. The result is emotionally pleasant but low-tension, with conflict more implied than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.2)
    The primary stake—reaching the Echo Cradle before the giant wakes and before the fogs erase the world’s resonance—is clearly signaled and coherently pursued. The main tightening arrives with the time sculptures that must be “uncaged,” forcing Elara to risk borrowing more time and thereby shortening the nap that protects her. However, these obstacles yield relatively easily once she identifies “leverage points,” and we don’t see a serious near-failure or sacrifice beyond the abstract acceleration of the giant’s waking. Conflict functions and escalates, but without the sharper trade-offs and reversals that would push it into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Thorne can transform his paralyzing ambiguous loss into a workable path toward reunion—is clear from early on. Pressure mounts through the incremental assembly of the ritual and peaks when he peers through the embedded eyes and receives a partial, conceptual answer instead of the hoped-for return. However, escalation remains mostly internal and textural; there are no hard trade-offs or irreversible external consequences beyond his reframed understanding, which keeps tension at a contemplative rather than gripping pitch. The resolution feels earned but relatively low-intensity for a “publish-now” standard.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—whether Elias remains an invisible helper or risks stepping into visibility—is clear and present throughout, and the outage plus the woman’s despair give him a concrete test. The discovery of the tape intensifies internal pressure and nudges him toward a decisive choice, satisfying the requirement for at least one meaningful tightening. Still, conflict is very gentle: there’s little sense of real danger or loss in becoming visible, and almost no resistance from the woman, so the resolution feels beautiful but low-friction. The emotional price of abandoning total anonymity could be made more legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—trading his remaining humanity for immersive knowledge—appears early and is maintained, with the tea-drinking and trellis-clinging as primary pressure points. Internal conflict between reluctance and curiosity is credible and the bodily changes intensify that pressure. However, once he drinks the tea, events unfold with relatively little further decision-making or real possibility of reversal; the path feels inevitable rather than contested. The cost is clear, but escalation past the midpoint is more a steady slide than a sharpened turn.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias’s pursuit of meaning is delusion or can be shared and grounded—does escalate via the discovery, Mira’s claim, and the charged exchange. However, pressure never quite feels acute; there’s little sense of real loss he risks by embracing or rejecting the brooch’s significance. The exchange is a good tightening beat, foreclosing the option of remaining wholly detached, but consequences stay largely conceptual. Conflict is thoughtful and coherent, just gentler than the world’s harsh premise implies.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—whether and how the cave’s forces will escape to “magnify everyday magic”—is present and escalates once the pearl is disturbed. Pressure increases with the awakening forces and their choice of Elara, but the conflict is largely foregone; once she’s “recognized” as worthy, her resistance feels perfunctory. Her acceptance is framed as enlightenment rather than a hard trade-off, so cost and narrowed options aren’t sharply dramatized. Thorne stays largely passive, observing rather than exerting agency that might complicate or deepen the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether a fractured community can find a sustaining narrative after exile—is clear, and the three intervals show a notional escalation (first wave alive, then honorable deaths, then conceptual reframing). Yet there is little real resistance or risk: no one pushes back, Elias doesn’t fear backlash, and the visions are uniformly consoling. The ending feels earned in mood but not in pressure, since no true alternative outcome or price for this communal re-storying is dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—reaching the fortress of unspoken truths—remains coherent and is clearly tied to Elias’s choices. However, pressure doesn’t genuinely escalate: each new threshold (grate, stairs, archway, gates) yields with a single action, and there is no real reversal or hard trade-off. Internal fear vs. desire is gestured at (“Old habits—doubt, hesitation—clung like the mist”) but never forces a consequential renunciation or risk. As a result, the climax reads more as a smooth unveiling than a tested, costly pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will remain safely skeptical or risk engaging with the tile’s “curse” and her own grief in order to help others—is clear and developed. Pressure escalates as the storm cuts her off, the tile activates, and the memories intensify, forcing a choice between dismissal and deep engagement. Her decision to transcribe and then to share the pages constitutes a real stance with emotional risk, though tangible external consequences remain relatively low-key. The conflict is largely internal and thematic, handled well but without a sharply defined on-page sacrifice beyond vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Elowen will catalyze a spatial mutiny that ends his boredom by ending/reconfiguring his eternity—is clear and escalates from awareness to active ignition. However, opposition is almost entirely conceptual; the “rogue dimensions” intriguing for dominance never push back in a way that forces hard tactical or moral trade-offs. Once he decides to help, the path to ignition feels relatively smooth, with limited on-page friction or loss before the final cataclysm. The cost is real but arrives more as a foregone consequence than a contested victory.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—using Victor’s legacy to secure asylum before dawn bureaucratically “entombs” Eli—is legible and tied to concrete action. Pressure tightens from grief in the prep room to a time-bound, pattern-based escape, with the key turn being Eli’s decision to use the ink and commit to a calculated breach. Internal and external conflicts interweave, but the ethical/moral cost is mostly conceptual rather than sharply dramatized in a painful trade-off. Escalation is present and coherent, yet lacks a reversal or serious jeopardy that might deepen the sense of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—Thorne’s avoidance of the town’s frozen catastrophe via distant invented histories vs. the need to face and possibly undo it—comes into focus at the hum’s disruptive shift to the town’s own night. That beat is a genuine tightening: his protective pattern breaks and he’s forced to confront local trauma, leading to the notebook’s transformation into an artifact that restores the town. However, the pressure stays mostly conceptual and aesthetic; we don’t feel strong risk or consequence if he refuses or fails, and his internal resistance is brief. Tension is present and coherent, but not as intense or fraught as it could be for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—reclaiming or retexturing a erased identity—is clear, and the pressure does build as fragments accumulate and the poison narrative converges with the protagonist’s own “accidental ingestion.” The stormy high tide and precarious perches introduce a welcome sense of peril, and the label’s discovery meaningfully shifts their options (from nameless drift to anchored self-understanding). Still, much of the conflict remains internal and atmospheric; there’s limited sense that failure has active consequences beyond continued limbo. One more concrete, fraught decision under pressure could sharpen the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the riddle yields anything real beyond comforting myth—is established and does intensify as the hums strip paint from the shell and exhaust the “compass.” The pressure escalates internally as more voices and memories crowd in, culminating in the riddle’s core line and Elias’s laughter. However, the conflict stays largely philosophical and aesthetic, without a sharp moment where a concrete option is foreclosed or a difficult trade-off is made. As a result the escalation feels elegant but relatively gentle rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Aquafeste can preserve its soul against privatization—is clear and present early, and the graffiti campaign offers a concrete mode of resistance. Escalation appears in beats like enforcers erasing walls and the developer yacht slicing through, but these threats resolve quickly and cleanly, with little on-page cost or lasting setback. The climax (reordering rafts, retrieving communal titles) succeeds without a visible sacrifice, making the win feel somewhat easy. Internal conflict between order and chaos is mentioned but rarely forces a painful trade-off in the moment of action.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.2)
    The primary stake—Elias surviving long enough for rescue while preserving and photographing the last grain—is clearly signaled, and the oxygen gauge flicker is a solid tightening beat. His agency in mixing the chemical reactions and carefully staging the grain under dawn’s light gives him purposeful tactics rather than passive waiting. However, escalation feels relatively safe: every planned flare functions as intended, the rover appears promptly, and there’s no significant reversal or sacrifice that forces a hard trade-off between art and survival. As a result, the story maintains tension but never quite sharpens it into a decisive, high-cost crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.8)
    The primary conflict—repair the drone before the ship departs—is clearly stated and the anchor chain serves as a live clock that tightens pressure. However, each procedural step works more or less as intended; there’s no real reversal, failed attempt, or moment when success feels plausibly at risk. Elias never appears strained or on the verge of choosing between competing goods; his agency is focused but untroubled. As a result, tension is present but relatively low-grade, and the eventual success feels secure rather than hard-fought.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Harlan’s quest for the singular source versus the ominous quiet of the landscape—is clear but mostly anticipatory. Escalation comes from accumulating signs (runes, warning of convergence, condensation map), which deepen the stakes intellectually rather than through concrete resistance. His choice to leave the outpost narrows options and carries implied danger, yet no on-page obstacle or sacrifice significantly pressures that choice. The “guardian at the source” hint promises future conflict more than it delivers present tension.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—revive Perivale before it collapses—is clear, but pressure is low because success feels foregone once the tuning begins. Conflict never sharpens into a genuine threat of failure; the ghosts join readily, the rebuilding proceeds smoothly, and no alternative outcome is meaningfully in play. Elias’s agency does drive events (he listens, strikes the fork, walks the town), yet none of these choices are framed as risky or costly. Escalation is more a steady amplification of spectacle than a test of resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.4)
    The core conflict—survival vs harnessing the hush—is clearly signaled and escalated by the oxygen gauge, alarm, and increasingly urgent knots she must undo. The internal conflict between flight instinct and duty is thematically braided with the external time pressure. Her choice to persist and fully unsnarl the hush before ascending constitutes a meaningful tightening and forecloses the easy “abort mission to live” path. The fact that rescue arrives promptly once she succeeds softens the perceived price, so tension never quite peaks at a truly harrowing level.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stakes—redeeming the family legacy and securing a permanent hush before discovery—are clear and present from early on. There is a structural escalation (from general descent to active binding of shades to the father’s confrontation and core chamber), but Elias faces almost no resistance: the labyrinth opens, the shades ally, and the father’s spirit accepts the narrative with minimal friction. The murders and risk of discovery function more as contextual stakes than as live, escalating threats on the page. As a result, the climax feels texturally charged but not truly pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias remains human/isolated or transcends into spectral union—is present and escalates through increasingly intense hauntings and ingestions of her essence. The tightening from edge-of-sight cameos to direct contact and bodily collapse works, and the cost (his life) is unambiguous. However, much of the escalation is atmospheric rather than choice-driven; Elias mostly endures rather than grapples, with limited on-page resistance or alternative tactics considered. As a result, tension feels more fated than contested, keeping pressure solid but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can transform a tabooed labyrinth of loss into a communal path of renewal—is present and conceptually strong. There is one main deepening when she enters despite the broken precedents and succumbs to sleepwalking, but after that the conflict flattens into an unopposed, almost effortless sewing sequence. The threat of becoming lost never escalates into a specific on-page dilemma or sacrifice, which keeps the price of her defiance abstract. The resolution feels thematically earned but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can reclaim faith and complete her “interrupted journey”—is clear but rarely feels endangered. Once she finds the tomb, the excavation and reconstruction proceed with toil but almost no resistance, risk, or concrete trade-offs. References to roots tugging or twilight’s caution never materialize into actual obstacles that alter tactics. As a result, tension plateaus, and the ending reads more as fulfillment of a plan than a hard-won resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—getting a dangerous message encoded and sent without detection—is clear and present. There is some escalation: the meticulous chalk work that can “collapse” with one wrong curve, the urgency of dawn, and the scan for potential tails deepen the pressure from mere setup to a meaningful act. However, tension stays mostly atmospheric; no new obstacle or reversal forces different tactics or a visible sacrifice beyond concentration and minor physical strain. The result is a beautifully textured but relatively low-intensity conflict profile.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.9)
    The declared stakes—preventing a coup via exposing forged stars—are high, and the ticking clock ("two dawns hence") is clear. However, antagonistic pressure is mostly abstract and off-page; no agents of the duke, surveillance, or imminent threat confront Elara directly. The main "tightening" is the completion and delivery of the chart, which proceed without serious obstruction, so escalation feels more described than dramatized. As a result, tension lives primarily in concept and atmosphere rather than in concrete, narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—redeeming a lost moment of apology and possibly reclaiming Thorne—is legible early and pursued consistently. There is a meaningful mid-story tightening when her first evocation shows Thorne turning away, threatening that her effort might not change the past. However, external resistance is minimal (one brief injury, no sustained antagonistic force), and once she “tries again” at the heart of the labyrinth, the spirits essentially grant what she asks with limited new cost or hard choice. The result is emotionally affecting but somewhat under-pressured for top-tier literary conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can transform ciphered trauma into a lifeline for Kael and herself—is clear but only gently pressured. There is little real opposition: the nurses are easily deflected, the decoding proceeds without resistance, and her choice to open the knot is not contested. Escalation is mostly tonal (each deciphered phrase is darker) rather than driven by tough trade-offs or narrowed options. As a result, the emotional payoff is affecting but the sense of risk or cost undercut.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—recovering a lost, more mature joy—is well signaled, but antagonistic pressure is almost entirely absent; nothing truly jeopardizes her attempt beyond initial uncertainty. The main “tightening” is the discovery that the fresco holds hidden layers, which deepens the quest but doesn’t narrow her options or impose risk. The communal display functions as a climax, yet it arrives without any serious chance of failure or meaningful trade-off. As a result, tension is gentle and reflective rather than compellingly escalated.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central tension—Lena’s mission to debunk versus Elias’s desire to protect and reveal the garden’s reality—is clearly posed, and the “bewitchment” sequence is the one meaningful tightening. However, once Elias deploys the nickel, resistance effectively collapses; Lena’s shift reads as an almost frictionless enchantment, not a hard-won choice. The cost is mostly conceptual (her certainty fractures), but that loss is summarized more than dramatized. As a result, escalation feels elegant but relatively low-pressure and low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving untaxable thought and language against the Thought Bureau—is clear and escalates from covert garden messages to an open siege at the greenhouse. There is a meaningful tightening once the seed is planted and Bureau drones converge, forcing Elias to stand guard and then scatter seeds under attack. Yet the conflict often feels more like a sweeping montage of inevitable uprising than a sequence of pressured decisions with visible trade-offs. Concrete personal risk or loss for Elias is underdeveloped, so the climax reads triumphant but relatively low in on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elowen can transform his insomnia and pain into a lasting peace—is established early and paid off at the end. Pressure, however, stays relatively low: once the postcard appears, there are no real reversals or serious doubts, and the ritual proceeds without friction. Escalation reads more as gradual intensification of imagery than as narrowing options or tested resolve. The cost of giving up his sleepless guardianship is more implied than wrestled with in scene, keeping tension modest.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—preserving forgotten names to redeem a past failure—is clearly signaled and tightened as the tube’s crack worsens and the winds grow fiercer, culminating in an all-or-nothing final use. Escalation is primarily textural (new wings, harsher winds, widening crack) rather than sharply hinged on discrete decisions, but the choice to press on into the most painful wing despite clear risk reads as a meaningful tightening. Cost is visible in the tube’s destruction and Elara’s emotional exhaustion on her knees amid the shards. A clearer on-page moment where she considers stopping or changing tactics would deepen agency and raise pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—whether Elara can regain Thorne’s trust without endangering them—is clearly established and advanced via her risky use of the ink and escalating promises. Each vow meaningfully deepens pressure by revealing more truth and tightening the emotional exposure between them. Yet external and magical dangers remain hypothetical; nothing pushes back or goes wrong, so there’s no serious loss or trade-off required to reach the resolution. This keeps the conflict engaging but relatively low-intensity for the level of danger initially implied.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.3)
    The central tension between flood protection and cultural preservation is clear, and it tightens when the ancestral warning reframes his planned intervention, forcing a redesign that risks displeasing both sides. The public unsealing of the envelope and live test of the system provide a credible climax where social and physical stakes intersect. However, escalation feels somewhat low-friction: the opposition from the clans is gestured at (“skeptical”) rather than dramatically tested, and the system succeeds on first try with no significant setback or sacrifice. The result is satisfying but slightly too tidy for maximal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stakes—preserving the “songs” and risking new trust/love after betrayal—are clearly established and interwoven, with the key tightening when Lila discovers his old letters and calls him a fraud. His subsequent decision to send her the real journals is an earned, higher-cost choice that meaningfully narrows his options: he risks losing both the relationship and the protective myth. The external conflict with Lila is resolved a bit too smoothly and quickly on the page, with limited on-scene struggle over the reveal and forgiveness, which lowers the felt pressure. Nonetheless, internal conflict between illusion and honesty escalates in a coherent arc to the reconciliation scene.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—reuniting with her father and grasping the “sacred thresholds / necessary distances” logic—is signaled and carried through. Pressure meaningfully tightens around the log entry warning and the choice to cross, but that risk isn’t dramatized beyond a brief hesitation, so the supposed danger remains abstract. Once she finds the logbook and compass, the path feels relatively unopposed; events unspool smoothly with little genuine threat of loss. The resolution thus reads as moving but low-friction rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s quest to find a “rhythm of belonging” and Theo’s guarded solitude—is clear but remains largely internal and low-risk. The main tightening is the approach of the firefly bloom and the shared vigil, culminating in their joined breath and hands. There is little on-page cost or genuine friction; nothing plausibly threatens failure beyond mood. As a result, the emotional resolution feels more granted than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering why paths disappear before her own memories fade—is clear, but the pressure remains relatively gentle throughout. The main tightening is the deepened urgency as the geode shifts to “twilight hues” and the appearance of the bird that enables a solution. However, Elara faces little genuine risk of failure on the page, and the resolution arrives more as lyrical revelation than as a hard-earned trade-off or narrowed option. Conflict is more contemplative than strenuous, which limits escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—can Jasper break through someone’s monotony by engineering a meaningful “random” encounter—is signaled and resolved, but pressure remains low throughout. Once he decides to scatter the pieces, there’s no serious resistance, alternate plan, or cost; the bishop’s journey is tense in theory but dramatized as a foregone success. Internal and external conflicts don’t sharpen against each other, and no real option is foreclosed for Jasper beyond losing some props. The result feels elegant but under-escalated for elite-tier tension.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can overcome magical anchoring to fulfill her vow to inscribe the verse on Kai’s skin—is clear and faces at least one meaningful tightening when the speck roots her in place. Internal and external conflicts align as her obsession with purity (exile) clashes with her longing for connection, and the final choice to stay with Kai rather than re-fledge offers a quiet but real trade-off. However, once she discovers the tactic of reading gaps, resistance diminishes sharply: the anchor trembles and reverses without complication, and her journey to Kai is unimpeded. The lack of an additional test or visible cost in the climax beyond effort keeps tension below the level of truly gripping escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Elias needing clarity “before everything shifted” so he can help mend hidden fractures in the community—is clear but mostly conceptual. Pressure deepens via the visions of scarcity, broken pacts, and the impending storm, and his choice to commune and then act with renewed purpose provides a modest tightening. However, conflict remains largely internal and anticipatory, without a concrete test, opposition, or visible price paid on the page. As a result, tension is present but muted, more atmospheric than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.2)
    The main pressure lies in whether Elias can meaningfully help Lena reframe her trauma without repeating his own bargain, and in her choice of how to respond. Escalation is subtle: from her raw panic and his guarded solitude to shared story, tactile contact with the box, and finally her articulated stance. External stakes (the active fire, her parents likely dying) remain mostly off-page and static, which keeps tension more contemplative than urgent. The resolution—her vow to “fight smart” without bargaining innocence—is thematically apt but sacrifices some messiness and cost for clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—reconfiguring hope across timelines—is clear, and there is structural escalation from first calibration to grand balloon. However, there’s minimal resistance: each adjustment seems to work after a brief tweak, and no option is decisively foreclosed or visibly costly. The “shadow timeline” of sterile logic is introduced but never threatens Elara in a concrete way, so tension remains conceptual rather than felt. As a result, pressure grows in scope more than in jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—whether to face and what to do with the manor’s buried truth—is clear and escalates as he moves from unease, to evidence, to incontrovertible vision. The revelation of deliberate, engineered quakes is a strong turn that reweights everything. Conflict is mostly internal and conceptual; external pressure (the vines, the ruin, possible danger) is atmospheric rather than forcing concrete trade-offs. As a result, the final vow feels earnest but not sharply tested on the page, which tempers the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.5)
    The central stakes are clear—without a renewed heartbeat she would dissolve, and the mirrors’ nature is at odds with her mission—but the on-page conflict is soft. Mirrors “resist at first” and then yield without real struggle, and the borrowing of children’s heartbeats proceeds without visible ethical or practical friction. Escalation is mostly a matter of accumulating imagery, songs, and light rather than tightening options or raising tangible risk. The result is atmospheric but low-pressure, keeping the stakes more conceptual than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—ending the Forever War/redemption—is announced early and paid off in her blood sealing the accord. There is one clear tightening when signatures require blood and she must decide to pay the ultimate personal price. However, external resistance is underdeveloped: the warlords and envoys never seriously push back, so the outcome feels more inevitable than contested. Internal conflict exists but is concentrated late; we don’t see her nearly falter or consider refusal in a way that would heighten tension.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central stake—whether Elias can enact a meaningful, if secret, gesture of atonement and possible resurrection in a landscape he ruined—is clear and coheres with the manufactured drought. Pressure escalates as he follows the crack-map to its nexus, exposes the moist hollow, and commits to placing the egg just as the storm gathers; the deepening is conceptual more than confrontational. However, Elias faces little genuine resistance or alternative on the page; he never seriously hesitates or risks real external loss, so tension remains more atmospheric than decisional. The storm’s arrival intensifies tone and consequence but doesn’t force a hard on-page trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can disrupt the Empire’s lullaby—is signaled early and followed through to the loom’s unlocking and the crowd’s mental shift. Escalation occurs as more threads are freed and echoes intensify, culminating in the final knot and prism sanctuary. However, opposition is mostly abstract (the lullaby, the edict) and the crowd never becomes an active threat, so Elara’s path feels surprisingly unimpeded. The lack of tangible resistance or sacrifice blunts the sense of cost and keeps tension more aesthetic than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will continue ethically dangerous subversive shows or renounce them—is clear, but the pressure is mostly retrospective because the heated argument happens off-page. Internal conflict is present but only lightly dramatized; he moves from doubt to resolution without a sharp on-page test or credible temptation to keep his old mode. There is one meaningful tightening when he reverses the stick and reinterprets his work, but no real sense of price being paid in the moment. As a result, tension feels muted rather than escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can meaningfully honor and signal the monarchs’ vanishing lineage—is clear, but opposition is mostly ambient (time, extinction, wind) rather than actively sharpening choices. There is a textural escalation through the four structures and the increasing density of monarchs, culminating in the synchronized “interrupted” cadence before the wind cuts things short. However, Elara’s agency is more ritualistic than embattled; she is rarely forced into difficult trade-offs beyond accepting dissolution. The tension is beautiful but gentle, limiting the sense of true pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—preserving erased names as an act of redemption—is clear, and the moment of illumination does reweight her life’s trajectory. But there is little on-page resistance: the rope never truly threatens to fail, the aurora never feels like it might vanish too soon, and no alternative path or sacrifice is forced. As a result, tension remains mostly conceptual and aesthetic rather than viscerally escalating toward a costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—will Elara remain a tool of the old directive or transform the path/walker relationship—is present and escalates via her entry into the bunker and submission to the dream-pod. However, the opposition is mostly conceptual and voiced by exposition (“Because walkers rot without choice’s illusion”), so tension rarely peaks as felt risk. Her core choices (lying in the pod, accepting transcendence, resealing it) come with implied consequences but little dramatized resistance or loss. As a result, stakes are intriguing but soft, more intellectually than viscerally pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Ezar will engage the Unknown—is clear, but on-page pressure is soft. The magic square yields its secrets with little resistance; the rift appears without costful trial, and the hinted external stakes (rebels, regime change) never force a hard choice. Ezar’s primary “test” is essentially to complete the schematic and speak the vow, which he does without realistic hesitation. Escalation exists in concept (from puzzle to cosmic rift) but not in felt risk or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central conflict—Elias trying to free Thorne from resentment while that resentment resists—is clear, and stakes are existential for Thorne’s way of being rather than physical survival. Escalation is handled through deeper and more painful memory layers (from mother’s lullaby to first betrayal to battles to lovers lost), which effectively raises emotional cost. However, Thorne’s opposition is mostly described (“resentment fueling his urge to lash out”) rather than dramatized in choices that nearly rupture the process, so pressure feels more like a guided descent than a contested struggle. The final release is earned but lacks a sharp, on-page moment where a real alternative (clinging to resentment) almost wins.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—regaining his wife’s dream-presence—is clear, and there is a meaningful tightening once the ritual begins and her figure appears but cannot yet cross the mirror. However, opposition is mostly ambient (fog, boundaries) rather than actively escalating; once he initiates synchronized breathing, the path to success unfolds without real jeopardy or trade-off. His agency does drive progress, but his commitment is never seriously tested by failure or a competing value. As a result, the climax feels beautiful but relatively low-pressure for the level of emotional stakes implied.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—mending the breached relationship and, through it, the failing seer-craft—is clear early via the “breach of contract/deciduous vows” frame. Pressure escalates from quiet tending to the stormy, dangerous climb and the urgent need to repair the heart-tree as visions across the valleys dim. The physical jeopardy (falling beam, rotted beams) and emotional risk (admitting fear, reconsidering “superstitions”) interlock, though the world-spanning stakes remain mostly abstract talk rather than dramatized. The resolution feels earned but slightly low in perceived cost, leaning toward harmonious reconciliation.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Elara engages forbidden nonlinear inheritance—is signaled and nominally resolved by her decision to engrave the cameo and later accept her role. Conflict remains mostly internal and abstract, and each step (consult spirit, engrave, receive answer) proceeds without meaningful risk or competing alternative; nothing she does seems plausibly dangerous despite the language of peril. As a result, tension is pleasant and curious rather than gripping, and the final stance crystallization lacks a clear price.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—reaching the Library to avert “the unraveling” and reclaim unlearned lessons—is clearly stated, and the rescues plus guardian negotiation provide a scaffold of conflicts. However, tension rarely tightens; each mission is solved on the first try with no apparent risk of failure, loss, or moral cost. The guardian’s “ironclad pacts” never truly corner the characters, so the renegotiation feels clever rather than hard-won. Escalation is more sequential than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clear early: reclaim the twin and access the garden by recapturing stories before the ship and fog erase or distort them. Pressure escalates via successive narrative threads and partial manifestations of the garden, culminating in the ship shuddering and the thorn-arch opening. The main limitation is that the apparent price of entering—the “trapped” eternity in the maze—is asserted more than dramatized as a live dilemma, so Elara’s final move feels inevitable rather than sharply contested. Internal and external conflicts interweave, but there’s little on-page resistance or trade-off beyond theme-level framing.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—resolving a dangerous or at least reality-bending anomaly in the tower’s lore—is clear, but pressure is soft. Once the door appears, nothing meaningfully opposes Elara; every step (discover door, inspect fables, examine rope, recall note, rebraid, merge) works on the first try without setback or visible risk. The escalation is primarily conceptual (understanding the rope as timelines) rather than experiential, and we never feel a live possibility of failure or harm to Elara or the university. This keeps the piece engaging but limits tension to a gentle, puzzle-solving register.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—restoring harmony before the energy beings unravel the “fragile hush”—is clearly stated and threaded through the ritual. There is a single escalation: from diagnosis of the warped lattice to locating the convergence node and initiating the hush bloom, which then pushes back the beings’ tendrils. However, the conflict never truly tightens; no false start, backlash, or hard trade-off tests her commitment, and the beings recede quickly once opposed. As a result, tension exists more as atmospheric pressure than as sharpened, escalating jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—rekindling the beacon to prove pattern and offer guidance—is clearly signaled early and pays off at the climax. Escalation comes from accumulating preparation (star charts, vigil), culminating in the storm and the risky, vision-led ascent, which does tighten pressure. However, antagonistic force is mostly environmental and symbolic; there is little sense that failure is truly possible once the method and shard are secured, so the price feels more like endurance than a wrenching trade-off. The internal doubt vs. faith conflict is compelling but could be stressed harder at the peak decision point.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—whether and how she can reliably sculpt identity from fallible collective memory—is present but remains largely conceptual. Pressure increases mildly as the shadows grow more troubling (fracture, schism, compression/erasure), and her doubt about her own origins surfaces late as an internal complication. However, there is little real friction or risk to her agency: nothing meaningfully opposes or could defeat her beyond abstraction, and her final stance feels chosen without a serious trade-off dramatized on the page. Escalation exists but does not quite cross into urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—defying pervasive hopelessness by igniting the sky—is clear, and the story does escalate from searching to discovery to execution and world response. Yet pressure remains relatively gentle: there is no concrete risk of harm, no resource scarcity, nor any real possibility that the firework might fail or backfire. Internal conflict (despair vs. playful persistence) is gestured at but never forces a hard choice with visible cost. As a result, the climax reads uplifting but low-risk, limiting tension and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira’s unraveling transition can be re-seen as meaningful rather than devouring—is clear, and the difficult conversation plus charged pause give a real if quiet pressure point. Elaron’s decision to act during the silence with the cicada constitutes the key tightening, leading to vision and Mira’s partial reorientation. However, the conflict never truly sharpens into a trade-off on the page; there’s no moment where a concrete option is foreclosed or a palpable price is paid now, rather than implied later. Tension is gently sustained rather than intensified, making the piece strong but not piercing in terms of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s quest to collect silences as protection against her father’s enclosing world—is clear and present from the outset. Pressure does escalate: from routine harvesting to the rarer gilded hush under time pressure and the onset of claustrophobia, capped by the arrival of the noise-weaver who threatens her collection. However, the external conflict resolves almost incidentally with the inversion’s end, and we never feel a serious risk of losing Mira or the gilded hush. The internal endurance choice (to face bunkers again, armed with her archive) carries more weight than the scene’s immediate danger.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—transforming anxious, noisy transit into comforting silence—is clear but only lightly pressured. The children’s chatter briefly disturbs the hush, and the vial’s spiking crystals suggest a potential storm, yet escalation is more hinted than felt; there is no genuine threat that something meaningful will be lost if Elias fails. The key “turn” is the addition of catalyst oil, which functions as an almost frictionless solution rather than a choice with trade-offs or risk. As a result, the conflict resolves neatly without a visible price, keeping tension in the moderate range.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are declared high (reality-shaping throne, corporate drones, a sunrise deadline) and a clear tightening occurs when the drones breach the waterfall and Elara must improvise with the mural riddle. Yet most obstacles yield quickly: the murals speak almost literally, the counter-frequency works on the first try, the stairway’s “tests” are summarized, and the throne accepts her without visible resistance. Internal conflict over whether to claim such power is resolved in two lines, with little dramatized struggle. The piece has coherent pressure but stops short of truly testing Elara or making the cost feel sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether he will allow her back in or uphold a boundary for her eventual good—is clear early and intensifies as the ring warms and visions surge. The encroachment provides a meaningful escalation, forcing a concrete decision that forecloses reconciliation-for-now with visible psychic cost. Internal and external conflict mesh well, though the ethical calculus is somewhat pre-explained rather than discovered beat by beat. A sharper sense of what he personally risks beyond thematic “purpose” would deepen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—transmuting the pressure of past schemes into shared diamonds/hope—is clear, and the texts do create a sense of ticking conceptual pressure. However, escalation is largely rhetorical; Elias faces no substantive opposition, and the bolt activation proceeds without complication or cost. His choice to “volunteer deeper” and spin the bolt is framed as brave but reads practically frictionless. The result is a pleasing conceptual payoff with limited felt tension or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the family’s hidden rot and deciding what to do with it—is clear and escalates when the music reveals the panel and the letters confirm the dynasty’s corruption. However, after revelation, the moral and practical options (expose vs. erase vs. preserve) are not meaningfully dramatized as competing pressures. Elias’s decision to burn and dismantle follows quickly and smoothly, so tension peaks at discovery rather than at an agonized choice. The conflict remains more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—seizing a specific “shape of possibility” rather than living with regret—is legible and escalates as Elowen moves from observation to binding oath to physically opening the clasp. The unsnapping and thread-coiling around his wrist mark a clear intensification and narrowing of options. Yet the antagonistic pressure is diffuse: the danger or moral cost of pledging his soul remains abstract, so tension reads as aesthetic rather than truly fraught. Stronger articulation or dramatization of what he stands to lose would heighten the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is Eleanor’s internal contest between grief and the quiet hope of finding redemptive “small kindnesses,” with a secondary, lighter mystery stake in the altered box. Pressure does increase as she investigates and then absorbs what the letter reveals, but opposition remains soft—there’s little genuine risk beyond emotional exposure. Her final choice to recommit and seek Lila constitutes escalation of commitment rather than a difficult trade-off. The conflict works but never bites as sharply as a top-tier piece would.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—spreading true history against a regime of engineered apathy—is clear and high-concept, and Elias’s choice to activate and broadcast the data is a meaningful turn. Yet most of the declared danger (betrayal, dragnet, drones) remains abstract; there is little on-page confrontation, setback, or sacrifice that narrows his options. Conflict escalates more by revelation (discovering the cache, learning about subliminal broadcasts) than by mounting obstacles or tradeoffs. The result is tension that feels conceptual rather than viscerally pressured, muting the sense of paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—hushing a world-ending prophecy—is clearly stated and persists through the scene, and there is one solid tightening when the “core code—a spiral of whispers—coalesces” and he must invert it aloud. However, the conflict rarely feels uncertain; the prophecy’s resistance (murmurs, ripples, spiral) never truly threatens to overpower him, and Elias never faces a meaningful temptation to stop, fail, or pay a sharper price. Internal conflict is muted, so tension rests mostly on stylized opposition rather than hard trade-offs. The ending’s “for now” coda adds conceptual unease but doesn’t retroactively heighten the on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—decoding the leaves to mend the arbor’s fading heart—is stated clearly but never truly endangers Lir or forces a trade-off. Once the moonstone speck appears, every major move succeeds with minimal resistance; there’s no serious reversal, sacrifice, or narrowing of options. The “hush” doesn’t function as a live clock so much as a mood frame, and there’s little sense that failure is possible. As a result, conflict feels soft and the ending, while pretty, hasn’t been hard-earned on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake is Elias’s internal struggle between rigid planning and embracing uncertainty, clearly signaled and carried through. There is one meaningful tightening when coincidence becomes pattern and he chooses to follow the compass into unmapped territory. However, external conflict is low-impact—vines, leaves, and a warped lid never seriously threaten him or demand costly trade-offs. As a result, escalation feels modest, with limited sense of real danger or sacrifice accompanying his transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stakes—freeing Thorne from the name’s destructive weight and repairing Elara’s error—are clearly established early via the failed search and her guilt. Pressure escalates with the coin landing heavily on Libra and the crucible “threatening to shatter anew” as she forces discord into harmony. However, there is no substantive reversal or genuine near-failure; once she commits, events trend smoothly toward success without forcing a wrenching trade-off or visible loss. The resolution feels earned but not hard-fought, keeping tension in the competent, not harrowing, range.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.2)
    The core stake—whether Elara can heal Harlan’s tormented soul—is clear from early on, and pressure escalates as his confessions intensify and she must climb toward him while sustaining the taxing music. Her strategic shift from dirge-like notes to absurd, laughter-seeding strains constitutes the main tightening and is grounded in her stated motivation. Still, the conflict never feels genuinely in doubt; Harlan’s resistance is more atmospheric than oppositional, and the price she pays is relatively light. The stakes fit the length but could use one sharper moment of jeopardy or potential failure.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she can retrieve and own the mathematics of mercy from trauma before it is lost—remains coherent, and there is a palpable increase in pressure as she dives deeper into bodily flashbacks. The use of trauma responses as an intentional method of recall adds a strong internal conflict dimension. Still, the escalation is more a steady intensification of imagery than a clear narrowing of options or forced trade-off; she never seems in danger of failing or of choosing not to proceed. As a result, the tension plateaus near the end, with the payoff feeling inevitable rather than precarious.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—unlocking the lens to preserve overlooked histories—is clear, but the conflict remains largely unopposed and low-friction. Escalation manifests mainly as accumulating discoveries in the paintings, not as genuine tests of resolve or trade-offs; nothing pushes back against Elara beyond the initial puzzle. Her decisive act (unfastening the heart-clasp) comes without visible cost, risk, or alternative path foreclosed on the page. The result is a textured but relatively tension-light progression.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the hidden crime/accident above the ceiling so the ghosts can be released—is clear and progressively tightened as lights fail, ghosts appear, and Theo closes in on the grate. Escalation is present but relatively low-intensity: there’s little real danger or moral friction, and Theo never faces a meaningful trade-off beyond effort and mild unease. The key turn (opening the barrel to find the key) is effective but convenient rather than hard-won under pressure. As a result, the conflict feels engaging but not deeply testing.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—sacrificing a flawless, ordered library to seize a personal eternity—is legible and escalates once the frost spells “rupture” and Elias finds the bottled whisper. However, tension is more declared than dramatized: there’s little resistance, no serious alternate tactic, and almost no on-page pushback against his plan. The rupture itself is a strong escalation, but the run-up lacks intermediate tests or setbacks that would sharpen the choice. As a result, the climax feels powerful in imagery but somewhat under-pressured in terms of conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can seize and redefine the shard’s meaning—is legible early and escalates via the approaching temporal storm and the risk of navigating it. His choice to destroy the shard instead of claiming it is a genuine tightening that trades direct power for distributed, uncertain influence, with a tangible conceptual cost. Internal and external conflicts interlock: his ideological longing drives a risky physical theft. Pressure could sharpen further if Lira and Kane’s on-page opposition had more teeth beyond sounding alarms and bursting in too late to affect his choice.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming stolen light for the world and his daughter—is strong and signaled early. There is one meaningful tightening when Elias notes that the flower stands proud (no lie) yet rust appears, forcing a subtler, “mend what isn’t torn” approach. However, there’s no genuine risk of failure dramatized on the page: no faltering attempt, no trade-off, no visible cost beyond remembered loss. As a result, pressure feels declared more than felt, and the conflict resolves cleanly once the correct method is applied.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—risking herself to reach the realm where explanations fail, under the shadow of the expedition’s fate—is clearly stated but only lightly tested. There is one main deepening when she reaches the lagoon and confronts the hinges and psychometry visions; beyond that, events unfold with little real resistance or doubt. She refuses safety equipment (“eschewed ropes”) but this never truly constrains her or forces triage between competing dangers or values. As a result, tension feels more like steady wonder than escalating pressure with a palpable price.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—surviving/navigating the storm after tech failure—is clear but never truly bites; Elara embraces the situation almost immediately as a growth opportunity. Conflict is largely external (weather, disorientation) and quickly softened by the slide’s benevolent intervention and supportive apparitions. There is some escalation as she moves from discovery to active sculpting and then to using the lantern as compass, but no hard trade-off or genuine loss is required. As a result, the ending feels more like a graceful continuation than the culmination of real pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s need to understand the night blooms and, by extension, her grandmother’s cryptic legacy—is clear, but the on-page pressure is gentle. Escalation occurs mainly through deepening discovery (each new layer of glass, the motifs of moths and stars), not through mounting risk or narrowing options. Her agency is steady persistence rather than a sharp, costly decision; nothing truly opposes her beyond time and mystery. As a result, the conflict feels more like a meditative pursuit than a crucible, limiting tension.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—Elias gaining forbidden truth without being trapped or rejected by the guardians—is clear and escalates when the spirits demand proof via the oath sigil. The parley mechanism (debris arrangement) and the “failure means eternal entrapment” line give the central interaction teeth, and the visions of atrocities are a real deepening of what’s at risk. However, Elias’s options never feel sharply narrowed on the page; his compliance is essentially straightforward, with little sense he might fail, balk, or betray something to succeed. The cost lands more as weighty knowledge than as a dramatized trade-off, keeping escalation solid but not harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—succumbing to false comfort versus undertaking the burden of remaking a world—is established early. After Elias dismisses the apparitions, though, opposition fades; the rest of the piece is him successfully executing on his goal without genuine complication or sacrifice beyond effort. Working memory “strains,” but nothing threatens collapse or forces a trade-off, so escalation feels conceptual rather than tense. The resolution is therefore more a foregone fulfillment than a tested victory.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will remain a detached archivist or risk self-involvement—emerges and tightens as the artifact’s emotions and prophecy unfold. The immersion act is a meaningful escalation, and the prophetic utterance forces him to confront the cost of his solitude. Still, much of the conflict is conceptual and remains stated rather than tested in concrete, consequence-laden choices, so tension sits in a relatively narrow emotional band. A more explicit on-page trade-off (something he risks losing besides comfort) would sharpen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—preserving the vortex inheritance and averting catastrophic entropy rebound—is clearly signaled early. Pressure nominally escalates as the vortex shrinks and Elara begins the entropy-decreasing ritual with the seeds and cap. Yet the conflict is essentially one-sided: no reversal, no partial failure, and no moment when it seems her attempt might cost her something tangible, so tension runs more conceptual than felt. As a result, escalation feels like a steady ramp of imagery rather than a tightening of options with concrete risk.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stakes—how to warn the villages and what kind of warning world they’ll live under—are clear and tied to the siren vs. bell choice. There is a meaningful tightening at zero hour as instruments spike and he must decide quickly. However, resistance is low: no countervailing force or serious doubt undermines his preference, and the storm promptly vindicates him with little on-page cost or consequence for risk. This keeps the conflict interesting but relatively gentle, more contemplative than tense.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can reconcile his fragility with a sense of strength—is clear, but the pressure remains largely internal and low-intensity. There is a modest escalation via the increasing meteor activity culminating in the “final, colossal star,” which offers a credible climactic deepening of his emotional risk. However, there is little sense of a foreclosed path or genuine dilemma; his ritual succeeds without resistance or meaningful jeopardy beyond sadness. The result is moving but relatively gentle in terms of conflict and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the covenant will be retied and the oasis partially restored—is clear, and there is one meaningful tightening when the recluse chooses to follow the ghost’s guidance and later hold steady during the ritual. However, opposition is minimal and largely atmospheric; nothing concretely threatens failure beyond implication, and his success feels almost preordained. The cost (lifelong isolation as guardian) is conceptual rather than viscerally pressured on the page, so tension remains relatively low for elite-venue expectations.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s need to unlock the capsule and understand time’s texture before his borrowed time runs out—is clear but remains mostly internal and contemplative. There is one meaningful tightening at the capsule opening and the urn touch, which reweights everything, but external pressures (Shift-enforcers, dangers of exposure) are gestured at rather than dramatized. Conflict never quite sharpens into a genuine dilemma or trade-off; he risks little beyond abstraction in choosing to probe further. As a result, escalation feels more like a smooth revelation ramp than a pressured testing of resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.8)
    The main pressure point is the kite string snapping, which introduces the central test of Elias’s ethos: can he genuinely embrace and tend to incompletion. That turn lands, but tension is undercut because he welcomes the mishap almost immediately (“not in loss, but anticipation”), so stakes never feel truly precarious. Escalation remains mostly conceptual and aesthetic rather than emotionally or practically difficult. The resolution is coherent but relatively low-pressure for an elite literary target.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Elias racing his illness to establish a lasting interspecies conduit—is clear, and the escalation from individual wiring to grove-wide awakening to posthumous pilgrimage provides a discernible tightening. However, conflict is largely one-sided: nature and tools cooperate, no human or environmental opposition arises, and the illness only weakens him without forcing a genuine trade-off or failed attempt. The result is a strong sense of stakes but relatively soft pressure, with little felt risk that he might not succeed.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can unlock the amber’s true function and meaning—is clear, but the conflict is largely frictionless. Escalation comes from the convergence and activation in the tower, which deepen knowledge rather than narrowing options with real risk or sacrifice. There is no antagonist or strong counterforce; academia’s disapproval and the world’s splintering remain off-stage, so the on-page stakes feel primarily conceptual. The final “cost” is a reorientation of understanding, not a choice that visibly forecloses an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—can Thorne successfully enact the concord and let the garden reclaim the battlefield?—is clear, but there is little true resistance or complication once the terms are explained. The birds help rather than challenge him, and the ritual succeeds immediately, so escalation feels like a deepening of mood rather than tightening of options. Internal conflict (fear of failure, doubt about his right to act) is implied but not dramatized into hard choices or trade-offs. As a result, the resolution, while satisfying, lands with relatively low felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—bridge distance to Mira and reorient his purpose—is clear from early on, and the cylinder/riddle offers a distinct tightening of pressure. Elias’s decision to leave safety and cross the wasteland is a genuine escalation with non-trivial implied risk. However, much of the physical danger is summarized rather than dramatized, so we rarely feel concrete jeopardy or loss on the page. The internal conflict between clinging to preserved “truths” and accepting “tinted” ones is compelling but under-tested before resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—remain in desolate isolation or risk the unknown rift in pursuit of “true north”—is clear and culminates in a concrete choice. However, pressure doesn’t intensify much: there’s little real resistance or alternative tactic explored, and no antagonist or urgent clock beyond general post-shutdown desolation. The rift discovery functions as the main tightening beat, but Elara’s acceptance is almost instantaneous, with minimal wrestling over danger versus duty or attachment. As a result, escalation feels more like a smooth unveiling than a sharpened conflict with visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are clearly signaled early—cosmic balance and mended skies—and the tension appropriately narrows around the queen swap and the board’s rebellion. The main escalation beat is the queen’s psychic assault, which forces Elarion to recommit and escalate to outright destruction, not just substitution. Internal and external stakes interweave but remain relatively straightforward, with little moral or tactical dilemma beyond “press on or retreat.” Because the resolution succeeds without painful trade-off or lasting loss, the pressure feels solid rather than searing.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—freeing himself from the penumbra to reclaim his vocation—is clear, and the walking-ritual offers a nice conceptual tightening as the words grow more charged. However, the conflict is largely one-sided: there’s no genuine resistance beyond mild penumbra quivering, and success feels assured from early on. The cost (severing a part of himself that’s obsessed with minutiae) is interesting but mostly conceptual, with minimal dramatized struggle or jeopardy to his body, mind, or goal on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will risk reopening traumatic visions to reclaim a true sense of home—is coherent and present from early on. There is a meaningful deepening when she first traces the glyph and her buried talent reactivates, and again as she ventures “deeper into the labyrinth” toward the core. However, escalation feels largely foregone and smooth; obstacles or reversals are internal and summarized rather than sharply tested in specific beats, so the cost of continuing is more conceptual than viscerally felt. The final choice to fully awaken the stone reads inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can move from corrosive guilt to an altered stance on his past—is clear from early on and narrows as he decodes threads that mirror his specific misdeeds. Escalation comes through the increasingly personal moves encoded in the tapestry (the platinum fork, the recalled student and empty hearth) that force him into a deeper confrontation than abstract remorse. His decisive internal move (reframing his act as love twisted by poverty and choosing “pawn to king seven”) feels like a credible answer to the setup. The conflict resolves somewhat smoothly and could use one more sharp on-page cost or resisted alternative to feel fully pressure-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether a monolithic ritual of forgiveness will hold—is clear and present from early on. Pressure does deepen as more youths join, verses grow bolder, and elders’ spies appear, but escalation is primarily textual/ideological rather than felt through narrowing options or immediate reprisals. Elara never truly pays a price or faces a moment where she might back down, so her agency, while constant, is never severely tested. The result is thoughtful tension but not quite sharp, high-stakes conflict at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stakes—survival amid the acid sea and psychic integration/redemption—are present early and interwoven as each confession both risks and repairs him. Pressure escalates via worsening environmental danger, dwindling breath, and progressively deeper wounds, with his continuing to the next pockmark serving as credible tightening choices. The external salvation (workshop buoyed skyward) is clearly tied to his agency rather than coincidence, though the price paid remains primarily emotional/psychic rather than forcing a truly wrenching trade-off. The conflict is strong and coherent, if not yet pushed to its most brutal or surprising expression.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will finally confront and relinquish his idealized past—is clear and culminates in a tangible renunciation (leaving the shell). Pressure escalates modestly: the mirror crack nudges him from inertia, the wrong turn heightens uncertainty, and the holographic projections force him to watch the arc from youthful vow to loss and isolation. However, opposition is soft; very little resists him besides his own reluctance, which is more implied than dramatized in moment-to-moment choices. The resolution feels earned but could benefit from one more concrete on-page test of his commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—reconciling with Mira and proving whispers over shouts—is clear and foregrounded early. The main tightening comes when he commits to the whisper-magic and waits, unsure if she will respond, but beyond that the pressure plateaus rather than escalating. There is little active resistance or meaningful risk; once the vial is opened, success feels almost guaranteed, so the reunion lacks a sense of danger or potential refusal. As a result, conflict reads as poignant but relatively low-tension.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—fashioning a beacon to call the lost back and redeem his own losses—is clear and present. Escalation is handled mostly through accumulative deepening (increasing censer hum, denser calls, approaching full moon) rather than sharp reversals, but there is a meaningful tightening when he finally mounts and lights the censer. However, obstacles are minimal and success feels almost preordained; the voices guide him perfectly, and nothing truly threatens failure. As a result, the price he pays leans more symbolic and emotional than dramatically contested, limiting tension’s peak.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will sacrifice involuntary honesty to cultivate psychological safety—is clearly framed and answered: he chooses occlusion and immediately tests his new capacity to lie. The narrative offers one main tightening: the discovery and then self-implantation of the eye, which irrevocably closes a path back to unmediated truth. However, external resistance and on-page consequences remain muted; his new lies work almost too smoothly, with little bite-back yet. This keeps tension strong but somewhat theoretical rather than viscerally escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake is Elias’s need to understand the stranger’s final gesture as a way of coping with his own isolation, signaled clearly once he pockets the flower and “began to investigate.” Pressure deepens rather than sharply escalates: the looping memories and his method of reading gaps gradually narrow his interpretive options until he must decide what to do with the boutonnière. The key tightening is his return to the dock at dawn, where he actively tests his method against the absences and aligns the stranger’s story with his own. The conflict remains mostly interior and meditative, so tension is steady rather than sharply ratcheting, but it is coherent and culminates in a meaningful, choice-shaped reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will find the Doorway and what it will demand of his life’s choices—is clear, with a visible tightening as he leaves the shop, navigates a flooding cavern, and commits to following the ants into a narrowing fissure. The internal and external conflicts intertwine, but the external danger (rising creek, flood risk) never quite bites, so the physical stakes feel more gestural than consequential. The final turn is primarily internal: accepting that the Doorway is a reckoning with his own map of choices, which is thematically apt but comes with minimal on-page resistance. The lack of a truly hard trade-off or sacrifice keeps the escalation from fully peaking.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—Elowen’s soul/agency versus the curse of her bloodline and the kingdom’s fate—is established early and escalates from physical risk (the climb) to metaphysical and moral risk (accepting bleeding starlight). The meaningful tightening arrives when the firefly vortex unlocks the grotto’s full power, confronting her with a choice between submission to the crown of light or retreat. However, resistance is minimal; she passes each threshold without serious setback or near-failure, muting the sense of price paid. The external threat (heights claim the unwary) never concretely bites, keeping stakes a touch abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—can Lirien truly “capture” presence and revalue the friendship through her new alchemy—is announced but only lightly pressured. There is minimal sense that anything might fail or be lost beyond a generalized regret; no concrete consequence is dramatized if Thorne rejects her or the ritual backfires. Escalation is mostly tonal (increasing radiance, more charged language) rather than structural, with the whisper functioning as a single, smooth culmination rather than a pressured choice between live options. As a result, tension feels low-grade and the resolution relatively foregone.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will remain trapped in jaded stasis or risk re-engaging with her own mortality and past selves—is clear and escalates when she weaponizes jealousy and literally explodes out of the cabin. The main tightening is her decision to lean into envy and then to shape the ensuing chaos into narrative mid-fall, which credibly fulfills her stated drive. However, there is little sense that failure has concrete consequences beyond continued malaise, and no real alternative path is dramatized; pressure stays mostly tonal rather than situational. The cost of her renewed perspective is implied rather than sharply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.5)
    The external conflict—repairing a malfunctioning clock—is inherently low-key, and the story leans on poetic discovery rather than felt risk or narrowing options. The major tightening is the moment Elara finds the strange screw and realizes it belongs to a birthing clamp, which shifts the piece from technical repair to charged human history. However, Elara never faces a real possibility of failure or a cost-bearing choice; her process unfolds smoothly and competently. As a result, tension remains more contemplative than pressurized, limiting stakes to a gentle emotional payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—pass the rite or face exile, and more personally, remain imprisoned by her scars—is clearly signaled and internally felt. Pressure escalates from itching to full crystal manacles and time-freeze, and her choice to lean into superstition via the quill is a genuine tactic shift. Yet after this choice, conflict becomes relatively linear: each new rune application succeeds without fresh jeopardy, and no option is decisively foreclosed beyond “continue or give up.” The emotional cost (pain, breath strain, vulnerability) is present but could be sharper or riskier to match the declared guild-level stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can meaningfully reconnect and apologize before both Theo and the orchard are fully lost—is legible early and steadily tightened. Escalation comes through the induced currents, Theo’s unstable manifestation, and the audible shift from hush to engines starting outside, which narrows the temporal window. Elara’s central act is an emotional choice under pressure: to speak frankly and accept a forgiveness that cannot undo the damage. The cost is clear and lasting—Theo dissipates, the magical conduit is destroyed, and the external world continues to cut down what remains.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—will he successfully arbitrate illusions and unify the cosmos within the universe’s “hiccup”?—is clear but remains abstractly treated. Pressure does rise via the ticking hiccup and the growing tremors of the library, and his movement accelerates as the climax nears. However, there is no true resistance, reversal, or cost: the dictionary cooperates, no option fails, and unification occurs without meaningful threat of loss or ethical conflict. The conflict reads more like an inevitable ritual than a test.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding and correcting the station’s relationship to time and horizon—is clear but remains mostly conceptual and low-friction. Conflict escalates modestly as the clocks reverse, the room chills, and visions intensify, but Elias faces no strong opposing force, moral dilemma, or real risk beyond discomfort and uncertainty. His key choices (to use the key, to keep counting backwards, to stop and withdraw the key) do guide the progression, yet none require a painful trade-off on the page. The piece reads more as a deepening meditation than a tightening vise.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake is largely intellectual/professional—whether Mira can reconceive intrusion detection as permeability rather than resistance—and that is clearly signaled. There is one meaningful deepening when the rat’s passage through the beam reframes “intrusion” as something to map rather than block, but there is little real opposition: no institutional risk, personal fear, or conflicting desire meaningfully pushes back. Elias functions as an ally rather than a source of pressure, so tension stays low and smooth. The result is an elegant but relatively low-intensity arc.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—how Elena will relate to and carry forward her father’s paradoxical legacy—is clear, but external pressure is low. The traversal presents no real risk or failure potential; riddles are solved frictionlessly, so escalation remains mostly conceptual rather than felt as tightening options. The key turn is internal: choosing to interpret the manuscript as something to publish rather than reject, which is nicely set up but arrives without much on-page struggle in the final beats. The story could benefit from at least one concrete obstacle or sharper trade-off to deepen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira remains trapped in a comforting wrong-number loop or risks re-entering her real relationships—is clear and escalates as she grows more attached and begins demanding a meeting. The pivotal turn is Elias choosing to accelerate the music and cut the line at her most vulnerable moment, forcing an ending that prompts her to act differently. Emotional and ethical cost is present (he is intentionally hurting her to help), but because his internal conflict about this is only lightly shaded, the choice feels somewhat preordained rather than acutely wrestled with. Still, the escalation from idle calls to a fraught severing is effective and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can meaningfully renew the covenant and preserve their small moments against oblivion—remains coherent and is signaled early. Escalation comes primarily from deepening ritual intensity (petal sequence, bone spoon, murmurs, bloom-brightening) and the ticking of twilight into moonrise, culminating in his partial return and the choice to bind him back into the locket. However, there is little genuine resistance: no serious chance of failure, moral dilemma, or external interference tests her commitment, so tension feels more like gathering reverence than pressured conflict. The cost is emotional rather than tactical—she gains contact but must still let him go—but it’s presented as serene acceptance rather than a hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—can loneliness be transformed into belonging through engineered reciprocity?—is clear, and pressure does build as the crowd forms and the rock begins to circulate with attached stories. Elias’s seeding of rumors and his choice to stay provide some agency-driven turns. Yet conflict remains almost entirely cooperative; there’s no real friction, failure, or cost beyond tears and vulnerability, so escalation feels gentle rather than testing. The result is emotionally pleasing but a bit low-tension for top-tier stakes work.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elar can reach the stillpoint and survive it without being “devoured” or hollowed—is clear, and the journey’s density of notes and emotional overload provides a recognizable escalation. His doubt, the rival mapmaker’s warning, and the ring’s “scorching” pulse create some pressure to turn back versus press forward. However, there is no real reversal or narrowed option beyond “continue the trek”; nothing on the page concretely threatens failure or loss besides internal fear. The resolution feels earned but relatively low in perceived risk, keeping the tension at a contemplative rather than gripping level.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—repairing the anomaly and reconfiguring her mistake—is clear, and there is at least one meaningful tightening as she moves from local fixes (seed isotopes) to deeper causal edits (Vega signal, mentor). Yet the piece lacks a sharp sense of jeopardy or resistance: there’s little sense that her edits might seriously backfire, beyond abstract “balance” language. Because each revision seems to improve conditions with minimal on-page pushback, pressure never quite peaks, and the ethical conflict remains more conceptual than felt. The final stance—continuing her work, newly at peace—lands, but with relatively modest tension preceding it.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—can Finn and Elara reclaim and reveal the value of silence amid noisy oblivion—is clear and does tighten as they move from private harbor to public disruption. Escalation is present in the bold step into the festival and the halting of guitars mid-strum, a solid beat of agency. However, the price of disruption is almost entirely positive: the crowd is moved, Finn is restored, and no competing harm or lasting cost is dramatized. This keeps the conflict meaningful but somewhat safe and low-risk.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—preserving the civilization’s knowledge and Theo’s promise from looters—is clear, and intensity rises as she moves deeper and uncovers more intimate traces of him. However, the conflict is almost entirely one-sided; there is no on-page adversary, time pressure, or serious risk of failure beyond interpretive missteps that are quickly solved. The most charged turn is the vandalized self-portrait leading to the hidden stair, but it functions more as an elegant puzzle solution than a crisis. The ending affirms commitment rather than forcing a difficult trade-off, which keeps escalation and cost moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming agency and escaping the lab’s entanglement—is clear early and escalates through Elara’s increasingly intense, painful drumming. The garden’s awakening and the handlers’ distant alarms provide a sense of rising pressure, and her choice to submerge with Kai into the lagoon feels like a committed, no-going-back move. Still, the path to success encounters little concrete opposition or complication; each escalation leads fairly directly to a positive outcome, so the risk of failure never feels sharply narrowed. Emotional stakes are vivid, but practical jeopardy and trade-offs could be more rigorously dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.3)
    The central stake—maps and coin wagered on a no-tech race in lethal conditions—is clear and present early, and the storm plus labyrinth rules tighten pressure as they go. Elias’s strategic whispering, map-folding, and walk-mimicry show adaptive tactics rather than a straight-line competence fantasy. However, Harlan never seriously endangers Elias or forces him to contemplate real loss; Harlan feels outmatched from early on, so the escalation curve flattens into demonstration rather than a knife-edge contest. The cost lands mostly on Harlan (maps, pride) with limited felt risk to Elias beyond conceptual vindication.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central conflict—whether darkness devours light or learns to cradle it—is clear and escalates as Elara intensifies the weave and the starlight pierces deeper into Umbra. Stakes remain abstract but legible: the meaning and nature of void itself. The main limitation is that Umbra offers almost no resistance; once shown light’s alternative, it yields quickly, so pressure never quite bites or forces a hard trade-off. As a result, the piece reads more as a graceful demonstration than a truly contested transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—awakening second thoughts under an authoritarian Council—is clear, but conflict remains mostly one-sided: Elias devises and executes his plan without resistance. The “hush where past meets prophecy” and synchronized displays provide a structural tightening, yet no option is meaningfully foreclosed and no turn forces him to reconsider or sacrifice an alternative path. Council guards “pausing” is a nice hint of pressure but never becomes a real threat. As a result, tension is more conceptual than visceral, with escalation present but relatively gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether to remain tethered to the docks or risk everything for oceanic freedom—is clear and culminates in the rope-cutting. Internal and external stakes align in the departure choice and the physical detachment from shore. However, escalation is gentle: comrades’ opposition is distant, and the Cataclysm’s no-violence rule plus the scrimshaw’s emotional compulsion remove many avenues for genuine friction. Their leap to leave carries cost in concept, but on-page resistance and trade-offs feel under-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—can she meaningfully lighten grief in a post-mandate emotional void—is clear, and her agency in choosing to keep performing and crafting the talisman gives the ending real, if modest, cost (she remains blank, committed to this ritualized half-relief). Pressure does increase somewhat as whittling speeds up, the turbine hum deepens into a “dirge,” and the blood-nick punctuates her effort. Still, the conflict stays largely at one temperature: there’s no decisive on-page moment where an alternative path is vividly available and then foreclosed. The result is textured but not sharply escalating tension.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are conceptually grand (unraveling of worlds, breaking sacred boundaries) but on-page pressure is gentle: the colonnade never truly resists, and there’s no counterforce beyond remembered edicts. Escalation exists—his paraphrases increasingly transform the space, the tremor of certainty amplifies—but it feels foregone rather than contested. The risk of dissolving the ban is asserted, not concretely tested; no option is meaningfully foreclosed in the moment. As a result, tension is present but subdued, more ritual than struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central conflict—Elias must barter with the phoenix to wake Mira—is clear, and pressure tightens when the phoenix counters by demanding his sight. His decision to subvert the bargain via an imperfect song is an earned escalation that tests his values rather than raw courage. The cost (foregoing the possibility of color) is conceptually strong, though its emotional sting could be sharpened on the page. External peril is low-key, but the moral/identity stakes carry the needed weight for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—can she reconstitute meaningful connection from lost sounds?—is legible and progressively deepened as each chamber attacks a different assumption (volume, language, permanence, etc.). Escalation is primarily conceptual rather than situational, but the Heart Vault and the cries of parted lovers provide a tangible emotional spike that justifies her culminating reconfiguration at the Final Bell. Costs are present (shattered assumptions, pain of grief) but somewhat cushioned by the consistently elevated, respectful tone, so the pressure never feels truly perilous. Still, the internal conflict is resolved through her deliberate choices (striking bells, refocusing the lens, continuing onward), making the resolution feel earned within this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are clear—reviving withering stars as an extension of surviving her own grief—and the ritual deepens as she moves from one curtain to greater veils. Yet conflict is largely notional: nothing pushes back, nothing threatens failure, and she never genuinely risks abandoning the task once begun. Escalation exists more as scale (more stars, grander veil) than as increased pressure or narrowed options. The final turn is satisfying but under-tested, so the price of her new stance feels modest.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—deciphering and inheriting a cultural-mapping duty—is present, but pressure on that stake is gentle and mostly unopposed. Theo’s confession and the grandmother’s letter could provoke deeper conflict (guilt, resentment, fear of failure), yet the story moves smoothly toward alignment and successful pattern revelation. Escalation occurs more as increasing complexity of the card spread than as narrowing options or testing commitment under threat. The result feels intellectually engaging but emotionally low-tension, with limited sense of risk or loss attached to their choices.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central conflict—Elara’s need to know versus the existential cost of that knowledge—tightens convincingly as her failed attempts wound her and the cataclysm encroaches. The key escalation is her choice to abandon all personal nostalgia, which forecloses a core part of her identity to gain the truth; the price is legible. Internal and external pressures (pagoda’s repulsion, collapsing world) are intertwined, and the final dance through the collapsing archive reads as a charged, costly aftermath rather than an easy triumph. The piece could marginally sharpen concrete consequences of the larger collapse, but the emotional stakes are clear.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—saving collective dreams/hope from corruption—is clear, and pressure mounts from subtle anomalies to direct confrontation with the shadow. The meaningful tightening occurs when Elara realizes the shadow is mobile and growing, pushing her toward an irrevocable binding act that will change her. However, the conflict is largely abstract and resolved via a single decisive ritual whose success never feels genuinely in doubt, so moment-to-moment tension is muted. Ethical stakes (safety vs wild potential) are articulated but not fully dramatized as a live dilemma at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.0)
    The primary conflict is internal—whether to treat her compassion as a flaw and close off, or to reconstruct with new boundaries—which is clearly articulated. The “shedding layers” structure supplies a gentle escalation as she confronts flattery, guilt, isolation, and fear in turn. However, resistance is minimal; each layer is resolved almost as soon as it’s named, with little sense of backsliding or genuine risk to her core self. The final stance feels earned but low-friction for a piece aiming at top-tier intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the true story of her scar/family—is clear early, and the choice to reopen her wound and physically tunnel is a credible tightening of pressure. The plants’ urging and the coffee-ring omen test her resolve and lead to a concrete, goal-driven sequence underground. However, the path is almost frictionless: no real reversals, competing obligations, or ethical costs complicate the dig, so tension plateaus rather than escalating sharply. The emotional price is implied but not viscerally tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether love can meaningfully persist in space and relics and how Elara will engage with it—is clear but plays out in a relatively low-key, contemplative mode. Escalation comes chiefly from deepening knowledge (visions intensifying, discovery of the box, realization that unused love migrates) rather than concrete obstacles or costs. The choice to pry open the panel and then to keep only a fragment does narrow options and signal a stance, but resistance or danger never truly bite. As a result, the conflict feels resonant but not sharply pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—freeing her trapped creativity—is present and consistent, with the main pressure coming from endurance vs. surrender to rest. Escalation is mostly accumulative: more meteors traced, more exhaustion, more cosmic imagery, culminating in finally sleeping fully. However, the conflict remains gentle and largely internal, with limited sense of real peril or hard trade-offs beyond fatigue and lost time. As a result, tension feels more meditative than tightening, which caps the score.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.5)
    Conflict is primarily internal and conceptual—between dreamless drift and emergent purpose—without much active resistance or jeopardy. The main tightening occurs when he decides to use the clock and then to become a “spark-tender,” but those choices are not sharply opposed or costly on the page. Stakes (reviving life/timelines) are huge in scale yet stay diffuse and serene rather than tense. As a result, escalation reads as a deepening of motif more than pressure narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will reclaim his inner wildness—is clear, but pressure is gentle and mostly internal. Escalation comes through intensifying visions and the roaring symphony at the heartgrove more than through hard choices or real threat; the forest largely cooperates with him. The act of unraveling the binding vine is framed as climactic, yet it lacks a felt risk or competing option—it’s simply the next step he’s guided to take. As a result, the arc satisfies conceptually but doesn’t quite bite in terms of cost or tension.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will move beyond her old “leash-bound” life to claim her courage—is clear, but the conflict is unusually frictionless. Doubt and fear are mentioned, and the path’s “indirect routes” and looping fog provide mild resistance, yet she never faces a genuinely hard decision where turning back or refusing is a live option. The guides are uniformly benevolent and there is no concrete external cost dramatized for abandoning the village, so escalation plateaus into a guided ritual rather than real testing. As a result, the final choice, while thematically apt, doesn’t feel heavily paid for on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether safety bought by silence is tolerable—is clear early and deepens once Elias uncovers Thorne’s history. Pressure escalates at the bolt discovery and the flood of logs, forcing a comparison between Thorne’s catastrophic silence and Elias’s corporate complicity. The resolution is primarily internal and quiet (choosing to remain), which fits the mode but leaves stakes somewhat abstract; no new concrete danger tests the choice. Still, the ethical conflict and its cost are coherent and build to a meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—truth of succession versus cosmic unraveling—is clearly signaled and followed through, and Lirion’s choice of a slow, textual campaign constitutes real, if quiet, agency. We see a meaningful tightening when the pretender senses loyalty drifting and sends spies, bringing pressure closer to the library’s “maw” and justifying Lirion’s final, amplified missive. Yet opposition and risk remain largely abstract; there are no genuine setbacks, counter-moves, or moments where Lirion’s plan nearly fails, so tension grows more in rhetoric than in concrete tests. The graceful, bloodless collapse is thematically apt but also reduces visceral stakes, keeping the conflict from feeling fully pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—whether Elias can understand why certain paths disappeared and what that means—is clearly signaled and escalates through his increasingly urgent data assembly and physical exhaustion. The tightening comes via the prolonged, obsessive reconstruction (storm swell, wiring salvaged projectors) and the partial dawn insight before the final “rogue wave” of revelation. However, conflict remains largely internal and intellectual, with minimal resistance beyond time, isolation, and fatigue; no live alternative path or real risk to his choice is dramatized. As a result, tension is steady and meaningful but never quite sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stakes—reviving a stalled rebellion and recovering meaning—are declared early and revisited at the end, and there is one meaningful tightening when she discovers and engages with the stone circle. However, antagonistic pressure (Corporate Veil, inner doubt) remains mostly abstract; no concrete obstacle ever seriously threatens failure or forces a painful trade-off. Escalation is more a smooth unveiling of power than a series of tested commitments. As a result, the resolution feels conceptually satisfying but somewhat low-friction for the scale of the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will break tradition to evolve it and safeguard the Caldera’s future—is declared early and revisited. Pressure escalates somewhat as the triple-moon alignment and ritual create a now-or-never window, and the unsealing is a real choice. Yet opposition remains abstract (councils, rigid customs) and never exerts on-page pressure; nothing actively resists her, and no alternative path is seriously tested. As a result, the stakes feel conceptually high but experientially modest.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Elena can live and relate while carrying non-erased trauma—is clear and tested when the sound morphs into the drone’s buzz and locks her body. Escalation is primarily internal: the freeze, the narrowing of perception, then the hard-earned reinterpretation of that bodily response. The later interaction with the young artist offers a modest but credible externalization of that internal shift. Stakes never feel trivial, but the pressure remains quiet and largely psychological, which slightly limits intensity at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can move from fragmentation to truthful creation—is clear, and there is a meaningful tightening as he chooses to untangle the threads and descend into the narrowing, darker spaces. However, opposition remains largely abstract; the storm and claustrophobia color the mood but don’t significantly endanger him or threaten true failure. Once he reaches the loom, the redesign of fate is achieved without setback or trade-off beyond a generalized “ache,” so the escalation never quite bites. The result is a persuasive internal victory that feels somewhat low-risk.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding and claiming his time-warping ability, tied to following Mira—is present and escalates when he risks dissolving into the ink. Internal and external conflicts interweave reasonably well (fear/anger vs. need for knowledge, portal danger vs. losing Mira’s lead). Yet there is little real on-page resistance: crossing into the ink-void proceeds without setback, and Mira offers an explanation instead of conflict, so options don’t narrow in a strenuous way. The cost of his choice is implied risk rather than a felt loss or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will risk herself to awaken forbidden networks and scandalize the Regime—is clear from early on and culminates in a concrete act. Internal and external stakes interweave: her moral rupture with the Regime and the looming danger of detection. However, the pressure line is relatively gentle: there’s no on-page reversal or near-failure, and opposition is entirely offstage, so her decision faces little escalating resistance beyond her own hesitation. The choice still forecloses a path and carries implied cost, but the conflict never quite tightens into a knife-edge.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—defend the farm without bloodshed—is clear and escalates when looters penetrate the dome. Elara’s choice to refuse violence under direct threat is the main tightening, but the external conflict resolves very easily once the roses act, with no serious reversals or near-failures. Internal and external stakes are nicely braided, yet the looters feel generic and underpowered as antagonistic pressure. The visible cost of her stance (risk of failure, potential loss) is more implied than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—to catch the goddess’s echo before it fades—is clearly established and tied to a rare temporal window when patterns break. Tension escalates as constellations disturb the garden, the echo zigzags through chaos, and competing seekers fail; the choice to use “voiced silence” under pressure is a meaningful tactical turn. However, the sense of risk and concrete consequence if he fails remains abstract, and his internal struggle is almost flawlessly competent rather than genuinely strained. The resolution feels earned but relatively low-friction, more like an elegant demonstration of mastery than a hard-won, costly victory.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central conflict—whether her father corrupted or redeemed truth—is clearly established, and Harlan’s accusation raises direct pressure on her legacy and self-concept. Escalation comes through her choice to interrogate via logical contradiction rather than accept or deny the claim, leading to a knowledge-turn when his story collapses. Yet the confrontation lacks a real sense that she might fail or pay a steep price; Harlan folds quickly and there’s no strong counter-pressure (e.g., his leverage, her fear of exposure) to make the stakes bite. The final decision to recast the empire’s mission reads as a natural outcome but not a hard-won sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—atoning for past neglect and quieting the child’s (and his own) dissonance—is clear, and tension does deepen as the firmware awakens and the time-fold intensifies. The final act of tattooing himself and tethering her spirit constitutes a meaningful, irreversible choice with cost. However, there are no real failed attempts, counter-pressures, or hard trade-offs en route; once the instructions appear, his path feels almost frictionless. As a result, escalation feels more like a smooth progression of revelations than a true tightening of screws.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the ritual dissolves into destructive chaos or yields meaning—is clear, and pressure does rise as chants turn frantic and accusations fly. Elara’s agency in placing the tile, shaping the mandala, and then interjecting drives the resolution. However, the escalation largely happens in summarized “cacophony” rather than sharply etched confrontations, so the sense of narrowing options is more conceptual than visceral. Her intervention carries little visible personal risk or sacrifice, which keeps the cost profile modest.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—freeing the survivors from Kael’s brutal rule by transforming him rather than killing him—is clear and thematically interesting. There is a credible deepening when Elara accesses Kael’s infancy and sees his buried empathy, which reframes the confrontation as reclamation rather than simple overthrow. However, the conflict never truly tightens; Kael does not actively oppose her, no alternative path feels live, and the renaming proceeds without real jeopardy or sacrifice beyond psychic strain. The result is more ceremonial than tense, muting the sense of cost and narrowing this below strong-elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—whether Elena remains paralyzed by scandal-born despair or reclaims her performing self—is clear, and the ghost’s offer of an “encore” provides a meaningful inflection point. However, pressure escalates more by accumulation of imagery than by narrowing options: once Reginald appears, there’s little real friction or cost in choosing to perform with him. There is no genuine threat, trade-off, or competing obligation; nostalgia surges and she flows into the encore rather than struggling through a hard choice. The ending offers resolution, but the path there lacks a sharp, felt price or reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether their connection is authentic or chemically haunted—is signaled and drives the scene, but tension remains relatively gentle. The experiment escalates through multiple exposures and culminates in a blind test, yet each step succeeds without real setbacks, making the outcome feel somewhat foregone. There’s limited sense of what Elara truly stands to lose if the experiment disproves their bond, beyond abstract unease. As a result, the emotional and narrative cost at the peak doesn’t fully bite.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Lira will truly become “the voice of the unknown”—is clear but remains largely unopposed. The main tightening comes when emotions overheat and threaten overload, yet this danger resolves quickly through a calm act of will, without a stark trade-off or lost option. There’s little sense that she might fail, be rejected by her people, or pay a steep personal price beyond abstract risk. As a result, tension exists conceptually rather than viscerally, and escalation feels modest.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the world is chained to a doom-prophecy or opened to choice—is clearly established. There is one meaningful deepening when the scrambled “doom” is revealed as “divergence,” changing the nature of the problem. But the process of “unscrambling” proceeds smoothly; there’s no on-page setback, cost, or credible risk of failure, so pressure never truly tightens. Elias’s climactic act (turning the hourglass, carrying the jar upward) is thematically potent but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will rekindle the broken network by awakening Lena’s unused courage while accepting his own limits—is clear and does tighten once he finds her and must decide what to give: stimulant, endorsement, or withdrawal. His decision to activate her ("Agent Rook: active, courage affirmed") and to stay behind constitutes a real trade-off and forecloses a path. However, there is minimal resistance or complication; Lena’s test has already succeeded in drawing him, and their conversation proceeds without substantial pushback or risk. The cyanide option remains mostly symbolic, so the moral/physical jeopardy never truly spikes on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.8)
    The central stake—understanding and clarifying the ancestral vow—is present but stays abstract and largely unpressured. Once he sits to mend the tapestry, there is no serious opposition: no counter-voice, no threat that he might fail or choose wrongly, only a steady drift toward clarity. The “why have they always ferried more than souls?” question is provocative but never made dangerous or time-sensitive beyond the soft clock of the rain. As a result, escalation is more a gentle deepening of reflection than a tightening that forces a costly stance.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—Kai’s need to understand why the oasis resists change—remains largely intellectual and spiritual, with little concrete risk or loss if he fails. Pressure escalates gently via the thrumming, the timelines’ convergence, and the narrowing window as smoke flattens, but no real option is foreclosed or moral tradeoff forced. His main “choice” is to commit to the process (follow patterns, throw the pot) rather than retreat, which never feels truly in doubt. The result is a compelling meditation but relatively low-tension conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will remain sealed in grief or risk connection—is clear, and the boat journey plus the gifting of the gauge tooth provide a credible tightening of emotional pressure. Elara’s actions steadily deepen the situation rather than looping. Still, tension operates mostly at a gentle, contemplative register; Mira’s decision to open up and accept the talisman feels earned but relatively unresisted, with little sense that another, bleaker outcome was truly live on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—her loneliness versus a need for meaningful connection compatible with independence—is legible but under-pressured. Once she decides to engage the stone circle, nothing truly opposes her; the ritual unfolds without resistance, and coexistence blooms on the first serious attempt. There’s no real trade-off beyond implied vulnerability in opening to the echoes, and no option is convincingly foreclosed. The escalation from hum → visions → apparitions deepens texture rather than tightening stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stakes—reconnection with Theo and discovering the “thread that connects all things”—are articulated early and pay off at the end, but escalation is gentle. Once she decides to place the twig spiral, obstacles vanish: the art responds, Theo is already there with a matching token, and no real resistance tests her commitment. Her main “choice” is to show up and make the offering, after which events unfold almost entirely in her favor. Emotional tension is present but not intensely pressured, which keeps the conflict from reaching a truly gripping tier.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake (community mindshare and freedom from manipulation) is clear and escalates from abstract cosmic threat to concrete campus clashes and a direct attempted takeover of the station. Elara’s decision to interfere rather than destroy is meaningful, and Harlan’s intrusion provides a timely human obstacle. However, the climactic confrontation resolves almost too smoothly—the demo wave immediately disorients the enforcers, with little cost or genuine jeopardy. The stakes conceptually are high, but the on-page risk and sacrifice feel somewhat underplayed.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stakes—survive the nexus’s spatial mutiny and obtain the key—are clear and converge well at the climax. Pressure builds from uneasy exploration to active threat as the organ’s reverberations twist corridors, compress space, and trigger Elias’s phobia, forcing him to keep playing and then to commit to the risky act of “transfixing” the nexus. Internal (fear vs. rebellion) and external (crushing walls) conflicts are interwoven effectively during the mutiny beat. The price he pays is more psychological than concrete, and the resolution feels a bit too cleanly victorious for the extremity of the threat, slightly softening the sense of lasting consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stakes—solving Mira’s disappearance and breaking Elara’s emotional dormancy—are clear from early on. However, escalation is relatively frictionless: once she finds the ribbon, her first, low-cost attempt (a thumb prick) yields total success with no real risk, failure, or pushback. External opposition (the killer, institutional resistance, physical danger) stays entirely off-page, so pressure never truly tightens in-scene. The internal conflict is resolved quickly and cleanly at the ritual moment, without a hard trade-off or visible enduring price beyond a symbolic scar.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—proving Thorne right to reverse the family’s exile and unmask institutional suppression—is clear and escalates from archival obsession to institutional confrontation. Elara’s agency drives the key turns (diving for journals, decoding, challenging Hale), but external resistance is relatively soft: Hale confesses quickly, and no serious obstacle complicates the transmission. The broader world-ending stakes are more gestural than dramatized, though they color the pressure effectively. The cost at the end is conceptual rather than visceral—the world and fog remain hostile—which works but could be sharpened by one concrete sacrifice or irreversible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake is the narrator’s willingness to move beyond the emotional “never” that followed his wife’s death, framed against the mystery of the hitchhiker’s vanishing. Pressure deepens somewhat as the flake and scaffold-map push him toward a decision to act on possibility rather than retreat. However, there is almost no genuine opposition—internal or external—and no serious alternative path; once the clues appear, he moves toward openness without a meaningful test of resolve. As a result, conflict feels more like a gentle thematic nudge than escalating tension.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—Elias defending his reclaimed circus-vault and his way of living with his legacy—is signaled early and returns at the confrontation with Raoul and the thugs. The territorial-marker gambit offers a clear, character-driven tightening where he chooses dissuasion over violence, but the intruders’ retreat feels somewhat too easy and low-cost for a supposed violent threat. The startup’s boom–bust arc raises abstract stakes but is delivered in recap rather than escalating on-page pressure. The final endurance in ruin carries conceptual cost yet lacks a sharply dramatized, painful fork-in-the-road choice.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.8)
    The central stake—whether Lyra can decode the inscriptions before she’s spiritually exhausted—is signaled but stays abstract and low-pressure on the page. Once Thorne decides to dream, there are no real complications or reversals; the dream yields exactly what’s needed, and dawn simply confirms it. Emotional tension exists in Lyra’s fatigue and doubt, but it doesn’t escalate into a concrete dilemma or force a trade-off. As a result, conflict feels more like a gentle puzzle solved than a tested commitment with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Thorne will pay a bodily and psychic price to confront his buried betrayal—is clear and escalates as the vortex tightens and the plant advances. His decision to bleed on the seed is a credible tightening that forecloses simple escape and tangibly raises cost. External pressure (vortex, trees) and internal pressure (guilt, self-image) reinforce each other through to the confession’s release. The conflict resolves a bit smoothly, with minimal residue of unresolved danger or ambiguity beyond the psychic wound.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are high in concept (chaotic dream intersections birthing horrors; restoration of temporal order), and they’re signaled early and clearly. There is one main tightening when Elara begins the painful scar-link and commits to entering the nexus, but after that, conflict becomes largely procedural—she navigates the maze and touches the orb without real resistance or jeopardy. No substantive option is foreclosed on the page beyond the general risk implied, and no visible loss or trade-off follows the restoration. As a result, tension feels more like a scenic crescendo than a true escalation with costly turns.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether she can mend her soul by binding her fate to her brother’s—is clear and present from early on, and the ritual sequence gives a natural escalation (finding the card, initiating the binding, paying blood, enduring the influx of alien memories). Her agency drives the key turn: she chooses to seal the pact with blood despite implied danger. However, opposition remains mostly atmospheric; there is little concrete resistance or genuine possibility of failure, so tension lives more in concept than in felt jeopardy. The hinted future cost (“prices yet unpaid”) sharpens stakes, but mostly as foreshadowed threat rather than on-page trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—whether Harl will remain in self-exile or reengage with his past and profession—is clear, and the discovery/appraisal of the cloth is a meaningful tightening. His decision to authenticate the scrap and plan a memorial exhibit provides a real turn from avoidance to engagement. However, the external stakes (career risk, social consequences) stay mostly abstract; there’s no tangible opposition or specific potential loss dramatized in the scene. As a result, escalation feels modest rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stakes—understanding transition and preventing the arbor’s collapse—are clear, and there is one meaningful deepening when the fields waver and thunder rumbles. However, the resolution comes almost effortlessly (the seed sprouts overnight and stabilizes everything) with little resistance or price, so escalation feels conceptual rather than tense. Internal conflict is more ruminative than pressurized, and the external “threat” never forces a hard trade-off or renunciation on the page. The story reads as contemplative rather than truly embattled.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara’s wonder can survive routine through reconciliation of her split identity—is clear and tightened by the waning moon exacerbating her turmoil. The pursuit and smelting sequence escalate pressure decently, especially with the risk of identities shattering if contradictions are denied. However, the conflict resolves without a hard trade-off or lasting visible loss; the ritual works on first try and there’s no serious doubt of success. Tension remains more lyrical than truly fraught, which limits the felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.2)
    The primary stake—whether Epsilon-7 becomes another sealed tomb or a reimagined refuge—emerges clearly in his hesitation over the override and tightens once he uncovers the shell’s record of sacrificed connections. The meaningful turn is his agency in crowning the node with the pearl, choosing a third path that redefines the bunker’s function. Internal and external stakes are interwoven, but opposition is largely conceptual; nothing pushes back against his plan, so pressure escalates more through revelation than through resistance. As a result, the cost is felt but gentle, centered on his internal renunciation rather than hard trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can reframe his guilt into some form of self-forgiveness—is present early and maintained. Pressure escalates via his deliberate, risky exploration and culminates in the layered graffiti that specifically references his bridge collapse, which is a strong deepening of conflict. His decision to accept a reframed narrative and to inscribe his own map is a clear act of agency, but the story doesn’t press hard on any competing choice (e.g., rejecting the graffiti’s absolution, returning to meds, or embracing permanent self-punishment). As a result, the path to redemption feels relatively unopposed and low-friction despite the heavy backstory.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—reach the hidden core and unlock unspoken words before her liminal window closes—is clear, but the on-page pressure is mild. The main opposition is the cipher, which she decodes steadily once she has the method; there’s no real reversal or serious threat of loss after that. Internal conflict (fear vs eagerness) colors her approach but doesn’t force a hard trade-off or renunciation. As a result, escalation feels more like deepening wonder than tightening jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (dream vs empire) is clearly signaled and tightened through the solstice deadline, ominous coffee omens, and the invasive urgency of the ivy’s “propagate” command. Pressure escalates as tools of divination, plant telepathy, and violin power converge, forcing Elara into an irreversible choice. However, once the hybrid solution (propagate dream through empire) appears, opposition softens, and there is little sense of a truly viable alternative or lingering threat; the empire’s weight is more declared than actively resisting. Tension is strong but stops short of feeling ruthless or morally knotted.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—snaring a last spark to fend off Lirien’s oblivion—is established early and coherently escalated when the elder’s breath finally ceases and the static turns wilder. The key tightening is her choice to infuse her own fading light into the chip, which forecloses simple martyrdom and transforms the object into a dual-spark ward. However, tension remains mostly conceptual and aesthetic; there is little sense that the ritual might truly fail or that she might pay a lasting negative price beyond transient pain. As a result, the conflict feels elegant but somewhat low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can move from wounded forgiveness to genuine contentment while restoring the grove—is clear but largely internal and gently pressured. The main escalation is informational rather than oppositional: the vision sequence deepens the situation and unlocks the ritual, but there’s no on-page resistance or possibility of failure testing her resolve. Her agency in choosing to use the pin and scallop the petals is meaningful, yet it faces little real friction or cost. As a result, tension is meditative rather than sharply tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake (revenge vs relinquishing certainty) is clearly established and resolved, with the wind-chime ritual serving as the main pressure mechanism. There is a meaningful deepening when Alex hears a different chime pattern and glimpses his “splintered” reflection, pushing him to reconsider his narrative. However, the conflict stays largely internal and unopposed; Elias and the system never press him into a truly painful dilemma where he might credibly choose vengeance. As a result, tension feels contemplative rather than urgent, limiting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Elara can achieve reversal—is signaled, but on-page pressure remains mostly contemplative rather than truly conflictual. The main tightening is her visionary exposure to the grotto and the encoded lesson in the ripples, which redefines what “reversal” means. Yet she isn’t forced into a difficult trade-off in scene; choosing patience over haste is framed as obviously correct, without real temptation or competing harm. The piece reads more like a prologue to the real ordeal than a self-contained test of resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—unlock the arrowhead’s nature and attain motionless navigation—is legible early and sharpened by his obsessive, centuries-long vigil. Pressure escalates texturally: larger and denser flocks, purer harmonics, and accumulated time deepen the sense of commitment and cost. The climax, where the flock finally mirrors the spirals and Thren chooses to press the artifact to his forehead, is earned and clearly consequential. What keeps it mid–high rather than elite is that the conflict never quite tightens into a dilemma or sharp reversal; endurance is tested, but no serious alternative path or ethical tension challenges his course.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—will Thorne reclaim unshackled, human magic in an automated age?—is clear from early on, and escalation centers on his decision to unstrap and step into the mist vortex. Yet the conflict remains mostly conceptual and aesthetic; once he chooses to remove the bindings, nothing on the page truly resists him, and mist walking works on the first try without mishap. There’s little sense of real risk (physical, moral, or existential) that forces trade-offs or tests his resolve, so the peak reads more like a foregone consummation than a pressured choice. The result is thematically potent but dramatically soft.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—finding or losing Lira forever—is clear, but it’s never seriously tested on the page. Elias decides to go, enters the wreck, receives guidance, and succeeds with no real resistance, reversal, or sacrifice, so pressure accumulates mostly by deepened wonder rather than sharpened risk. The librarian offers answers rather than real opposition, and no alternative outcome feels live once the library appears. As a result, escalation is more atmospheric than truly conflict-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.5)
    The stakes—cosmic realignment versus dissolution into stellar doubt—are huge in concept but stay abstract on the page. The main pressure comes from her need to choose and interpret the correct bursts, yet the declaration that the coins are “infallible arbiters” removes much of the risk of error and so flattens potential tension. There is escalation in the progression from lesser bursts to the “core burst,” and the realization that the universe’s self-doubt catalyzed rebirth is a meaningful deepening. Still, her path never feels genuinely endangered; conflict reads as controlled ritual rather than a hard-fought, costly decision.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elowen will face and fix her grief by naming the fears that consumed Lirian—is legible early and pursued throughout. Pressure escalates via the sequence of monsters: from the first naming to Nyxara’s isolation terror, to the final confrontation with Vorath/oblivion. Her choice to proceed despite rising emotional cost and embodied pain constitutes a real, if internal, sacrifice that forecloses hiding from her trauma. Still, each step resolves with relative ease; a sharper felt risk of failure or refusal at one naming would heighten tension.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—restore cosmic equilibrium or the stars and tides unravel—is stated early and revisited through the chaotic dripping and stellar flickers. Escalation is present but modest: the key tightening beat is the failed first repair, when the crack widens and the drips go “chaotic frenzy,” forcing Elowen into a riskier, more precise method. Internal conflict (doubt vs devotion) and external difficulty interweave, but the price he pays is mainly exhaustion rather than a sharper loss or tradeoff. As a result, the conflict reads strong but not harrowing given the declared cosmic scale.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will continue to carry his guilt in isolation or transform it into shared, constructive memory—is clear and does tighten as he follows the photos to the final revelation. The key escalation is the discovery of his own image with his mother, forcing explicit recollection and leading to the decision to confess and burn the photographs. However, external pressure is fairly soft: Mira does not significantly oppose or complicate his choices, and nothing on the page materially resists his chosen mode of atonement. As a result, the price he pays reads more solemn than truly costly, keeping the conflict strong but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—achieving inner harmony before an imminent, high-stakes transformation—is clearly signaled and carried through. Pressure escalates accumulatively via the crystal’s thawing, the sun cresting, the starlings’ increasingly charged formations, and the convergence of crystal, flame, and flock. Her choice to trust the intuitive codex in the birds over pure formula is a meaningful deepening that narrows her internal options. Yet there is no true reversal or concrete threat to the rite’s success, so the sense of cost and jeopardy remains more conceptual than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are legible and focused early: Lena’s life, the seed-pods, and the fragile currency of trust. Pressure escalates coherently with the discovery of the rogue updraft, then the secondary vortex demanding mid-transmission adaptation. Elias’s agency drives both turns through specific, technical decisions rather than generic “try harder” beats. However, there’s no genuine near-loss or sacrificed option—everything works on the first inventive attempt—so while tension is present, the sense of price paid is somewhat muted.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stakes—custody of the clone and Kai’s chance at emotional restoration versus the Collective’s control—are clearly signaled and remain coherent. Pressure escalates from verbal/legal pretense to magical/physical confrontation, then to the high-risk vivification rite while timelines destabilize, with Kai’s blood and the threat of “unstable revival” underscoring cost. Kai’s agency drives the key turns (taking the Blade, exposing Elara’s fear, seizing the jar, choosing to vivify despite his void). The conflict could gain further bite from a sharper, more morally fraught cost, but for this length it delivers a solid, earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—saving the property from predatory developers—is established, and the investigation of the seed loosely escalates via successive “orthogonal” tactics. Yet opposition never materializes on the page, and no option is meaningfully foreclosed; every new approach yields progress without setback or cost. The final “win” (documents and grants) arrives without a tough tradeoff or visible price, so tension remains mostly conceptual and under-pressurized. Conflict operates more as intellectual curiosity than true jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—can Elias transmute the household’s fossilized grief into laughter before the hourglass runs out—is clear and tightened by the temporal limit and by gradually intensifying winds and lullabies. Escalation is present as he brings more blowers online, surges the tempo, and the ghosts begin to stir, with the hourglass’s end cutting the ritual off at its peak. The primary cost is temporal and existential: he succeeds but is snapped back into solitude and silence, which is felt but not agonized over. The conflict leans meditative rather than sharply oppositional, so tension lives more in cadence than in genuine risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.8)
    The core stake—remain stranded or find a way home by befriending uncertainty—is clear, and there is at least one meaningful tightening when the pendant flares and the cultist’s apparition appears. However, waiting dominates the middle without much felt risk or alternative tactic, so pressure grows more atmospherically than through hard choices. The decision to welcome and interiorize the cultist is a genuine turn, but the story doesn’t clearly articulate what could be lost or damaged by that choice. As a result, conflict reads more meditative than tense, keeping stakes on the abstract side.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—defying a script of perpetual failure—is stated early and tracked through each iteration of the experiment. Escalation is clear in the increasing willingness to destroy more of the crozier, culminating in total obliteration. However, the conflict is largely one-sided experimentation versus inert matter; there’s little sense of genuine jeopardy or alternative paths, so tension stays conceptual rather than visceral. The cost of the final act (sacrificing the relic and his old identity) is implied but not deeply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stakes—preventing the city’s literal fall and extracting a meaningful signal from cosmic chaos—are stated clearly and linked to perigee as a time pressure. There is one meaningful tightening when she must abandon standard techniques and undertake the assumption-shedding inner work. However, the external danger (cables might snap, city might plunge) remains abstract; we never feel a near-miss, complication, or real possibility of failure after she begins tuning. Resolution comes smoothly once she engages her method, with little sense of trade-off or lingering cost.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—saving the vanishing commuter ferry and its passengers—is clear, and pressure does rise as the hull turns translucent and doubles overlap. Elias’s choice to use the radio via the hourglass patterns is a meaningful tightening that resolves the situation. However, there are no real reversals or failed attempts; once he understands the hourglass, the path to success unfolds smoothly. The resolution feels low-cost and low-friction, with little sense that failure is a live, narrowing possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can move from rational, illusory approximations of connection to something real—is clear but not strongly pressured. He encounters little resistance; once he commits to weaving, the story mostly proceeds in a straight intensification line without meaningful alternative options or trade-offs. The eruption is dramatic but doesn’t exact a visible price beyond temporary chaos; he emerges largely unscathed, with gains but no real loss or compromised value. As a result, escalation feels more like a volumetric increase in imagery than a tightening conflict with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—whether humanity will remain “anchored in ignorance” or learn to traverse the unfolded horizons—is clearly stated but remains abstract. Conflict is largely procedural and cooperative; Elara offers exactly what Kai seeks, and the lesson proceeds smoothly with no setback, risk, or moral trade-off that forces a difficult decision. The rift portal simulation hints at peril, but no on-page test of courage or cost accompanies it. As a result, pressure only modestly deepens rather than truly escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Clara lives or reenacts her mother’s death—is clear and meaningful. Tension escalates credibly from eerie discovery to the revelation of Clara’s suicidal intent and the urgency of conveying Evelyn’s message. However, Clara’s resistance is minimal; her acceptance of the supernatural claim and subsequent reversal feel emotionally under-tested, reducing the sense of real jeopardy. The conflict resolves cleanly and a bit easily given the premise’s weight.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stakes—survive the claustrophobic, tide-bound descent while reclaiming the erased team’s memory—are clear and present early. Pressure escalates via the narrowing passage, the tidal deadline, and the intensifying metaphysical risk of phasing, culminating in her decision to synchronize with the codex and traverse solid rock. However, the path from decision to success is relatively smooth: there’s little sense of genuine risk to the return protocol beyond discomfort, and no serious setback or trade-off once she commits to phase transitions. As a result, the cost feels emotionally real but tactically low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s need to confirm her aliveness and fetch “wisdom from failure”—is established early and tied to the ghost’s survival as data. There is some escalation as the ghost pleads for cohesion and she undertakes the risky, improvised defragmentation via ink patterns. Yet resistance is minimal: there’s no real sense her attempt might fail, harm her, or trap her in the archive, so the pressure doesn’t significantly narrow her options. The resolution feels more like a successful ritual than a hard-won choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Thorne can preserve the language’s textures before they vanish—is clearly signaled and comes to a satisfying resolution, but escalation is mostly conceptual rather than dramatized. The diamond’s rumored curse and the threat of madness never become specific on-page tests; his near-omnipotent success in the ritual undercuts felt risk. The main tightening is temporal (last elders dying, children shifting tongues) plus the one decisive ritual, which works structurally but stays emotionally cool. The conflict is thematically weighty yet could use one concrete, resistant beat to raise pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara remains locked in bitterness or embraces the post-Change “play”—is signaled clearly and ties to her relationship with her brother. Yet the conflict escalates only modestly: tension rises when she hears the confessions and her brother’s voice, but she does not seriously resist or wrestle with the choice; the first big test is also the last. There’s no substantial reversal or costful trade-off beyond an internally narrated letting go, so pressure never quite tightens into a dilemma. The result is emotionally coherent but somewhat low-friction for the ambitions of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—freeing the orchard from mechanical blight—is evident, and escalation follows a logical arc from quiet, covert playing to open confrontation at the heart tree. There is one meaningful tightening when the statues converge and the central tree splits, forcing Elara into direct, physical action. However, danger and cost remain low: the statues never truly threaten to stop or harm her, and she uproots the iron roots with relative ease. The conflict functions and resolves but lacks a sharper trade-off or genuine risk to reach higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can continue smuggling people toward healing in the face of surveillance—is legible and his covert launches do create a gentle tightening of pressure. The patrol’s “routine check” and the distant siren offer embryonic reversals, but they resolve quickly and without real cost, so the danger remains more implied than viscerally felt. Internal and external conflicts are nicely braided (his personal longing fuels his risky help for others), yet the piece never forces a genuinely hard trade-off or closes off an option on the page. As a result, escalation feels atmospheric rather than sharply consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can transform this pocket of ruin and silence into living art—is present but soft, with little external resistance or time pressure beyond the lyrical “elastic” hush. The key “turn” is his decision to hum, allowing the fragment’s magic and the restoration to bloom, but this choice faces minimal on-page friction. Conflict is mostly internal and thematic, yet his vow vs. song tension resolves quickly without visible consequence or sacrifice. As a result, the piece is compellingly atmospheric but produces limited tension or felt risk.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Eliza can reawaken analog memories and reach the story-realm without losing herself—is present and coherently built. There is a clear tightening when the scarf activates: the abstract quest becomes immediate, and hyperbolic space “pulls at her,” forcing a choice about immersion vs remaining anchored. However, that pressure is resolved fairly gently via a patron’s cough and her quiet refolding, so the cost and narrowing of options feel modest rather than acute. The conflict works for a lyric piece but stops short of a truly bracing test of her values.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can reclaim the runaway dream in some form—is signaled early and escalates through the repeated dawn attempts, the dream’s flickering partial apparitions, and the draining palette. The third-dawn sequence is a clear tightening: limited remaining paint, rising insistence of whispers, and the dream’s moment of “reluctant surrender.” Internal and external conflict are braided but the inner moral calculus (what it means to trap a dream) stays mostly implicit, so the price reads more conceptual than agonizing on the page. Overall pressure is coherent and builds, though not through sharp reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether they will face disorientation to free an idea bound by fear—is clear, but the pressure never truly sharpens into a hard trade-off. Disorientation is described as the price, yet she endures it without real resistance or risk of failure, and his own “beginning the work” occurs without any on-page setback or counterforce. The conflict remains largely conceptual rather than dramatized through irreversible choices that close doors. As a result, escalation feels more like a smooth lyric ramp than a tightening crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming stolen memories—is clear and remains central, and there is a meaningful deepening when the mushrooms’ glow mirrors the constellations and the theft’s mechanism is revealed. However, opposition is largely abstract and non-resistant; once he returns, nothing seriously threatens failure or imposes a difficult trade. His invocation and study work on the first attempt, so escalation reads more as gradual unveiling than as tightening pressure with foreclosed options. The emotional payoff is satisfying but arrives without much felt risk of loss.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Kai regaining his place in the world if he proves resilience—is signaled early, and the shadow-in-glass moment is a solid deepening that forces a concrete test of that resilience. Elara’s barked urgency at the sigil beat provides real pressure on Kai to act under fear. However, the path from test introduction to success is very straight; there is no serious setback or price, so escalation feels moderate rather than bracing. The external and internal conflicts align nicely but never quite bite hard enough to feel high-stakes at elite-publication level.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.8)
    The stakes—loss of childhood awe and a graying world—are enormous, but the on-page conflict remains abstract and largely unopposed. Once Elowen appears, Lirien decides to help and the ritual proceeds flawlessly; his “pruning” of a frayed thread neatly stabilizes everything without resistance or sacrifice. Elowen’s doubt is invoked then instantly dispelled by the seed’s success, so no option is meaningfully foreclosed. The result is a pleasant, gently escalating sequence rather than true pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—freeing trapped spirits and, by extension, addressing Lirien’s unresolved guilt—is signaled early and threaded through the unraveling of the net. There is clear escalation as more knots are undone, prisms tremble, and the final knot proves resistant and personally tied to the shade. However, opposition is largely conceptual; there is little sense that Lirien might fail or that a wrong move would exact a concrete price beyond generalized warnings about shattering silence. The resolution feels somewhat smooth, with the final knot yielding quickly once pierced, so the cost and narrowing of options could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stakes are internal and epistemic—can Elias uncover and ethically respond to the chapel’s silence, and thus to his own grief. There is a clear tightening when investigation shifts from archive comparison to physical descent, and again at the keystone decision. However, conflict is mostly one-sided; nature, institutions, or other people never meaningfully oppose him, so nothing tests the price he’s willing to pay. As a result, tension is steady but gentle, never quite sharpening into a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.8)
    Conflict is primarily internal and conceptual, centered on how Elara understands and relates to death and surrender. There is a gentle deepening—from simple curiosity, to the anomalous globe and note, to a more encompassing epiphany about “entanglement reversed”—but pressure never really tightens or corners her into a meaningful trade-off. Her decisions (not alerting anyone, releasing the globe, ascending) don’t feel costly or contested on the page. The result is thematically resonant but low in felt stakes and escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—whether the ghost’s encoded pleas can be fully articulated and freed—is clear, and Elowen’s desire is aligned with it. There is one main tightening as she finds and uses the flower press bolt plate to merge code and graffiti. However, there is no meaningful opposition: neither the world nor Elowen herself significantly resists the goal, and everything required appears exactly when needed. As a result, escalation is more procedural than pressurized, and the final success carries little sense of risk or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Lira uncovers and integrates the painful coded truth about herself—is clear, and the diary’s layers provide a notional escalation floor by floor. Yet Lira faces little genuine resistance; she never seriously considers closing the diary or defying its implications, so there’s limited sense of options narrowing or prices rising. The revelation that she is the child is a strong informational turn but not matched by an equally tested choice. As a result, tension is more atmospheric than truly conflict-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—proving “empty spaces remember” to redeem Lira’s absence and his life’s work—is clear, and the snapped string forces a new, irreversible situation. Escalation is primarily internal and accumulative: successive cloud-emotion readings and glimpses of “spooled wholeness” build to the decisive act of sending the origami log and accepting permanent drift. That final stance crystallization is earned, but the external danger of being stranded in the upper atmosphere never meaningfully constrains his choices beyond the initial premise. As a result, tension stays largely conceptual rather than viscerally tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—finish an impossible mirror before demolition erases the library—is clear and present early, and the demolition countdown plus the precision demands give some sense of rising pressure. Her prosopagnosia and unique way of seeing function as internal conflict against the guild’s more limited vision, aligning external and internal stakes. However, the crafting sequence lacks a genuine on-page setback or near-failure; once she deciphers the coin, success feels nearly assured. The cost is mostly in what’s lost around the success (the tree, her recognition), which reads more elegiac than sharply pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.5)
    The primary stake—Elara’s drive to uncover a discovery worthy of legend—is clear, but it remains more aspirational than pressured until late. The sudden external conflict with the starlings does escalate tension, yet it appears and is solved in short order, undercutting any sense of real risk or trade-off. Elara’s internal and external wants never truly collide; she gets safety, power, and discovery without meaningful compromise. The escalation is present but feels gentler and more convenient than the premise warrants.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can find and internalize the “rhythm of repair” his father embodied—is present, but the path toward it meets little resistance. The prophecies guide him, the gears fit “as if predestined,” and there’s no concrete risk of failure or cost beyond generalized emotional strain. The one tightening beat is the assembly/uncapping moment as the light intensifies, but even there the outcome feels assured. As a result, tension is more contemplative than pressurized, limiting stakes impact.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—whether the family can save the blighted orchards by trusting Lir’s instructions—is clear and scaled appropriately. However, most conflict is summarized and resolved relatively smoothly, so doubt (“Why trust a ghost?”) never really bites or forces a costly choice. Escalation exists (increasing blight, more urgent messages), but it doesn’t narrow options sharply; the group ultimately just tries the bell with little on-page risk of loss. The result is emotionally pleasant but not truly tense.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—buying humanity a sliver of mercy at the edge of annihilation—is clear and appropriately scaled to the concept. Pressure tightens when he commits to using the puppet head and pane to push the lullaby through, and the visible cost is the destruction of his only companion and his own apparent dissolution. However, opposition is largely atmospheric; nothing meaningfully pushes back against his plan, so tension is more about solemn ritual than contested effort. A small complication or genuine risk of failure on the page would deepen the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—save the travelers before frost and curse claim them—is signaled early and pursued through a clear sequence of increasingly committed actions (retrieving the blueprint, each marked junction, the final keystone throw). External pressure (approaching night, birds, voices growing closer) escalates well, but Elias encounters little real resistance beyond time, so the danger feels somewhat smoothed. The internal conflict is present but not sharply tested; he complains yet never wavers in tactics once committed.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.6)
    The central stakes—atonement for environmental harm and an attempt to transmute grief into ethical work—are clear and coherent. There is a meaningful deepening at the moment of insight when the river and foam reframe his entire research philosophy. However, after that turn, pressure doesn’t really escalate: the lab work and deployment succeed without obstacle, ethical dilemma, or sacrifice beyond effort implied in summary. The lack of visible resistance or trade-off undercuts tension and keeps conflict from feeling fully tested.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will remain a vendor of erasures or use his own method to rupture his looping story—is clear, and escalation is marked by progressively deeper, more revealing incisions. However, opposition remains mostly conceptual; there’s little concrete friction beyond his own recognition that voids define him, so the choice to step into the vortex feels more ordained than wrestled with. The story earns one meaningful tightening (the core glyph and map) but lacks a sharp reversal or trade-off between competing goods. The cost is present but more inferred than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elaris will confront and transform both his own and others’ remorse—is clear and escalates once he begins tasting the pools. His decision to keep absorbing and smoothing the remorse despite increasing emotional weight is the key pressure point, and the pavilion’s hums and cracking ice give some sense of strain. However, there’s little sense that he might fail, break, or choose to stop; no substantial reversal or narrowing of options complicates the path once he commits. As a result, tension feels more ritualistic than precarious.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—preventing harvest-time social fracture by restoring the grain elevator talks—is clearly signaled, and Elara’s bridge-building constitutes the main tightening move. However, antagonistic pressure is mostly abstract: the “shouted accusations” and farmers vs. workers tensions are summarized rather than staged in escalating beats. Once the bridge is built, the conflict resolves with striking ease; grumbles convert to laughter in a single choral scene, so the price of failure never fully bites. The resulting tension feels earnest but under-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether she can (and will) transform herself into this new role—is clear, and pressure “escalates” via increasingly dense visions and synaptic changes. However, opposition is minimal; the piece lacks a concrete risk of failure or harm beyond abstract identity dissolution, so tension remains low-grade. Her success feels inevitable rather than contested, and no real option is foreclosed on the page except in conceptual terms. This keeps the experience texturally rich but dramatically soft.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—recovering “forgotten combinations” before the inversion hour ends—is clear, and there is one escalation when gravity flips and the threshold opens. However, Elara encounters almost no resistance: no real risk of failure, injury, or misinterpretation, and no moral or emotional tradeoff. The time constraint is mentioned but never felt as a tightening vise; she moves from discovery to success in a relatively frictionless line. As a result, tension is atmospheric rather than truly pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring some form of music to a silent world—is clear, but opposition remains mostly atmospheric rather than active. Pressure escalates via intensification of the performance (from first low thrum to full symphonic swell), yet Elowen never faces a real risk of failure or sacrifice beyond exertion. The grove responds in a largely cooperative way, so conflict reads as ritual fulfillment rather than test. As a result, the climax is beautiful but emotionally gentler than the premise could support.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—mending the eclipsed covenant before the great alignment—is clear, and the tension builds through increasingly complex correlations of silence to board and monoliths. Escalation is mostly textural and internal: each “silence” becomes more fraught until the final, betrayal-laced quiet clarifies the guardians’ grievance and triggers the hum and shudder. The cost is primarily conceptual/emotional (world partially saved, but phase and exile unchanged), with little direct resistance or risk to Elias himself beyond failure. That keeps the conflict compelling but somewhat gentle, more meditative ritual than truly pressured crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—recover the diary’s contents before the fireworks break this unique silence—is clear and time-bounded. There is some escalation as he tunes through frequencies and sweats under the ticking clock. However, there’s no substantial reversal, complication, or real risk; the tuner works on first serious attempt and resistance from the clasp is more decorative than threatening. As a result, tension remains relatively low and the final success feels expected rather than earned against genuine pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—can Elara endure the corpse flower’s stench and extract a deeper serenity from it—is clearly signaled and escalates from faint rot-scent to overwhelming bloom. The turning point at the full eruption, where she collapses yet keeps sketching and finds meaning inside the assault, credibly tests her initial ambition. Internal and external pressures (her nose, the village’s motion, social doubt) interweave. However, the danger feels largely experiential rather than consequential—there’s little sense that failure would carry lasting personal or communal loss beyond a missed insight—so the cost reads more thematic than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stakes (saving her withered groves and, by extension, averting famine) are clear and present from early on, with the inversion window providing structural time pressure. Escalation is primarily environmental and informational: core resonance increases, the arches enclose, and the discovery of the nexus/arrow reweights her options. However, conflict remains relatively smooth—she encounters no real resistance to taking the artifact and no on-page moral calculus about harming the wider planet to save her grove. As a result, pressure rises but never fully crystallizes into a hard tradeoff with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding the cause to prevent future disasters—is clear, but present-tense danger is minimal and mostly atmospheric. Escalation is intellectual rather than visceral: deeper into the maze, more data, then the conceptual convergence at the crater. Elias’s choices (where to place sensors, donning the mask, transmitting the report) aren’t framed as difficult trade-offs with visible cost. The piece maintains interest but never quite tightens into high-pressure conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether wonder can enter the “sculpted hush” without shattering peace—is clear but remains abstract. There is one main tightening: Elyra’s moment of commitment as she channels the aurora and strikes the bell. However, the risk of failure never feels sharply realized; there’s little sense of what concrete harm might occur beyond a vague threat to serenity. As a result, escalation is present but soft, more ceremonial than genuinely pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elaron can extract meaningful insight from his failure—is signaled and resolved, and his agency (planning, traveling, playing) drives the turns. Escalation is relatively soft: once he reaches the amphitheater, the ritual and crossing unfold with little resistance, and the shadow thieves’ presence poses no real risk beyond emotional discomfort. The internal conflict between shame and the desire for wisdom is present but not sharply dramatized through competing impulses in-scene. As a result, tension feels contemplative rather than pressurized, limiting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can use transposed empathy to “quantify” emotion without losing control—is signaled early and escalates cleanly once the broadsheet is read. The key tightening comes when the transpose overwhelms them, turning his tactic (disorientation) back on him and forcing him into frenzied printing and a risky grab of the fragment. The cost is primarily internal and conceptual (psychic inundation, fragment drained), which fits the mode but feels slightly under-felt on the page; their recovery is swift and tidy. No major reversals are missing, but a sharper sense of what might be irrevocably lost would intensify the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is emotional and conceptual—whether Kael can still “germinate wonder” and whether Thorne’s legacy is live or dead—and this is clear early. Pressure does deepen as the pendant activates and the shared visions blur time, but opposition is soft: Lira’s routine suspicion dissolves quickly, and there’s minimal resistance or real risk to Kael’s choice. The only visible cost is Kael parting with the pendant, which is thematically right but under-emphasized as a sacrifice, so escalation feels gentle rather than gripping. The result is a satisfying but low-tension progression rather than a truly tested crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—can he prove objects retain emotional residue, and what that proof will cost his self-image—is clear and active from early on. Pressure deepens notably when the experiment stops being “neutral data” and implicates him personally: Eliza’s name, *Feel me*, and the car replaying familial violence collapse his scientific distance. His decision to both document and partially conceal the true nature of the findings (the “truthful lies” of the paper) is an earned, conflicted resolution with visible psychological cost. That said, the conflict remains mostly internal and unfolds smoothly; there’s little resistance or real risk of refusal once the phenomena manifest, which softens escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can send her message at the cost of herself—is clear, and pressure tightens when she discovers the puzzle edges and recommences the rite, knowing it will consume her essence. Internal and external stakes align in the climax as her life force visibly dims to fuel the tapestry. However, conflict is largely foregone: there’s little resistance, doubt, or complication once the method appears, so escalation reads more as ritual completion than tested struggle. The cost is strong and legible, but the path to it could use one more pressured beat or obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—preventing Lirath’s decay by turning rubble into resilience—is clear from early on and resolved at the end in a concrete way. However, antagonistic pressure is largely abstract (entropy, past collapse) rather than active or adaptive; nothing in the present really pushes back once Elar has the silk. The shaft sequence lacks a real reversal or spike in risk: the stones tremble, then work as intended, scaling up without complication. As a result, tension plateaus; the story traces a purposeful process more than an escalating conflict with visibly rising cost.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the withheld truth of her origins and its multiversal cost—is clear, and pressure does deepen as each redirect reveals a higher price (from curiosity to cosmic burden and engineered purpose). The key tightening is when the mentor’s echo states “weave or all unravels,” forcing Elara to take or refuse the role; that choice reweights everything prior. Yet the conflict is mostly internal and relatively smooth; refusal or rebellion are gestured at via “doubt flickered” but never fully dramatized as live options with concrete consequences in scene. As a result, tension is solid rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stakes—whether the “bottled” safety of the light and letters will persist as Harlan fails and the lamp goes out—are clear, and there is one solid tightening when Elias discovers the anonymous chain and chooses to contribute to it. External pressures (storm, haunt, Harlan’s worsening cough) remain mostly atmospheric rather than forcing hard trade-offs. The final choice to “protect” the chain has conceptual cost but feels relatively low-pressure on the page, with escalation more textural than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—Elias choosing to unleash ancient shadows to reshape humanity—is huge but mostly conceptual, with no concrete counterforce. Escalation is primarily a matter of scale (from storm to world-reframing darkness) rather than tightening pressure or narrowing options. Once he sees the prophetic images, nothing resists his plan; his “fervent resolve” leads straight to success. As a result, the story reads more like an origin myth of a change than a conflict under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elowen can understand and safely manage the story-magnetism of her transplanted heart—is clear but remains largely internal and contemplative. Pressure does build as the sun intensifies and the revelation about the donor’s fate emerges, reweighting the gift as a potential threat. However, there is little real opposition or narrowing of options beyond “understand vs be overwhelmed,” and no moment where she must pay a visible price or forego something concrete. The final choice to adopt “watchful” use of the gift feels right but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether quantified sorrow can be transformed into something gentler and whether Elias can finally access the trees’ “truths”—is present but soft. The escalation through the three sextant components is structurally tidy, yet each step feels assured rather than pressured; nothing meaningfully threatens his goal, body, or belief. The corridor journey with the final shard hints at tension but resolves instantly into revelation once the “pin” moment arrives. Elegant, but dramatically underpowered for elite-market standards.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—reviving the realm and its communities—is clear, and the progressive songs plus gathering spirits give a semblance of escalation. However, opposition from the endless night is underdeveloped: shadows “howl” and bind the glow but never seriously endanger failure, and Elara never appears at genuine risk of losing. The conflict is largely metaphysical and lyric, which is fine, but it reads as a smooth ascent more than a pressured trial with foreclosed options. As a result, the climax is beautiful but not especially tense.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will continue to hide from the Order or finally answer its call—is present, but the pressure around it is relatively gentle. There is one meaningful tightening when the young man presents the invitation and the clock nears midnight, prompting her to act where she once refused. Yet the hinted threat of a “trap” is never paid off, no one opposes her, and she faces no substantive consequence for either choice, so escalation remains mostly conceptual. The resolution feels more like a foregone conclusion than a hard-won stance.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake is emotional: whether Elias can move from paralyzing guilt and silent observation into active repair with Mira and their shared past. Pressure deepens when Mira arrives unannounced and starts naming the loss (“You’ve made a paradise from trash”; “I noticed the bakery gone”), forcing him to articulate the “creep” and accept complicity. The turning point is her whispered “I forgive you” and their vow to tend the garden together, which reconfigures their estrangement at real but understated cost. Escalation is more of a steady thickening than a sharp crux, leaving some potential tension (e.g., disagreement or flare of blame) underused.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—preserving the luminous vows against oblivion—is clear, and tension nominally rises as frequencies weaken and the library drifts. However, Elias never faces a genuine trade-off or credible chance of failure; each step proceeds smoothly from one measurement to the next. The supposed peril (entropy, abyss, descent) stays conceptual rather than viscerally felt in his body or choices. As a result, escalation registers more as deepening description than sharpened conflict or narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.7)
    The dominant stake—disrupt the truce-sealing deal and capture the sound of trust breaking—is clear early and escalates via the series of false starts to the climactic public accusation. The time pressure of sunrise and the risk of calling out Thorne in a den of pirates create coherent, growing pressure. Lila’s final choice to sacrifice the hush and ignite violence is a genuine narrowing of options with lasting world consequences, though her personal risk feels lightly treated (she slips away rather easily). One more concrete brush with danger—near capture or injury—would sharpen the sense of price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will cling to skepticism or open herself to the reality and meaning of weather-carriers—is clear and culminates in her understanding and joining them. Escalation is mostly textural: taste-shifts intensify, the ring spins and then locks, the personal weathers become more present, and the explanation reweights her worldview. Still, there is little concrete risk or visible cost; her change comes without sacrifice beyond an internal reorientation. The conflict remains contemplative rather than tense, keeping pressure moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—whether Elias will reclaim his locked-away creativity—is clear, and the lock repair provides a concrete task under modest pressure. Escalation is present but gentle: once he remembers the spare assembly, obstacles yield quickly with little genuine risk or sacrifice. His mnemonic gift and prior foresight solve the problem almost frictionlessly, dampening tension. The resolution is earned but feels comfortable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—can Elara find and access a space where truth endures, and thus resolve her fixation on “lost conversations”—is signaled early and followed through. Pressure escalates as she moves from petty marketplace lies to systemic ledger deceit to the deep, personal lie from her mentor, culminating in her choice to publicize the vault and alter her practice. The physical cost (wilting, breathlessness) is present but never pushes her to a truly agonized tactical trade-off, keeping the conflict more lyrical than harrowing. The final stance—inscribing a new maxim and openly sharing—reads earned, though the ethical calculus remains relatively unambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.3)
    The central stake—preserving the spectrum of wonder before it fades—is powerful but remains mostly conceptual, with little concrete resistance or on-page jeopardy beyond the slow thaw. Escalation is present in the increasing complexity and activation of the sculpture, but there are no real reversals or hard trade-offs dramatized; entropy is noted more than it is felt as tightening pressure. Elara’s agency is steady rather than tested, so the conflict feels relatively low-friction despite world-scale implications. The piece functions more as a poetic origin-myth of the sculpture than as a scene of escalating struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stakes (farm survival and Zeta’s mental integrity) are established early and steadily escalated by the magnetic storm, the roses’ mutation, and the unleashed fears. There is a clear tightening via the choice to open the box, then a further deepening with the two-step tactic (contain/miniaturize, then burn). The cost is more conceptual and psychological than visceral, which slightly mutes tension in the peak beats. Nonetheless, agency drives every major turn and no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stakes—solving the mailbox mystery and using it to heal community rifts—are clear, but the pressure remains gentle. The main escalation is the layering of clues via stories while external city noise rises, yet there is no serious resistance, moral dilemma, or credible risk of failure. Elena never faces a hard trade-off or moment of doubt; she simply interprets and acts. As a result, the resolution feels more like an inevitable unveiling than a hard-won turn.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.4)
    The central stakes—liberating the archive and then the colleagues—are clearly stated and escalate in scope. Yet conflict is relatively frictionless: the journal yields to her, the AI accepts her dance after a single performance, and the pods revive without complication. The environmental danger is gestured at but does not significantly alter her options or inflict loss. As a result, tension exists in concept more than in felt, escalating pressure, and the resolution lacks a sharp, costly test of her commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—retrieving erased memories and potentially restoring them to the town—is clear, and the excavation of the heart is a meaningful tightening. However, opposition remains mostly environmental and modest: fluctuating gravity and physical labor, with little genuine risk of failure or moral friction. Once the divination provides a map, the path feels relatively unchallenged, so escalation is more procedural than sharply pressured. The ending resolves cleanly but without a strongly felt price or narrowed options beyond implied responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—preventing a cataclysmic prophecy—is stated early, and the decision to attempt the ritual gives the scene baseline pressure. Yet the conflict feels largely conceptual; nothing on the page resists him beyond internal visions, and the ritual unfolds as a smooth execution rather than a contested struggle or ethical trade-off. The moment when the prophecy’s code “stirred within him” could have been a pivot that complicates or endangers the process, but he simply “pressed on” without consequences. Stakes read large in summary but remain abstract in the lived scene, muting tension.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—Elara forcing the truth about the buildings’ language from Harlan—is legible early and comes to a head on the rooftop. There is one meaningful tightening when she stops accepting his “humoring” and actively interrogates him, even physically grabbing his wrist, which propels the reveal. However, Harlan’s resistance is relatively soft, so the conflict resolves quickly once challenged; we don’t see options genuinely narrow or a hard trade-off beyond abandoning their shared pretense. The stakes feel more conceptual and atmospheric than acutely pressured, which keeps escalation competent but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether she can archive the quarantined memory without being overwhelmed—is signaled early and followed through to closure. Pressure builds via the time limit (before the last star fades), the intensifying whispers, and the pain of recollection as the memory breaches quarantine. Her commitment is tested by fear of catastrophic failure, leading to a meaningful tightening when she chooses to continue the ritual despite the risk. However, escalation remains relatively smooth and internal; there is no on-page reversal or major complication that significantly narrows options beyond what’s declared in exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.8)
    The core stake—whether Elias will successfully sever his bond to the treason and truly forgive the unfinished—is clear, and the unlinking of each specific edict provides a nice structural beat. However, escalation is modest: nothing resists him except his own summary backstory, and once he starts the rite, there’s no real sense that he might fail, stop, or pay a sharper price. The stalactites dripping faster and the aurora’s “approval or warning” hint at rising pressure but never solidify into a felt dilemma or risk. As a result, the ending satisfies quietly but without much teeth.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stakes—maintaining a fragile pact while pursuing forbidden knowledge—are signaled and do escalate via each new whisper increasing suspicion and potential betrayal. The merchant’s greed and eventual lunge provide a clear external conflict that intersects with Elyra’s disclosure strategy. However, resolution feels a bit too easy: the guardian swiftly neutralizes the merchant and Elyra’s final cry costs her little, so pressure doesn’t tighten as sharply as it could. Internal stakes (her need for answers vs. the risks of revealing them) are articulated but not sharply dramatized in difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the betrayal to free the ghosts and salvage innocence—is signaled early and followed through via the escalating intensity of dream-cameos. Pressure tightens as she moves from fragmentary visions to naming the first mate and forcing his confession, with the locked-in ritual preventing easy escape from the confrontation. Agency is clear in her decision to command the globe, bind the mate, and insist on truth drawn from subtle dream cues. However, opposition feels relatively soft: the mate’s resistance is brief and not especially dangerous, so the cost of success remains more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes remain mostly conceptual—whether Kai will apprehend and honor hidden effort—so tension never rises beyond a meditative hum. The “conflict” is essentially a choice to follow the moon paths and invest care in a discarded net, but there’s no resistance, competing demand, or real risk of failure. Pressure does accumulate texturally via motifs, not via narrowing options or escalating cost. As a result, the piece reads as a beautifully-rendered reverie rather than a fully pressurized story.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—debunking a supposed curse—evolves effectively into a higher-stakes ethical conflict about whether to expose powerful tech. Pressure tightens through the investigative sequence and peaks when he realizes that revelation would invite warlords and weaponization. His final choice to re-bury the diamond and preserve the myth clearly forecloses a path he has lived by, with a conceptual and moral cost. The conflict is mostly internal and quiet, but it coheres and escalates under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—remaking the world’s allegiances through forbidden frequencies—is strongly signaled, and pressure does increase as signals cohere, followers arrive, and sabotage hits. Yet key tests of that stake are undercut: Mira’s betrayal is instantly neutralized by the shadows, and Elias’s central “choice” at the end is simply to keep broadcasting despite a vague warning. The conflict remains more conceptual than visceral; variant allegiances shift, but we do not feel a sharp trade-off or loss. Escalation is present but lacks a moment where a real option closes with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias’s work can truly bridge generations and justify his hermitic life—is clear but softly pressured. The main tightening is his decision to offer the “music box jar” to the grandmother, which could in theory expose him as a fraud or charlatan but in practice succeeds quickly and cleanly. There’s minimal resistance or complication; his doubt dissipates after a single positive encounter. As a result, conflict feels more atmospheric than sharply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes are explicit—protect the key, prevent its misuse, absolve or be consumed by the wraiths—and pressure escalates from ominous approach on the ice to a full pursuit and a high-intensity sonic confrontation. Elias’s key decision to “adapt, not flee” meaningfully narrows options and drives the climax through vibrational matching rather than brute destruction. The resolution hinges on his competence and choice, but the conflict resolves quickly once he engages the resonator; there’s little sense of risk that adaptation might fail or cost him something material. This keeps the piece from a higher band even though the structural tightening is sound.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—shattering the Regime’s mental yokes—is clear early, and the pressure tightens from internal struggle in the sanctuary to the exposed climb and timed sabotage on the viaduct. Elara’s agency drives the key turn: she chooses disciplined timing over impulsive attack and then risks herself to unyoke the core. Internal and external conflicts interweave well, but the lack of serious on-page obstacles or near-failure during the sabotage slightly flattens escalation. The price feels more implied (risk, past deaths) than acutely experienced in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central conflict—Elara’s need to free herself from Marcus’s control—emerges clearly and is effectively braided with the external investigation and Lila’s historical flight. Pressure escalates through the environment (flooded tunnel, testing trains) and the intensifying visions, culminating in Marcus’s text and the tunnel-shaking train as a combined trigger for her decisive rebellion. However, Marcus remains entirely off-page, so the threat feels slightly abstract, and her resistance—while earned—faces relatively little on-page friction in the moment. The stakes are emotionally significant but could benefit from one more concrete sign of danger or loss linked to Marcus.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stakes—Elias’s need to transform hollow apology into meaningful action and to see whether Marcus’s heart can “wind again”—are clearly established and coherently maintained. Pressure escalates modestly via Harrow’s painstaking repair, the storm’s intensification, and Elias’s deepening memories and realizations. However, the conflict is largely internal and reflective, with limited on-page testing of Elias’s resolve beyond showing up and watching; the final vow arrives without a hard trade-off or contested choice in the present. The repair’s success leaning on almost-miraculous light undercuts some potential for a more costed, agency-driven turn.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can translate the glyphs and seed machine yearning—is clear but remains almost entirely unopposed. Once she finds the arrow tip, every step proceeds without setback, constraint, or meaningful resistance; rivals who “mock from afar” never generate actual friction. The algorithm works on first application, and even the specter of machine mutiny is treated as “glorious folly” rather than a tested risk. This lack of tightening pressure or trade-offs significantly weakens dramatic tension and keeps the story from feeling like a true struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—Elara risking her position and safety to learn the truth about “deleted” data—is set up and pays off via the lie and the triggered audit. There is a clear escalation from pattern-spotting to unauthorized access to corporate alarms and purge. Yet most resistance is procedural and offstage, with the key prices (terminal lock, job loss) delivered in summary instead of as felt obstacles. As a result, tension is present but never quite bites as hard as the premise allows.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake (avert war between orchard and ice wraiths) is clearly stated, and the parley set-up promises real pressure. Yet once Thorne places the fragment and engages the mirrors, resistance from the wraith or dryad largely evaporates; their shifts from hostility to acceptance occur quickly and without a serious setback or moral trade-off. The “weighted breath” suggests a high-tension window, but the escalation is more declarative than felt, and no significant option is truly foreclosed by her choice. As a result, the conflict resolves cleanly but not deeply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Liora’s need to truly hear the sound of endings—is clear and persists, with pressure tightening around two key beats: the near-death sigh of the rescued woman and Tomas’s breath at the dock. Conflict is primarily internal and conceptual; external danger (thin ice, trawl nets) is mostly off-stage or in summary, so immediate risk feels muted. Her breaking point with the parasol snapping and the final acceptance of “no more trawling needed” provide a credible internal turn but not a sharply contested choice with visible alternatives on the page. The result is emotionally satisfying but relatively low-tension.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elena clings to an incompatible engagement or accepts the cost of divergence—is legible early through the quarrel and her dreams of rural life. However, conflict remains mostly internal and conversational; once she enters the pavilion, there’s little escalation or narrowing of options beyond Theo’s gentle nudging. The mulled-wine conversation deepens understanding but doesn’t force a sharp trade-off or reversal. The ending’s stance crystallization is clear but arrives without a strong sense of tested resistance or visible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are clearly stated (wisdom will fade if not preserved), but conflict is almost entirely procedural and uncontested. The parapet is said to “resist all but sidelong truth,” yet it never actively resists beyond that rule; once the method is known, every step works on first try. Pressure therefore plateaus: there is a sense of importance but little escalation or genuine risk of loss. The final success is earned in process terms, not through a hard trade-off or visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.0)
    The dominant stake—transmuting communal pain into a healing “masterpiece”—is signaled early, but it faces almost no friction or risk on the page. Once Elara opens the case and lays out the photographs, everything proceeds in a smooth upward glide: the townsfolk arrive, participate, confess, and heal without resistance or complication. There is no meaningful escalation, reversal, or price beyond tears; the process feels foregone rather than earned. As a result, tension is low and the ending, though pretty, lacks bite.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elowen will decode and testify against the terminal hush of language—is clear and does tighten once she starts hearing and assembling the pattern. The primary escalation is internal and conceptual rather than dramatic: the sequences grow denser and stranger until they compel her to speak, and the act of testimony forecloses her former pure reticence. While there’s no strong external antagonist, the hush and supposed end of words function as a situational pressure that she actively opposes. The tension is more meditative than gripping, but coherent and genuinely reweighted at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—securing a lasting record of aging’s sound despite his forgetfulness—is clearly signaled and pursued. Pressure escalates in an accumulative way: the sound grows clearer, visions intensify, and his tactics refine (rearranging markers, redrawing sigils) until he reaches the amphitheater. Agency is present in how he uses his limited foresight and tools, and the final act of recording then replaying feels earned, but the conflict remains largely internal and contemplative, with minimal jeopardy or hard trade-offs. As a result, the tension is strong for a lyric piece but never reaches a sharply painful price point.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.5)
    The external stakes (loss of the observatory and the once-in-an-eon pulsar observation) are clearly set and escalate as the quake worsens and the anomaly warps every clock. The internal stake—Elias’s need to “harness the ephemeral”—interlocks with this, and his decision to open and alter the master chronometer is a meaningful tightening of risk. However, the actual cost paid feels relatively light: he succeeds on the first conceptual try once he spots the leaf cue, with no significant failure beat or sacrificed alternative, so pressure never quite hits a breaking point. The tension is real but a bit under-exploited for maximal impact.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—facilitating a “flawless goodbye” through father–daughter reunification—is clear and present from early on, and Elara’s actions are oriented around it. However, tension remains gentle and largely unopposed; Lena comes when called, and reconciliation happens without real resistance or a decisive, costly trade-off. The hymning deepens emotional stakes but does not materially narrow options or introduce reversals beyond a slow emotional opening. Harlan’s death is inevitable rather than escalated by choices, so the pressure arc feels more like a soft glide than a tightening coil.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering where shadows go at noon—is clear, and there is a mild escalation as she awakens each automaton and the visions intensify. Conflict is primarily procedural and intellectual; the automatons offer resistance only as incomplete circuits rather than active opposition, so pressure never narrows her options sharply. There’s no real moment where Elara must risk something meaningful, choose between competing goods, or confront a moral or emotional cost. As a result, tension is steady but relatively low-grade, more discovery than trial.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will cling to skepticism or risk believing in fae and acting on that belief—is clear, and it does tighten modestly as she uncovers the tooth and commits to Grandma’s method. Still, the on-page pressure remains low; the maze offers no real threat, the ritual proceeds smoothly, and there’s no time or social consequence pushing back against her choice. The substitute body and endangered child are potent but abstract here, never pressing her with a hard “if this fails, then what?” moment. As a result, escalation feels more like deepened ambiance than sharpened conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—creating and sharing safe light after fire trauma—is clear, and there is some deepening as Elara moves from private experiment to public offering. Internal and external stakes align nicely when she steps before the villagers with her creation. However, conflict remains largely one-sided; her work on the glass succeeds without meaningful friction, and no one in the village opposes or complicates her plan. As a result, the escalation feels more like a smooth unveiling than a pressured test of her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can transform publicized pain into a live, mutual connection—is legible, and the pivotal turn is her decision to proffer the pendant, which Kai accepts. However, pressure remains low: there’s little sense that he might reject her, leave, or that giving up the pendant might truly cost her beyond the implied sentimental value. Internal and external conflicts are harmonized rather than clashing, so escalation feels more like a gentle deepening than a genuine narrowing of options with sharp trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—will Elias succumb to despair and abandon the book or push “against the current” to salvage it—is clear, and the narrowing timeframe (“closing pages,” deepening mist) provides a mild tightening. However, each cameo is resolved in essentially the same way with little real risk of failure, so pressure escalates more in rhetoric than in actual costs or foreclosed options. His final stance feels more like a confirmation of a direction he was already leaning toward than a hard-won, high-price turn.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake (averting famine by restoring sacred practices) is clearly established, and Elowen’s ritual provides a focal action. Yet there is almost no antagonistic pressure: once “everything aligns,” success unfolds without setbacks, trade-offs, or visible risk, and no real options are foreclosed. The villagers’ participation and the moon’s descent function more as smooth crescendo than true escalation. As a result, tension is gentle and lyrical rather than gripping, and costs remain largely offstage.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Lir can successfully fix Eira’s last heartbeats into a map and thereby find a way to follow—remains legible throughout. Pressure escalates accumulatively: prolonged stillness to sync pulses, meticulous construction with limited materials, then the risky ignition of flash paper that could fail or destroy the work. The cost at the end is chiefly emotional and directional (accepting her death, committing to follow a metaphysical map), which suits the mode but keeps tension more internal than visceral. A single sharper on-page jeopardy or complication in the ritual itself could have deepened the sense of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—capturing and storing echoes/wonder—is clear but remains largely conceptual, with no explicit negative consequence for failure beyond disappointment and abstraction. Pressure does increase somewhat as he moves from first faint click to partial harvest to full cascade, but the progression feels methodical rather than fraught. There’s no true reversal or sacrifice; persistence yields success without much trade-off. As a result, tension is atmospheric rather than dramatically escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can survive and complete her atlas when the fractals overrun her—is clear, and it tightens effectively when she becomes boundary-lessly trapped. Her agency in recalling the ancestral method and re-orienting the burner drives the resolution. However, the sense of danger and sacrifice stays somewhat abstract and aestheticized; there’s limited felt narrowing of options beyond the conceptual. The final price (her partial fusion with the monument/role) is implied but not sharply dramatized as a loss.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—how Elara will hold onto Theo without being destroyed by loss—is legible and nicely aligned with the act of carving the locket. Pressure does accumulate texturally as she moves from blank to clasp to hollow to engraving, but there’s no serious obstruction, reversal, or real risk of failure; she mostly executes a plan already decided. The internal conflict stays low-key, so tension is more gentle than gripping, which limits escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can reclaim or must relinquish his old ambitions—is clear early and sharpened as personal fragments surface. Pressure escalates from abstract regret to direct self-confrontation when his ghost appears and challenges his narrative of “it wasn’t waste.” His final refusal to “chase again” and choice to descend constitute a real foreclosure with cost (giving up the carousel’s promised ascent). The conflict stays mostly internal and lyric, but there is at least one clear tightening and a meaningful trade-off at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—proving decay reversible by resurrecting the terminal—is clear but stays largely abstract and unopposed. Her engineering tasks escalate in complexity (electricity, water, air), yet nothing meaningfully fights back: no system failures, time limits, or hard trade-offs. As a result, tension is more implied than felt; the outcome never seems in serious doubt. The final “Awaiting intentions” line reframes possibility but doesn’t foreground what she risks losing.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will face sound and reconcile with his abandoned musical self—is clearly signaled and coherently pursued. Pressure escalates from pure silence to crystal whispers to the box’s full song, and his choice to wind it fully in that hostile-to-sound space is a real internal test. However, tension remains gentle throughout; there’s little sense that a different choice would have carried sharply felt consequence beyond continued wistfulness. The escalation is effective but low-intensity, limiting the category’s ceiling for an elite market.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake is epistemic—whether Elias can truly understand how lies are built—rather than physical, and this is an acceptable quiet focus. However, the external dangers of salvage (mud, snags, wreck instability) are named but never meaningfully tested, and he never has to choose between competing risks or values. The “pressure” is more implied portent than escalating conflict, so the middle beats don’t feel like they truly narrow his options. The realization at the end doesn’t arise from hard-won trade-offs, just from successful salvage.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—preserving fragile, encoded knowledge before it’s lost—is thematically potent but plays out with relatively low on-page resistance. The main conflict is a gentle puzzle: can the rope be decoded and the lore recovered, with Kael’s skepticism softening rather quickly. There is a meaningful deepening as Elias penetrates toward the “master weave” and commits to teaching the boy, narrowing his path to a life of stewardship. However, escalation feels mostly linear and contemplative rather than pressured; no real option is foreclosed beyond the abstract fear of forgetting.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can transform his loneliness and grief into a usable map of healing—is clear but stays mostly internal and contemplative. Pressure deepens when his sister’s absence is explicitly mapped onto the garden, but there’s little sense of options narrowing or a truly risky trade-off; he never seriously contemplates not engaging in the ritual. Escalation is more steady accretion than a pronounced tightening, which suits the mode but keeps tension modest. The resolution is earned yet relatively low-cost and conflict-light.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether beauty can be reawakened in a flawed, mechanized world—is clear, and pressure rises as Elarion commits to activating the device and the egg begins to crack. However, opposition is mostly atmospheric: the mechanical world’s “jealous fury” and the shuddering palace are evocative but do not force him into a concrete dilemma or sacrifice. The escalation culminates in the bird’s imperfect birth and the palace’s violent reaction, but Elarion’s agency at the peak is limited to holding and accepting the chick rather than making a truly pressured choice. The stakes thus feel conceptually high but experientially muted.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Lira can transform a site of her father’s destruction into a locus of healing—is clear but faces little on-page resistance. The primary “conflict” is internal and largely resolved by the time the scene opens; the graft proceeds without setback or meaningful test of resolve. This yields a contemplative, low-pressure piece where tension deepens texturally rather than through escalated choice or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—unfreezing a city’s stolen memories—is clear, and the quest structure provides some sense of progression as she follows increasingly charged “breadcrumbs.” However, pressure never tightens into a genuine dilemma: there’s no real risk of failure, alternate path, or visible price beyond “wait patiently and observe carefully.” As a result the climax feels inevitable rather than hard-won, limiting tension and dramatic payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—breaking or bending destructive generational cycles without igniting new conflagrations—is signaled early and persists throughout. Pressure coheres through the gear’s projections of endless loops and the memory of her dam’s catastrophic honesty, culminating in the decision to embed the gear as a soft, systemic intervention. Escalation is primarily conceptual rather than dramatic; the “calculations screaming eternal loops unless interrupted” is the lone explicit tightening beat. The conflict remains somewhat abstract and low-friction on the page, which blunts tension even as the final choice is thematically apt.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—will Elias find a legible “shape” for collective grief—is clear and followed through, and there is a meaningful deepening when the uncle’s specter directs him to the plague knot at the ribbon’s core. However, pressure remains low and mostly contemplative; Elias’s path is steady rather than contested, with little sense of what he risks by failing or succeeding beyond internal dissatisfaction. The escalation is textural (more specters, storm outside vs. calm inside) rather than conflictual, which fits the mode but limits tension. As a result, the final insight feels poignant but not hard-won in the sense of difficult trade-offs or foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s quest for redemption and restoration of communal balance—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure escalates from routine penance to a once-only, time-freezing confrontation with the ledger of his deeds at the pendulum’s pause. The cost is largely historical (thirty years of sacrifice) rather than newly exacted in-scene, which weakens the sense of a fresh trade-off at the climax. Internal and external stakes are well braided, but the outcome feels assured once the visions begin, limiting late-scene tension.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the intentions behind the echoes—is clear, and there is a mild tightening as he decodes deeper knots and the voices sharpen. However, Elias encounters no resistance beyond the puzzle itself, and he never has to choose between competing goods or accept a visible loss. The conflict remains largely intellectual and atmospheric rather than pressured. As a result, the resolution feels inevitable rather than hard-earned.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether innovation can emerge under the Edict before collapse—is clear, and enforcer approach plus cracking ice provide an external clock. Conflict escalation, however, is largely intellectual: recalibrating models, imagining cascades, rather than dramatized tests or trade-offs. Elias’s key “choice” is essentially to continue his work and write despite danger, but there’s no sharp on-page moment where an alternative path is truly foreclosed with visible cost. As a result, pressure tightens conceptually, not viscerally, keeping stakes somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—reviving stories in a repressive, post-famine world—is strong and thematically clear, and the broadcast’s effects escalate from local dust to global reports. Yet antagonistic pressure (patrol drones, algorithms) stays abstract; there’s no concrete beat where Elara must adapt tactics or risk immediate capture. Her agency is steady rather than tested by a hard trade-off, so tension rises more by accumulation of marvel than by narrowing options. The conflict is coherent but not fully exploited.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central conflict is largely internal—between honest memory and curated solace—with the chair’s mechanical failing providing a subtle external pressure and temporal trigger. Stakes are emotionally clear (how he will live with his mother’s memory) and escalate as the chair falters, pushing him into performing the rite now. However, the sense of risk around whether to perform or resist the ritual could be sharpened; his path feels somewhat foregone. The cost is nevertheless legible in the coldness that settles in his chest and the heavier mask at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central conflict—rational preservation vs. mythic erasure—tightens meaningfully once Elias’s doubt surfaces and he chooses to test narratives via excavation. The three-layer dig is an effective escalation structure, each stratum raising the question of what the evidence “proves,” and the final act of reconstruction is a clear commitment. However, the stakes remain mostly conceptual; the social and personal price of confronting the surface cult is gestured to but not concretely felt. Tension operates more in the realm of ideas than in palpable danger or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.4)
    The central stake—whether damaged individuals can unlearn hatred enough to sing in true harmony—is clear, and the early clash between Joren’s dirge and Lira’s canticle provides a promising flashpoint. Yet after that moment, conflict and resistance are largely summarized, with little on-page testing or reversal of their commitment. The final choir success arrives without a visible trade-off or sharpened dilemma; nothing critical seems at risk in the closing beat. Tension exists conceptually but doesn’t meaningfully tighten in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will successfully seed a quiet, mind-altering rebellion—is clear and his actions steadily move toward that. The main tightening is the need to prune before planting as the alignment peaks, which interweaves external and internal stakes decently. However, there is minimal resistance: no concrete threat of discovery or failure, and no visible sacrifice beyond labor and risk implied in exposition. Because nothing on the page seriously threatens his plan or forces a trade-off, tension feels muted.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stakes—city power and the preservation of wonder in a deadened, routine-bound populace—are legible and intertwined. Pressure escalates once when Mira demands “No games” and the curse forces a choice between raw truth and the riddle-box workaround. However, external resistance is minimal; the path from riddle to insight to plan is relatively smooth, so the felt cost and narrowing of options are modest. The conflict remains engaging but never quite bites as hard as the premise allows.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether the bay’s homes can retain or regain their “aliveness”—is clear, and there is a meaningful deepening when the big shard of hush reveals the true nature of that aliveness. However, conflict is largely internal and conceptual, and Elias never seems in danger of failing or paying a price for his pursuit. The escalation from private noticing to community ritual is graceful but low-tension. Without a concrete trade-off or threatened loss on the page, stakes feel more contemplative than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—how Elara will interpret and carry her ancestor’s legacy—is legible early and escalates through each telepathic revelation and the ampoule-opening. Pressure deepens rather than broadens, culminating in a meaningful internal turn from vengeance toward complicated stewardship. However, the struggle sometimes feels smoothed; her resistance is stated (“she clung to outrage”) more than dramatized in concrete refusals or missteps, so cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt. Thalor bears most of the tactical agency, with Elara’s primary decisive act being assent to see and to accept, which works but keeps the conflict slightly soft.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can conceptually rupture his confinement through proof—is clear, and pressure escalates as equations accumulate toward the die-throw and cosmic backlash. The rupture is an effective tightening beat that shows real cost: the universe recoils, reforms stronger, and his hope of escape narrows. Internal and external conflicts braid well, but the pressure remains largely intellectual; there’s little sense of what he tangibly risks in failure beyond continued abstraction. That keeps the tension strong but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—can fleeting kindness endure in others’ memory?—is clearly signaled and does deepen as visions connect past acts to present echoes. Pressure escalates moderately as the visions move from distant history to live reactions in the city, culminating in proof that reconfigures his belief and relieves his insomnia. However, opposition is mostly internal and relatively smooth; his doubt never truly endangers his project nor forces a painful trade-off. The result is affecting but feels like a steady revelation more than a hard-fought crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stakes—survival vs erasure of their arts—are signaled early and tighten effectively as thaw becomes flood and outer-world scouts appear. Elara exercises agency at key turns (shifting to the bread ritual, then ordering evacuation and distribution of lens shards), and these decisions alter tactics. However, the conflict mostly moves in one direction, with few hard trade-offs or real temptation to stay, so the climactic choice feels necessary rather than agonizing. The price of abandoning their established refuge is present but could be rendered more sharply on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—defying a hereditary curse to rewrite the island’s fate at personal cost—is signaled early and tightened as Elias commits to the stone and yoyo. Escalation is clear: discovery → experimentation → activation → bodily sacrifice and world-scale reversal, with his life force as the narrowing resource. The price is unmistakable on the page (his body wasting, collapse amid gears), and his agency drives each turn. The main limitation is that opposition is largely systemic and internal; there’s little adaptive resistance beyond “the stone hungers,” so tension could be even sharper with more concrete on-page tests or micro-reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—defeating Fear/escaping limbo—is clear early, and pressure coherently tightens as Fear moves from abstract silhouette to physically lunging presence. Elara’s agency in choosing to unbosom and then weaponize the clasp drives the decisive turn rather than coincidence. The price she pays is more existential than immediate (continued cursed allure and psychic scarring), which suits the piece but keeps the climax from feeling brutally costly. Nonetheless, the antagonistic pressure escalates in step with her confessions in a satisfying causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether the orchard survives the oncoming tempest—is clear and is tested progressively by rogue waves, shipwreck debris, and finally the massive beam. Escalation is well paced, culminating in the dome of sound repelling the last, largest obstacle. Agency is strong: Elowen adapts tactics (sketching resonance, then building instruments, then a culminating crescendo) rather than passively enduring. The main limitation is that internal stakes (what failure would mean to him beyond generic loss) remain somewhat underdeveloped, which mutes the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—piercing the watchers’ silence versus the safety of the city—is announced early and escalates cleanly through Elara’s decision to perform the sonic ritual to the literal cracking of the shell and revelation of punishment. Her agency is undeniable in initiating the crisis, and the resulting cost (accelerated drift, likely doom) is clearly linked to that action. However, once she commits to the whistle sequence, she has no further meaningful choices under pressure; the crack and visions happen to her rather than requiring a new stance or trade-off. The conflict feels more like a single decisive reach followed by consequences than a live, evolving dilemma at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will exhume a painful, destabilizing truth—is signaled early and followed through. There is a meaningful deepening when the microscript reveals gas canisters, raising both personal and ethical stakes. Still, pressure rarely bites: vandals remain hypothetical, no one contests his actions, and his decision to expose the truth never feels at risk. The result is a thoughtful arc with limited on-page struggle or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stakes—Elias’s need to transform from mere surveyor to archeologist of lost dreams, under the physical threat of the tide and collapsing structure—are clear and do escalate. Beats such as the water rising to his chest, the buckling pillar, and the lintel pinning his leg provide tangible external pressure that tests his resolve to continue writing and sealing notes. However, his success is never seriously in doubt, and the internal conflict (self-preservation vs. devotion to this ritual) is asserted more than dramatized through hard trade-offs. The ending reads as an earned completion of a difficult task rather than a true narrowing of options with a sharp, felt loss.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.8)
    The primary stake—uncovering the honest origins of Elyria’s fall—is clearly signaled, and pressure does tighten as she tests the stamp and advances toward the vault. However, external opposition is almost nonexistent, and there’s little sense of danger, competing priorities, or what she might lose beyond an abstracted career-foundation shift. Her “alternative hypothesis” works on the first try, and the vault opens without meaningful resistance, which flattens escalation and price. The conflict functions but never quite feels like a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—can Elar transform unbearable grief into something bearable without erasing Lira—is clear from early on. Pressure tightens as he moves from contemplation to forbidden dream recording to an all-consuming ritual that risks his essence and identity. The emotional cost of the transformation is legible (tears, exhaustion, loss of shadow impression), though external or social consequences of breaking a “forbidden art” are only lightly implied rather than stressed. Overall escalation works, but an added concrete risk or sacrifice could heighten tension further.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—tapping unused cosmic potential in a ruined world—is clear and scaled appropriately to the scene length. There is one meaningful external spike (the overload and blackout) and an internal deepening when she recognizes the blackout as an opportunity rather than a disaster. But once she commits to the hunt, opposition is minimal; she locates and captures the pool without real resistance, sacrifice, or trade-off. As a result, escalation feels more like a discovery sequence than a pressured test of resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—will they decode the frequency of belonging—is clear and present early, but the path to success is fairly smooth. Once the chip is remembered, there’s no serious resistance, failure, or moral trade-off; each step works on the first try. Internal hesitation is brief, and no option is truly foreclosed beyond remaining lonely. As a result, pressure accumulates more as a mood than as tightening conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will continue to comfort people with lies or face and share painful truths—is clear from early on. Escalation comes through deeper revelations (grandfather’s drowning, mother’s watch, carvings confirming the crime) that increase the moral weight of his earlier deception. However, the conflict remains almost entirely internal and contemplative, with little external resistance or genuine risk to following through on his final vow. The cost is more implied (loss of livelihood, self-image) than palpably felt in a specific pressured choice.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.5)
    The stakes—lives of prisoners, possibility of peace, Elara’s moral reckoning—are clearly articulated and thematically rich. Yet the on-page conflict is relatively static: once both parties arrive and show their counterpart captives, there are no genuine reversals, last-second doubts, or tests that might derail the exchange. Elara’s confession about the counterfeit pull carries potential for rupture, but Kael accepts it with minimal resistance, so pressure doesn’t meaningfully tighten. The result is a thoughtful but low-suspense negotiation where the outcome feels safe early on.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can find an internally honest way to navigate his life instead of repeating past evasions—is clear. Pressure escalates via physical risk (night paddle, rogue swell) braided with intensifying self-recrimination, culminating in the question of whether this trip is transformation or another dodge. His decision to continue paddling after the broadsiding and then to accept the star/pole sign and beach at the old inlet reads as an earned commitment to a new stance. Still, many regret beats reiterate stakes without adding new costs, so escalation feels more like steady pressure than a sharply narrowing vise.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Jax can spark empathy in Elara and reconfigure their ruined relationship—is clear and present throughout. Pressure escalates from solitary deciphering of newspapers to a hazardous underground journey to an emotionally pivotal encounter at the lake. However, once they arrive, the conflict resolves quickly: Elara is initially flat but cracks almost immediately upon touching the baseball, with minimal resistance or trade-off. The story gestures at great moral and emotional stakes but dramatizes only a modest on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—reunite with a dead beloved at the price of one’s humanity—is inherently strong, and there is a clear escalation from discovery of the fortune to the painful metamorphosis. However, resistance is mostly verbalized (“Reluctance gripped her”) and never seriously threatens to alter her course; failure or refusal never feel like live options. Once the ritual begins, events unspool without further complication, and the “sacrifice” is quickly reframed as an uncomplicated blessing, muting cost. Pressure is present but not sharpened into truly risky trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Lirien can atone for devoured hours and change how time will flow for her child—is signaled early and carries through to the end. Pressure deepens via her physical fragility after birth, the intensifying vapors, and the ritual’s revelations (cards, glowing crack, clockwork), culminating in the choice to bind the mechanism to the baby. Escalation is more accumulative and interior than conflict-driven; there’s little active resistance beyond her own guilt and the oppressive environment. That’s effective for this lyric mode, but a stronger sense of risk or competing options at the peak would heighten tension.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.2)
    The core conflict—Elara must integrate her own dark impulses without violating her pacifist creed to free the souls—is clear and internally coherent, and the stakes are existential for her purpose. Pressure escalates via successive shadows (rage, guilt, envy, humanity’s violent end), with the final tapestry-stitching and portal breach functioning as a meaningful tightening. However, resistance feels relatively smooth; there’s little visceral sense she might fail or be damaged by the process, so the conflict never quite bites as hard as its cosmic frame suggests. The resolution is earned but could use a sharper sense of risk or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stakes—Elias’s desire to grasp transformation and the implicit threat of the active volcano—are clear, and pressure does tighten as he reaches the beach under the alignment and Ebon begins to tremble. However, external conflict is largely resolved by an accidental act plus prophecy and cosmic alignment, not by a hard choice that costs him something beyond losing his collection. Internal stakes (understanding transformation) are fulfilled with minimal friction or sacrifice, so escalation feels more like a lyrical crescendo than a true test of limits.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can use the blackout to seed a silent revolution against the Overwardens—is signaled early and followed through. Yet the conflict is curiously frictionless: no antagonistic presence appears on the page, guards are merely puzzled, and no action comes close to failing. The main “tightening” is the move from decoding the sundial to activating the vault conduits, but this doesn’t foreclose options or force a trade-off. As a result, tension is more implied than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael can turn his curse into understanding and fulfill his wife’s charge—is established and escalates as each placement of a rock increases pressure and risk of failure. The visions that “assail” him mid-ritual add internal conflict, and the tightening cadence of mathematical sequences gives a sense of mounting tension. However, the threat of failure remains abstract; there’s no concrete on-page loss or irreversible consequence tied to misplacing a stone beyond generalized “chaos.” The resolution, once he completes the pattern, feels more like an automatic success than a tested, costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias remains a silenced, isolated navigator or risks reconnecting and sharing truth—is clear but mostly internal and conceptual. The envelope’s arrival and the ticking timer provide a skeleton of temporal and psychological pressure, yet there’s little direct antagonistic force in the present to escalate risk; the regime stays abstract and offstage. His choice to reply and descend is meaningful but not portrayed as immediately perilous or heavily costly in-scene. As a result, tension is more meditative than gripping, strong for lyric work but shy of elite narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.0)
    The conflict between duel and potential alliance, as well as between two philosophical stances, is clearly established and escalates through an actual fencing bout. The crucial turn—the revelation of the overture mid-duel—reconfigures the stakes and resolves the immediate physical conflict into partnership. However, the price of this choice is light: Lang’s yielding and change of stance come quickly, and the risk Elias takes in revealing the message under live steel is more implied than dramatized. Tension is present and coherent, but the felt danger and tradeoffs could land harder.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—transforming a prison library into a subversive garden of words and flowers—is clear and appealing, but the pressure against it is relatively soft. Guards “pass indifferently” and the warden’s anger appears only in retrospect, so escalation reads more as industrious montage than tested resistance. The main tightening is the discovery and planting of the seeds, which deepens meaning but doesn’t really foreclose options or exact a visible price in-scene. As a result, tension is more conceptual than felt, limiting the sense of risk at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—reaching the refuge to defy fate and reconnect with Lira—is signaled early and followed through. Escalation exists (from passive pianist to active climber braving surges and heights) and culminates in the grove’s transformation. However, external resistance is light and brief, with few real dilemmas or foreclosed options; the environment threatens but rarely forces a hard tradeoff or sacrifice. The internal conflict (grief vs. resolve) is steady rather than sharply tightened by new, complicating pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the island can retain its cultural memory—is well signaled and emotionally legible. Pressure does accumulate via imagery (shadow-creatures devouring books, the dormant Guardian, monsoon as temporal pressure), and Elara’s choice to invoke the awakening rite is the key turn. Yet opposition is soft: the shadows never directly contest her, the Guardian offers no serious resistance, and there’s no moment where a plausible path is foreclosed with concrete loss. The ending frames ongoing vigilance as a cost, but the on-page escalation never quite forces a wrenching trade-off or visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can transform regret and find the “color of unspoken apologies”—is signaled early and resolved. There’s a discernible tightening when she must physically prune the bonsai-symbol of her silence and face the compass’s visions, which serves as the main pressure point. Yet conflict remains gentle and largely unopposed; Hiroshi never challenges her values, and she never seriously balks, so the emotional cost and tension of letting go feel somewhat under-tested. The result is a coherent but low-intensity escalation.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=4.0)
    Escalation is absent; the protagonist faces no resistance, as the dust works perfectly on leaves, mirrors, and data on the first try. The lack of failure or cost makes the resolution feel inevitable and unearned. The stakes are declared but never threatened by a genuine possibility of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.1)
    Conflict lacks genuine tension; the protagonist is overly competent, and the "shadows" offer no adaptive resistance, resulting in a one-sided climax. The resolution comes too easily via a prepared item, missing the escalation of cost required for higher stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the cracked pane offers a moment of physical escalation, the conflict is resolved immediately by Elara's unopposed skill. The antagonist (Kai's rage) presents a threat that evaporates upon contact with the solution, lacking the back-and-forth struggle required for higher tension.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central conflict is stable, with distress signals providing constant pressure that escalates logically. The final trade-off—sacrificing self for the silence of others—is a clear, earned cost paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=4.0)
    Stakes are high in concept (starvation) but low in execution because obstacles are resolved through summary ("Resistance flickered... but Mira persisted"). The antagonist force (sanctions/enforcers) appears only in brief, generalized anecdotes or successfully evaded moments, lacking the immediate pressure required to force a hard trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is virtually no resistance or escalation; the protagonist identifies the problem and fixes it immediately with a magical breathing technique. The healing process meets no obstacles, and the "unused love" flows freely without demanding a sacrifice or trade-off from Elias.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.5)
    Pressure escalates clearly to a decision point, and the cost of the resolution (loss of the photographs) is visible on the page. The stakes are high and personal, though the antagonist is an abstract mental state.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=4.0)
    While external pressure exists (Wardens arriving), the lack of felt cost or genuine struggle deflates the tension; Elara moves with "grace" and easily overcomes obstacles. The resolution involves discarding chains "like old skin," rendering the physical and emotional price of the ordeal negligible.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.0)
    Pressure is coherent and escalates through the ticking clock of the regenerating flesh/mitosis window. The conflict deepens meaningfully when Elias realizes the scavenged sounds are insufficient, forcing the personal cost of reliving his own betrayal. The stakes shift from a technical challenge to an emotional sacrifice, earning the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.0)
    Stakes remain abstract; the guards are distant sound effects rather than a pressing threat. The central conflict dissolves immediately upon the accidental toppling of the jar, which provides the solution without forcing a difficult choice or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is minimal; the environment yields immediately to Elias's will, and the "ice-melting" presents opportunity without immediate threat. There is no antagonist, internal doubt, or scarcity that forces a difficult trade-off; the decision to stay feels inevitable and cost-free rather than a hard-won resolution to a dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=1.5)
    Conflict is resolved by authorial fiat and magical convenience (the shell decoding the cast) rather than character agency. The climax is undermined by the text rewriting itself on the page, negating any accumulation of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.2)
    The stakes of "endless night" are declared but not felt, as the conflict is resolved instantly upon Elara's request with no visible cost or struggle. The narrative lacks a meaningful tightening of pressure, resulting in a low-tension exchange rather than a dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=3.9)
    Stakes remain purely abstract with no visible external opposition or cost; the "overload warnings" are a token inconvenience that requires no tactical change. The resolution is achieved through a magic object that functions perfectly on the first try, bypassing genuine struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is introduced ("mistrust," "betrayal") but deflates immediately upon the inciting action; Mira offers no resistance to the "truth" shown by the lens. There is no escalation or back-and-forth pressure; the stakes are resolved by a single external intervention with no visible cost paid by either character.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.5)
    The stakes are clear (demolition) and pressure escalates effectively through the auditors' arrival and the negative scans. The climax is a direct confrontation of values resolved through a decisive, cost-laden act that proves the protagonist's truth.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.5)
    The central conflict—Elara’s theory versus established science—is resolved too easily; Dr. Lirren’s skepticism vanishes instantly upon the device's activation, offering no genuine resistance. The "duress" of the drone malfunction is summarized rather than dramatized, lowering the immediate stakes. The tension is theoretical rather than visceral, and the meta-interruptions deflate any accumulated pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes are legible (decipher the code or fail), and the protagonist takes active measures to escalate the situation. However, the cost of the climax is externalized (the building breaks) rather than personal, and the "disruption" feels more like a mechanical puzzle solution than a high-stakes risk with unavoidable consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes are high (life and death), but they function retrospectively; the on-page tension is atmospheric rather than urgent until the specific memory of the cartographer surfaces. The conflict remains largely internal, centered on the protagonist's method, which lowers immediate narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.0)
    Internal pressure builds well through the mounting panic of the radio calls. The stakes are clear, but the resolution feels rushed; the "struggle" with the valve resolves the decades-old guilt too easily, lacking a commensurate on-page cost for such a deep trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the environment submits "deferentially" to the protagonist, removing potential obstacles before they manifest. There are no opposing forces or hard trade-offs; the "soul's fractures" are mentioned only when cured, lacking prior dramatization to establish stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=3.9)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no significant obstacle or risk of failure. The "tightening" is merely atmospheric (the eclipse) rather than a causal escalation of stakes or interpersonal tension.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative lacks active resistance; the protagonist moves from discovery to resolution without facing a dilemma or obstacle that forces a hard choice. The stakes are purely existential ("dreamless void"), and the resolution arrives without a visible or felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.1)
    The narrative lacks genuine resistance or felt cost; Elias executes his plan flawlessly and receives immediate social reward ("cheers"). The spies function as props rather than active threats, and the lack of a "pinch" or moment of potential failure flattens the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=3.8)
    Escalation is rhetorical rather than dramatic; the antagonist is a passive target that absorbs the priest's attacks without effectively countering or endangering him. The conflict lacks genuine tension because the protagonist's victory feels inevitable and cost-free from the start.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=3.2)
    Opposition is abstract; the threat of "exhaustion" is stated but never forces a hard trade-off or jeopardizes success on the page. The protagonist succeeds through simple persistence, lacking a moment where the stakes feel genuine or failure is a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are high in concept ("labyrinth of self") but low in execution because the threat is abstract and the protagonist is effectively invincible ("phasing through assaults"). The climax resolves the central tension through a rapid "integration" that feels like a magical toggle switch, lacking visible cost or sacrifice. The escalation is descriptive rather than dramatic, with no sense of genuine peril.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=3.5)
    Escalation is negligible; the protagonist faces no resistance, failure, or trade-offs while using the phonograph, leading to a tensionless mass healing. The stakes are declared but never threatened, as the solution works perfectly on the first attempt.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are established (evac vs. record), but the pressure remains abstract; the "follower" is a shadow that never engages, and Elara dismisses the threat with cool rationalization. The lack of an immediate, pressing antagonist lowers the felt tension.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=4.7)
    Stakes are purely internal and resolved by a convenient info-dump regarding terpenes and neurotransmitters. There is no external pressure or genuine obstacle; the protagonist simply enacts a ritual that works perfectly, removing tension from the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.8)
    The central conflict creates a binary choice (sever or retreat) that is meant to be impossible, but the protagonist's ability to seamlessly integrate both options undermines the tension. The resolution lacks a tangible sacrifice; he gains wisdom without visibly paying the price of the "impossible choice," deflating the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.6)
    The conflict is largely abstract (Sound vs. Silence), and the escalation lacks visceral friction; the survivors surrender their fragments willingly, and the hush "cracks" without forcing Lir into a hard trade-off beyond the initial decision to play.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.5)
    The conflict is primarily internal and procedural, focused on the successful execution of the "half-truth" infusion. Stakes are legible—the client's peace versus the loss of authentic feeling—and the climax requires a specific, active intervention from Elias. The cost is thematic and felt ("absorbing the truth's sharper half"), satisfying the situational drive.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=3.0)
    Conflict is virtually absent; Mira is described as "reclusive" yet opens her door and reveals her deepest secrets immediately upon being asked. There is no friction, no refusal, and no cost to the characters' goals; they simply agree to be friends and collaborators.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is a near-total absence of conflict; the search for the tag and the integration into the group occur without resistance or setback. Characters agree instantly ("It haunts me too"), relationships lack friction, and the "ache" is resolved without any trade-off or renunciation. The stakes of belonging are stated but never threatened, resulting in a narrative with no escalating pressure or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the ticking clock of the giant’s nap creates structural tension, the protagonist’s ability to manipulate the constraint reduces the sense of risk. The trade-off—shortening the safety window to bypass barriers—is calculated perfectly, resulting in a victory without the sting of sacrifice or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.5)
    Escalation is linear and lacks significant resistance; Thorne performs the ritual with a "conjurer's touch" and it simply works. There is no moment where failure seems possible or where he must pay a visible cost (stamina, sanity, material sacrifice) to proceed. The stake (connection to Elowyn) is clear, but the lack of on-page obstacles results in a process narrative rather than a dramatic conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.2)
    The stakes are legible, pitting the woman's despair against Elias's protective isolation. Yet the escalation is short-circuited by the "magic feather" prop (the tape); the conflict is resolved by a convenient object rather than a costly, earned confrontation or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is largely internal but lacks on-page pressure; the protagonist overcomes his "reluctance" too easily to generate genuine tension. The storm provides atmospheric texture but does not force a difficult choice or alter tactics meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake (finding meaning) is abstract and resolved with minimal opposition. The encounter with Mira, which should be the peak pressure point, resolves instantly into a cooperative exchange without testing Elias's resolve or forcing a difficult trade-off. The "tightening" is theoretical rather than felt; the cost of the exchange is stated ("mock the lesson") rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict is present, but the antagonist (the forces) explains itself too conveniently, reducing tension. The protagonist (Thorne) lacks agency in the central struggle, as the climax revolves entirely around Elara's sudden decision while he watches.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=3.8)
    Tension is deflated by the omnipotent efficacy of the trumpet valve; the protagonist faces no opposition from the crowd, the environment, or the object itself. The escalation is purely additive—each blast works better than the last—resulting in "symmetric satisfaction" where the solution perfectly matches the problem without requiring sacrifice or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=3.9)
    There is virtually no genuine opposition; the protagonist encounters barriers (grate, bricks, gate) and immediately overcomes them with the ticket punch. The lack of failure, adaptation, or cost makes the stakes feel theoretical rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are emotional but low-tension, as the protagonist faces no significant obstacles; her transcription succeeds on the first attempt without error or external pressure. The fisherman's return provides a resolution, but because the solution was magical and immediate, there is no felt cost or sacrifice. The conflict is resolved too neatly, lacking the friction required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=3.5)
    Tension is flat; Elowen dominates the conflict with the storm and "sentient voids" effortlessly. The dominant stake is abstract (boredom), and the protagonist achieves his goal without facing a moment of genuine jeopardy or a forced trade-off that narrows his options.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.2)
    The stakes are declared (asylum vs. capture), but the on-page tension dissipates the moment the ink pot is opened, as the artifact provides a flawless instruction manual for escape. The lack of a complicating factor or a moment where the "math" fails forces the protagonist into a passive role during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.1)
    The central conflict between the safety of "invented histories" and the trauma of reality is well-staged. The escalation is distinct—the lamp forcing the town’s tragedy into the light—but the resolution (the town immediately waking) feels slightly too neat/symmetric, reducing the lingering weight of the tragedy.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=4.0)
    While the stakes (identity recovery) are clear, the escalation lacks agency and cost. The protagonist faces environmental pressure but no antagonistic force or internal trade-off; the ending offers a pure gain (identity restored) without a visible price paid on the page, leaving the closure feeling unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are primarily philosophical, lacking visceral or immediate pressure; Elias faces no antagonist or time limit, only the abstract desire to solve a riddle. The escalation is rhythmic—playing the cello faster—rather than a deepening of consequence or danger. The cost (flaking paint on the shell) is symbolic and minimal, resulting in low narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.4)
    Conflict is introduced but resolved with low resistance; the protagonist's intuition conveniently bypasses the antagonist's enforcers ("blind spots"). The stakes are high (eviction), but the victory feels unearned because the opposition never forces a painful trade-off or failure.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake (survival vs. photo) is present, but the protagonist never faces a forcing move where he must sacrifice one for the other. The resolution arrives via the rover without a final, costly trade-off, deflating the accumulated pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=4.0)
    While the departing ship provides an external clock, the protagonist faces no significant opposition or possibility of failure, as his skills are described as "unerring." The conflict is purely procedural; there is no moment where the outcome is in doubt, and the resolution requires no trade-off or painful choice.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=4.0)
    Stakes are declared but not tested; there is no antagonist or significant obstacle preventing Harlan's departure. The narrative lacks a tightening of options—clues simply accumulate until he leaves—and the protagonist pays no price for his discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=1.5)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; the ghost town, the stones, and the magic system cooperate fully with the protagonist's intentions from the start. There is no antagonist, no scarcity of time or resources, and no escalating pressure to force a meaningful trade-off or risk. The "collapse" is a passive backstory element that exerts no active pressure on the present scene.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=4.7)
    Stakes are declared via the oxygen gauge but not tested by a difficult choice; the protagonist succeeds at every goal without sacrifice. The tension dissolves when the perfume vial acts as a magical sedative, removing the visceral panic essential to the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=4.8)
    The narrative lacks active resistance; the shades are compliant ("grateful," "nodded") and the guards are "oblivious," removing urgency from the scene. Without an antagonist or a complication that forces a difficult choice, the protagonist simply executes a plan without pressure or escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.2)
    There is virtually no conflict; the protagonist desires the outcome (reunion/death) and the antagonist (ghost) provides it willingly. The lack of resistance, hesitation, or unexpected complication means the stakes—though nominally life and death—generate zero narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=2.8)
    Conflict is negligible; the "broken precedents" serve as a conceptual straw man rather than an active antagonistic force. Elara enters the maze and succeeds without facing a concrete test, setback, or trade-off; the tension is purely atmospheric and dissolves instantly upon the act of sewing.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=3.1)
    There is no genuine conflict; Elara faces no antagonist, internal doubt, or physical obstacle that genuinely threatens her goal. The "relentless toil" is stated in summary but not felt in scene, and the resolution arrives via persistence without any escalation of stakes or tactical pivots.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=4.9)
    Stakes are declared ("dooming the message to irrelevance") rather than tested by significant opposition; the vendor bot is a trivial interruption that adds no real cost. The protagonist's "sweat" attempts to signal stress, but the scene lacks a mechanism that forces a difficult trade-off or genuine risk beyond standard genre anxiety.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story lacks immediate on-page conflict; the antagonist (the Duke) is distant, and the "spies" are mentioned but never manifest as a concrete threat. The scene with the courier is low-tension, as he is a friendly unsuspecting vessel rather than an obstacle, leaving the protagonist's goals largely unopposed in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=3.9)
    Stakes are declared as high (lost love) but feel low because the obstacles are overcome effortlessly through magic. There is no genuine opposition or moment where failure seems possible; the "gash" heals immediately, and Thorne appears simply because he is summoned. The lack of a true dilemma or sacrifice flattens the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is no meaningful escalation or resistance; the protagonist interprets signs and performs an action on a sleeping subject without facing obstacles. The stakes remain abstract and internal, resolved by a convenient discovery rather than a difficult decision or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=3.2)
    Escalation is virtually nonexistent; the protagonist encounters no opposition, risk of failure, or difficult choices. Every action—finding the artifact, activating the tool, consulting the network—succeeds immediately, stripping the story of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is introduced but not escalated; the skeptic offers no effective counter-move once the "bewitchment" begins. The stakes (hoax vs. magic) are resolved by the magic working perfectly on the first try, lacking the "meaningful tightening" or "visible prices paid" required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=3.8)
    The antagonist (Thought Revenue Bureau) poses no active threat until the finale, where they are immediately defeated by the "warp" with no agency required from Elias beyond planting the seed. There is no moment of "meaningful tightening" where the protagonist must choose between competing values; success is linear and unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes are low because the outcome is never in doubt; the environment and the "off-key wind" aid the protagonist immediately. The conflict is resolved via a magical object found by chance, and the "warfare" of pain surrenders without a genuine struggle or tactical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation is the story's strongest suit, following a clear accumulative path where the damage to the tube intensifies with each wing visited. The cost is distinct and paid on the page—the destruction of the catalyst object to achieve the preservation of the names. The pressure holds coherently through the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=4.0)
    Tension is flatlined by the immediate and total success of the magic; Elara writes three promises, and the ink obliges three times without extracting a price. The "risk" is purely hypothetical, and Thorne's skepticism evaporates instantly upon hearing the magic, leaving the dominant stake untested by genuine opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=3.0)
    The central conflict between progress and tradition evaporates rather than escalates; the rival clans abandon generations of animosity immediately upon hearing a single letter. The resolution is unearned, as the "harmonized system" offers a perfect solution with no visible cost or sacrifice from any party.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=4.2)
    The central conflict (fraud vs. connection) is resolved too easily through off-page actions (sending a note) and summarized reconciliation ("Trust bloomed anew"). There is no visible struggle or cost on the page; the stakes evaporate the moment they are tested, lacking the requisite tightening or deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.5)
    The stakes are articulated conceptually ("sacred thresholds") but lack on-page pressure; the antagonist is the abstract "distance," which offers little active resistance. The resolution comes too easily—Elowen simply walks through the maze after a moment of intuition—rendering the conflict static.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is virtually no conflict or escalation; the protagonist faces no obstacles, and the antagonist (isolation/Theo) capitulates instantly. The climax is an aesthetic observation rather than a resolution of accumulated pressure or a choice with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is no meaningful escalation or antagonist; the conflict is a philosophical question answered immediately by an external event (the bird). The stakes ("before memory fades") are stated but not felt through pressure, resulting in a flat narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=3.7)
    The protagonist faces no resistance; his plan succeeds instantly and perfectly on the first attempt without cost, adjustment, or risk of failure. The stakes remain abstract ("monotony"), and the conflict is resolved by serendipity rather than struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.1)
    Stakes dissolve immediately upon the protagonist's realization, lacking a sense of genuine peril or cost. The obstacle (the anchor) is removed by looking at the sky, stripping the climax of tension and rendering the "panic" unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are abstract ("fragile peace," "rumored tempest") and told rather than felt through immediate pressure. There is no significant escalation; the protagonist performs a ritual and receives the necessary answers without trade-offs or complications. The "cost" of the revelation is negligible.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=3.9)
    There is almost no resistance or escalation; Lena moves from sobbing to enlightened compliance without struggle. The stakes are theoretical ("universal language") rather than immediate and felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=2.5)
    Conflict is devoid of genuine opposition; the "rigid" and "despair" timelines are passive variables that yield to simple adjustments. There is no escalation of risk, only a linear progression to total success.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes are clear and escalate appropriately from a personal quest to a revelation of historical atrocity. The conflict shifts from a physical search to a moral burden, culminating in a choice that recontextualizes the protagonist's entire craft. The cost is felt in the weight of the "legacy" and the destruction of his family's mythos.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=2.9)
    There is virtually no conflict; the protagonist faces no antagonist, internal barrier, or scarcity. The stakes (dissolving like mist) are stated but never felt because success is effortless. The "resistance" of the mirrors is trivial, resolving without forcing the protagonist to adapt or pay a price.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=4.7)
    Conflict is low-voltage; the opposing warlords, described as unyielding, capitulate immediately without genuine struggle or counter-moves. The stakes of a "Forever War" are undermined by the ease of the resolution, and the cost is not felt until the final, passive vision.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.8)
    The stakes are clear and the pressure of the approaching storm provides a functional ticking clock. However, the conflict remains largely internal and symbolic; the cost is purely sentimental, and the billionaire's ability to simply "fund bird sanctuaries anew" lowers the weight of the sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=3.4)
    Stakes are declared but never tested; the "Empire" and the crowd remain passive, offering no active opposition. The protagonist faces no trade-offs, executing her plan perfectly without loss or adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are abstract and the conflict is entirely internal and retrospective, lacking an active antagonist or obstacle on the page. The protagonist's decision comes too easily, with no visible cost or trade-off required to embrace the "ethical" path.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes remain abstract and theoretical; while the structures escalate in size, the protagonist faces no meaningful opposition or trade-off. The climax—the tower's collapse—is framed as a success of the "method," negating any sense of risk, loss, or hard-won victory.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the environment (usually an antagonist in such settings) actively aids Elara via "snowmelt ardor," and the technical task succeeds on the first attempt. There is no tightening of stakes or meaningful obstacle to force a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=4.0)
    Escalation is driven by external timers—the storm and decaying code—rather than protagonist agency; Elara enters the pod because she is guided, not because she forces a trade-off. The resolution lacks a hard choice, allowing her to gain wholeness without paying a meaningful price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.0)
    Stakes remain abstract; the "rebel scouts" and "teetering regimes" are mentioned but exert no immediate pressure on the scene to force a trade-off. The puzzle of the tile is solved instantly with no risk of failure, leaving the scene devoid of meaningful escalation or suspense.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is muted by the omnipotent nature of the healing method; there is no moment where the outcome is in doubt or where Elias must adapt his tactics. The escalation is abstract, moving through layers of memory without forcing the protagonist to make a hard trade-off. The resolution comes from the tool overpowering the resistance, rather than a battle of wills.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake (recovering his wife) is clear, but the conflict is largely external (man vs. fog mechanics) rather than interpersonal or internal. The obstacles are overcome with procedural ease via the sextant and breathing, lacking a moment where failure seems genuine or a sacrifice is demanded. The tension resolves smoothly rather than snapping.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=4.5)
    External pressure is artificially generated by a convenient storm rather than rising stakes between the characters. The conflict dissolves instantly upon Lila's return; she capitulates to the mending process with almost no friction, removing tension.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=3.9)
    Stakes are theoretical; the "peril" is mentioned but never felt on the page. The central conflict (how to use the cameo) is resolved immediately by the tree spirit's instructions, lacking a meaningful tightening of options or a moment where Elara must risk something tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is negligible; obstacles are resolved instantly using convenient items from the diary without cost or failure. The intrusion of meta-commentary in the climax dissolves whatever tension had accumulated.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=4.6)
    Tension is low because the protagonist faces no significant opposition; the magic (narrative threads) functions without failure or on-page cost. The stakes are stated, but the path to victory is a linear accumulation of successful actions without a moment of doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are low and abstract; the "frozen clock" and "missing door" present a puzzle rather than a threat. The protagonist faces no obstacles or costs—she simply remembers a solution and executes it. The ending dissolves all tension by revealing the artificiality of the construct.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is strictly external and static; the protagonist faces no difficult choices or trade-offs. The escalation is nominal—she arrives, performs the ritual, and succeeds immediately—lacking the "tightening" or "deepening" required for higher engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=4.2)
    The stakes are theoretical (proving meaning) rather than immediate or visceral. The conflict is externalized largely through the storm and the technical task, both of which are overcome with relative ease via the "blessed" visions. There is no meaningful tightening of options; the solution presents itself and works perfectly on the first try.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.6)
    Stakes are primarily philosophical ("lest collective memory dissolve"), which limits visceral engagement and perceived risk. The external pressure of the dissolving fog bridge provides a functional clock, but it doesn't force a difficult trade-off or desperate tactic until the very end. The "cost" of the resolution is conceptual—accepting identity as a construct—but lacks a felt on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=4.8)
    The stakes remain purely thematic and abstract; the "gravity of hopelessness" is an atmospheric condition rather than an active antagonist. There is no point where failure feels possible or dangerous, resulting in a low-tension progression where success is inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=3.6)
    Stakes are purely internal and abstract, resolved instantly by the magical foresight without a test of character. The "difficult conversation" is summarized rather than shown, and the tension dissipates immediately upon the vision, lacking a meaningful reversal or deepening. There is no felt cost to the resolution; the insight is given, not won.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are clearly defined and escalate through environmental pressure (gravity) and the antagonist's arrival. The protagonist pays a felt cost—enduring the "cradle of green" that mimics her phobia—to secure her prize, though the physical escape is resolved somewhat quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=3.7)
    Stakes are low and escalation is negligible; the "spike" in noise is immediately neutralized by the operator's routine maintenance. The conflict dissolves without narrowing options or forcing a difficult trade-off, resulting in a flat dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=3.1)
    Escalation is negligible; the primary threat (drones) is bypassed instantly with a magic-key solution, incurring no loss of resources or time. The stakes are declared high (dominion over reality) but feel low because the protagonist never faces a moment of genuine risk or potential failure.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are legible and the conflict is focused, with the doorknocker ring serving as a tangible anchor for the internal struggle between compassion and necessary severance. The escalation works well, moving from the temptation of contact to a painful rejection that forecloses the path of dependency with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain thematic rather than visceral; while the text claims pressure is "crushing," Elias resolves it instantly with a tool, facing no genuine opposition or risk of failure. The cost is described physically ("felt it in his bones") but does not force a difficult trade-off or alteration of tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is virtually no resistance or escalation; Elias wants the truth, the gramophone immediately provides it via a magic leap, and he acts without hesitation. The stakes are declared ("titans of industry") but remain abstract and untested in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=4.0)
    Escalation is negligible; the "shifting reality" provides atmospheric flavor but never actively opposes the protagonist or forces a difficult choice. Elowen faces no antagonist, no time limit with consequences, and no dilemma—he simply takes what is offered. Without an obstacle that threatens failure, the stakes remain abstract and the victory feels hollow.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=5.6)
    The story lacks significant conflict or escalation; the obstacle is a hidden compartment that yields easily to a letter opener, and there is no opposing force or time pressure. Eleanor faces no dilemma where she must sacrifice one value for another; the "cost" of the discovery is negligible, making the emotional payoff feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=3.0)
    There is a distinct lack of active opposition; the "regime's dragnet" and "drones" are evaded easily in summary, removing immediate stakes. The climax involves simply unlocking a door, requiring no sacrifice, difficult trade-off, or visible cost from the protagonist, rendering the "rebellion" abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.0)
    Escalation is linear: Elias plays, the prophecy resists, Elias intensifies his technique. While there is a clear "beam struggle" dynamic, the costs are largely abstract (breath, weight) rather than a tangible sacrifice or irreversible consequence that deepens the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=2.5)
    There is a complete absence of meaningful opposition; the "fading" arbor offers no active resistance, and Lir faces no obstacles in his task. The stakes are stated but not felt, as the solution is applied effortlessly. Without escalation or risk, the narrative lacks tension entirely.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=4.1)
    Stakes remain abstract; there is no meaningful tightening of options or genuine threat of failure. The protagonist faces no active opposition, and the "improvisation" is a low-stress solution to a minor physical barrier. The climax is a confirmational moment rather than a test of agency.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=3.8)
    While the stated stakes are high (saving a brother), the on-page resistance is minimal. The ritual succeeds on the first attempt without backlash, and the declared "risk" of imbalance remains theoretical, lacking a dramatized penalty or difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=4.6)
    The conflict lacks genuine pressure; the antagonist (Harlan's trauma) yields immediately to Elara's first attempt at a solution. The shift from "mournful chorus" to banana-peel slapstick is tonally jarring and de-escalates tension rather than tightening it. The stakes feel low because success appears inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.2)
    Escalation occurs through deepening flashbacks, providing internal momentum. However, the stakes remain abstract and cerebral; the conflict is solved by remembering a math equation, which distances the reader from the visceral reality of the trauma and survival context.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is no meaningful escalation; the protagonist moves from one painting to another with equal ease, treating the climax as a checklist item. The absence of an antagonist or time pressure (explicitly removed by the "eternal instant") leaves the stakes abstract and the outcome inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are low; the protagonist faces no genuine opposition or risk, and the resolution requires no sacrifice or difficult trade-off. The ghost's plea is easily satisfied with a found key, resulting in a linear progression without meaningful tightening or reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is negligible; the protagonist faces no external antagonist or internal doubt, moving from inciting incident to resolution without significant obstacle. The "cost" of the library's destruction is framed as a triumph for Elias, muffling the stakes. The escalation is purely procedural (walking to the bottle) rather than a rising pressure cooker of options and consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.4)
    The internal stakes (myth-making vs. apathy) are high, and the plan to use the storm adds pressure. However, the external antagonists arrive only for a brief, low-stakes confrontation, making the climax feel more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=3.9)
    While the declared stakes are massive (the sun, his daughter's life), the on-page resistance is negligible. The "covenant of rust" and the "wilting flower" act as background texture rather than active obstacles; Elias faces no antagonist or difficult setback, and the rust flakes away effortlessly upon his first attempt.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent; the protagonist faces no active opposition or environmental danger despite the backstory of a doomed expedition. The stakes are historical rather than immediate—Elara is never at risk of failing or dying. The climax resolves without a trade-off or sacrifice, rendering the victory hollow.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=3.0)
    There is little genuine conflict; the storm, initially presented as "wild coastal fury," submits to Elara's carving without extracting a price. The resolution is unearned, as the "timewoven alliances" simply remove the danger, deflating the stakes established by the GPS failure.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=4.1)
    Stakes are purely aesthetic and intellectual; there is no antagonist, deadline, or risk of failure to generate tension. The "gnawing question" is stated but not felt as a crisis, and the resolution comes through time passing rather than a high-stakes decision.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.4)
    While the stakes are high (eternal entrapment), the conflict plays out as a series of instructional tasks (arrange debris, prove lineage) that Elias performs without significant struggle or cost. He complies immediately with the guardians' demands, lacking a moment of hard choice or tactical pivot that would deepen the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes remain theoretical because the protagonist faces no active opposition or risk of failure. The potential antagonist—the temptation of the ghosts—is dismissed in a single sentence, removing the story's primary source of tension. The escalation relies on asserted effort ("working memory strained") rather than dramatized trade-offs or consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes are clear but primarily internal and thematic. The escalation relies on the prophecy text explicitly narrowing the protagonist's options rather than pressure arising from the situation itself. The turning point is functional and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are declared ("erasing her lineage's extended years") but never tested by genuine opposition or failure. The protagonist faces no significant obstacles or escalation; she simply executes a procedure that works immediately, rendering the conflict low-tension.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=3.7)
    Stakes are declared but not felt; the protagonist pays no price for his decision, facing no genuine opposition or loss. The choice between siren and bell lacks a penalty, resulting in an unearned, symmetric victory that fails to test the character's resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are purely internal and abstract ("fragility amid infinity") with no external pressure or time constraint to force a difficult decision. The escalation is linear and gentle, leading to a resolution that feels like a foregone conclusion rather than a hard-won victory.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.3)
    The stakes are clear (restoring the oasis), but the narrative lacks immediate pressure or active opposition. The protagonist resolves the central conflict essentially by looking at it ("channeling will through eyes alone"), which solves the problem without forcing a difficult trade-off or risking failure.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.2)
    The constraint of the "Shift-enforcers" effectively shapes the protagonist's methodology, adding texture to the plot. However, the escalation is relatively mild, transitioning from a received message to a realization without significant new obstacles or reversals in the scene itself.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.0)
    Escalation is negligible because the protagonist welcomes the disruption. When the kite crashes, Elias feels "not in loss, but anticipation," which deflates the narrative tension immediately. Without a moment where the protagonist fears failure or pays a price, the stakes remain purely abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=4.6)
    External conflict is virtually non-existent; nature cooperates immediately with the protagonist's efforts ("birds perched unafraid," "leaves trembling as if sensing"). The stakes of the terminal diagnosis are diluted by the montage-style pacing and the lack of obstacles in the remodeling process.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=4.0)
    Escalation is absent; the arrival of competitors (Kai and Mira) dissolves immediate tension rather than spiking it, as they instantly form a cooperative "unspoken pact." The protagonist faces no active opposition or dilemma, allowing the narrative to glide to resolution without a felt price or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=4.1)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the environment (sun, sea) is passive, and the protagonist faces no active antagonism or risk of failure. The stakes remain abstract and thematic (healing the land) rather than visceral, resulting in a flat narrative arc with no escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.0)
    Escalation is negligible; the protagonist faces no significant opposition or moment of doubt. The transition from the shack to the reunion is smooth and procedural, missing a crisis point where the outcome is genuinely in question.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=3.0)
    The central conflict dissolves immediately upon the discovery of the rift, offering a solution with no meaningful opposition or trade-off. Escaping a dead station for a guaranteed "verdant" paradise lacks felt cost; the "abandonment" of the station is a relief, not a sacrifice. The stakes are declared but never tested by failure or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.2)
    The central conflict is resolved with minimal resistance; the "void-secrets" and mental assault are dismissed with a laugh and a smash. The cost—"secrets spent"—feels abstract and low-impact for a story about restoring cosmic balance.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation is coherent, built through the sequence of spelled words. However, the stakes feel somewhat intellectual; the "penumbra" is a nuisance to be removed, so its loss lacks the visceral "felt cost" required for higher bands, reading more as a procedural success.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict is low; the antagonist is an internal fear that dissolves immediately upon the protagonist's first action. There is no meaningful tightening or complication; the inciting incident leads directly to a successful climax without requiring the character to endure the established "pain."

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.5)
    While the stakes are high (a frozen village), the conflict is entirely internal and resolved without tangible on-page cost. The protagonist "winnows ruthlessly," but the price paid is abstract ("hollow victories") rather than a felt sacrifice required by the rubric.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes are declared regarding the ritual, but the opposition (Elders/spies) remains passive and imposes no pressure. The narrative lacks a meaningful tightening or reversal; the protagonist gathers followers and succeeds without facing a true test or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=3.8)
    While the stakes are technically life-or-death, the protagonist faces no dilemma; the solution (repair the statue) is obvious and works without failure. There is no escalation of complications, only a linear sequence of successful magical actions that dissolves the threat.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=3.5)
    Escalation is negligible; the protagonist encounters no physical or psychological obstacles in the cave, and the climax is a passive viewing experience. The stakes remain abstract, and the "perfect" ending removes any sense of risk or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=3.9)
    Stakes are theoretically high (lost love), but the execution lacks genuine pressure because the protagonist faces no obstacles in the scene; he simply waits for the magic to work. There is no moment where the plan might fail, and the resolution comes without sacrifice or trade-off. The conflict is resolved by a Deus Ex Machina vial rather than human effort.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.2)
    Tension is low as the protagonist faces no active opposition or possibility of failure; the narrative tracks a linear process of instruction and construction. The climax is a foregone conclusion of labor rather than a high-stakes test of the protagonist's commitment or ingenuity.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are clear and high, escalating from social friction to a visceral physical sacrifice. The cost is palpable on the page—pain and the permanent loss of true sight—making the resolution earned and significant.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes are purely internal and thematic; there is no external pressure or time constraint after the stranger's jump. The conflict is resolved through passive observation of magical visions rather than active decision-making under duress. The "investigation" lacks resistance, making the epiphany feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=5.7)
    External pressure is generated effectively by the rising creek, acting as a ticking clock. However, the internal conflict lacks a meaningful tradeoff; Elias does not have to sacrifice anything or make a painful choice to achieve his realization, lowering the felt stakes of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes are declared early ("reclaim her fraying soul") but remain abstract throughout the ascent. The external conflict (the climb) lacks specific, escalated hurdles, and the "final warning" fails to manifest as a concrete pressure point beyond the initial mention. The climax offers a choice, but the opposition is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=3.1)
    Tension is virtually nonexistent; the protagonist faces no external opposition, resource scarcity, or internal doubt that threatens the outcome. The "cost" of the secret is mentioned abstractly ("weight settled in him") but does not alter tactics or force a difficult choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=4.7)
    Stakes remain abstract; the conflict is an internal struggle resolved by a sudden, magical capability ("erupting upward") rather than a hard choice. The "jealousy" method removes the difficulty of the obstacle rather than forcing a trade-off or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=2.8)
    The primary conflict is retrospective, residing entirely in the midwife's flashback, leaving Elara with no active obstacles in the present timeline. The repair process is smooth and intuitive, lacking any risk of failure or cost that would generate narrative tension. The stakes remain low and abstract, with the "crisis" having been resolved decades prior to the story's start.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=5.4)
    While the stakes (exile) are established, the conflict is resolved without a dilemma; the protagonist faces an obstacle (crystals) and applies a solution (quill) that works instantly. There is no moment where she must sacrifice one value for another, resulting in a low-tension victory.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.2)
    The external pressure of the chainsaws provides a tangible clock that heightens the internal stakes of the apology. The cost is felt through the destruction of the unique talisman (the bottle), ensuring the resolution isn't cheap.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes are theoretically infinite but narratively flat, as there is no specific antagonist or obstacle to generate friction. The resolution feels inevitable from the start, with the "hiccup" providing a time window but no palpable urgency or consequence for failure.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.9)
    Escalation occurs via the clock reversal, but the stakes remain abstract ("phantom hands," "mirages") rather than visceral. The resolution—simply removing the key—lacks a sacrificial cost or a difficult trade-off, leaving the protagonist safe and the conflict neatly tidied away.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes remain purely theoretical with no visceral cost; the breakthrough ("revolutionizing... on the spot") arrives instantly upon the conversation, lacking the friction or struggle required for high tension.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=3.6)
    Pressure is low throughout; the protagonist faces no active opposition, time limit, or difficult trade-offs. The narrative is a linear progression of following steps to a guaranteed reward, lacking meaningful escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.8)
    The stakes are legible, but the escalation is summarized ("friendship bloomed") rather than dramatized, and the conflict dissolves instantly upon the thematic announcement, lacking a felt cost or difficulty in the final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=3.6)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; the protagonist faces no external antagonism or internal resistance during the process. The stakes ("oblivion's tide") are declared but never tested, as the ritual succeeds without forcing a trade-off or difficult choice. Escalation is merely chronological, not dramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=3.1)
    The "polite" tone diffuses tension effectively, but this results in a lack of meaningful opposition; the crowd accepts the rock immediately, leaving the protagonist with no dilemma or obstacle to test his commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=3.9)
    Escalation is minimal; the "rival's warning" introduces a stake that never materializes into actual opposition. The climax lacks a hard trade-off; the ring "scorching" is a physical discomfort, not a narrative cost, leading to an unearned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=4.8)
    Escalation collapses once the pen is introduced; the protagonist moves from problem to solution without encountering new complications or heightened stakes. The text claims edits "demanded balance," but this is not dramatized; instead, we see a montage of improvements (colleagues saved, vines fixed). The lack of a "felt cost" or a hard choice at the climax flattens the dramatic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is virtually no conflict; the festival crowd offers no resistance, and the "disruption" succeeds immediately upon execution. Escalation is absent, as the protagonist moves from passivity to total success without facing a meaningful obstacle or paying a price.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=3.3)
    There is a near-total absence of active pressure; with the library hunters absent and no time limit established, the stakes remain abstract and historical. Escalation is spatial (moving deeper) rather than dramatic; Elara faces no risk of failure, rendering the "rescue" low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=4.2)
    Tension is minimal as the antagonist (handlers) appears only in the final moments and is immediately neutralized by the protagonist's splash distortions. The escalation relies on aesthetic intensity rather than causal pressure or narrowing options; the victory feels inevitable rather than fought for.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are clear (coin, maps, pride) but relatively low impact. The conflict escalates linearly through the race, but Harlan's incompetence ("shouts bounced confusingly") reduces the tension; he defeats himself, requiring little agency from Elias beyond staying the course.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are theoretical ("teach darkness the value of stars") rather than visceral; the antagonist, despite a "gnawing hunger," capitulates immediately upon seeing the light patterns. There is no escalation of pressure or moment where Elara's goal is genuinely threatened, resulting in a conflict that feels like a pageant rather than a struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is no effective opposition; the Council is a static concept, and the guards merely "pause," offering no active resistance. The protagonist faces no dilemma, makes no sacrifices, and pays no price for his rebellion, resulting in a flat narrative arc with no escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake (freedom vs. tethering) is clear, but the escalation is dampened because the obstacle—emotional guarding—is removed instantly by the artifact. There is no sustained pressure or oscillation; the characters switch from guarded to confessed to departing without facing a true dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—cultivating lightness against the weight of grief—is clear and tracks through the scene. Escalation occurs via the intensifying narration and the physical slip of the knife (blood), which serves as a decisive intensification. The conflict remains largely internal but is externalized well through the whittling action.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=3.0)
    There is no effective opposition; the pillars "surrender" and the lake "softens" merely because the poet speaks. The stakes are theoretical (crossing a boundary) but never threatened, as success feels inevitable from the first line. The narrative lacks a moment of true risk or a decision that requires a sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are established early (waking Mira), but the tension dissipates at the climax when the antagonist (the Phoenix) capitulates to a thematic argument rather than enforcing a painful choice. The protagonist achieves his goal without a significant loss or concession, softening the narrative impact.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are purely conceptual; there is no external pressure or risk of failure, only a sequence of intellectual queries. The "pain" described is abstract and told ("Pain lanced her") rather than demonstrated through consequence or cost. The resolution is inevitable, not earned.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are high in concept (dying stars) but low in execution, as the protagonist faces no active opposition or possibility of failure. The escalation is a linear ladder of success—she crafts, she places, it works—devoid of the setbacks or difficult choices required to generate tension.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is virtually no resistance or escalation; Theo arrives, presents the problem, and Elara immediately solves it with her tools. The stakes—predicting mania or finding "true north"—remain abstract concepts that never threaten the characters' immediate safety or resources. The protagonist faces no dilemma, makes no difficult choice, and pays no price for the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.7)
    The conflict is legible and stakes are high, with the pagoda providing physical pushback ("shocks of iridescent fire"). The resolution is earned through a decisive action (shattering the veil), though the repetitive nature of the obstacle feels slightly mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are global and abstract ("humanity's dreams") rather than specific and visceral; the antagonist ("shadow unbound") is a vague force without agency or distinct tactics. The conflict is resolved through a magical assertion rather than a tactical struggle, and the cost ("human warmth") is stated in the aftermath rather than felt in the moment of loss.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=4.2)
    Escalation is linear and low-friction; the protagonist resolves deep trauma through a swift mental checklist. The cost of the final decision is stated ("acknowledge her oversight") but not viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=3.8)
    There is no effective opposition; the protagonist follows precise telepathic instructions to a guaranteed reward, removing the possibility of failure. The stakes are purely theoretical, as the supernatural assistance solves the central mystery without requiring a genuine trade-off or risk from Elena.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=5.0)
    Conflict is minimal; obstacles yield immediately to Elara’s abilities ("psychometry tugged," "wood yielding with a sigh"). There is no escalation of pressure or risk; the protagonist faces no dilemma where she must trade one value for another. The resolution arrives via discovery rather than a decisive, costly act of agency.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is low-stakes and internal, with the solution (rest/surrender) provided by external instruction ("unspoken words") rather than discovered through struggle. The antagonist is a vague creative block that vanishes without extracting a visible, irreversible price from the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is virtually no active opposition or risk of failure; the "unlit corners" await saving but do not resist, and the "wind's thieving fingers" are mere decoration. The protagonist achieves his goals instantly upon touching the clock ("he is occasionally everywhere"), removing any tension or stakes. The conflict is purely conceptual and resolved by fiat.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is virtually no opposition or escalating risk; the forest actively aids Elias (unfurling ferncoil ladders, whispering directions), removing any sense of danger. The stakes are purely internal and abstract, and because the environment facilitates his goal rather than resisting it, the climax lacks tension. The resolution comes without a visible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is negligible; the "test" of resolve is mentioned in narration ("testing her resolve") but not shown on the page. The guides and the environment remove obstacles rather than creating them, resulting in a lack of narrative tension. The stakes remain abstract ("claiming a life unchained") and are never threatened by a concrete, opposing force.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.8)
    The stakes of silence versus safety are clear, but the conflict is largely internal and retrospective. The climax—handing over the bolt—resolves quickly into a shared understanding without forcing a difficult trade-off or escalation of tension on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is remote and lacks genuine escalation; the antagonist never directly pressures the protagonist, and the stakes are resolved via a magic mechanic without resistance. Options never narrow, and the protagonist wins without sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes are purely intellectual and asserted rather than demonstrated; we are told the rhythm is "urgent," but there is no external pressure or time clock forcing the action. The brief "storm swell" provides a moment of texture but does not force a difficult choice or impose a cost. The conflict remains internal and abstract, lacking a visceral sense of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=2.8)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent; there is no antagonist, environmental hazard, or time pressure actively opposing Elara in the scene. She faces no difficult choices or trade-offs, resulting in a flat escalation curve and a resolution devoid of earned stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=3.7)
    Stakes are abstract ("ecosystem would wither") and the antagonist ("rigid rebuilding councils") is entirely off-page until the lecture at the end. There is no on-page opposition or escalation; the plants agree with her, she has the item, and the ritual succeeds without a hitch. The lack of an active obstacle prevents meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=5.0)
    Pressure dissipates quickly; the protagonist resolves her PTSD episode through an instant epiphany ("pearl of stillness") rather than struggle. The interaction with the artist lacks genuine friction, serving only as a vehicle for the protagonist to deliver the thematic lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are declared ("fragmented reality") but the on-page conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no active opposition, only a task to complete. The resolution comes too easily via the magical loom, lacking a "dark night of the soul" or a genuine trade-off that tests his commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=3.6)
    Escalation is negligible; Elowen faces no active opposition or dilemma in accessing the ink's truth, only a puzzle he solves instantly. The resolution feels unearned, relying on a magical guide (Mira) to explain the stakes rather than forcing the protagonist to make a trade-off under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are high in theory (Regime collapse), but the on-page obstacle is minimal; the protagonist simply overrides safeguards with "intimate knowledge." The "cost" is anticipated (alarms will blare) rather than paid on the page, making the victory feel unearned. The conflict is resolved without significant tactical adjustment or sacrifice during the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=4.0)
    The conflict is introduced (looters vs. pacifist) but immediately deflated by the supernatural efficacy of the roses. There is no escalation where Elara is forced to reconsider her methods or risk losing everything; the plants simply solve the problem. The absence of a difficult trade-off makes the stakes feel theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are low because the protagonist's competence is absolute; he waits "unerringly calm" and deploys a perfect method without struggle. There is no moment where failure feels possible, and the climax lacks escalation—he simply acts and succeeds. The absence of a price paid for the magic (a "felt cost") flattens the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=4.0)
    The conflict lacks genuine pressure; the antagonist offers no meaningful resistance, folding immediately upon the protagonist's first rebuttal. The stakes feel declared rather than felt, as the victory is handed to Elara rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.5)
    The pressure escalates effectively as the "dissonance" translates into intelligible pleas, narrowing Elias's options to a single, costly choice. The dominant stake—silencing the guilt—is dramatized clearly, and the resolution requires active protagonist agency with a lasting physical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=4.0)
    The stakes are stated but never visceral, as the magical solution removes any real threat of failure or social collapse. The resolution is unearned; the protagonist faces no hard trade-offs, and the conflict dissolves into a "soft reset" of harmony without consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=4.1)
    Conflict is static; the antagonist poses no active threat until the climax, which resolves immediately upon the protagonist's action. The stakes are high in theory but low in practice, as the victory requires no sacrifice or difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=3.5)
    Tension collapses at the climax because the protagonist faces no opposition or trade-off; she is offered a perfect solution and accepts it. The lack of a "visible or felt price" for re-writing her personal history drains the narrative of dramatic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=4.5)
    The stakes are clear (reality vs. illusion), but the escalation lacks genuine friction; the environment and partner yield immediately to the protagonist's desires. The climax—a blind test confirming telepathy—provides total validation without exacting a price, leaving the conflict feeling low-risk.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are theoretical; the protagonist succeeds at every step without setbacks. The "overheating" threat appears and is resolved in two sentences, rendering the conflict purely procedural.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=3.6)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent; Elias encounters a problem (doom prophecy) and immediately solves it without external opposition or internal doubt. The stakes are theoretically high (the world), but because success is instant and costless, the narrative lacks tension. The escalation is linear and smooth, devoid of the friction required for a compelling arc.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.8)
    The stakes are clear—preserving the network and Lena's potential—but the conflict is low-intensity, functioning more as a ritualistic handover than a high-pressure crucible. The external threat is abstract, leaving the tension to rely on Lena's internal state, which is resolved relatively quickly. The "cost" is present (Elias remaining behind), but the lack of immediate antagonistic pressure limits the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=3.8)
    Pressure is low and abstract; the "conflict" is a meditation on lineage that encounters no active resistance or external test. The stakes ("lest the promise dissolve") are theoretical, and the resolution (deciding to be simple) carries no visible or felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is no tangible opposition or risk; Kai faces no antagonist, environmental hazard, or internal dilemma that threatens his goal. The stakes are purely intellectual (curiosity), and the answer is revealed immediately upon looking through the glass. Without a moment where failure is possible or a price is paid, the story lacks narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is no active opposition or escalation; Elara encounters no resistance from Mira or the environment, turning the story into a lecture rather than a conflict. The stakes (Mira's "unspoken storms") are resolved instantly by Elara's monologue, rendering the emotional arc unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=2.7)
    There is virtually no conflict; the "tides" rise but pose no threat, and the protagonist faces no opposition from the environment or herself. The stakes (isolation) are resolved instantly upon touching the sundial, resulting in a friction-free victory. The lack of a "meaningful tightening" or trade-off keeps the tension flat throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=2.9)
    There are no meaningful obstacles or stakes; the protagonist desires connection and receives it instantly without risk or sacrifice. The conflict is purely internal and resolved by a deus ex machina event.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.2)
    The central conflict with the "tricksters" and Harlan is established well, but the climax lacks sufficient resistance; Harlan folds immediately upon hearing the signal, and the crowd disperses without further complication. The stakes are high, but the protagonist pays a minimal price for victory, reducing the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.8)
    Escalation is clear, moving from silence to sonic intrusion to spatial threat. The stakes are physical and immediate (crushing), providing coherent pressure, though the cost is largely transient panic rather than a lasting sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is no active antagonist or obstacle; the "disappeared evidence" functions as backstory rather than a present pressure. The conflict is resolved instantly by the protagonist's intuition, removing any sense of risk or escalation. The stakes are theoretical (solving the case) rather than visceral, as Elara faces no physical or professional threat in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is negligible; the antagonist, Dr. Hale, "recoils" and confesses immediately upon being shown the journals, offering no dialectical opposition or tactical countermove. There is no escalation of stakes; Elara finds the key, uses the key, and wins without enduring a cost or making a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=3.4)
    Conflict is minimal and internal pressure is low; the protagonist moves from confusion to resolution via external conveniences (the found object, the magic map) rather than difficult choices. There is no meaningful escalation or felt cost to the decision to follow the trail; the "never" vow is discarded too easily.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=3.0)
    Tension is diffused by the summary format; the "struggle" with market forces is abstract, and the physical confrontation is resolved instantly without cost or exertion. The stakes are declared rather than tested, and the protagonist prevails through a passive "primal claim" rather than an active, difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=3.9)
    Dramatic tension is virtually nonexistent; the protagonist faces a problem and solves it immediately upon entering the dream state. The declared stakes ("light fails") remain abstract and are never tested by a failure, a ticking clock that forces a tradeoff, or a moment of genuine doubt. The narrative lacks a meaningful tightening of options.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.2)
    The stakes are clearly established, blending physical survival with the need for self-revelation. However, the cost paid—a pricked palm to activate the seed—feels like a standard fantasy trope that lacks weight proportional to the "unbending" of a soul. The resolution comes too swiftly after the sacrifice to register as a deep struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are declared as global ("world teetered," "doom") but remain abstract and distant. There is no immediate, concrete pressure or active opposition in the scene, resulting in a flat escalation curve without genuine peril.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are declared ("freedom") but not viscerally felt; the ritual proceeds without significant obstacles or meaningful opposition. The central conflict is resolved through a linear set of actions (find card, cut hand, chant), lacking a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt or options are narrowed by pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake (finding purpose/redemption) is clear, but the on-page pressure is low; the conflict is entirely internal and resolved by the serendipitous find rather than a hard choice. The resolution comes without a felt trade-off or price; he simply gains a new purpose, making the victory feel weightless.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=4.0)
    Stakes are declared ("touching distance from collapse") but not felt, as the solution is applied effortlessly and succeeds immediately. There is no escalating pressure; the tree shudders once, Elias acts, and the problem vanishes. The conflict lacks a moment of genuine doubt or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=4.6)
    Stakes remain abstract ("wonder fades") and the central struggle is externalized into a writhing orb rather than a difficult interpersonal or internal choice. The resolution is achieved through the librarian's mechanical competence, leaving the protagonist without a defining moment of agency or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.4)
    The central stake ("dissolve walls between hearts") is abstract and lacks immediate, concrete pressure. The conflict is resolved by a convenient artifact rather than a difficult trade-off, and the "hesitation" timeframe suspends pressure rather than escalating it.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes are declared ("self-forgiveness") but never tested against opposition; there is no antagonist or obstacle, only a scavenger hunt for affirmation. The resolution comes too easily—reading a wall—and the "cost" of the past accident is backstory, not a price paid in the present scene. The tension flatlines because the environment cooperates perfectly with the protagonist's emotional needs.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is no genuine resistance or escalation; the watch works immediately, the library provides the solution via mist, and the protagonist faces no antagonist or time pressure on the page. The "peril" mentioned is abstract and never manifests as a concrete obstacle forcing a hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are stated early ("bind her life... or shatter it"), but the escalation is flat because the protagonist faces no increasing pressure or failure before the climax. The resolution dissolves the conflict through magic rather than a character-driven decision that incurs a loss, rendering the initial stakes moot.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.7)
    Stakes are theoretically high (oblivion), but the escalation is driven largely by environmental coincidence ("static surged wilder") rather than character choices until the very end. The climax resolves without a lasting price or sacrifice, diminishing the narrative tension and the weight of the "threshold."

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=3.6)
    Pressure is negligible as the antagonist's action is backstory and the present obstacle is resolved instantly by a found object. There is no escalation of stakes or tightening of options; the solution is handed to the character.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=3.9)
    Resistance is minimal; Alex protests once verbally before immediately complying with Elias's instructions, stripping the scene of tension. The conflict is resolved through the application of a tool (the cloak) rather than a hard choice, leaving the "cost" of forgiveness abstract and unfelt. The stakes de-escalate rapidly once the magic system is engaged.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are existential and established early. The pressure escalates from the social/professional desperation of the opening to a primal fear of oblivion. The "interference pattern" scene acts as a masterful deepening, converting a scientific inquiry into a metaphysical ultimatum. The cost is undeniable and paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=3.6)
    Conflict is static; the protagonist faces no active opposition or shifting stakes, merely the passage of time. The escalation is linear and told through summary, lacking a pivotal moment where the cost of failure is felt or choices narrow under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.2)
    Escalation is present but mild; the protagonist overcomes the primary barrier (the mist) by remembering a technique and removing a restraint without opposition or consequence. The lack of a visible price paid for this rebellion makes the victory feel unearned and lowers the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=3.5)
    Tension is virtually absent; Elias faces no genuine opposition, as the environment permits entry and the spectral librarian immediately assists him. There is no escalation of stakes or potential for failure; he simply proceeds to the goal. The lack of a visible or felt price paid for the resurrection flattens the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is abstract and lacks genuine stakes; "stellar doubt" is treated as an external entity rather than a felt pressure. The protagonist uses "infallible arbiters" (the coins) to make decisions, which negates the risk of failure and flattens the escalation curve. There is no moment where the outcome is in genuine doubt, nor is there a personal price paid for the success.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=4.7)
    Conflict is minimal; the monsters act as passive targets for the naming ritual rather than active threats. There is no moment where the ritual threatens to fail or demands a fresh sacrifice, resulting in low tension and a resolution that feels inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake of cosmic imbalance is clear, and the complication ("imbalance fought back") adds necessary external pressure. However, the resolution relies on a sudden insight and persistence that feels relatively low-cost on the page; the "fracturing" of devotion is stated but healed quickly without lasting consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are declared ("ghosts demanded reckoning") but not tested; the antagonist force (the past) capitulates immediately to the protagonist's desire to heal. Mira offers no resistance, accepting Elias's narrative framework instantly, which deflates tension and leaves the central conflict without a struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=3.7)
    Stakes are declared ("lest the alchemy consume her") but never tested on the page; the ritual faces no resistance or risk of failure. Escalation is absent, as the character moves smoothly from preparation to success without confronting a dilemma or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes are clearly established (Lena’s survival), and the "rogue updraft" introduces effective immediate pressure. However, the resolution feels procedural, and the "cost" of the decision is asserted in the narration ("unspoken sacrifices") rather than demonstrated through a visible trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.2)
    The antagonist poses little threat against the protagonist's overpowered "Blade of Verity," which effortlessly dismantles opposition. The escalation lacks grit; the victory feels inevitable rather than hard-won through ingenuity or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=3.0)
    There is no meaningful escalation or cost; the protagonist faces a threat (developers) and immediately solves it with a series of lucky guesses and a magical gift. The conflict is purely external and dissolves without forcing Elias to trade anything of value or change his stance. The victory is handed to him, negating tension.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.7)
    Escalation is present as Elias adds blowers and voice, but the climax is rushed due to the short length, summarizing the intensification rather than dramatizing the struggle. The cost (cessation of agency) is legible at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are clear (home vs. exile), but the protagonist remains largely passive ("waiting") until the climax, limiting the escalation of tension. The cost of the final choice is internal and abstract ("wild heart at peace") rather than a visible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are clear but remain abstract ("destiny") until the final image, and the escalation is mechanical rather than emotional. While the failures build pressure, the "destiny" stakes feel declared in exposition rather than dramatized through immediate, felt consequences for the character.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes are high (city collapse), and the external pressure of the perigee is effective. However, the resolution comes with low personal cost; Elara solves the problem using her tools and professional skill without facing a painful trade-off or lasting loss, making the victory feel slightly unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=3.4)
    Tension is severely dampened by the protagonist's lack of fear; "chuckling" at the anomaly signals to the reader that the danger isn't real. The conflict with the "dour" double is introduced and resolved in two lines without genuine opposition. The escalation is linear and lacks a moment of doubt or difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.8)
    Escalation is effective: the protagonist's actions cause his comforting memories to degrade into painful truths (pact to betrayal), raising the stakes. The internal conflict is clear, though the lack of external pressure limits the tension to the abstract realm.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are clearly defined but lack immediate visceral risk, as the climax occurs within a holographic simulation where success is achieved without a significant reversal. The protagonist learns the method smoothly without facing a tangible trade-off or obstacle that forces a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=4.7)
    Stakes are nominally high (suicide), but the protagonist faces little genuine opposition or cost; she simply relays a message. The conflict is resolved too easily by the supernatural element, lacking a sense of earned escalation or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.0)
    Tension is built effectively via the rising tide and narrow passages, but the climax deflates when the protagonist gains the ability to phase through matter. The stakes shift from physical survival to a mystical procedure that lacks clear cost or difficulty, lowering the narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=3.1)
    Stakes are low as the antagonist (the ghost) is cooperative and the resolution requires no sacrifice or difficult choice. The conflict is resolved through a convenient ritual rather than struggle or ingenuity.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is abstract (entropy versus preservation) and lacks immediate pressure; the antagonist (the curse) is a "paper tiger" that vanishes instantly upon use. There is no escalation of difficulty on the page, only a linear progression to success.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are low because the protagonist faces no real opposition or trade-offs; the "cost" of the transformation is the release of negative emotion, which is a reward, not a price. The conflict resolves too easily when the brother appears as a benign, welcoming figure rather than a source of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is little genuine conflict as the protagonist's tactic ("resonantly soft" playing) easily bypasses the antagonists' sensors without complication. The climax lacks pressure; the statues converge but fail to act before the problem is solved. The stakes are declared but never tested against a risk of failure or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=5.4)
    Conflict is largely theoretical; the patrol serves as a "false tiger" that dissolves without genuine pressure or cost. The stakes remain abstract ("fostering what rules forbade") until the end, and the ease of the drone missions undercuts the sense of danger implied by the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no active opposition or ticking clock, and the repair process proceeds with magical ease. The potential internal conflict—breaking his vow—is resolved too smoothly to generate the necessary narrative pressure or sense of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.1)
    Escalation is low-resistance; the scarf resists only briefly before complying, and the stakes of "full immersion" remain abstract. No visible price is paid for the magic, leaving the conflict feeling theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.8)
    The stakes are high in concept but low in dramatization; the obstacle is a fleeing bird that is captured after a brief struggle with equipment. The cost of the victory is nominal ("sweat," "smudged fingers"), lacking a deeper trade-off or painful sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.5)
    The stakes are high in concept (freedom of the soul) but low in execution, as the conflict is resolved without significant resistance or cost. The "disorientation" is stated as a necessary price but is resolved quickly via a magical process, lacking a moment of genuine doubt or sacrifice. The protagonist faces no meaningful opposition; the ritual simply works.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story lacks significant tightening or escalation; Elias encounters a puzzle, solves it, and leaves. The opposition is passive (the environment and the lock), and the climax resolves without a trade-off or a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt. The stakes remain abstract rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are clearly defined (reversible vs. permanent exile), and the shadow incident provides necessary on-page pressure. The escalation is functional, though the solution comes too easily (Kai succeeds immediately upon being told to "do it"), lacking a moment of genuine doubt or sacrifice to earn the "resilience" theme.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=2.5)
    Escalation is negligible; the protagonist faces no genuine opposition, and the "doubt" mentioned is resolved instantly by a magical gesture. The stakes are theoretical ("wonder fading") and the resolution is cost-free, lacking the necessary trade-offs to generate narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.7)
    The stakes are legible (the peace of the spirits and the shade), and the pressure escalates through the density of the work ("hours bled"). However, the conflict is largely procedural; Lirien faces endurance constraints rather than a sharp tactical dilemma or an escalating cost that threatens failure.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=3.8)
    There is almost no escalation or resistance; the protagonist moves from discovery to resolution without encountering a significant setback or narrowing of options. The "tightening" is procedural rather than conflict-driven, and the stakes remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=3.9)
    Stakes are purely abstract ("physics of letting go") and lack immediate physical or emotional pressure; the environment's danger is mentioned but never felt. The resolution comes too easily through passive observation of a magical object, requiring no sacrifice or difficult choice from Elara.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=2.8)
    There are no genuine stakes or obstacles; the ghost asks for help and Elowen provides it instantly without risk or cost. The lack of an antagonist or a difficult trade-off renders the victory hollow, as the protagonist glides through the plot without resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.6)
    Stakes remain largely internal and retrospective, lacking urgent on-page pressure; Lira faces no active opposition or dilemma, merely a sequence of realizations. The "cost" of the revelation is not paid in the scene, as she immediately accepts the life-altering news with "tender resolve." The conflict is situational but resolved too neatly by the diary's convenient final entry.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=4.2)
    The stakes of survival are raised by the "snapped string" but immediately abandoned for observational musing, removing urgent pressure. The conflict is purely internal and resolved without a difficult choice or sacrifice; the protagonist simply looks through a telescope and finds exactly what he needs.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.4)
    The external ticking clock of the demolition crews creates effective pressure that escalates naturally alongside the internal artistic challenge. The foreman’s voice acts as a sharp rhythmic device to tighten the tension in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=3.5)
    The threat of the starlings is resolved instantly by the puzzle solution, forcing no difficult trade-offs or tactical changes. The stakes remain abstract because the protagonist faces no genuine risk of failure or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=3.6)
    Tension is negligible; obstacles dissolve immediately upon encounter (the door groans open, the gears fit perfectly, the prophecies provide instructions). There is no escalation of stakes or moment of genuine risk where failure seems possible. The resolution feels inevitable from the start, lacking the friction of a true test.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=3.0)
    Conflict is nominal; "doubt" is mentioned in summary but dismissed in a single exchange of dialogue. There is no escalation of pressure; the path from problem to solution is linear and unobstructed. The stakes (planetary blight) are declared but the resolution feels unearned by protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—humanity's annihilation—is effectively pressured by "time's final ripple." The protagonist's agency is central to the resolution, and the cost is visibly paid on the page through the disintegration of the puppet head, meeting the standard for a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are clear and the ticking clock of the frost provides functional tension throughout the rescue. However, the birds—established as a threat—are bypassed relatively easily via the magic system, meaning the escalation relies almost entirely on the timeline rather than an adapting antagonist or deepening complication.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=4.5)
    Pressure is low throughout; the conflict is internal and retrospective, with no immediate external stakes or ticking clock in the ravine scene. The resolution comes too easily via the epiphany, lacking a moment where the protagonist must choose between two difficult options with visible consequences. The stakes are declared but not tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation is present, driven by the rhythmic counting of losses which deepens the internal stakes. While the cost is ultimate (dissolution of self), the lack of external friction—given the "lull" context—makes the conflict feel inevitable rather than struggled for. The pressure is consistent but lacks a sharp pivot point prior to the finale.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=4.8)
    The central conflict is processed through a montage ("Pool by pool, he progressed") rather than an escalating series of hard choices. The protagonist "endures" the contagious remorse, but there is no moment where failure seems possible or tactics must change; the outcome feels inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=2.1)
    The conflict evaporates immediately upon contact with the protagonist; there is no escalation, only a linear progression to success. The &quot;shouted accusations&quot; turn to laughter without any intermediate struggle or negotiation. The stakes are declared but never tested, as the solution works perfectly on the first try.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=3.8)
    There is a distinct lack of obstacle or cost; the protagonist wills the change, and the universe complies instantly. The stakes are abstract, and the escalation is merely a series of successful modifications without any genuine risk of failure or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=3.9)
    Tension relies entirely on a mechanical timer (the hour of inversion) rather than antagonistic pressure or difficult choices. The protagonist faces no unexpected setbacks; the plan works perfectly, resulting in a low-stakes progression that lacks escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes are abstract and lack urgency; the "Great Stillness" provides backdrop pressure but no active opposition. The protagonist faces no difficult choices or tradeoffs—he simply performs his craft and succeeds, leaving the central conflict without a dynamic arc or paid price.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.0)
    The central conflict is Man vs. Nature/Magic, but the antagonist (the unraveling covenant) exerts little active pressure on the page. The "difficulty" Elias seeks is negated by the worry stone, which effectively solves the puzzle for him, robbing the climax of earned escalation or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=4.6)
    Conflict is strictly external (Man vs. Lock) and lacks visceral stakes; the threat of missing the "perfect silence" feels manufactured and abstract. The escalation relies on technobabble ("subsonic rumbles," "432 hertz") rather than escalating personal risk or moral dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.5)
    While the internal and external conflicts are linked, the montage structure dissipates the pressure. We are told of the struggle ("motion and smell converged in torment") rather than witnessing a specific, desperate choice that creates a visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.8)
    Escalation is strictly linear (fly, find, take, return) without a meaningful reversal or deepening of stakes. The lack of an antagonist or a significant trade-off makes the success feel inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=3.6)
    Stakes remain abstract ("foresight") and the protagonist faces no meaningful opposition; the wind and debris present physical features to measure, not obstacles that threaten failure. There is no moment where Elias is forced to sacrifice one value for another, resulting in a flat trajectory without escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.0)
    Stakes are abstract ("wonder vs. survival") and lack immediate physical or relational consequences in the scene. There is no active opposition or escalation of difficulty; the environment yields instantly to the protagonist's action. The success is absolute and immediate, removing any sense of risk or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=4.5)
    The conflict is entirely internal and resolved without significant external opposition or risk of failure. The stakes are theoretical (wisdom vs. haunting), and the escalation is low; the ritual succeeds on the first try, yielding the answer immediately. The "shadow thieves" appear as harmless visions, lacking active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are theoretically high (apocalypse), but the on-page conflict is largely an abstract feedback loop of "transposed empathy" equations. The escalation is intellectual and technobabble-driven ("Joy's vector traces sorrow's arcuate path"), lacking a gritty, felt cost beyond the dimming of a magical battery.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent; the protagonist faces no resistance, refusal, or risk of failure in his interaction with Lira. The narrative lacks a meaningful tightening of stakes or a moment where the outcome is in doubt, resulting in a flat dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=4.7)
    Stakes remain theoretical; there is no immediate threat, deadline, or risk of failure driving the scene. The escalation is purely informational—the window reveals increasingly clear answers—rather than a rising pressure that forces difficult choices. The protagonist faces no external opposition and overcomes his internal skepticism instantly.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.9)
    A distinct cost is paid on the page (the protagonist's life/essence), providing a baseline of consequence. However, the escalation is mechanical—she finds an object and immediately uses it—lacking the friction of failed attempts or deepening complications.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=3.9)
    Conflict is external (entropy) and resolved linearly without meaningful escalation or reversal. Elar faces no active opposition or dilemma; the "barter" for the silk does not force a difficult trade-off on the page. The stakes are global but feel distant due to the summary delivery.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=4.6)
    Stakes remain abstract and cosmic ("realities fraying") rather than immediate and visceral. The conflict is resolved through information dump rather than a test of skill or character, and the "weight" of the truth is stated rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=2.2)
    Stakes regarding the failing light and the preservation of safety are established but abandoned for a meta-commentary on word count constraints. The tension dissolves without decision or cost, as the story fails to reach a narrative conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are globally high (a new dawn) but the conflict faces zero active opposition, as the "screen-bound" world is passive. The escalation is mechanical—adjusting levers—and while the result is a world change, the cost is theoretical rather than visceral or personal to Elias.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes remain abstract and internal; the "pressure" is described ("building pressure in her chest") but never tested by external opposition or a difficult trade-off. The resolution—deciding to "illuminate [stories] wisely"—feels like a low-stakes semantic shift rather than a hard-won victory or costly renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is minimal; the story is a procedural of healing where the protagonist faces no opposition, risk, or trade-offs. The text explicitly negates physical cost (moonlight heals his knees) and emotional cost (sorrow simply disperses), resulting in a low-tension vignette rather than a drama.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are theoretically high (dying realm) but lack tension because the solution is additive (singing -> success -> more singing -> total success). The "resistance" of the night is overcome without a change in tactics or a sacrifice of resources; the "pain lanced Elara's temples" is a token physical sensation, not a narrative cost.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=3.9)
    Stakes remain abstract and internal, resolving without genuine opposition or escalating pressure. The protagonist faces no difficult trade-offs; the "cost" of leaving her ordinary life is framed as a reward, stripping the climax of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=5.0)
    The dominant stake—reconciliation—is established but resolved with minimal resistance; the estrangement dissolves over a single interaction without forcing a hard trade-off. There is no meaningful tightening of options; Elias offers bread, and the conflict evaporates, leaving the absolution feeling unearned. The "creeping" threat is discussed abstractly but does not exert active pressure on the scene's climax.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=4.3)
    Stakes are high (oblivion), but the escalation is repetitive; the protagonist simply measures frequencies until he finds the solution. There is no moment where pressure forces a trade-off or a sacrifice of resources/values. The conflict is external and is resolved through steady competence rather than a dramatic turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.8)
    The stakes are clear, but the "false start" structure dissipates tension by listing the failures in summary rather than forcing the protagonist to endure the cost of each attempt in a full scene.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes remain intellectual (curiosity) rather than visceral or personal; the "danger" of the weather is mentioned but not felt. The conflict is resolved too easily with a single line of dialogue, lacking the "meaningful tightening" or trade-off required for higher bands. The protagonist pays no price for her revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are purely internal and stated ("quiet desperation") without external pressure or time constraints. The central conflict—opening the box—is resolved through a competency check (mnemonic gift) rather than a difficult choice or sacrifice. There is no escalation of cost; the protagonist achieves his goal completely free of consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.4)
    Escalation occurs via physical cost (wilting), but the protagonist's agency is weak in the rising action; the bazaar and farm obstacles are resolved by the interventions of secondary characters (the child, the worker) rather than Elara's own actions. She reacts rather than drives the solution in these beats.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes remain largely philosophical ("wonder's spectrum," "truth itself would mute") and lack visceral, immediate pressure; the "boy with dulled gaze" appears as a prop to validate success rather than a complicating agent. There is no active antagonist or escalating obstacle that forces Elara to sacrifice something concrete to succeed.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation is coherent, moving from internal static to physical threat to resolution with rising pressure. The cost—sacrificing the "human template's youth" relics to restore order—is a legible trade-off, satisfying the requirement for closure with a paid price.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=3.2)
    The stakes are abstract ("healing divides") and the opposition—city noise—is overcome with a simple gesture, lacking genuine pressure. The conflict is resolved without any trade-off or difficult choice; the "victory" feels inevitable rather than fought for.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=4.0)
    The dominant stake shifts abruptly from abstract intellectual property to life-or-death rescue, creating a disjointed escalation profile. The antagonist (corporate saboteurs) is abstract and off-screen, leaving the protagonist to battle static locks rather than active opposition. The resolution comes through "patient unraveling" and dance, lacking a visceral trade-off or painful choice.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=4.8)
    Escalation is strictly linear and physical (digging vs. gravity tugs) rather than a tightening of tactical options or stakes. The obstacles are nuisances rather than true antagonists, and the climax requires no sacrifice or difficult trade-off, resulting in low tension.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are declared ("worlds colliding") but never felt; the conflict remains abstract and distant. The antagonist—the prophecy—is passive, allowing Elias to dismantle it without a tactical pivot or escalation of risk. The absence of an "all is lost" moment or meaningful opposition flattens the dramatic tension entirely.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=4.8)
    The conflict is low-pressure; Harlan capitulates almost immediately upon being questioned, offering little resistance to test Elara's resolve. The stakes are declared ("desperate for sugar," "motive sharpened") but the on-page obstacle is minimal, resulting in a convenient resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.2)
    The stakes (sanity versus independence) are established early, but the escalation relies on intensifying descriptions of pain rather than evolving pressure. The resolution is earned through endurance, but the repeated invocation of "resolve" as a magical fix undercuts the agency of the struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are theoretical rather than felt; the "calibrated treason" is backstory, and the "unlinking" encounters no resistance. The physical cost—a prick from a thorn—is trivial and does not balance the weight of the stated political consequences. The lack of an antagonist or obstacle makes the resolution feel inevitable and unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are theoretical ("why some echo") until the merchant lunges, at which point the conflict is instantly resolved by the guardian and magic echoes without struggle or cost to the protagonist. The "webs of intrigue" are declared but do not generate palpable pressure or difficult trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=3.6)
    Opposition is negligible; the antagonist (the Mate's shade) appears and is immediately bound and compelled to confess without inflicting any cost on Elara. The stakes remain abstract and historical, with no immediate threat to the protagonist to force a high-pressure decision. The climax resolves via a command rather than a contest of wills.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=3.2)
    Tangible stakes are virtually absent; the conflict is purely philosophical and meets no opposition. The mending process proceeds without complication or tradeoff, offering no test of the protagonist's values. The resolution is inevitable and cost-free, lacking the tension required for a narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central conflict (Truth vs. Safety) is strong and escalates from a physical journey to a moral dilemma. The pressure tightens appropriately when the nature of the "curse" is revealed to be fragile technology. The cost of the final decision—betraying his own vocation—is legible, though the brevity makes the turnaround feel slightly swift.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=2.9)
    The protagonist lacks agency in the climax; the "ancient shadows" resolve the betrayal automatically via deus ex machina while Elias merely watches. There is no difficult choice or sacrifice made by the character to earn the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is negligible; the primary obstacle (the melody faltering) is resolved in the next paragraph with no risk of failure or resource depletion. The protagonist faces no meaningful opposition, and the "doubt" mentioned is a false beat that does not impede his action. The stakes remain theoretical rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=4.0)
    Conflict is external and loud but lacks genuine pressure; the wraiths are generic monsters that are dispatched with a single dial-turn. There is no escalation of cost—Elias does not have to sacrifice anything (the key, his safety, the tower) to achieve victory. The "adaptation" is technical rather than personal or tactical, resulting in a climax void of suspense.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=3.9)
    Stakes are declared but never tested; the protagonist faces no external antagonist or unforeseen obstacle during the heist. The tension remains theoretical ("Regime's grip") rather than immediate, resulting in a climax that feels like a foregone conclusion with zero escalation or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.2)
    There is a clear decision and cost (leaving the partner, destroying the phone), but the escalation is internal and abstract. The parallel between 19th-century slavery and a modern abusive relationship is drawn with heavy-handed explicitness that flattens the nuance of the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=4.0)
    Stakes are internal and abstract; there is no external pressure forcing a trade-off or risk. The conflict resolves too easily—the heart is fixed by the shopkeeper and a weather event while Elias watches—resulting in low tension and a lack of visible cost to the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=4.2)
    Pressure is low because the narrative spans a long timeframe where obstacles are overcome via summary ("she refined," "she etched"). The stakes (machine sentience) are high in concept but abstract in execution, lacking a moment where Elara faces a genuine risk of failure or loss. The conflict is resolved by the magical efficacy of the algorithm without a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central conflict (curiosity vs. corporate protocol) escalates cleanly to a high-stakes choice: forging the timestamp. The cost of this action is immediate and permanent (the audit bot lockout and loss of job), satisfying the requirement for a decisive turn with consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.5)
    While the stakes of war are declared, the conflict lacks on-page pressure; the antagonist yields immediately to the protagonist's first attempt at resolution. The absence of a forced trade-off or setback makes the victory feel inevitable and flat.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=5.7)
    Stakes remain largely internal and abstract; the protagonist observes rather than struggles against significant opposition. The "failure" with the elderly woman is a brief beat that resolves quickly through passive listening later.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; Elena faces no meaningful opposition or difficult choice, merely listening to a lecture that resolves her internal state. The resolution feels inevitable and cost-free, as she passively absorbs wisdom rather than forging a new path through agency or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are declared ("wisdom... fades forever") but never viscerally tested; the ritual proceeds without error or significant opposition. The "tightening" is merely procedural execution rather than a pressure-cooker of narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.4)
    There is no meaningful opposition; the town's grief dissolves instantly upon contact with Elara's work. The stakes are declared ("unspoken grief") but never tested against a risk of failure, resulting in a low-tension progression where success is inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.4)
    The conflict between the external "suspended hush" and the internal urge to speak provides adequate pressure. The escalation is linear and logical, leading to a meaningful tightening where Elowen breaks her silence, though the stakes remain largely philosophical.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes are clearly defined, but the escalation is flat; Elias faces environmental friction but no significant external antagonist or sharp internal dilemma that threatens failure. The victory feels inevitable, lacking a moment of high pressure where he must sacrifice something to succeed.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=3.9)
    The dominant stake—capturing the pulsar—is clear, but the secondary threat of the observatory being hurled into oblivion by a spinning clock hand disrupts suspension of disbelief. The escalation relies on this physical absurdity, making the tension feel contrived rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=3.9)
    Conflict is virtually absent as the "flawless goodbye" goal faces no significant obstacles. The estrangement—the primary source of tension—dissolves immediately upon the daughter's arrival, rendering the stakes purely theoretical rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes remain abstract and low; Elara faces no active opposition, time pressure, or risk of failure. The obstacles (opening the pedestal, fixing the automatons) are overcome immediately upon interaction, lacking the escalation required to make the final success feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=3.6)
    There is no genuine opposition or pressure; the maze "yearns her forward" instead of obstructing her, and the magical ritual succeeds instantly without trial or error. The central conflict (skepticism vs. belief) evaporates the moment she finds the tooth, rendering the stakes theoretical rather than dramatic. The narrative lacks a deepening of cost or a moment where the protagonist must sacrifice something to succeed.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=2.8)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; the sea glass yields to polishing without difficulty, and the villagers offer no opposition to the new technology. The stakes regarding fire safety remain in backstory and never exert immediate, on-page pressure or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is no authentic conflict or resistance; Kai arrives and immediately affirms Elara's feelings, leading to mutual agreement. The stakes remain abstract ("healing"), and the narrative lacks a moment where the protagonist must choose between competing values or endure a tangible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.7)
    The conflict is static; the "current" and "fog" oppose Elias, but he overcomes them effortlessly in every beat with mere willpower. The lack of a visible trade-off, failure, or escalation in cost makes the victory feel inevitable and low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=3.5)
    While the stakes (famine) are high in theory, the on-page obstacle is negligible; the ritual works perfectly on the first attempt. There is no escalation of pressure, no moment of doubt, and no sacrifice required to achieve the remedy.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are clear (mapping the lost soul), but the conflict is strictly one of endurance against the cold. The lack of a live antagonist or a choice that requires sacrificing one desire for another limits the tension to a linear "will he finish the spell" track.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes remain abstract and low-pressure throughout; there is no active opposition, time crunch, or agonizing alternative to force a hard decision. The escalation is purely procedural (trying different angles), and the protagonist never faces a moment where failure feels imminent or costly.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes are theoretically high (infinite entrapment), but the escalation is brief and lacks a "try-fail" cycle to prove the difficulty. The transition from weaving to being "trapped boundary-lessly" happens in a single beat, and the solution follows immediately. The pressure feels manipulated to fit the length rather than organically driving the protagonist to a desperate measure.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.2)
    Conflict is low; the carving process meets no physical or emotional resistance, and the magic works perfectly without a glitch. The stakes are clear, but the protagonist's victory feels inevitable rather than hard-won against active opposition or difficult trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are clearly established (reclaiming youth/ambition vs. accepting erosion). The escalation through the collected story fragments to the ghost's manifestation is effective. The climax creates a meaningful turning point where Elias must abandon his primary tool and goal, satisfying the requirement for cost.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is purely theoretical (order vs. entropy) with no active opposition or risk of failure. The protagonist faces no difficult trade-offs; the repair process is smooth and inevitable, lacking dramatic tension or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes remain low and internal; the "onslaught of sound" is introduced and immediately mitigated by "petrichor nostalgia," removing the potential for genuine conflict or endurance. There is no escalation of risk, and the resolution comes without a felt price or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is virtually no conflict or active opposition. Elias faces no physical danger from the "cool ooze" nor any time pressure despite the radio mention; he simply arrives and takes the object. The lack of obstacles or meaningful cost renders the "upheaval" unearned and the stakes negligible.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes are theoretical (loss of wisdom) rather than immediate. The conflict with Kael is mild and dissolves instantly upon the introduction of the fulgurite; there is no moment where Elias must trade something of value or risk failure. The "curse" of the rope offers no genuine resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes remain abstract as the protagonist faces no meaningful opposition; the magical thread functions as an instant solution to his "nomad's ache" without complication. Escalation is replaced by a repetitive list of three obituary entries, with no increasing risk or paid price.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes are well-defined (sterility vs. life), and the escalation through the assembly process is coherent. The cost—a "flawed genesis" resulting in a marred bird—is visible and felt, effectively charging the final image with a bittersweet reality.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=3.0)
    There is virtually no active resistance or escalation; the character faces no external opposition or internal hesitation during the task. The stakes are purely thematic ("heal this land") and do not exert immediate pressure on the grafting process itself.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is no genuine opposition or escalation; the frozen time removes urgency, and the "sidereal patience" mechanic removes the need for difficult action. The resolution is inevitable rather than earned, as Elara faces no risk of failure or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are theoretically high (the fate of stellar lineages), but the lack of active opposition or immediate peril renders the conflict largely contemplative. Elowen’s journey faces no concrete resistance, making her success feel inevitable rather than hard-won; the cost ("forever haunted") is stated rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is entirely abstract and intellectual, missing the external pressure or risk of failure required to generate genuine stakes. The mention of a storm outside is incidental background noise that fails to force a hard trade-off or complicate the protagonist's goal.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=4.9)
    Escalation is weak; the protagonist faces no active opposition or difficult trade-off in the climax, merely observing visions that affirm his redemption. The declared stakes (missing tides, village harm) are bypassed by the magical nature of the pause, removing the felt cost of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=3.5)
    The conflict is abstract and lacks urgency; the chess game against "echoes" has no tangible penalty for losing, and the decoding process meets no resistance. Elias approaches every hurdle with "blithe abandon," removing any sense of risk or escalating pressure required for a compelling narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are clearly established, and the approaching enforcers create a functional ticking clock that pressures Elias's choices. The escalation is linear and effective, though the lack of a concrete on-page confrontation keeps the danger slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=4.2)
    The conflict lacks genuine escalation; the antagonist (drones) appears and is immediately dismissed by the protagonist's competence without testing her resolve. There is no on-page cost or trade-off; Elara succeeds at her goal without losing anything, flattening the stakes to a frictionless progression.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.7)
    The slowing chair acts as an effective external pressure that escalates the scene immediately. The stakes are clearly defined: the preservation of a fleeting memory against the erosion of time. The cost is felt in the lingering doubt and the physical weight of the mask at the end, fulfilling the requirement for a visible price. (Score capped by Q7 artifact debt).

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are intellectual and abstract; the antagonist forces ("surface envoys") are distant backstory rather than immediate pressure. The escalation is a procedural sequence of digging rather than a tightening vice of consequences, lacking a felt "do or die" moment on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=2.9)
    Conflict is abstract and resolved too easily via the teacher's method, with no felt cost or genuine risk of failure on the page. The antagonism between characters is stated in summary ("bellowed a defiant folk dirge") and then immediately smoothed over without a decisive tactical struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.0)
    There is virtually no active pressure; the Regime is a distant concept, not a present obstacle, and the pruning is performed with ease. The story lacks a tightening of stakes or a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.1)
    The stakes are high globally (city power) but the interpersonal conflict is low voltage; Mira's opposition is overcome instantly by the offering of the box. There is no moment where Elias is truly at risk of failing or where the cost of his truthfulness forces a painful trade-off; the "workaround" removes the teeth from the curse.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=2.9)
    There is virtually no conflict or opposition; Elias creates the magic, understands it, and heals the town without setbacks or trade-offs. The "creeping normality" is an abstract antagonist that offers no active resistance. The protagonist pays no price for his success, resulting in a flat narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=4.1)
    Conflict is informational rather than dramatic; resistance is low ("Elara... demanded proof") and instantly overcome by the statue's magic. There is no tangible cost to Elara for uncovering the truth; she simply receives it. The stakes remain abstract (historical reputation) rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.8)
    Escalation is clear, moving from physical climbing to intellectual challenge to the physical risk of the dice throw. The stakes are high (eternity vs. release), and the cost is paid on the page (the shattered die), though the resolution happens very quickly due to the short length.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.0)
    Escalation is linear and lacks a meaningful reversal or deepening; the protagonist faces no active opposition or setback before the climax. The resolution arrives via a magical external response that relieves the tension without demanding a difficult trade-off from Elias.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.2)
    The imminent threat of the flood is undercut by the group's ability to pause for a baking ritual, which lowers the felt pressure. The escalation relies on a sudden external convenience (the scouts) rather than a tightening of internal options.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake (fate vs. freedom) is established early and escalates to a climax with a visible, high-stakes cost (life force). While the opposition is abstract, the sacrifice is dramatized clearly on the page, satisfying the requirement for a meaningful tightening and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.8)
    Escalation is present as Fear physically closes in, but the conflict resolution lacks genuine friction; Elara simply recites the correct lines and throws an item to win. The "cost" of confession is stated in dialogue but the immediate success of the ritual robs the moment of felt narrative weight. The stakes feel abstract despite the visceral imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.9)
    Escalation is present (clouds to waves to beam), but the protagonist's control over the threat feels absolute, reducing tension to a display of competence. The climax lacks a moment of genuine vulnerability; the victory is achieved through a magical skill set that never seems in danger of failing.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from a personal inquiry to a catastrophic, city-wide failure. The cost is unmistakably paid on the page as the shell fractures, permanently worsening the city's situation under the causal drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes remain abstract ("rescue truth") and the external pressure ("whispers of vandals") is a declared threat that never materializes in the scene. The conflict is entirely internal and resolved through assertive exposition rather than dramatized struggle. There is no escalation of risk; the protagonist succeeds simply because he arrived.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.2)
    The rising tide provides a clear, functional ticking clock that escalates pressure, and the protagonist pays a visible physical cost ("lungs aflame," "pinned leg"). However, the stakes are somewhat melodramatic ("futile rite against the sea's hushed blaze"), and the internal conflict is resolved too neatly by the coinciding discovery of the ancestor's name.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.3)
    The central conflict (mystery vs. truth) is low-pressure; the obstacle of the blackout is immediately solved by the convenient property of the ink, removing the need for struggle or ingenuity. The stakes are abstract ("career's foundation shifting") and do not manifest in a tangible, on-page cost or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict is entirely internal and static; the pressure is "grief hurts," and the escalation is simply "grief hurts more" until the ritual resolves it. There is no external opposition or meaningful trade-off; the magic functions without failure or cost, rendering the stakes theoretical. The climax lacks a moment where Elar must choose between two difficult paths; he simply completes the spell.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.1)
    Stakes are theoretical rather than felt; the "ten precious minutes" act as a mechanical timer rather than a source of escalating pressure. The protagonist meets no resistance or meaningful failure during the hunt, resolving the conflict without a visible cost or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.0)
    The story lacks meaningful escalation; obstacles are overcome immediately upon presentation (the torn chart is fixed by drones, the inert chip is activated by star trails). There is no moment where failure seems possible or where the protagonist must trade one value for another, resulting in low narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—moral integrity versus concealment—is clear, and the internal pressure escalates appropriately. Yet, the external pressure is minimal until the serendipitous discovery, making the conflict feel largely interior and passive.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes are theoretically high (peace, brother's freedom), but the on-page conflict is low-resistance; the antagonist immediately accepts the token and the apology without testing the protagonist's resolve. The lack of pushback flattens the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.8)
    The stakes are primarily internal and abstract; the external pressure (a rogue swell) is resolved too quickly to feel like a genuine test. The accumulation of regrets provides some pressure, but the resolution comes from the environment (the star) rather than a costly protagonist choice.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=3.0)
    The narrative lacks genuine stakes or escalation; obstacles are navigated via "cryptic hints" rather than struggle. The resolution comes without cost—simply showing the ball fixes the central conflict—depriving the story of tension or earned payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=2.8)
    Stakes are declared but not felt; there is no external opposition, and the internal conflict is dismissed almost immediately. The "reluctant metamorphosis" presents a potential trade-off (humanity for love), but the narrative removes the sting by making the transformation a euphoric, uncomplicated success.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.2)
    The central stakes—regret over stolen time—are established early but resolved too neatly by the magical reveal. The conflict deflates rather than escalates at the climax; the realization that time is "reclaimed, not stolen" feels like a soft reset that erases the weight of the prior regret without a tangible sacrifice or "felt cost" on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes are declared but not felt; the antagonist (the shadow) surrenders to the protagonist's first move (stitching) without inflicting damage or forcing adaptation. There is no visible cost to the victory.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.1)
    Stakes remain abstract and theoretical until the climax, where external problems (illness, blindness, volcano fury) are resolved by a magical event with no cost to the protagonist other than the loss of an item he intended to give away. There is no escalating pressure or "tightening" of options; the narrative drifts rather than drives toward the conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=3.5)
    Tension is virtually absent; the "guards" murmur excuses and stir but never present a concrete obstacle or threat. The protagonist faces no difficult trade-offs or risks, as the environment (the blackout) actively conspires to help her. Without an antagonist force or a moment of potential failure, the stakes feel theoretical rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=4.9)
    Conflict is theoretically high (tormenting visions) but practically low; the protagonist overcomes the "assailing" foresights simply by continuing the ritual he already planned. There is no moment where he must abandon a goal or sacrifice a resource to succeed; the victory feels inevitable rather than forged in the crucible of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=3.5)
    The scene lacks immediate, high-stakes pressure; the conflict is primarily historical (past censorship) rather than an urgent on-page struggle with visible consequences. The protagonist faces no active opposition in the moment, making his exchange of poems feel like a low-risk aesthetic exercise rather than a dangerous act of resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=3.9)
    Stakes feel performative; the "yield truth or blood" threat evaporates immediately upon the reveal. The lack of visible cost or genuine peril makes the escalation flat and the resolution satisfying only in a symmetric, mechanical sense.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=3.8)
    The antagonist is effectively absent from the scene; guards "passed indifferently," removing all tension from the forbidden act of rebuilding. The victory comes without an on-page test or felt cost, as the regime's "iron grip" never materializes to oppose the protagonist's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pressure is low; the protagonist faces minor physical hurdles (a climb, a surge) that are overcome quickly. The antagonist is an abstract "fate" that yields easily to the musical performance, lacking a moment of genuine doubt or sacrifice that would heighten the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=4.7)
    Stakes are declared early, but the on-page pressure is low; the "shadows prowling" and the "monsoon" act as atmospheric markers rather than active forces that force a hard trade-off. The protagonist resolves the central conflict (waking the guardian) on the first attempt without failing or having to alter her tactics significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=3.8)
    Escalation is negligible; Elara faces no obstacles, makes no difficult trade-offs, and pays no price for her resolution. The "struggle" is resolved by following instructions, turning the climax into a performative ritual rather than a contest of values or wills.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can silence be transmuted into shared resonance—tightens through each fork strike; yellow wonder and violet sorrow foreclose abstract hope and force concrete tactile choices. The lily’s crack supplies a visible price that alters tactics mid-scene, converting Kai’s rage from atmospheric threat to harmonized substrate. Escalation is causal, not additive: every heat swirl narrows options until only the deepest fork can prevent collapse. Cost is unmistakable—the conservatory walls permanently scarred—though the moment of Kai’s hand-on-tine could carry even sharper physical risk to push this into 9+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—silence versus the relentless distress flares—tightens with every shard; each successful pulse silences one wail, foreclosing retreat and raising bodily cost as oxygen dwindles. Escalation is causal under the Situational lens: mounting spectral aggression and lung pressure force Elias deeper into “impossible spaces,” turning abstract architecture into life-or-death leverage. One meaningful deepening suffices: when the final prism clicks above the air bubble, the option to remain alive is erased. The price (his corporeal dissolution) is visible on the page, meeting the 8+ cost requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—survival via secrecy—tightens when enforcers nearly catch Lena, showing visible price. Escalation is cumulative, not causal-peril: each run thickens communal commitment. Cost is felt (Tomas’s cracked voice, Lena’s frozen breath), but stakes never pivot to higher external jeopardy. Sufficient for length, yet lacks a final fork that forecloses an option.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—liberate stored love—tightens when the camera projection reveals Mira’s knotted reservoir; that visualization forecloses Elias’s solitary treasure-hunt and forces shared breath as the only tactic. Escalation is single but meaningful: the knot dissolves on-screen, color returns to her skin, love starts moving. Cost is conceptual (love is now expended, not hoarded) rather than physical loss; still legible under poetic lens. No reversal or foil, yet the deepening re-configures both quests into one live circuit.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—break memory’s retrocognitive choke—signals early and tightens through each resurfacing photograph. The middle beat (pressing fragment to photo) narrows options: continue looping or destroy the portal. Cost is visible—photos crumble to dust, fragment flakes into “luminous motes,” foreclosing return. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes again, so escalation just clears the 8.0 threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—get seeds before Wall falls—is signaled in para 4 and escalates as Wall bombs start mid-story, tightening the literal countdown. Elara’s agency drives every turn: she deciphers, kicks board, slams hatch—no luck rescues her. Cost is present (chain galls, lost months, plush avalanche bruises) but not irreversible; she exits lightly scathed rather than bearing a persistent handicap. Still, the tightening is clean under Causal lens and the final image forecloses return to captivity.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—capture the sound of trust breaking—tightens once when he pours his own bottled-night into the spiral, foreclosing the option to keep that memory private. Cost is visible: the same silence now warns others, so he must forever hear his own wound amplified. Escalation is accumulative (density of void layers) rather than causal-reversal, fitting the lyric drive.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—hearing fate—tightens when glyphs bloom under moonbeam, turning theft into warning. One meaningful deepening: jar spill reveals seer truth, narrows options from steal → listen. Cost visible: she flees alone into night, life path rewritten. Agency drives every turn; coincidence only complicates (jar fall). Sufficient for 8+ band; persistent constraint (jar hum) shapes future, not this scene’s tactics, keeping it just below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stake—permanent sanctuary vs. nomadic survival—is declared early and reiterated, but pressure stays at one register: ice retreats, hope swells. No credible tightening or trade-off confronts Elias; the only “cost” is the abstract loss of wandering, never tested by competing demand. The spheres accumulate, yet each success lowers tension rather than narrows options, keeping escalation flat.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaim erased identity—tightens through each causal notch; the gala confession is the irreversible hinge that escalates flight to counter-attack. One meaningful deepening: when shell decodes “fear the deep,” Elara’s vulnerability flips from liability to ordnance. Cost is visible—she still trembles post-victory, proving vulnerability’s price is perpetual, not magically cured. Harlan’s off-stage scream keeps consequence legible without diluting agency.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—navigating endless night—signals early and tightens once: map or perish. Escalation is textural: each summarized silence adds a fold to the darkness, narrowing options until only the fragment remains. Agency is shared oracle/Elara yet cost is visible—star winks out, booklet sheds final gold. No reversal, but deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—origin of thought—signaled in line 1; pressure escalates as each loop forecloses a prior theory, narrowing possibilities. No external antagonist; the conflict is epistemic, intensified by the violin’s decay and overload warnings. Visible price: violin lost, wonder traded for certainty. One meaningful tightening suffices; the sixth–seventh fusion is the decisive compression.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“prove gardens know gardeners before demolition”—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightened when the 2.4 aggregate scan threatens eradication. Agency is accumulative: each polish beat increases visible cost (time, arthritic fingers, public mockery) until the 9.3 emergence forecloses demolition. No coincidences resolve; the final shift is earned by iterative polishing, not luck. Persistent constraint (1.9 orb) shapes every tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prove sideways time—tightens when protocol failure forces her to embed the nexus inside a routine repair, risking exposure. The single reversal: colleagues’ dismissal flips to stunned recall of unlived memories, showing price on their faces. Agency is decisive—she pulls the lever knowing the station will never share linear reality again—so cost is visible and irreversible. Escalation is efficient: one external malfunction → one internal gamble → one cosmic consequence; no loops or coincidences dilute pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—decode Elara’s message—tightens once: water damage reveals the prompter-box clue, narrowing options from “search everywhere” to “go below.” The influx that cracks the foundation raises physical cost in lockstep with emotional stakes. No reversal after that; escalation is linear rather than recursive, sufficient for 700-word scope. Luck (lantern happens to be rusty) complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—can she surface the swallowed truth before another climber dies—intensifies as the berry’s weight grows and the lost cartographer’s fate is revealed. One meaningful tightening: smudging the illustration is the irreversible act that forecloses her former marginal method and makes the cost visible. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens via recurring aurora pulses and internal heaviness rather than causal turns. Cost is felt, but external consequences (next climber’s arrival) remain off-stage, keeping escalation just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—guilt’s weight—signaled early; pressure tightens when radio voices converge on sabotage, narrowing Jax’s options to confess or flee. Protagonist agency drives climax: he grips and turns valve, physically enacting release; cost is the audible snap of absolution beads and the hush of self-exposure. No external antagonist needed; internal conflict escalates via accumulating callers until self-implication peaks. Escalation is one meaningful tightening; coincidence (radio show topic) complicates but does not resolve, satisfying lens.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—reignite Lila’s wonder—faces one tightening: totality’s hush removes all external sound, forcing the duo into wordless communion; the locket transfer then crystallizes risk of fresh loss for both. Cost is legible in Elias’s surrender of relic and Lila’s first fragile speech. No secondary reversals, but the eclipse progression supplies coherent situational pressure without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“collect the stories before the void claims him”—tightens when the tapestry offers a last story that could burn or endure. Escalation is textural: each echo layers grief until displaying the fragment becomes the irreversible act that forecloses escape. The price (permanent dreamlessness) is felt, but the axis anomaly never narrows live options; it’s thematic backdrop, not tactical obstacle. One meaningful deepening satisfies lens; no reversal, but renunciation counts.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake crystallizes: escape stagnation by exposing the smugglers. One tightening beat—embedding film slivers into cookies—narrows options and raises personal risk. Cost is hinted (loss of anonymity) but never felt on-page; applause replaces consequence. Escalation is linear, not recursive, yet sufficient for 800-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—prevent possession—signals early; tension tightens through density, not reversals: each new loop adds mass to silence, slowing the shadow’s tendrils. Agency is ritual, not decisional, but the accumulation forces the entity to recoil, a visible price. Cost is conceptual but legible: Elias drains his palette and voice to zero. A sharper tactile loss (cracked knuckle, blood in the white?) would push this into 8.8+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—transpose private nostalgia into public symphony—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens through density, not reversal: each mapped memory adds timbre until the lake resonates. Cost is felt on the page: trembling body, deepening eye-shadow, final gentle collapse. No antagonist is needed; pressure is the dawn clock and the risk that exhaustion will silence the music. The mirrored horizon deepens rather than complicates, forcing her to conduct before the light completes its rise.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—wholeness versus eternal fragmentation—signalled in para 1 and escalates as each retrace deletes one possible life forever. Agency sits with Elias: he chooses which selves to merge or reject; the “periodically eternal” reset sharpens urgency every seventh heartbeat, tightening options without gimmick. Cost is visible: darkening glow, sweat, and ultimately the surrender of a discrete shadow-self. Pressure plateaus briefly in the mid-labyrinth exposition, keeping it just below the 8.5 tier.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—pierce her own numbness—is signaled in paragraph 4 and escalates through two tightenings: (1) needle repair risks ruining the relic, (2) communal rite risks exposing her failure. Each move raises social-emotional cost; the filament’s silence reflects each listener’s private void, turning personal stake into communal pressure. Agency remains hers: she chooses the backward spin, invites Thorne, orchestrates the night. No coincidence resolves; the final thaw is earned by her orchestration of others’ catharsis.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—preserve data integrity while surviving rogue-zone incursion—tightens when the message reweights her logs as bait. One meaningful deepening: micro-vortices aligning with pigeon paths foreclose the safe-observer role. Cost is conceptual but legible: she accepts isolation and imminent danger by withholding the report.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—will he surrender to scent-induced grief?—signaled in paragraph 2. Escalation: scarf barrier→vial uncork→UV reveal→plant floods air→he inhales: each step narrows exit until choice becomes inevitable. Cost legible: knees buckle, chest crushed, sobs rack. No external antagonist needed; internal conflict suffices. Tension tightens once, decisively; meets short-form threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaim audible beauty from the hush—signaled in paragraph 2 and escalates as each offered fragment tightens the communal need. The meaningful turn is Lir’s decision to spend his own unfinished memory; this risks the silence returning if the ritual fails, a felt trade-off. Pressure accumulates: hush “thickens,” flames shrink, listeners wait. Agency remains his throughout; coincidence is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—“will counterfeit calm truly replace grief?”—tightens once: petal’s static test → absorption → darkening forecloses raw grief. Cost is visible (petal’s color shift, Mira’s luminous stillness) and persistent (Elias carries residue). Agency is Elias’s micro-choices of calibration; no coincidence. Meets 8.5 band: price charges final image under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—will silent benefactors stay silent?—is declared early but materializes only as mutual congratulation, not jeopardy. Pressure plateaus once identities are swapped; no option is foreclosed, no price paid on-page. Coincidence drives the reveal (same wreck, same donor), yet the lens allows it; still, it resolves rather than complicates. A single micro-turn occurs—Mira agrees to meet publicly—but stakes neither deepen nor narrow.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“to graft herself onto community”—is declared in paragraph 3 and escalates through each tag migration, tightening the group’s web. Mid-story, Elara’s solitude is tested when laughter emerges “rare, laced with ache,” a micro-turn that forecloses retreat. Final cost is visible: her private satchel of reeds becomes a public canopy, a material forfeiture that seals belonging. Pressure is coherent but one-step; no higher-stakes reversal threatens the commune, keeping it just shy of 8+ brilliance.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—retrieve/reason Elowyn—signaled in second paragraph and tightens when each dovetail cut narrows possibility to one: pursue via math. No antagonist needed; pressure is epistemic. Escalation is accumulative: each chip mapped = density rise; orchard’s hum = visible response. Cost paid: pouch empty, glass eyes forever lost to stone, hope re-priced.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—visibility versus safety—tightens once: the tape find forces the choice to cache the relic and risk exposure. Escalation is causal, not repetitive: each step (find → cache → whispered playback → emergence) narrows retreat options. No off-stage luck; coincidence (tape’s presence) complicates, does not resolve. Price paid on-page: anonymity foreclosed when he steps into her flashlight beam, a cost foreshadowed by the compass needle quivering toward the tape’s magnetism.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—knowledge via self-experiment—tightens exactly once: sip → irreversible growth, foreclosing human future. Cost is legible on the page: legs root, torso bark-over, memories of wife fragment. Agency remains his even as options collapse; no outside rescue. Storm season pressure mirrors internal escalation, satisfying causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“magnify everyday magic”—is voiced early and tested by the cave’s offer. Escalation is one-step but decisive: the forces’ demand narrows Elara’s options to surrender or die; she pays with bodily agony. Thorne’s agency is passive, yet the final transfer keeps the cost legible. No coincidence resolves; the cave’s rule simply finds a host.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.7)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—reach the fortress—tightens with each punched ticket that forecloses retreat; the final gate demands the last ticket, visible cost. Pressure escalates via accretion of spectral revelations, but no live option is ever truly risked; the path feels pre-channelled rather than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake: transform private grief into shared reflection. Pressure tightens once: tile unlocks mother’s memories, forcing Elara to act—transcription forecloses her detached stance. Cost is conceptual (loss of skepticism) rather than visceral, sufficient for lyric mode but keeps score sub-8.5. No secondary reversals, yet whale chorus + human murmurs at close show visible payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“what happens after goodbye to eternity?”—is signaled early and sharpened by each remembered farewell. One meaningful tightening: at the crystal spire he chooses to ignite convergence, trading stasis for unknown fragmentation; the price is legible (“laughing softly into the chaos”). Escalation is accumulative/lyric: mutiny layers build like auroral fire until space itself rends. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, fitting the cosmic scale, though a tangible forfeiture (loss of sanctuary, bodily coherence) would have deepened punch.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—political asylum—announced early and narrows to a single night-time breach. Escalation is causal under the lens: each patrol loop tightens the window, ink insight liquefies prior rigidity, timing equation forces precise action. No external reversals needed; knowledge gain is sufficient tightening. Price is conceptual—Eli trades ethical rigidity for passage; visible but could be more visceral. Agency remains protagonist-driven; math, not luck, opens the door.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of “fair trade” emerges from concrete mechanics—equations, patrol intervals, ink that dissolves moral absolutes—rather than thesis statement. Final image reframes father’s swindle legacy as balanced equation: risk traded for freedom at the cost of Eli’s ethical ossification. Subtext in gesture (twisting the stopper, shoulder driving the bar) carries moral ambiguity without sermon. Resonant reconfiguration achieved; slight deduction for final-line commentary on “balanced truth” that edges toward echo.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—can Thorne keep inventing safe pasts to outrun the town’s real annihilation—is signaled in line 5. Escalation arrives when the lamp hum spews gunpowder alongside papyrus, forcing him to admit the actual frost-night; this deepening reweights his task from escapism to resurrection. Cost is visible: the notebook’s pages warp under truthful ink, his workshop light “dies,” and the town’s return is purchased by his own archival extinction. Agency is present yet quiet—renunciation rather than battle—fitting the 600-word lyric scale.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaim erased self—remains coherent; each fragment tightens the texture but does not foreclose an alternative path or demand a trade-off. Escalation is accretive, not risky; the final discovery is luck-borne, not agency-driven. Cost is conceptual (knowledge of sabotage) rather than a tangible loss paid on-page, keeping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“decode the universal riddle”—is repeated but abstract; pressure concretizes when each retelling dissolves a prior certainty. Escalation is textural: density of voices tightens the moral cost of manufacture. No visible external price (no broken string, no blood), so 8.8 gate remains shut. The irreversible silence of the shell supplies a conceptual cost, satisfying minimal legibility under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—save the carnival from privatization—is signaled early and tightens through each graffiti cipher that forecloses legal protest. The binary-pulse mask mural embodies visible price: stall-owners risk eviction by swapping deeds. Escalation is accumulative: each decoded wall raises communal exposure, narrowing Elara’s safe moves until the hull-tag leaves her literally exposed on open water.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—transmit existence of the last grain before oxygen expires—tightens with each chemical timer. The middle beat (first flare seen by base) meaningfully narrows options: rescue is possible, yet dawn still demands he outlast alone. Cost is visible on-page: fogged visor, flickering gauge, numb fingers uncapping vials.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—repair before anchor lifts—tightens through sensory cadence: each clank shortens options. The deepening occurs when Elias deciphers erratic hums, converting data into last-minute patch alignment; escalation is textural, not causal-chain, but pressure is legible. Cost is the sacrificed voyage. Could edge higher with one visibleresource loss (apprentice fatigue, polymer shortage) but remains within band.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reach the singular source—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightened twice: once by the vellum warning, once when the glass starburst locks coordinates. Each tightening forfeits alternative routes; the cost is the outpost’s safety and the guardian unknown ahead. Escalation is accumulative: pattern density increases rather than causal reversals. Coincidence (condensation mimicry) complicates but does not resolve; agency remains Harlan’s to march. Visible price: he abandons the known map-margin for an unmarked ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stakes are announced early—restore balance or Perivale collapses—but the only tightening is incremental visual restoration; Elias faces no resistance, resource limit, or emotional trade-off. Escalation is therefore decorative, not consequential; the “before the collapse” clock never audibly advances to pressure tactics. Agency is present but frictionless, keeping pressure shy of 8-band intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—capture silence orb before air runs out—broadcast by blinking gauge and reiterated alarm; each unsnarling beat shortens clock. Escalation is density-driven: water violence increases per knot undone, silence “thickens into harnessable essence,” a legible because-therefore under Accumulative lens. Visible price paid: critical alarm, then “gauge hit critical,” foreclosing ascent option. Agency is steady micro-interventions; no external antagonist, but coincidence absent, satisfying lens guardrails.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—redeem “boy who cried wolf” lineage via achieved hush—is signaled early; pressure tightens each time Elias confesses into the lattice to bind one more shadow, foreclosing retreat. Stakes remain abstract (familial honor) until discovered bodies would convert hush to public accusation; the abstract quality limits visceral cost during middle beats. Agency is steady—he chooses each poisoning, each confession, the final shedding of shade chorus—yet danger feels environmental (guards) more than personal. One credible loss: the father’s spirit stabilizes then dissolves, visualizing Elias’s forfeiture of paternal approval forever.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—will Elias accept lethal transcendence to reunite?—is signaled with first pear ingestion. Escalation is textural: each cameo tightens the euphoric poison’s grip and peels another life-layer, narrowing his worldly options. Visible price—bodily collapse, spectral kiss—alters tactics: by final cameo he no longer fears death but welcomes it. The tightening is single but meaningful under Accumulative lens; no reversal is required.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—replace shattered precedent with fluid grace—signals early and tightens when she violates the low-tide ban. Agency is accumulative-textural: each stitch deepens pattern density rather than forcing a causal fork. Cost is present but generalized (“ruin reverenced”); no single tool or stamina loss alters later tactics. Escalation is a cadence shift: petroglyphs brighten, walls hum, dawn arrives—stakes reweighted through sensory intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—restore personal faith—is signaled early; pressure accumulates through artifact finds, not narrowing options. No reversal or resource loss complicates tactics; risk is spiritual and static. The sundial’s function points the way, but choosing to follow is deferred beyond the text, so cost is prospective, not paid. Escalation is atmospheric deepening rather than a crucible that forecloses paths.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“get the letter out unseen”—tightens once: chalking the cipher in full view of awakening pedestrians and overhead drones. Cost is legible: every stroke risks exposure; the heart she adds is a gamble she can’t afford to lose. Escalation is textural: density of surveillance imagery (drones, iris-scans, synthetic pigeons) rises while her tool remains a child’s toy. No reversal, but the final heart reframes the stake from pure escape to sacrificial signature.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: to turn ciphered despair into lifeline—signaled early. One meaningful deepening: decryption moves from generic fear to the literal tourniquet scar, tightening options. Cost is the tear-graft and the vow to carry another’s grief. No coincidence; escalation is her escalating intimacy with Kael’s code.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—recover personal joy—tightens when曝光 risks diluting memory into public spectacle; visible price is surrender of private nostalgia to communal network. One meaningful intensification: fresco exposure turns private quest into shared haunting. No external antagonist, but fog + network pressure suffice. Agency remains hers; coincidence absent. Cost legible in final “etched in her soul’s fresco”—private joy now communal beacon. Sufficient for 8-band; would need sharper tactical trade-off for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—Lena’s certainty vs. wonder—tightens when the nickel’s reflection removes her option to dismiss. Agency is hers: she stays, steps closer, forfeits prior identity. Cost is felt (her gasp, softened eyes) though not as sharp as the garden’s full sonic price could have shown.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—keep the defiant spark untaxed—is signaled early and escalates when drones detect the kale glyphs, forcing Elias to risk the greenhouse infiltration. The warp-fruit harvest narrows options: he can’t retreat; seeds must be scattered now while beetles buy seconds. Cost is visible—greenhouse breached, Bureau shock troops incoming—yet the beat feels rushed; we don’t fully feel the bodily risk of arrest. Sufficient tightening for 700-word scope, but a hair more jeopardy on the page would clinch 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake is legible by line 3: endless insomnia versus coveted sleep. Escalation is textural—each refrain of “shyly unstoppable” and “blossom armistice” layers urgency until the galaxies physically merge with shell. Agency resides in the ensconce act; no outside coincidence intervenes. Price is the poet’s forfeiture of vigilance, but because the loss is welcomed, the on-page pain-cost feels milder than the causal setup promises; hence capped below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserve names before they vanish—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens each time the tube’s crack widens. One meaningful escalation per wing: absorption of nomad names, then revelers, then melancholics, finally “Lirien” ghost-name—each step paid with escalating tube damage. Agency remains hers; winds complicate but never solve. Final cost: tool destroyed, task complete but irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“restore trust before paths diverge”—is signaled early and tightened by each vow; the final symphony makes the cost audible. Escalation is accumulative: knot-by-knot loosening raises spectral murmurs and Thorne’s skepticism, not external peril. Agency remains Elara’s; no coincidence resolves. Price is felt: the ink’s glow dims and she carries a future-silence talisman.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—flood control vs. sacred relic—tightens when tremors threaten aquifers; one decisive deepening occurs at the decoded parchment. Escalation is accumulative: each volcanic exhale layers urgency. Cost is legible: ancestral pact nearly drowned the site. Agency is Elias’s redesign, but the clans’ instant consensus softens the price.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—preserve the “echo” against erasure—ramifies from forged meteorite myth to shared human song. Tightening occurs when revelation of true letters annihilates Elias’s leverage, forcing a public gamble on naked honesty. Cost is visible: the chip’s hum drops to “pure, human echoes,” relinquishing cosmic grandeur for mortal duet. Agency stays with Elias: he maps, confesses, balances; Lila’s forgiveness is response, not deus ex.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve wonder by respecting distance—tightens each time a new code surface (grain, logbook, compass) shows the same spiral warning. The protagonist’s agency is the incremental decoding; each intuition forecloses simpler solutions (charge straight in, ignore the log). Cost is legible: she almost loses the light when twisting the chair, and the final crossing is shadowed by the log’s warning. One meaningful deepening suffices for 800-word frame; no multiple reversals required.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“break monotony or stay drowned”—is signaled early. Escalation is a single tightening: will the bishop reach Elara? Jasper’s wind-calculation scene embodies agency under pressure. Cost is conceptual but legible: Jasper abdicates recognition, Elara risks future disappointment. No secondary reversals, but one meaningful turn suffices for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—deliver verse to mortal skin—tightens when anchoring nullifies mobility; gap-reading offers one escalating micro-turn that rewrites cosmic syntax rather than external opposition. Cost is visible: dissolving wings and permanent terrestrial anchor convert exile into irreversible choice. Agency remains internal/decisional under Accumulative lens, sufficient for 600-word scope. Pressure stays coherent but single-threaded; no second reversal beyond anchor release.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—mend the invisible fractures before the northern tempest—signals early and tightens through each ripple revelation. One meaningful deepening: the lighthouse pane crack becomes metaphor for communal breach, narrowing his options to communal healer rather than passive artisan. Cost is felt: he accepts responsibility and pockets the shard, abandoning pure observer stance. Agency is his stone-throw and interpretive act; coincidence never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are declared early—translate personal pain into universal—but the on-page test is only Lena’s tears quieting; no live option narrows for Elias. Pressure rises once: sob from brush shifts Elias from solitude to mentorship. No credible loss of gear, time, or stamina; box leaves his pocket but costs him nothing. Vow is emotional lift, not tactical impediment—escalation emotional but static.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.1)
    One dominant stake—hope’s reinvention—tightens via each balloon launch; the third, “grand trial balloon” forecloses the sterile-logic timeline and costs her the safe solitude of the grotto, a visible price that alters her stance and is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—ancestral guilt versus confession—tightens once: the film negative reveals engineered quakes, foreclosing denial. Cost is conceptual (moral burden made undeniable) rather than tactical; no tool or stamina loss alters next moves. Escalation is singular but sufficient under Accumulative lens; pressure peaks at the glimpse, not after.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—annual renewal of existence—peaks when final lullaby threads the last heartbeat. Escalation is textural: each borrowed pulse visibly brightens her form and the mirrors’ resistance softens. One meaningful tightening: mirrors tremble, then yield, foreclosing return to rigid truth. Cost is felt in the children’s unwitting donation and her ephemeral survival; both are on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will the accord stick or will she repeat her ancient failure—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when she names each delegate’s private wound. The meaningful turn is her decision to bleed, which forecloses any future negotiation for her; the price is visible, felt, and irreversible. Pressure is causal: each signature shrinks the possible return to war. No coincidence; even the stars’ pause is framed as ritual consequence, not deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can the architect of extinction purchase private absolution—tightens once: the egg either hatches or becomes tomb, and Elias’s single visible choice forecloses both manipulation and witness. Escalation is accretive: each sentence layers salt, silence, and self-recognition until the storm forces the final stake (“rain to heal or drown”). Cost is legible in the physical act—egg surrendered to seep he cannot command—and in the emotional forfeiture of ever announcing the gesture. No coincidence; drought-born map literally drives him to his knees.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—defy conformity’s lullaby—is signaled early; pressure escalates by density (echoes harvested) rather than causal turns. One visible cost: citizens’ smiles falter, but the price to Elara herself is only implied. Agency is present—she lunges at the final knot—but the tightening is atmospheric, not option-narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—ethical storytelling vs. weaponized mockery—tightens when a line wounds a grieving patron, forcing the choice to abandon subversion. Reversal of the stick is the single meaningful turn; options narrow from bar pulpits to campfire honesty. Cost is legible: he forfeits nightly adrenaline and the identity built on it. Escalation is efficient but single-cycle; no deepening pressure after midpoint keeps it below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—signal the overlooked before extinction—arrives early and tightens through each tower’s height and fragility. No external antagonist; pressure is entropic wind + dwindling monarchs. Escalation is cadence-based: every new hitch raises the chance of total unravel, visible in the quiver of the fourth tower. Price paid: she forfeits permanence, accepting that the last broadcast is also the last structure.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserve fading names—faces twin antagonists: ice entropy and self-blame. Escalation is accumulative: each re-braid tightens possibility of total auroral fade, while guilt thaws into urgency. One decisive deepening: final cinch makes retreat impossible; aurora surges or is lost. Cost is visible—rope forever altered, Elara tear-scarred, exile prolonged by new burden—so pressure reweights her future options.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—will Elara pierce the fog of her eternal present?—is signaled early. Tightening occurs when she foresees herself sealing others inside; the option to refuse is foreclosed by her own prior vision. Cost is visible: she accepts responsibility for future loops. Agency is interior but decisive; the transcendence is irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—covenant with the Unknown—is signaled early and tightens when schematics reveal the rift coordinates; the palace tremor literalizes cost. Escalation is accumulative: each overlay of star-chart onto tile deepens cosmic pressure rather than external threat. One meaningful turn at 75% when hologram projects; options narrow to kneel or retreat. Agency is attention/renunciation—he forfeits oil and regimes alike.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—Thorne must surrender resentment or stay trapped—is signaled in the second paragraph and tightens with each skipped tooth. One meaningful deepening: the lullaby memory collapses his armor, foreclosing violence forever; cost is the identity he loses in that breath. No false escalation; every warp is tied to his interior flare-up. Agency stays with Elias’s relentless winding and Thorne’s final exhalation—no coincidence, only cellular causality.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—recover or relinquish the dream—is signaled early; pressure tightens through each breath-cycle that pulls the apparition nearer, narrowing options from search → build → merge. Agency is continuous: every mirror placement and timed exhale is an irreversible tactical choice that spends physical stamina and rational credibility. Visible price—frost-numb fingers, cracked instrument, surrendered skepticism—accumulates and is felt in the final image. No coincidence resolves; the last boundary dissolves because he keeps paying breath by breath.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can broken vows be mended before visions die—tightens when quartz eyes across valleys fail, turning abstract breach into bodily urgency. The meaningful turn comes when Lila’s feisty shove saves Elias: her trait, once escape fuel, now forecloses the option of leaving again, price paid in shoulder-impact and beam-scar. Cost is visible; escalation causal; one beat short of 9.0 only because the external threat (storm) is helper, not driver.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: seize forbidden knowledge without unraveling self. Escalation is textural: each orchard blossom and bathroom drip adds density to the paradox. Midpoint tightening—“engrave your query”—forces creative act with visible risk. Cost is legible but mild: a single warmed shell and a smiling acceptance; stronger physical or social price would sharpen 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—“reach the Library or timelines devour”—is signaled early. Pressure escalates artifactually: each rescue yields a map fragment, narrowing the path. Yet Elara’s personal stakes never rise; she risks no loss, exhaustion, or moral trade-off, so the tightening is intellectual, not felt. The final beat is a door opening, not a choice that costs her anything, keeping escalation moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—access to the garden—remains steady, but pressure is atmospheric, not tactical: fog thickens, memories blur, yet no option is foreclosed or resource depleted. Escalation is poetic layering (each thread-story summons phantom petals) rather than a narrowing of choices; the final crossing costs nothing Elara visiblyValues. A single felt forfeiture—burned fingertips, a memory forever lost—would have pushed this into high band.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—restore temporal order vs. risk of being swallowed by void—arrives late, signaled only once the door appears. Escalation is present but gentle: each artifact discovered narrows the solution path from observation → handling → re-weaving, yet no credible loss (time, safety, social credit) is dramatized. The rope-reconfiguration turn is agency-driven and visually specific, but because Elara never fears failure, the cost feels notional. Still, one meaningful tightening occurs: the braid merge is irreversible, foreclosing further study of the chamber, satisfying the 600-word minimum.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“reclaim core harmony”—signaled early; tightening occurs when spiral node forces single placement decision. Cost visible: eternal vigilance accepted in final line. Pressure coherent under Accumulative lens: discordant vibrations intensify until bloom muffles them. No live option foreclosed beyond personal cost, keeping it from top band.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“do coincidences carry meaning?”—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens through each star alignment that mirrors her life markers. Escalation is textural: density of star-path imagery increases until the alignment clears the storm, forcing her stance crystallization. Cost is legible: she trades anonymity for beacon exposure, solitude for guardianship. No reversal beyond the single decisive ignition; sufficient for 600-word accumulative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: will collective memory outlive personal erasure? Escalation is textural—each measured shadow shortens or forks, tightening the threat of oblivion. Agency is attention/ endurance; cost is the dread she swallows with every impossible extension. No reversal, but deepening pattern reweights stakes credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stake—“defy the gravity of hopelessness”—tightens when the mosaic note offers a concrete tactical path; the rocket’s launch forecloses the old wandering life, price legible in the spent scaffold claimed by vines.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—Mira’s terror of transition—tightens when the cicada forecloses retreat: the vision proves leaving is irreversible molting, not optional escape. Escalation is textural: each sensory layer (grit, silk, nacre) adds density until the stake is reweighted. Agency remains Elaron’s; Mira’s yes/no moment happens off-page, so the price is felt but not visibly paid by her hand, capping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: hoard silences vs. impending bunker return. Hourglass of inversion tightens time; noise-weaver’s intrusion is live antagonistic pressure that threatens archive. Escalation: sideways gravity → scarce golden sprout → claustrophobic entrapment → theft risk; each step forecloses retreat. Cost: swallowed claustrophobia, doll’s fragile core now sole vessel—loss of either = silence collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—can silence be taught?—is signaled early and deepens when the children’s noise spikes the crystals. One meaningful tightening: the catalyst drop that turns sound into foam, foreclosing the option to keep scolding. Cost is mostly relational (Mira’s tears, children’s softened voices) rather than personal to Elias, capping escalation just below 8+. Agency is decision-based, fitting accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—claim or refuse the throne—tightens exactly once, at the summit vision where stewardship replaces conquest; the price is the forfeiture of absolute power. Corporate drones complicate but do not resolve, satisfying coincidence rules. Sunrise acts as a live clock that forces the final micro-choice under the skylight, cost fully legible.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—threshold integrity—signaled early; one meaningful tightening as ring warms and scars ignite. Escalation is imagistic, not causal: veil thins nightly, ring arrives, keeper burns it; agency is ritualized rather than adaptive. Cost is conceptual (her gasp) not tactical; no resource lost or option foreclosed for keeper. Sufficient for short-form Accumulative arc but lacks visceral price.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes begin abstract (“quantum promise”) but tighten when the bolt engages and the chamber’s pressure becomes viscerally punitive—every prior victim’s loss materializes as force. One meaningful escalation: twist bolt → diamonds erupt → foreclose hoarding. Cost is shown (shared diamonds, loops averted), though the turn is compressed into two sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—dynasty’s guilt vs. Elias’s need to end it—tightens when the violin overtones reveal forgery and murder. The price is legible: he forfeits identity and heritage in the hearth, a felt loss that reconfigures his future to exile.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—seize possibility before regret—signalled in paragraph one and tightened exactly once: the unsnap irrevocably binds his thread to the marionettes, trading autonomous silence for external voice. Accumulative pressure escalates through sensory density (molten-glass air, fracturing stars) rather than causal reversals; cost is visible when vapors crystallize his future into unasked-for orbs. No antagonist needed; coincidence complicates but does not resolve. Price paid on-page: spectral co-ownership of his narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—recovering erased acts of kindness—tightens once: the false bottom and letter force Eleanor to decide whether to slip the findings back into anonymity or annotate the file, thereby accepting ongoing, unpaid labor. Escalation is textural: dust pattern → seam → relic → letter; each increment densifies the moral weight of her original mission. Cost is visible on-page: she pockets the obligation to seek Lila with no promise of success. Agency is present (she re-files with new annotations, polishes button), not passive discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—smuggle truth past engineered apathy—is signaled early and tightens when rally collapses. The puddle-map discovery is a micro-turn that narrows option to solo lagoon trip; key-turn in booth is decisive act that irreversibly exposes truth at personal cost. Escalation is causal: because cell shattered, Elias must act alone; because map appeared, he finds cache; because cache opens, broadcast launches. Price legible—he seals booth knowing drones will hunt him—satisfies cost test under 800-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—silence the prophecy—signals in paragraph 2 and tightens through each lengthened pause that devours murmurs. One meaningful deepening suffices: spiral of whispers coalesces, then is eroded by his inverted whisper; cost is breath, nostalgia, and the fragile permanence he admits at end. Agency is renunciation/attention rather than brute victory; option to fully eradicate prophecy remains foreclosed. Coincidence complicates nothing; pressure grows under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“decode leaves to mend the arbor’s fading heart”—is signaled in para 2 and tightens when the sylph’s script demands a descent into ash. Escalation is accretive: each new shrine births a transformed that enlarges the possible coalition, reweighting the task from lone sorter to army. Cost is conceptual but legible: the arbor’s fate is now literally in Lir’s falling hands as he steps off the edge. No visible forfeiture of personal safety keeps the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—will she extract the mercy equation before forest or memory consumes her—tightens through each trauma echo, narrowing tactical options from full cognitive search to body-only abacus. Agency is chiefly endurance/attention rather than external action; nevertheless, cost is visible: each recollection spikes tachycardia and joint subluxation, altering her physical capacity to proceed. Escalation is accumulative/textural: pattern density (UV imagery, skeletal math) intensifies until bark becomes writing surface; shift at “Integral of pain over time” crystallizes knowledge and forces captors’ panic, making next beat oblivion. Final restraint—rising “rooted yet free”—acknowledges persistent danger without external rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“what ceilings hide” vs. the weightless burden of ghosts—tightens once when the dust anomalies force Theo to pry the mainspring, narrowing options from mere observation to physical breach. Cost is visible: the ghosts dissolve, taking with them Theo’s accustomed (if eerie) companionship, a felt price on the final beat. No reversal beyond the single escalation, but that deepening is meaningful and protagonist-driven. Coincidence is absent; escalation is pure agency under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—“compress eternity into a moment”—is declared early and escalates through each frost rereading. The rupture act narrows options to one: library death for personal transcendence. Cost is legible in prismatic rain and the swallowed remnants; no off-stage rescue. One beat short of 9+ only because the price is borne by setting, not Elias’s body, softening visceral punch.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single dominant stake—redeem lost cause by weaponizing artifact—tightens when Elias realizes possession is impossible and ups the ante to narrative sabotage. One meaningful turn: instead of keeping shard, he destroys interpretive certainty, escalating stakes from personal trophy to collective ideological seeding. Cost is legible: alarms, pursuit, scholarly enmity, permanent loss of scholarly voice. Could use one earlier tactical loss to sharpen trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.5)
    Single dominant stake: restore light/daughter. Pressure is atmospheric—rust creep, twilight window—not protagonist-driven; no narrowing of options or trade-off is dramatized. Escalation is lyrical density (bells → symphony) rather than causal tightening. Cost is paid by antagonist (midnight recoils), not by Elias, so agency feels ornamental; still, the visible price (rust defeated, dawn achieved) is on-page and under the inferred Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“find where explanations fail”—is signaled early and tightens with each hinge: first vial of ancient essence, then revelation of thought-moving water, final offer of eternal guardianship. Each deepening narrows her options from curiosity → commitment → irreversible communion. Cost is conceptual but legible: she forfeits explanatory sanity and former life. Agency is hers at every latch; no coincidence rescues or dooms her.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—survival + artistic re-visioning—tightens when slide projections foreclose isolation; agency is present (carving, fire-lighting). Cost is conceptual (ancestral load) more than visceral; escalation is lyrical deepening, not sharper trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“why flowers bloom at night”—is signaled in line 4 and tightens through each glass layer discovered. One visible price: last-snow mud ruins her boots, yet she keeps scraping, narrowing options to nocturnal art only. The deepening pattern (postcard → glass → mural) reweights the stake from curiosity to vocation. No reversal is needed; accumulative pressure suffices under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—recover censored truth—tightens when ghosts demand proof; the debris-oath sequence visibly narrows options and links failure to eternal entrapment. Escalation is situational-pressure rather than causal domino, but the single deepening is meaningful and paid for with spectral recognition. Cost is legible; lacking a second reversal keeps it shy of 8-plus threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—civilization rebirth via memory-forge—signals in line 3 and tightens through each materialization: lanterns, streets, citizens. Every escalation is protagonist-driven; no coincidence resolves. Cost is visceral: sweat, mental overload, refusal of rest. The final tightening occurs when the bottle cools—he must now live inside the world he willed, foreclosing retreat. This persistent constraint (bottle intact) charges the image and meets high-band cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—lonely recorder vs. emotional participant—tightens when the oracle forecasts the orchard’s fog-devour, forcing Elias to choose immersion over safe annotation. Cost is legible: he forfeits the scribe’s immunity and steps into the feelings he once catalogued. Agency is present; the prophecy is triggered by his own illicit memory-stir. Slight dip from 9.0 because the external world (city, fog) does not visibly adapt to his choice within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—prevent snap-back of borrowed time—tightens when the vortex shrinks; each seed placed narrows options, forcing the final hand-plunge that stabilizes the maw. Cost is visible: the atrium’s partial thaw externalizes the energy debit she’s assumed. Agency is hers alone; no off-stage rescue. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length; no reversals required. Luck (starlight convergence) complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single dominant stake—warn villages vs preserve sonic hush—signaled early. Pressure tightens at midnight barometer drop; choice forecloses siren path with social cost (villages might sleep through bell). Escalation is one meaningful deepening rather than causal chain; sufficient for Accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual (paradigm shift) more than visceral; no tangible loss (limb, job, relationship) appears on page, keeping it below 8.0 band.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—finding strength in vulnerability—tightens through star-empathy exercise; each traced meteor forecloses denial of fragility. Pressure accumulates by lyrical density, not external jeopardy. Cadence shift at colossal final star deepens cost. No concrete price (fatigue, glass fracture, station risk) materializes, holding score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: preserve silence to earn oasis revival; signaled in paragraph 4. Pressure tightens when ghosts entwine vines on glass—each palm press forecloses refusal. Agency is renunciation: he accepts perpetual vigil; cost is deeper isolation. No antagonist, no reversal, but the pattern intensifies under Accumulative/Textural lens—sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single dominant stake—feel time’s texture before borrowed heart expires—tightens when capsule breach freezes the shard, trading grief-abrasion for eternal stasis; that irrevocable swap is the visible price. Escalation driven by Elias’s agency: he alone pries lid, presses shard to chest, then transmits new listing; each act narrows future from seeker to supplier. No coincidence; garage-sale replies arrive via network he seeded. Mid-scene deepening occurs at “suddenly timeless” beat, shifting knowledge = irreversible; from here, selling fragments is the only path left.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—beauty via imperfection—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens when the snap forces Elias to test his thesis in real time. The reversal is his agency: he chooses to mend publicly with shoreline grass and feather, narrowing options from pristine poet to scarred tinker. Cost is visible—paper forever crinkled, string permanently shorter—altering future tactics. Escalation is single-cycle but sufficient for 700-word scope; no external antagonist needed.</answer>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>“Woven dawns” emerges as an organic paradox: each sunrise is both broken and whole, a theme proved by the kite’s final low wobble rather than lectured. Subtext resides in object handling—feather quill, grass twine, crinkled rice paper—so insight stays implicit. The ending image (kite trailing like a comet) re-prices the concept without moralizing. Minor slack: the children’s murmurs could have carried social counterpoint, but their silence keeps the lens interior, fitting Elias’s solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—restore interspecies respect—is signaled early but remains abstract; no concrete opposition (axe-wielders, sceptics) appears to test it. Escalation is textural: each copper coil adds luminous density, not narrowing options. Protagonist agency is iterative, not decisively tested; no reversal or trade-off beyond fatigue. Cost is atmospheric (gut pain, breath) but does not alter tactic; tension accumulates without tightening knot.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—decode alien homecoming chemistry—tightens when converging footprints force physical rendezvous and shared activation of the relic chamber. One meaningful escalation: illicit solo scan → academy exile → must trust rival pilgrims to complete synthesis, narrowing her options from lone genius to collaborative apostate. Cost legible: forfeited tenure, now “new orbits of understanding” without safety net. Coincidence (simultaneous arrival) complicates rather than resolves, intensifying social risk.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reclaim battlefield with garden—signaled in first third. Tightening occurs when spectral tern’s call narrows scatter to “north, where blood pooled deepest,” foreclosing random dispersal; Thorne’s compliance costs him last seed stock. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens: each seabird directive adds density, nutrients, luminescence. Cost is visible—pods gone, future garden unprotected—yet lacks a second reversal, keeping score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—translate distance into closeness—threads every beat; escalation is steady (leaf → riddle → trek → reunion). The tightening moment is the rift-edge recognition: live option of finding Mira forecloses solitary death-tracking. Cost is present but abstract (shared hauntedness); no concrete tactical loss is dramatized, keeping pressure heartfelt yet not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—map or die in isolation—tightens when the compass twitch reframes the station from prison to gateway; one meaningful escalation suffices. Agency is continuous: she sketches, interprets, then leaps; the cost (eternal exile) is visible on the page at the jump. No external coincidence rescues her; the wormhole was always there, masked by the same field that trapped her, so revelation not luck drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single dominant stake—heal the sky—tightens when corrupted queen writhes and alarms stir; option space narrows to smash-or-fail. Cost is present but light: a psychic vision and a shattered queen; no lasting personal price is dramatized. Agency remains thief-driven; coincidence eschewed. Sufficient tightening for length, yet lacks a visceral trade-off to reach high band.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—sever the penumbra to chronicle the overlooked—tightens once: the spelled words progressively pin the shadow until it is absorbed by the chessmen; the cost is conceptual but legible (he trades his own partial self for archival purity), satisfying the single deepening required at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—“map the contours of what was lost”—tightens when each glyph seeded forecloses nostalgia and demands inner thunder. Agency is continual: every stroke is a conscious trade of pain for phoneme. The deepening is the reversal of loss itself: home relocates into labyrinth rather than outside it. Cost is cumulative insomnia and irreversible perceptual shift—visible in her “forever changed” eyes.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—is signaled in line 3 (“weight of that betrayal”). Escalation is woven: each decoded thread tightens the noose of memory until the queen-sacrifice fork reenacts the original moral crash. The visible price is the pawn’s transformation; once promoted, the object can never revert, foreclosing the fantasy that the past can stay unplayed. Agency is strictly Elias; coincidence is absent. One tightening suffices for 700-word scope, and it lands with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“will tomorrow’s ritual silence every grievance?”—tightens with each added stanza until the only remaining option is to break the ritual itself. Visible price: elder spies witness, dawn marks her for exile or worse; youths carry incriminating verses in their throats. Agency is cumulative/textural: each poem adds refractive shards until the elders’ single truth diffracts beyond repair; no coincidence, only mounting resonance. Last beat narrows options to zero: she cannot unsing the canyon, can only await consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“conjure meaning from oblivion”—is signaled early and tightens with each pockmark: fail to narrate = drown. Agency is pure endurance under breath-clock; each scar-match costs remaining air, foreclosing retreat. Fifth pockmark crater drains last breath, crystallizing stance before resurrection. Cost is visceral (burning lungs, acid lips) and persistent (glowing scars). No external coincidence; pressure is coherent situational vise.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—finish the shell or remain imprisoned by nostalgia—is signaled in paragraph two. Escalation is single but meaningful: the mirror crack forces the deferred act, the wrong turn intensifies physical jeopardy, and the oasis provides the only conditions (light, water, isolation) to complete the shell. Protagonist agency drives every beat; coincidence complicates but does not resolve. Cost is legible: the hologram’s extinction proves the memory cannot be revisited at will, narrowing future options to living without the illusion.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“prove whispers travel farther than shouts”—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens once when Elias uncorks the vial, foreclosing the horn option. Pressure is lyrical rather than causal; the scent-thread is an externalized coincidence that complicates, not resolves, but the stance crystallization (Elias kneeling, recorking) carries visible emotional cost. No secondary reversals, yet the single deepening sufficies for length. Cost is felt, not logistical.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—call the scattered home—signals early and tightens with each lunar phase. Mid-story deepening occurs when the censer’s wild spin under gibbous moon forces Elias to twist left coils, visibly raising failure risk. Final act is his decision to strike flint; cost is palpable—flames lick his scarred hands, signal wails into unknown. Escalation is causal, single-thread, and sufficient for 700-word span.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—gaining permission to lie—signals early; pressure escalates as each storm night strips more trust, forcing the occlusion decision. The insertion sequence is the decisive tightening: it narrows Elias’s moral options to mediated half-truths, price paid in split vision and self-doubt. Agency remains causal throughout; storms complicate but do not resolve. Cost is visible on-page: “Words now bent to his will” paired with the ache of “pain bloomed, fractured and exquisite.”

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: decode the stranger’s gesture or remain locked in solipsistic grief. Escalation is textural—each surfacing borrowed memory thickens emotional density until the final pinning narrows Elias’s options to perpetual guardianship. Cost is conceptual: he forfeits the possibility of ending his own vigil. No causal antagonist required; pressure is situational isolation amplified by imprints of another man’s dying. One meaningful tightening suffices—from spectator to successor—and lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—honor father’s promise vs. lifelong solitude—tightens with each water-level inch; options narrow to crawl or retreat. Ant-following is active agency that risks flood-death; cost visible in soaked satchel, tremoring knees. Escalation is situational pressure, not multiple reversals, sufficient for 700-word arc. Luck (chip warms) complicates but does not resolve; final choice still renounces comfort zone.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—reclaim her soul from dream-tyranny—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened when she touches the pool: surrender heart or stay hollow. One meaningful turn suffices; the vortex of fireflies is the irreversible narrowing. Cost is legible: she forfeits untainted humanity for “vengeful grace.” No coincidence; every escalation is because/therefore under her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—density of presence—signals early and tightens through color pour → whisper → spiral ignition; each step forecloses retreat. The meaningful deepening is the relational gravity infused by the shared secret; options narrow to “endure this new weight together.” Cost is legible in the curl’s star-heavy pearl and Thorne’s audible breath-catch.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“map the chaos or be swallowed by it”—tightens when the grave vision turns the scroll into an existential invoice. Escalation is accumulative: each recalled self ups the envy-density until the cabin roof literally shatters. Cost is legible: she forfeits the fantasy of reunion with earlier freedoms and accepts perpetual servitude as chronicler. One hairline slip: the plunge-and-glide sequence is slightly abstract; a sensory pinch would cinch 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—exile from guild—signalled in opening paragraph; tightening occurs when crystals sharpen into manacles, forcing completion of the rite. Protagonist agency drives each beat: dip quill → trace sigil → endure pain → shed flakes → weave constellation. Cost is repeatedly legible—flaking skin, aching lungs, permanent glowing threads—so escalation stays visceral. No external antagonist needed; internal/external pressures braid cleanly within the “breath between storms” window.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—deliver apology before chainsaw dawn—signals in para 1 and tightens each beat: every spark risks archival fire, every second risks Theo’s dispersion. Micro-turn at bottle uncork: static jumps from prop to piano, shifting her tactic from plea to conduit. Cost is dramatized—burned lace, powdered glass, scored yellowing folios—altering her next column’s raw material. Escalation is situational-pressure rather than causal twist, but coherent under that lens; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single stake—illusions must be arbitrated toward unity—tightens texturally each time the dictionary flips to a new definition. The “universe’s hiccup” supplies a live clock, narrowing to the dissolution beat. Protagonist agency is steady: he walks, reads, adjudicates galaxies. Cost is conceptual yet visible on-page: the dictionary, his sole instrument, is forfeited in the act of unification.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: can Elias force the clocks to surrender their true measure before madness or dismissal? Tightening arrives when backward count peels gear-etched shipwreck names—each digit narrows future, raises culpability. Cost visible: tears freeze, key vibrates, horizon log corrected at price of lifelong doubt. Agency drives escalation; coincidence only complicates (authorities’ scorn). No reversal overkill; one meaningful turn suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: can she detect intrusion without resisting it? Pressure tightens once: the rat’s scatter forecloses the old “block” model and forces the surrender-tracking tactic. Cost is visible—she banks her prototype on an untested philosophy before birdsong. Agency is hers: she chooses to “let the intruder pass,” not Elias. Coincidence (rat) complicates, not resolves. Under Accumulative lens, the spore-density shift reweights the stake; no further reversals needed at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—“inherit genius without ruin”—tightens with each graffito that literalises the father’s paradoxes; the final manuscript confrontation forces a public/private trade-off that was not live at start. Escalation is textural: density of contradictions increases until the archive re-weights the stake rather than explodes it. Cost is visible in the extinguished candle and the cooled mica—tangible, minor, but sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.7)
    One dominant stake—control over connection/severance—tightens when Elias hangs up on Mira, foreclosing her pleas and recharging the loop. The cost is visible: Mira’s voice shifts from weeping to resolve, Elias remains alone with the disc. Under the causal lens, agency drives every escalation; coincidence merely complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—keep their covenant alive—tightens as each petal narrows the ritual to irreversible commitment. Escalation is textural: liquid thickens, ghosts gather, options collapse into “write or lose him again.” The price (he remains locket-bound) is legible on the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—loneliness vs. reciprocity—tightens when each rock touch compels a story-for-story exchange, foreclosing solitary exit. Escalation is textured, not causal-heavy: density of shared stories increases until dawn’s “new rhythm” reweights options. Visible cost is the mutual vulnerability each teller pays; Elias’s own mask-drop caps the spiral.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—chart inner grief or remain hollow—threads every beat; each ultrasonic note absorbed is a tightening of emotional density. No external antagonist needed; pressure is situational: the forest’s very texture demands deeper absorption. One meaningful escalation: when ring “scorches like restrained fire,” the cost of continuing becomes visceral, foreclosing retreat. Final image of ring removed and maps knowingly incomplete pays visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—can she atone for the seed catastrophe—tightens at each edit stroke; options narrow from “fix anomaly” to “accept eternal editorial vigilance.” Escalation is causal under the chosen lens: each contingency tweak visibly retracts a vine or rewrites a memory, proving price on the page. The midpoint “soft resonant click” of the nib is the decisive beat that flips the tool from relic to weapon, foreclosing the option to walk away. Persistent constraint—anomaly still rim-visible—keeps future cost alive, satisfying high-band requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—rescue Theo’s promise—signals in line 5 and tightens with each artwork that forecloses wrong turns. The slashed self-portrait delivers the decisive micro-turn: gashes reveal coordinates, narrowing options from search to descent. Cost is visible: she trades personal reunion for archival guardianship, a price legible in her collapsing whisper. Pressure escalates via pattern-break—warm paint, weeping pigment—rather than external antagonist, fitting the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—sever entanglement on own terms—signalled in line 1. Escalation is one continuous cadence swell: thigh → harness → air → water; each drumming beat tightens the garden’s sonic net until the lagoon offers the single exit. Price is incremental and visible: pain through spine, petals folding in “respectful defeat,” handlers’ alarms lost in surface distortions. Agency resides in rhythmic endurance that forecloses return to lab life; coincidence plays no role.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—cartographic supremacy and personal creed—tightens when communication mode becomes the sole variable under storm interference. Mid-story whisper taunts erode Harlan’s lead, converting abstract bet into felt advantage. Final cost is Harlan’s forfeited maps and pride; Elias’s method is validated, foreclosing louder alternatives. One clear escalation beat suffices under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single dominant stake: will the void learn to cradle light? Pressure escalates through pattern intensification rather than causal reversals—each spiral tightens Umbra’s options until he must either absorb the star-warmth or retreat. Visible price: Elara’s tempo accelerates, breath implied in finger-cramp precision; Umbra’s shadow-fringe frays into twilight—loss of pure oblivion as identity. Agency remains hers; coincidence absent; closure keeps new equilibrium at cost of perpetual vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—seed doubt inside a locked-step town—tightens through the escalating window displays; each shopkeeper’s micro-compliance risks exposure. No visible price is exacted on the page (no arrest, no lost job), so cost is conceptual rather than visceral, keeping it shy of 8.8. The protagonist’s agency is cumulative rather than decisive in a single beat, fitting the Accumulative lens. One meaningful deepening occurs when the rook’s pulse syncs with the town’s nascent reflection—options have irreversibly narrowed for the Council’s authority.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—freedom from human guise—signaled early via cage metaphors. One meaningful tightening: scrimshaw confessions collapse their dock-bound option, foreclosing retreat. Price is visible: severed rope, shouts receding, clothes shed. Agency drives the turn: Elara saws, Kai steadies, both row. Escalation is coherent under causal lens; mer reveal is new rule but does not resolve conflict, only manifests it. Cost legible; persistent constraint (cannot return to dock) implied but not dramatized on-page, holding below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can she lighten grief without feeling—tightens when the knife slips: blood proves the body still bills her. Each whittle deepens the pattern (void → artifact → void) under Accumulative pressure. No reversal, but the deepening is decisive: the bouquet’s last petal falls, foreclosing the option of authentic mourning. Cost is visible in the bleeding thumb and the eternal tomorrow she announces.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—will verse actually dissolve the boundary?—tightens once: first crack in ice signals irreversible shift. Escalation is textural/accumulative rather than causal-reversal; each paraphrase deepens pattern until pillars yield. Agency is present—he kneels, speaks, steps—but risk remains metaphorical; no tangible loss (blood, exile, voice) is paid, so cost feels aesthetic. Sufficient for short lyric arc, but lacks visceral price that would propel score higher.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—Mira’s awakening—tightens when the phoenix demands a sensory trade, forcing Elias to wager his dormant color-sight. Escalation is singular but meaningful: the reed tongue’s imperfect note narrows options and is paid for by perpetuated blindness. Cost is legible on-page (“content in his blindness”). Agency is protagonist-driven; coincidence only complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—feel connection’s texture—tightens three times: hollow laughter → velvety pause → fibrous reunion → gossamer transience, each refracted through lens-use. Agency is continuous: she decides whichTexture to keep and pays in intimacy lost to grainier weave. Cost is visible: the final grit under her knees is residue she created. No external antagonist needed; pressure is accretive pattern-break, not causal reversal, satisfying lens.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can withering stars be rebloomed?—is signalled at first curtain; escalation proceeds via each origami deployment that narrows her path from mourner to perpetual gardener. The tightening is the blooming itself: every revived constellation increases the unspoken obligation to maintain cosmic foliage, price felt as endless labour. No coincidence, only pattern-driven intensification under the Accumulative lens; final nebula is payoff, not rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—decode the crash pattern to warn the next generation—is signaled early and tightened when the reversed World card reveals “communal ledgers.” Cost is conceptual but legible: they accept lifelong vigilance against the next mania. Agency is mostly intellectual; the physical act is the final roll of the tape, still a visible foreclosing. Escalation is steady under the Accumulative/Textural lens: each measured branch increases pattern density until meaning crystallizes.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—save collective hope from shadow corrosion—tightens once: Elara decides to sacrifice corporeal warmth. Pressure is coherent but static; the shadow’s escalation is described (“had grown since sharing began”) rather than dramatized on-page. The meaningful turn is her ritual commitment; visible price is her partial humanity, reported not tasted. Sufficient for a lyric short, yet short of visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—trust versus self-protection—tightens once: the shed guilt layer forecloses naive openness, replacing it with “boundaries drawn in compassion’s ink.” Under Accumulative lens, the pressure is density-driven: each recalled laugh, each peeled scale, thickens the cost until the final pouch-talisman narrows future tactics. No external antagonist is needed; the internal reversal is sufficient at this length. Price is visible—she will alert authorities tomorrow, conceding that justice is part of compassion.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—scar-reading as life-meaning—is signaled in paragraph 2 and escalates when coffee rings confirm she must reopen surgical wound. One meaningful tightening: the ivy’s telepathic command “dig” forces a painful trade-off between bodily integrity and narrative truth. Cost is visible—blood on soil, reopened sutures—altering her later stance. No reversal overload; a single intensification is sufficient and paid.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“where does unused love go?”—signaled in paragraph 3. Escalation is accumulative/textural: each relic saturates space until architecture becomes storage, tightening options. Cost is legible: she forfeits permanent closure with her fiancé by choosing to become a carrier of collective longing. No reversal, but deepening pattern forces stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.3)
    Dominant stake—keep freight safe—shifts to cultivating sparks; the tightening is signaled but not pressure-tested. No visible resource is expended; the clock’s hum decides for him. Escalation is imagistic (glow fractures sharper) rather than tactical; options do not narrow. Cost is conceptual, not felt, so tension plateaus despite lyric intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—reclaim the wild frontier of mind—is signaled early and tightens as each arboreal voice strips a layer of self-doubt. The final unraveling of the corewheel axis is the decisive act that forecloses the path of detachment. Pressure escalates accumulatively: each new tree song increases density until the gear click provides the single intensification. Visible price: fused gear, permanent perceptual overload.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—break the leash—signals early; pressure tightens when each indirect loop forces her to re-choose continuation. The final stamp is an irreversible trade-off that forecloses return to village life; cost is legible in her tears and the guides’ fade-out.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“understanding safety’s price”—tightens when Elias literally touches the evidence of Thorne’s silence; knowledge becomes culpability, foreclosing easy departure. One clear escalation suffices at this length: the bolt discovery functions as irreversible hinge. Agency remains internal yet decisive: staying is the costly act. Coincidence is absent; pressure stems entirely from confronted memory.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are legible early: false king will “unravel the cosmos’ fragile weave.” Pressure escalates by accretion—each planted book erodes loyalty; the final missive topples coronation mid-ceremony. No visible personal cost to Lirion keeps it from 8.8, but the pattern’s tightening is unmistakable: every drift-runed book narrows the usurper’s options until only collapse remains.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—why shipping paths vanished—tightens through data assembly: each corroded holodisk shrinks options until only the atlas overlay remains. Mid-scene deepening occurs when coral cores reveal nascent color, flipping puzzle from pure loss to emerging pattern. Cost is visible: Elias’s exhausted knuckles, the station’s groan, the decision to transmit rather than hoard data. Agency is accumulative—tapping, aligning, wiring—rather than single decisive punch, fitting the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—“find meaning to restart rebellion”—is clear early. Escalation is a single mystical jump rather than narrowing options: the stone circle instantly flips lull to mobilisation without intermediary obstacle or trade-off. Agency is present (she activates the slab and glasses) but price is externalised; no personal option is foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—evolve tradition or let council ossify it—surfaces early and tightens when plants warn of withering if she refuses. One meaningful escalation: amber immersion forecloses heirloom stasis, forcing live adaptation; price (scalded skin, social risk) is visible.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—can optimism survive recurrent trauma?—is signaled by line 3 and tightened when the photograph resurfaces. The meaningful deepening occurs during the freeze: Elena’s options narrow to endure or collapse; her choice to “root through” re-weights the stake under Accumulative lens. Cost is visible: she yields the photo’s private pain to become social bridge, forfeiting secrecy. Agency is present; coincidence (finding the photo) complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—recovering artistic truth—tightens when each untangled thread releases a lived memory, narrowing options to either stay shattered or re-weave. Escalation is accumulative: density of recalled betrayals increases until the loom forces a single decisive placement of cards. Cost is visible in the “glowing scar” that persists after storm abates, satisfying the 8+ requirement of felt price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—why time slows—tightens when the ink offers a single escape route that demands bodily risk. Escalation is one-step: from question to lived answer inside the ink void. The price is the sensory fracture he carries back; visible cost is on-page (“prismatic shards”). Agency is high: he elects to step in, not merely observe.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—awaken the frozen minds vs. preserve her own safety—tightens the instant the glitch appears; transmitting the letter forecloses retreat. Escalation is causal: glitch → override → cascade → unseen alarms. The price (inevitable detection) is conceptual but undeniable in the final quiet. A stronger on-page visceral cost—heartbeat stutter, glove tear—would have pushed it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—preserve the farm’s quiet life—faces two escalations: physical breach then moral choice of steel vs. pollen. Protagonist agency drives both turns: she repurposes the scrap and cultivates the pollen trait. Cost is visible: dome wounded, roses forever altered, dagger permanently sheathed. Coincidence limited to prior tower debris; it complicates, not resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—snare the goddess-echo before it vanishes—signaled in paragraph 2 and tested by the chaotic star-fracture beat that tightens the hunt. Escalation is causal: stellar disruption → echo surges → silence-lure becomes the only viable tactic, foreclosing noise. Visible price: the captured echo immediately whispers of “wilder gardens,” guaranteeing future obsession; the win perpetuates the cycle. One meaningful turn suffices at this length and is delivered on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—silence the cradle-cry guilt—tightens when firmware renders the plea audible. Mid-story deepening (letters reveal his past error) raises cost of proceeding. Final tether act forecloses denial; no coincidence required. Pressure curve is single but sufficient; a second visible tactical loss (needle, blood, or time) would have pushed it to 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single dominant stake—can Elara turn cacophony into meaning—tightens when the hush physically spreads from her pattern, forcing villagers into silence and mutual recognition. Escalation is Accumulative/Textural: chant density rises, color layers accrue, then cancel into hush. The price is paid on-page: Elara forfeits her finished art by scattering it, proving mandala unity is inherently transient. No coincidence used to resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“can empathy survive after fire?”—is signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation is single but meaningful: the rename forecloses the option of simply killing Kael and instead encases him in his own forgotten mercy, a tactical narrowing that reweights the plaza’s future. Cost is visible on-page: Kaelon’s tears, survivors’ outstretched hands, Elara’s loosening trap—each a concrete price. No reversal beyond the decisive act is needed at this length; the tightening suffices under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—will she perform again or stay ghost-bound—is signaled early; pressure escalates when echoes force her to sing, tightening options under the Causal lens. The cost is lyric rather than practical: she trades permanent nostalgia-symbiosis with Reginald for renewed art. One deepening only; no secondary reversal, but the orchard’s applause illusion suffices for this length. Price is present but muted—she gains more than she loses, muting the brink tension.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—“is the telepathy real or chemical ghost?”—is signaled early and tightens via each fractal exposure. Agency lies in devising the blind test, yet escalation is incremental (tingle → throat-clench → willow image) rather than option-narrowing; the final image grants confirmation but no forfeiture or new risk. Cost is aesthetic/emotional, not a path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—can maps encompass the unmappable?—is signaled early and tightens when the fossil’s emotions detach, forcing her to either contain or release them. Agency is continuous: she probes, inhales, presses relic to chest, then chooses release; each act escalates psychic load until thermal overload threatens. Cost is felt: surrendering the fossil ends her tactile interface with human memory, trading control for prophetic voice. Escalation is accumulative/textural—denser thermal orbs, mounting humidity, rising tide—rather than causal reversal, but remains coherent under lens.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prophecy vs. free will—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens when cataloging reveals divergence, not doom. One meaningful deepening: the echo’s shift from scrambled moan to harmonious counsel narrows Elias’s options to act. Cost is visible (trembling fingers, reversed sand) and persistent (he must now carry the jar upward). Agency is entirely his; coincidence is absent. Sufficient for 600-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—network resurrection via Lena—tightens once with the stimulant transfer; options narrow from possible suicide to self-sacrifice as mentor. Agency remains Elias’s; no outside rescue. Visible price: his own future is foreclosed to green-light hers. Could use one additional micro-cost beat (tool fatigue, frost-numb fingers) to enter 8.5+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—clarify the palimpsest or lose ancestral meaning—tightens when each unpicked thread removes a comforting story. The single meaningful deepening occurs as the final stitch locks in the reduced vow, foreclosing future embroidery. Cost is the forfeiture of layered identities; no external antagonist needed. Escalation is textural, not causal, and fully legible.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“why do some places resist?”—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens once: fractured visions → sun-pattern map → clay vessel. The deepening reweights the stake from curiosity to vocation; options narrow to “carry this vessel home,” foreclosing passive observation. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable on the page. No reversal, but single meaningful escalation satisfies accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—Elara’s need to “reflect light into dark corners”—is signaled at the harbour edge and tightened once: the offer to row. Agency is low-risk (offering a boat ride) but still forecloses solitude for both; cost is conceptual rather than visceral. Escalation is accumulative: moonlight density increases, Mira’s silence thins, gauge passes—no causal chain, yet pressure coheres under the chosen lens. A higher band would require a sharper forfeiture (time, safety, or social credit) visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—translate isolation into independence—threads every beat; pressure tightens as each hum offers spectral coexistence but demands she surrender total autonomy. The final stance narrows options: she gains wings and command of tides yet accepts eternal singular presence—felt cost is legible. Agency is interior attunement rather than external risk, fitting Accumulative lens. No reversal beyond acceptance, but the cadence shift from brittle to sovereign suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—can risking exposure reconnect her?—tightens once: the twig offering. Escalation is lyrical, not causal; pressure accrues through mirrored spirals and hush of crowd until stance crystallizes. Cost is legible in her public unmasking and Theo’s reciprocal reveal. Slight deduction for coincidence facilitating climax.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—save community from psychic harvest—signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation tightens once: subsonic trick pivots from abstract threat to crowd-control failing live on air. Price is felt via protesters’ temple-rub confusion and Harlan’s slump; tricksters’ recoil shown as waveform collapse. Protagonist agency drives reversal; coincidence absent.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—retrieve the key or be crushed—is signaled early and tightened when corridors literally shrink. The organ chord is the meaningful turn that escalates stakes by shrinking space; the compass transfixes the mutiny, foreclosing retreat. Price is present (claustrophobic panic) but remains abstract—no lost tool, blood, or time is shown.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—erase reversible exile—signaled early and tightens when each decoded stanza forecloses denial. One meaningful deepening: Hale’s confession absorbs the last escape route, forcing transmission. Cost is visible (dread-sweat, quivering knees) and conceptual (honor restored yet station still doomed). Agency is Elara’s at every beat; coincidence complicates (storm wrecks crate) but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: break the “never” vow or stay safe. Escalation is textural: each luminous echo thickens stakes until the scaffold reveals the escape path, forcing the vow’s reversal. Cost is legible—tomorrow he will risk the hidden trail,loss unknown. No external antagonist needed; pressure is situational and internal, sufficient for 600-word frame.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is ownership of the train-cum-vault; pressure tightens when crypto winter evaporates funding, then peaks in the storm-night intrusion. The meaningful turn is Elias’s refusal turned territorial defense, but because the thugs retreat off-page, the price (perpetual vigilance) is announced rather than dramatized. Escalation is textural—crowdfunding surge, then ghost-town emptiness—sufficient for Accumulative lens but lacking a visible wound or lost object on-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—decode before light fails—signaled in telegram and reiterated by clock strike.  One meaningful tightening: seventh-pulse realization collapses infinite inscription permutations into a single solstice alignment, foreclosing further search.  Cost legible in Thorne’s “ethereal sweat” and Lyra’s tear tracks.  agency remains interior (dream witness) but directly changes physical next-step (temple ascent).  Could edge 8.8+ if a concrete resource (ink, stamina, telescope time) had been visibly forfeited to obtain the alignment.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—face the erased murder—signaled in paragraph 3. Pressure tightens exactly once: when the vortex contracts and demands flesh; the plant’s circle-by-circle devouring externalizes escalation. Cost is visible blood and psychic fracture; that price reshapes the final gait. Under causal lens each spiral is a because/therefore ratchet, not decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=3.7)
    Stakes are declared (“covenant dimmed…dreams intersect chaotically”) yet never tested by a visible consequence on or off the page; hybrid horrors stay off-stage. No fork forces Elara to risk or renounce anything; the only “pressure” is her jittery thrill, which never escalates into potential loss. Resolution arrives by ritual assertion, not by a narrowed choice that costs her. Because no option is foreclosed, tension remains ornamental rather than operational.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—mend soul-holes by bartering destinies—announced early; pressure tightens when the blood seal forces memory influx at visible personal cost. Agency progression is causal under ritual logic; no outside coincidence. Stakes stay personal, not abstract, yet the “dimmed future” cost is stated more than dramatised in-scene, blunting visceral escalation needed for 8.2+.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—recover purpose after public/applause failure—tightens once: the duplicate cloth forces him from hiding into action. The escalation is accumulative/textural: each factual recitation layers density until emotion breaks through, a legitimate cadence shift. Cost is conceptual (future exposure, possible new failure) rather than immediate; still legible under the inferred lens. No secondary reversal is needed at this length; the single tightening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—prevent arbor collapse after spirit-departure—is signaled early and kept alive via field-waver thunder. Pressure escalates only once: thunder → plant seed → dew conducts → fields steady; the tightening is poetic, not tactical, so options never visibly narrow and no price is paid by Elias. Escalation is therefore present but lightweight, satisfying the 600-word “one intensification” rule yet lacking a felt cost that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: can wonder survive routine? Tightens when the waning moon traps Elara in looping spirals—no exit without smelting. Price is paid on-page: she must surrender coherent self to tidal breath. Escalation is single but sufficient; luck complicates nothing.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will he seal or open hearts—is signaled by line 4 and tightens when the override switch hovers. Pearl insertion is the decisive turn that forecloses bunker-as-bunker, price paid on-page (seals now permeable, refugees exposed to unknown connection). Pressure escalates via accumulative texture: each inscribed confession thickens the moral weight until the pearl ignites. No coincidence resolves; the seashell anomaly complicates but remains causally linked to builder grief.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—signaled in paragraph two. Escalation is textual/accumulative: each graffiti layer thickens the river’s shared culpability, narrowing Elias’s self-accusation to one voice among many. The climb onto the sink is the visible pressure point—physically risky, morally symbolic—foreclosing lifelong denial. Cost is the unmuted memory he must now carry, made legible by the accordion’s heavier, clearer tone.

    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—dream vs empire—signaled in paragraph 2 and escalates via solstice deadline. Propagation act at climax narrows option set: she must share dream or lose it. Cost legible: dawn-crescendo ruptures her pure-artist identity; plants colonize observatory, sealing exit to solitary path. One meaningful tightening suffices; no reliance on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—snatch a spark before personal extinction—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens when her own reflection appears in the chip. The meaningful deepening happens mid-text: the elder’s helix frays, forcing her to risk self-extraction; options narrow from “save him” to “save him and herself or lose both.” Cost is visceral—pain lances, brilliance erupts—and the grotto’s tremor externalizes the price. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens; no reversal is needed because density itself becomes the vise.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—can contentment survive inside endless loss/return?—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens when the wilted flower demands the scalping act. Agency drives escalation: Elara’s decision to climb, to pry the pin, to carve the petal each narrows options under the causal lens. Cost is visible on the page: sap as blood-promise, trembling petal as live surrender. The off-page kin fire is the only pressure not re-inscribed in the present moment, holding the score shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.2)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—reversal of aging—signals early and tightens once: ripples encode the price (vanish first). Escalation is accumulative-pattern rather than causal-turn; sufficient for short-form. Agency is interior attention, not external act; cost is conceptual (ego dissolution) but legible. No visible price beyond the abstract “vanish,” so tension plateaus rather than spikes.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—disembodied navigation—tightens via accretive cost: decades of dust, ebbing flocks, ossifying joints. Each harmonic session is a micro-bet that forecloses alternatives (no travel, no trade, no human contact). The decisive intensification is the single perfect throw that finally aligns birds with spirals; coincidence is absent, pattern is earned. Price is irreversible corporeal stasis, legible in the dust-mantled silhouette that no longer breathes.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—prove the sacred simple can outshine automated grandeur—tightens when straps break and mist becomes the only path; failure means robotic eternity. One meaningful escalation: straps off → magic feebly returns → must attempt impossible mist-walk; no safety reset. Cost is visible: frost-burned hands, societal exile, acceptance of lifelong minority status in a world run by code. Closure crystallizes stance, not world-fix, keeping pressure coherent.</answer>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.9</question><comment>Theme emerges through accumulating images of handmade hush vs. coded dazzle; keystone’s humble vine-scroll beats digital symphony. No moral statement—final tableau lets lantern-light imply rebellion. Sacred/simple gains weight each time automation’s dazzle is shown hollow. The concept is repriced: reader must decide if a single lit stone can counter oceans of algorithmic brilliance—ambiguous yet charged.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake—recover Lira by “discovering the color of sound”—is signaled early, but pressure plateaus once inside the library. Elias faces no escalating obstacle, cost, or reversal; the librarian simply delivers exposition and the book opens to reveal the answer. No option is foreclosed, no resource spent, no tangible price exacted. Escalation is therefore thematic (learning the answer) rather than causal or tactical, keeping tension static.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—wavelength alignment versus dissolution into stellar doubt—is signaled in paragraph 5 and tightened twice: first when she risks mis-interpreting a burst (peers shredded), then when the core burst demands she become the fulcrum. Each narrowing is driven by her coin-cast agency; luck complicates but never rescues. Visible price: she forfeits passive observer safety and accepts possible obliteration when she ignites the beacon. Cost is legible on the page (“stellar doubt trembled”) even though the universe’s response is still only a hint.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.4)
    Single dominant stake—"name the fear that ate Lirian"—tightens exactly once yet decisively: when the first monster locks into crystal, the option to forget is forever lost. Escalation is textural accumulation: each successive naming saturates the page with irretrievable grief, raising the cost of stopping. Agency remains frontal; no coincidence, only her deliberate cranking of cylinders and tear-fed refractions. Final price is paid on-page—"sacrifice’s echo became her strength"—a conceptual repricing that makes the named horrors her new reaper’s arsenal.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—cosmic imbalance—materializes in every erratic star-wink and chaotic drip, felt on the skin. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: each micro-calibration of drip-rate tightens the task, visible when chaotic surges crack the fresh repair and force deeper channeling. The cost is relentless: spell-fatigue tremors, grandmother-whispered doubt, final collapse onto cold stone. No coincidence resolves; luck complicates then tests precision. One meaningful turn—the bell fracture widening—forces the shift from surface patch to interior re-tuning, foreclosing brute-magic option forever.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether Elias will keep atonement private or surrender narrative control—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens with each unearthed photo. The meaningful escalation is the moment he recognizes his own young face beside his mother: knowledge flips from salvage to self-indictment, foreclosing the option to remain merely guardian. Cost is visible (loss of photos, loss of secrecy) and persistent: the label now lives with Mira, a future vector of accountability. Agency remains his—he chooses the burn, chooses the gift—so luck complicates but does not resolve. Under Accumulative lens, the cadence shift from solitary hush to shared hush reweights the stake without requiring a second external reversal. Pressure is coherent; no abstract or telescopic stakes declared. Sufficient for 8.6; the half-point gap reflects that the physical stakes (levee breach risk) are relics of the past rather than live tactical pressure in the present scene.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—internal synthesis before dusk—tightens once: the crystal must thaw exactly as the starlings script the bridge pattern, or she remains fractured. This single deepening reweights the premise under Accumulative pressure; the visible price is the crystal’s total loss and the tear’s surrender. No external antagonist needed; the orchard’s magic complicates but does not rescue. Cost is legible, yet the escalation is more a crescendo of density than a causal fork, keeping it just shy of the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single dominant stake—Lena’s survival under Elias’s read—tightens twice: first when the rogue updraft negates standard protocol, then when secondary vortex demands mid-air vector change. Each escalation is driven by Elias’s agency (invent buckle mod, flare cue) under causal lens; price is his rising heart-rate and the irreversible widening of sky-ground separation. No coincidence; weather data is legible to him alone. Cost is visible: “trust endured, fragile as a buckle’s clasp” ties the mechanical fix to social fragility at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—own the duplicate to reclaim feeling—signaled in second paragraph and tightened when Elara’s drones project false histories meant to disqualify him. Mid-scene reversal: Kai’s bloody slice vivifies the brain, converting pretense-shattering into literal life-creation; option space collapses from “win custody” to “become dyad,” a visible trade-off. Cost is on-page: shared identity, perpetual Collective threat, and loss of singular self. Agency remains Kai’s; coincidence only complicates (history rewrites) never resolves. Pressure escalates under causal lens; no narrative loops.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—save venue from paving—signalled early and tightened when seed-map implies surveillance. One meaningful turn: UV ink exposes untouchable covenant, flipping sabotage into sponsorship. Cost is present but light: a conceptual price (future obligation to build corpse-flower room) rather than tangible loss. Escalation stays causal-under-inference; no coincidence rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—restore laughter—signaled in paragraph 3; pressure escalates via textural layering: each blower adds density, each half-sung lullaby softens grief. One decisive tightening: the mother’s ghost-smile flickers—first proof the tactic works—cost is Elias’s dwindling energy. Agency is present—he chooses the surge—but escalation relies on cumulative resonance rather than a sharp reversal. Price is felt (engines die, he fades) yet the laughter cascade feels slightly convenient because the chamber’s conversion rule is asserted, not tested under threat.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—homesickness versus surrender to uncertainty—is signaled early and tightens when the pendant flares into a literal door. Escalation is imagistic, not causal: each “interiorizing” beat adds density rather than narrows option, but the final fold/portal does foreclose exile. Cost is conceptual (garden now inside) rather than felt, keeping it at the 7-floor for accumulative designs.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—breaking a prewritten destiny—signals early and tightens through each failed trial; the escalating cost is the alchemist’s dwindling time and material. Agency is visible: Elias actively shatters and reforges the crozier, narrowing options until only total obliteration remains. The final turn is driven by his choice to pulverize, yet the beat is compressed into one sentence, muting the visceral price. No visible loss of tool, body, or social credit occurs on-page; the cost is atmospheric rather than tactile, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can Elara turn cataclysm into reborn broadcast—is signaled by line 3 and tightens when cables begin to sing. One meaningful deepening: the realization that abandonment was “by design” collapses her binary of ruin/renewal, foreclosing retreat. Cost is visceral: if she mis-tunes, the city plunges; after success she still loses her prior worldview. Agency drives every turn; coincidence merely complicates (moon arrives on schedule). Meets 9+ quick test: escalation under protagonist control with on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—“keep his beloved ferry intact”—is signaled early and escalates as the hull turns translucent. One meaningful tightening: parallel passengers overlap, forcing Elias to act before complete fade. Cost is conceptual (accepting permanent transient life) rather than visceral; no credible loss of tool, stamina, or social credit occurs on-page. Escalation is coherent but relies on invented pattern-radio logic that isn’t foreshadowed, slightly blunting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single stake—master starlight navigation—tightens once when geometry lesson forecloses ignorance. Escalation is informational, not perilous; no visible price or lost option occurs on the page, so pressure stays conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—Clara’s life—arrives late and is signaled abstractly (“come to end it all”) rather than through tangible preparation or visible means, flattening visceral urgency. Pressure escalates only once, when the mother’s message is relayed; Elara’s agency is passive conduit, not active trade-off. No credible loss (time, social credit, physical risk) alters Elara’s tactics; the hearing-aid battery dies afterward but never limits her. Because coincidence (finding the aid) initiates rather than complicates, escalation feels atmospheric, not causal under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“honor the unremembered before tide re-floods”—is clear and externally clocked. Escalation is a single deepening: the codex reveals colleagues’ spectral imprint, forcing her to risk phase limbo that exacerbates claustrophobia. Price is liminal entanglement (body hums like fiber), visible on page. No second reversal, but one meaningful tightening suffices; cost could be sharper—no lasting physical loss, only psychological scar.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—prove her aliveness by extracting wisdom from collapse—signaled in first third and tightened when the ghost begs cohesion. Escalation is intellectual rather than external: each decoded fragment narrows her options until refusal to become a ghost is the only stance left. Cost is conceptual but legible: she accepts perpetual exile from societal records (“erroneously alive”) in exchange for integrated self. No coincidence resolves; pressure culminates in her charged poise on the threshold of the storm.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—save textured language—signals early; pressure tightens when only Thorne remains and the curse threatens madness. One meaningful escalation: realizing bird-flight can pattern the chaos, he risks self-annihilation to complete the transmutation; option to retreat is foreclosed once the diamond drinks the final “zhar’keth.” Cost is his dimming veins and the dispersal of the flock—visible, felt.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“reclaim hope from frostbitten void” via cosmic joke—is signaled early and narrowed to one tightening: hearing brother’s confession forces her whispered surrender of bitterness. The price is palpable—palm pierced, feet lifting, garden forever abandoned—so escalation lands under Causal lens. No secondary obstacle complicates; escalation is a single crescendo rather than a tightening sequence, holding the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—reawaken beauty vs mechanical order—tightens when statue tilts head, then again when statues converge; each beat is protagonist-driven via music pulse. Escalation is causal: softer the signal, harder the risk. Cost is legible—shell shatters, gears scatter, bridge hums with “tarnished wonder reborn.” One meaningful tightening suffices; no reversals required.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—mending sundered families while healing his own vow—tightens when absences link into an escape route, foreclosing neutrality. Each emptied slot is a visible price (Kowalskis 3 wks, Lees 1 mo, Garcias 8 days) that escalates risk of detection. Protagonist agency drives every beat: he files pristine manifests while uncorking storms. Final cost is conceptual but undeniable—half-drained vial, heavier heart, and the patrol siren that now knows his scent.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can silence birth living art?—tightens when the fragment demands voice; the misting hush deepens, forcing a wordless song that costs Elias his pure muteness. Escalation is textural: each carousel bone unearthed increases luminous pressure until dawn’s ray forecloses concealment. Price is legible: he forfeits sole possession of the miracle, leaving it pulsing in the train. Slight reserve: external coincidence (fog bank) initiates without later complicating, capping 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—reach the place where stories live—is signaled in para 2 and sharpened by the scarf’s growing heat. One meaningful tightening: the hyperbolic warp tries to suck her in; she shelves the model, foreclosing immediate transcendence. Cost is the perpetual incompleteness she now carries. Escalation is textural—colors blooming, threads vibrating—rather than causal, fitting the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“draw the runaway dream home”—tightens with each depleting well of dawn-colored paint. Sunrise photography as method forces literal clock: miss the crest and pigment dries powerless. Third-dawn pause supplies one meaningful reversal; bird’s surrender narrows options to eternal memory rather than flesh. Cost visible: palette emptied, fingers sapphire-stained, freedom forever translated to plate.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—freedom from fear—tightens when the locksmith realizes the woman’s release awakens his own. One meaningful deepening is sufficient: the ribbon dissolves, secrets spill, cost is legible (“heart disoriented”). Agency is shared yet sufficient; coincidence merely hints, never resolves. Escalation is accumulative: each knot and star pulse layers consequence rather than narrows causal path.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—recover or relinquish stolen memories—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the star-map decryption demands a literal touch that will end the ring’s glow. One meaningful deepening suffices: the alignment of Sirius with the ring’s center forces a now-or-never stance. Cost is legible—he gains the past but loses the numinous refuge forever. No escalation loop; pressure coheres under Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—Kai’s reversible exile—signals early and tightens when the shadow is literally snared. One meaningful deepening: the fracture line in the leaves raises permanent-loss risk, forcing Kai’s steady hand. Price is visible: Elara’s anxious backwards steps and the emptying library after Kai’s departure. Agency stays with Elara’s annotation and Kai’s sigil; coincidence merely observes from the swing.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—“preserve the color of wonder”—is signaled early and escalates through each essence-capture beat; the final rainbow tree offers visible payoff. Pressure is accumulative: every strand tightens the possibility of failure, yet no live option is foreclosed; the ritual never falters or demands sacrifice beyond described effort. A credible price (fatigue, bleed, orchard wilt) would have driven the score into the 8-band. Still, the tightening pattern is coherent and sufficient for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—anchor the drowned—signals in paragraph two and tightens with every knot: each release forecloses the option to stop, since silence pools like ink and prisms tremble. Agency is iterative renunciation of rest; the price is bodily (“hands, scarred”) and existential (dawn’s threat replaces starlight). One meaningful deepening occurs when the shade confesses the final knot is its own echo, converting abstract labour into personal reckoning. Cost is visible on-page: the needle tip “stained with hush’s residue” and Lirien’s “fractured core” now mended yet haunted.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—decode silence without succumbing to its madness—escalates via each new fissure (map, soil, keystone), narrowing Elias’s options toward descent. The price is knowledge rather than bodily risk; because the psychological toll is implied而非 dramatized on-page, the tightening is legible but not viscerally paid.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—intellectual ownership of history vs. surrender to entropy—tightens once yet decisively when the decrypted note forces the choice: surface with evidence or release it to silt. Agency is continuous: cross-referencing logs, sampling glass, logging coordinates, then deleting them by letting the globe settle. Cost is legible: she forfeits renown, funding, possibly oxygen time. Escalation is single-point but sufficient under Accumulative lens; luck complicates (globe intact) but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: give the voiceless speech before thunder strikes. Escalation: mural pleas → ghost entrapment → plate alignment → pigment transfer → spectral release, each step foreclosing retreat. Protagonist agency drives every beat; no coincidence. Cost is legible: her own anonymity surrendered—she will now be heard, whether she wants it or not. One meaningful tightening: once plate bolts click, retreat is impossible; thunder must carry the truths.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—will Lira embrace the painful truth behind her ascent?—tightens once per floor as decryption strips away illusion; the tenth-floor arrival forecloses denial. Agency is shown in her decision to keep reading despite mounting anguish; the final step into the aerie is an active claim of heritage. Cost accumulates texturally: each decoded secret increases the emotional price of continuing, visible in trembling fingers and caught breath. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the cadence of floor-ding beats steadily reweights the meaning of her promotion.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—immortalize sky before demolition—signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens with each axe-crink outside. One meaningful deepening: the guild’s abandoned ambition becomes her attainable one, reframing failure into possibility. Agency is continuous: she stays, carves, angles mirrors; no outside rescue. Cost legible: tree falls, her authorship erased—felt in “recognizing none of their blurred faces.”

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—discovery of uncharted rift—is signaled early and tightened when starlings threaten the ship. The hopscotch sequence forces a trade-off: decode now or be grounded, a visible price paid in energy borrowed from unknown source. Escalation is single but sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single meaningful tightening: when the final pinion meshes, the hall’s light intensifies and mirror options collapse from infinite refraction to single repaired rhythm—live with the mirrored cadence or leave forever. Cost is visible—sweat freezes on skin, reflections confront him with irretrievable father loss. Protagonist agency drives the turn; no coincidence resolves the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—save the blighted orchard—is signaled early and tightened by each chalk command. Agency is collective rather than individual, but the final bell-pull is an unmistakable narrowing of options with visible physical effort. Cost is present (bruised hands, swallowed pride, Lir’s disappearance) yet feels light because no one risks personal loss or moral trade-off. Escalation is linear, not spiral, but sufficient for lyric-fable mode; coincidence is mythic, not cheat.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single dominant stake: grant mercy across dead children’s time. Escalation is textural—each spiral, each crack, each dusk shade thickens the weight of that task until the lullaby’s release narrows Elias’s life to dust cost—visible on page.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—travelers’ lives vs. Elias’s psychic cost—signaled in paragraph 2 and escalates with each nut mark that could expose him to birds or frost. One meaningful tightening: final nut at zenith forces a visible grunt/flick under bird patrol, foreclosing retreat. Frost price is atmospheric yet viscerally legible; failure means shared death. Coincidence limited to lure-whispers off-page; resolution rides on his engineered causality, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—personal/ecological atonement—tightens once: the insight that his polymers killed the river forces a public reversal that could ruin his reputation. Escalation is modest but sufficient for 700-word scope; no second reversal is required. Cost is visible: he stakes credibility on foam-derived emulsifiers and their downstream success. Agency stays internal-scientific, aligning with Accumulative/Textural lens; pressure deepens through pattern recognition rather than external antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reach origin via self-erasure—signaled in second paragraph. Escalation is accumulative: each numeric cut deepens absence-density until options narrow to single step into cloud. No coincidence; pressure is coherent. Cost legible: 47 891 hours of solitude tallied, then paid by physical dissolution of slate and self.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—erase his own remorse via culinary alchemy—is signaled in paragraph 1 and escalates through each tidal-pool absorption that visibly costs breath, fog, and chest-lead. Agency is continuous: sample → heat → inhale → soften grief-of-others → lighten self. The last pool emptied = live option foreclosed; price is cumulative bodily toll and the pavilion’s thaw—cost legible on page. Escalation is steady but single-thread; no secondary reversal keeps it just sub-8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—prevent harvest violence by uniting silos—is signaled early and tightens when the bridge skeleton must be finished before dawn. One meaningful deepening: shouted accusations modulate into polyphonic chorus under Elara’s literal bridge, narrowing options from separation to shared crossing. Cost is visible—weight repurposed, social credit wagered—but the escalation leans on communal euphony rather than a private, felt price for Elara herself. Agency is choral-directorial, not personal-sacrifice, keeping it south of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—excavate abandoned dreams—is signaled early. Pressure escalates through accretive mirror-tilts; each new entangled memory tightens the psychic load. No external antagonist means tension is entirely spectral; the tightening is poetic rather than tactical. Cost is conceptual (she accepts custodianship of ghosts) but no live option is foreclosed—she could still walk away—so the trade-off feels abstract, not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes—“find forgotten combinations”—are declared early and delivered; the inversion hour tightens the window, forcing the leap. Yet the chamber offers no resistance: no guardian, puzzle, or trade-off, hence no escalation after entry. Protagonist agency is high but pressure plateaus; cost remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—music vs. silence—tightens when the first bone-felt thrum proves the risk works; live option to abandon disappears once cracks sing. Escalation is accumulative: each strum layers drought/rain memories, deepening the cost of eventual silence. No coincidence; pressure is coherent environmental empathy. Price is the unrepeatable moment and the grove’s new, unhearable repertoire—felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“phase looms, covenant fraying”—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens when each mapped silence makes the pact’s fracture legible. Escalation is textural: each silence correlated warms the stone and raises the hum, foreclosing the option to abandon the task. Visible price: every chess rearrangement burns time and exile-deepens; the final alignment leaves him walking into unchanged night. No false reversal—luck never intervenes.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—capture the pre-firework hush—tightens when tuner fails incrementally, then clicks. Visible price: sweat on brow, operatic voice cracking; conceptual price: the coming boom will obliterate the very silence he sought to bottle. Escalation is density-driven, not causal reversal, fitting accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can she bloom serenity amid motion?—tightens when gales threaten to fling the seed into the abyss, foreclosing the safe option. Escalation is textural: each odor note (earth→sweet→rot) intensifies the assault on her trait. Midnight bloom is the decisive intensifier; no coincidence, pure organismic inevitability. Cost is legible: she collapses, nose “aflame,” yet rises with reconfigured stance.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—revive dead groves—signaled in paragraph two and tightened when inversion window threatens to collapse. Each beat raises cost: proximity alarms fail, vines recoil on theft, gravity reverts while echoes fade. Agency drives every escalation; coincidence only complicates. The price is visible: planet’s song damped, Elara morally indebted, groves unnaturally juiced.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stake is singular: prevent the next convergence. Pressure escalates geometrically—each measurement narrows the world to a single truth: the town was murdered by topology. The decisive tightening occurs when he kneels at the crater and the wind pools, proving the choke point; options collapse to one imperative—code this shape into machine memory. Cost is visible: he exits forever haunted by airflow, the patch a lifelong breather alarm.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—can wonder penetrate perfection without destroying it?—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tested in every bell-stroke. Pressure escalates by chromatic accrual: each spectral wave “sculpts new contours of soundless song,” tightening the risk of fracture. A visible price is paid (amber dims, bells awaken) and the final cadence forecloses retreat—the hush is forever partnered with harmony, calcified routine no longer an option.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—quantify emotion or perish—signals early and tightens when the transpose recoils, swapping dread for obsession. One meaningful deepening: the feedback loop amplified by the halo forecloses the option to stay detached. Cost is visible on-page: seared palms, spent fragment, new star’s birth. Agency remains Elias’s at every turn; coincidence is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—whether routine hauls can birth wonder—tightens when the pendant demands a live test on a sceptical stranger. Escalation is interior: Kael’s offer risks ridicule; the sympathetic vibration answers by collapsing Lira’s resistance, forcing Kael to recognise his own legacy as myth-seed. Cost is time-dilated solitude: he walks on alone, mentor still absent. One wished-for sharper external consequence (coin is token; no ridge-beast appears) keeps it from higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—prove/disprove emotional absorption—signaled in paragraph 3 and escalates through each prism refraction until frost literally writes *Feel me*, foreclosing neutrality. Agency is intellectual-attentive: Elias chooses to press forehead to glass, melt a path, snap photos—each act raises emotional exposure. Cost is visible: the cleared window is “forever changed,” engine now “alive with absorbed vindication,” foreclosing pure empiricism. Pressure tightens once but decisively; no reversals needed.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—send message across impossible distance—is signaled early and tightens once: the puzzle-edge frame forces a final, irreversible weave that consumes her life. Under Accumulative lens, density increases via glowing threads and flaring amber until options collapse into the single lift-off. Cost is visible—“her life force dimming, body slumping”—but the beat is compressed into one clause, muting visceral price. Still, the foreclosed path is legible and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—“coax resilience from rubble”—is signaled early and deepened when each silk-tied stone lifts, narrowing options toward planetary salvage. The visible price (spent silk, public whispers) is present but diffuse; escalation is imagistic rather than tactical, so pressure tightens through spectacle more than through contested choice.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—truth vs multiversal collapse—signaled early. Escalation: first redirect reveals mentor’s warning; second exposes engineered origin; each tightens stakes from personal to cosmic guardian. Agency sits in the two shard-twists; cost is the fusion burn. Slight abstraction: "weight...a steady hum" could be more visceral, but cost is still page-visible.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“will the anonymous letter chain/fragile safety survive the keeper’s death?”—is signaled once lamp dies. Escalation is textural: each unearthed note thickens meaning, narrowing Elias’s options to silence or participate. His decision to write and rebuild the tower is the single tightening that charges the ending; cost is the permanent vocal commitment he can’t retract. No reversals needed; density pattern suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—rebirth via primordial dark—tightens once: storm-beam redirect forecloses safe routine. Escalation is situational: external pressure coils, Elias angles mirrors, shadows answer. Cost is societal (screens flicker), not personal; price is legible but vicarious.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—can she wield the narrative magnet without being consumed—is signaled in paragraph 2. Escalation is accretive: each sun-trail intensification tightens the warning until the fractal map reweights options. Price is visible: the wing’s shift from sapphire to “velvet blue” marks the danger she now internalizes. No coincidence; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: redeem the sextant’s quantified sorrow. Escalation occurs via density: each mapped dream dilutes one grief batch, tightening the pattern. Agency is sustained attention rather than external opposition; cost is invisible labor and the astronomer’s erased grief. One meaningful intensification—pin-drop silence crystallizes the oak revelation—sufficient under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—reignite a dying realm—is signaled in paragraph 3. Escalation accrues texturally: each forgotten song adds luminous strands, spectral communities knit tighter, the Heart Tree’s pulse strengthens. One meaningful deepening occurs when shadows howl and Elara’s temples split—cost is visible. The chorus join-in slightly diffuses personal pressure, keeping the score just sub-8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—redemption through paradox—signals early and intensifies when she converts her past refusal into the youth’s rescue. Midnight’s ticking clock narrows options to a single ingress; the price is her irrevocable exposure to the Order’s gaze. Escalation is causal, not repetitious; each beat forecloses retreat. Cost is visible (invitation → dust), though the youth’s stakes feel secondary, capping peak visceral punch.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—salvage meaning before vows vanish—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightened each time a frequency wanes. Escalation is scalar, not causal: amplitude drops, frost thickens, abyss revealed; each sample raises stakes for the next. Protagonist agency pure: only his sequential measurements allow the harmonic chord that reverses entropy. Cost legible in frozen ink, trembling gauge, and perpetual ascent duty.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—will the truce survive Lila’s recording gambit—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens with each false start; sunrise is a live fuse, not scenery. The third attempt’s public fob-exposure is the meaningful turn that forecloses negotiation, forces steel-draw, and produces the literal sound of trust breaking. Cost is legible: the market’s social contract is shredded, Lila’s future access forfeited, the cylinder itself a portable curse. Escalation is causal under the inferred lens: because she displays proof, therefore blades emerge, therefore truce collapses.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—will she keep doubting or surrender to cosmic weather—signals early and tightens through synesthetic taste spikes that foreclose retreat. Escalation is Accumulative: density of sensory data (petrichor, salt, honey) reweights the stake rather than causal reversals. One meaningful deepening at the ring-lock beat narrows her path to joining. Cost legible: epistemic surrender tastes of wild honey, a sensual forfeit of intellectual distance.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“rectify this self-inflicted wound”—is signaled in first third and narrows to one live option: fix lock or remain corked. Escalation is incremental but causal: each replaced gear forecloses retreat; the laugh at the end is the audible price paid. No coincidence; all pressure is wrought by his own past sabotage. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single dominant stake—locate vanished truthful talk while her body penalizes every lie encountered—tightens with each honesty-test beat. Escalation is micro but legible: her collapsing knees at the padded ledger, then revival when the worker speaks plain. Agency remains hers: she chooses to keep descending and ultimately to broadcast the vault quietly, paying with exposure of her mentor’s lie.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“preserve wonder’s spectrum”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the iceberg’s inevitable thaw demands daily retuning. One meaningful deepening: the boy’s touch releases a personal crimson symphony, proving the sculpture works yet also proving its fragility (more pilgrims = more melt). Agency remains Elara’s: she chooses to keep tuning rather than speak, a trade-off that narrows her future to perpetual vigil. Cost is visible: “the fragment thawed imperceptibly,” a clock she can slow but not stop.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“resolve inner static”—tightens when magnetic flip fractures memory; miniaturize/burn choice forecloses retreat and carries visible slag-cost; one meaningful escalation suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—proving communal listening heals—announced early; personal risk to Elena is muted, muting pressure. One meaningful tightening: sirens/news vans intrude, forcing Elena to redirect circle back to stories. Cost is social, not personal; neighbors pay emotional price, but Elena’s options never narrow. Agency is facilitative (she decodes, opens, offers locket), not self-endangering; tension plateaus rather than spikes.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—liberate archive & colleagues—tightens once: dice failure would drown both data and people. Agency is continuous: each pirouette narrows AI options until revival sequence is the only path left. Cost is visible: pods warming drain suit power, hull groans escalate. Would breach 8.8 if a single dice mis-roll had forced a trade-off between data and lives on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—reclaim deleted memories—tightens when each gravity pocket he pierces costs physical instability and forecloses anonymity. The escalation is one continuous deepening: every shovel-scoop increases the danger of being discovered and the moral price of exposing the town’s trauma. Final cost is legible: Elias exchanges freedom for custodianship, a visible forfeiture sealed by the chamber’s eternal silence.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—preventing prophecy-driven cataclysm—is signaled in paragraph two and narrows to a single decisive tactic: mapping silence through origami geometry. Escalation is micro but efficient: whispered secrets hush, brook glows, prophetic echo dims—each beat raises the cost of failure. The price paid (wing dissolved, ritual finished) is visible, though cataclysm remains off-page abstraction, capping intensity just below the 8.5 gate. Agency is entirely Elias’s; no coincidence rescues him.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—learn the living language—tightens from eavesdropping to ownership; the meteor shower externalizes the escalating volume of the buildings’ calls, forcing Harlan’s confession. One meaningful reversal: Elara turns supplicant into interrogator on the rooftop, narrowing Harlan’s options to surrender or silence her. Cost is legible: Harlan forfeits sole guardianship; Elara accepts the sleepless burden of fluency. Coincidence (meteor timing) complicates rather than rescues—it awakens the building, not the plot. Pressure stays coherent under causal lens; no static loops.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—freeing himself from his own forged chains—is signaled in paragraph three. Escalation is the sequential unwriting of each edict, each drip-synced stroke narrowing future options until the final snap. No coincidence; every tightening is agency-driven. The price—reopened wound, permanent exile from his own crafted power—is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—will knowledge of echo-immortality survive the night?—is signaled in paragraph two. Each disclosure raises relational cost: first doubt, then oracle grief, finally merchant violence that forces Elyra to expend her sonic trump card. The tightening is one-directional yet sufficient for 750-word scope. Price is legible: permanent fracturing of the pact and her self-exile.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—retrieve untainted relic—established early; pressure tightens when cameo clues foreclose wrong assumptions, pointing to sabotage. No time-lock or immediate bodily risk; cost is conceptual (ghost unrest) and moral (exposing mate). Escalation relies on pattern density, not causal reversals; sufficient under Accumulative lens but never threatens Elara’s safety, keeping visceral stakes moderate. Final locket extraction pays price of eternal stewardship, felt but off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—protect key—tightens when wraiths emerge; option to flee is foreclosed by sprint to tower. Escalation: ice cracks sonically, light fades, wraiths mass; each beat raises physical & spectral cost. Visible price: tear-tracked cheeks, body thrumming with residue—tactics altered by exhaustion. Agency: tuning choice is proactive adaptation, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single stake—sever the Regime’s neural yoke—tightens as lunar nadir approaches; protagonist’s agency drives every beat. Price is legible: personal risk on ice, public exposure, irreversible act. No secondary reversal needed; escalation cleanly forecloses retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—break Marcus’s control—signalled by text leash; each train rumble deepens the cost of staying linked. Mid-story phone-toss narrows options irrevocably; no coincidence required. Price is visible: severed comms + soaked report risk, tightening the external conflict to match internal flight.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—Elias’s need to atone for denying Marcus a second opinion—is signaled early and tightens when the heart’s stillness mirrors that refusal. The single escalation is the heart restarting; it forecloses the option of perpetual self-reproach and forces public commitment. Cost is present but abstract (lifetime advocacy vow); a more tactile forfeiture would deepen the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—will machines awaken—signaled first paragraph; tightening occurs when the yearning core shudders the cart upward, foreclosing sea-level safety. Cost is visible: acid sea becomes “irrelevant now,” a lived forfeiture of home. Agency is continuous; coincidence only complicates (sea belches the tip), never resolves. One meaningful escalation suffices; bell image reweights stakes without external rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—where do deleted files go?—tightens when the forged audit request forecloses back-out option; escalation is steady under an Accumulative lens as 2519 traces densify, but price is narrated (“cost her job”) rather than shown in a beat that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—annihilation of orchard vs. floes—signaled in first paragraph and tightened into one meaningful turn: the orb’s reconstitution that forecloses war. Escalation is lyric-accumulative under Hybrid lens: each mirror glimpse thickens mutual isolation until shadow-empathy becomes the only narrowing option. Visible price is legible—wraith’s bow and dryad’s unfurling leaves carry surrender of absolute claim. Agency is Thorne’s mapping, not external coincidence, satisfying causal test.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—hear the ending sound—is signaled in paragraph 2 and intensifies with each trawl; the near-miss with the elderly woman narrows options to pure witnessing. Agency stays active: Liora chooses to lean in, then chooses to stay beside Tomas, forfeiting further trawls. Cost is the heirloom’s loss and the lifelong burden of the sound now inside her. No coincidence resolves tension; wind only delivers when she stops chasing.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—whether mismatch is fracture or gift—tightens once: letter fragment reframes quarrel from loss to redirection. Escalation is Accumulative: sensory density (amber, clove, wind) accumulates until stance crystallization feels inevitable. Agency resides in Elena’s decision to accept mismatch and leave; Theo’s cost is already paid. Price is visible—she relinquishes fiancé, he relinquishes Clara again—sufficient for sub-800-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—will the echo survive?—is announced early but never seriously threatened; tension is atmospheric, not tactical. Escalation is a gentle thickening of stillness rather than a narrowing of options. The sole micro-turn (parapet shudders once) is quickly steadied, so cost feels symbolic rather than tactical. Still, under an accumulative lens, the deepening cadence does reweight the stake, satisfying the 8.2 floor for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—decode the growth pattern before the hush erases all future lexis—is signaled in paragraph six and tightens when each fractured sequence proves the viral echo model. One meaningful deepening: realizing growth is fractal, not linear, forecloses hope of restarting external lexicons; the price is the recognition that her testimony can only preserve, not proliferate. Agency remains hers throughout; coincidence never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—capture age’s sound—tightens through each evaporated vision: every forgotten prophecy raises the cost of permanent retention. Escalation is textural: density of chalk marks, driftwood arrows, and fog-thick sculptures accumulates until only the recorder’s virgin reels remain un-ruined. The protagonist’s agency is relentless rearrangement; the decisive turn is pressing RECORD inside the chalk rune, a choice that forecloses innocence of the reels. Price is on-page: the tape now ages him loop by loop—entropy weaponized against prophet.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: save tonight’s once-in-eon pulsar capture. Pressure escalates under causal lens: quake → spin anomaly → observation doom → Elias must restructure the hand. Tightening beat: only the leaf’s 0.2-sec fall is precise enough to counter 2.38 km/s orbital spin; that trade-off costs him the purity of eternal mechanism. Cost legible: clock will never again be changelessly constant, observatory now bound to terrestrial rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“flawless goodbye”—tightens once when Elara places shard in Harlan’s hand, forcing father-daughter convergence. Escalation is single-pulse rather than narrowing; pressure feels accumulative-textural (lyric hymning) more than causal trade-off. Cost is legible but borne by Harlan/Lena; Elara’s risk remains off-page. Sufficient for length, yet a hair below high-band price-proof.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“where shadows go at noon”—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened twice: first gap closed → vision of vault; last map reveals rift. Cost is conceptual (she gains guardians’ burden) but not visceral—no risk to body, reputation, or time—so pressure plateaus rather than spikes. Still, agency drives every beat: she inks, aligns, re-loops.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“heal the rift between skepticism and magic”—tightens once: the tooth’s glow forces her to act, no reversal needed. Agency is ritual performance; failure means the village keeps losing children. Price is the linen strip and the irreversible shift in public stance she must now defend. Under causal lens, escalation is clean; cost visible on page.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—share light without fire—signals in paragraph 5 and tightens when polishing risks failure. One meaningful deepening: the glass’s glow must suffice in place of torches; this narrows options and carries visible price (no flame ever lit). Escalation is textural: each lyrical pass of sand increases radiance until the single reversal—village accepts cold light. Agency remains Elara’s; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes—“collect shapes before final chapter closes”—are declared early but remain abstract; no concrete deadline or editor looms. Escalation is textural: mist thickens, cameos accelerate, but options don’t narrow—Elias merely repeats the same ritual. Cost is atmospheric (cold, fatigue) rather than tactical; nothing is forfeited. The final lantern mother deepens texture yet offers no new trade-off; pressure plateaus rather than tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—save arbor from blight—tightens once: the moon dips, Elowen must sing now or lose the weave. The price is paid on-page: blight “retreating like shadows at noon,” villagers compelled to reenact rites they had abandoned. Agency is hers alone; coincidence merely complicates (moon lingers). Escalation is single but decisive; no option is foreclosed beyond the communal endurance of renewed ritual, so cost is visible yet not agonizingly personal.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—turn grief into navigable map—tightens once: the flash-paper ignition costs the entire scavenged pattern, foreclosing retreat. Cost is visible (sweat freezing, palm numb) but not persistently punished afterward; still, agency drives every escalation under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—can he bottle wonder without losing himself?—tightens once: the harvest begins to replay his own voice, layering self-echo into stored sound. This single deepening reframes the risk from “failure to capture” to “capture of self,” a felt price that narrows future options. No reversals are needed; the accumulative pressure of harvested memory becomes the cost that charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—escape boundary-less trap—signaled once recursion tightens. Escalation driven by her re-orienting lamp: each micro-tilt narrows options until crystallization forecloses infinity. Cost legible: loss of boundary-less diffusion, replaced by fixed stone skin. No reversal, but single deepening suffices for 700-word textural arc.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reclaim squandered ambition—tightens when each fragment *renames* his loss, narrowing options from chase to stillness. One meaningful deepening: the rival scavenger fragment forces Elias to see his own erosion, paying the visible price of handing over the wheel. Agency drives every beat; coincidence merely complicates (wheel jam). Cost is felt in the ghost’s refusal and the empty click that no longer turns toward erosion.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—prove decay reversible—tightens when mis-wiring could fry both her and the resonator; sparks are felt price. Escalation is linear, not recursive; no second reversal or trade-off. Agency is high; coincidence absent. Sufficient for 800-word window, but lacks a final narrowing—once power hums, risk evaporates.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—silence vs. song—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens exactly once: the crystals force sound into the hush, making renunciation impossible. The price is visible: tears weld, the robe carries new auditory memory, and future clocks will “bear melody’s ghost.” No antagonist is needed; pressure is situational and coherent. The tightening suffices at this length, though a second articulation of cost (e.g., a cracked crystal shard) would have pushed the band higher.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—decode myth vs. risk of being misled—tightens once the twin sundial surfaces; option to keep chasing is foreclosed by inscription. Escalation is causal under lens; no coincidence. Cost is conceptual but legible: abandoning lifelong quest. Felt price could be sharper; inscription acts more as idea than visceral loss, capping score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve ancient methods—tightens once: the rope’s cipher must be decoded before modernity erases it. Agency sits with Elias; the fulgurite is not coincidence but his deliberate instrument. No new opposition surfaces after the knot yields, so escalation plateaus rather than compounds. Cost is custodial, not immediate, keeping pressure short of the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—can absence be transmuted into bearable geography?—tightens with each obituary: options narrow from writing about others to writing himself into留在原地. The price is the thread’s physical fray; its loss of ancient integrity is felt on-page. Agency remains Elias’s throughout; coincidence never rescues. The final cadence shift from third-person elegies to first-person internal map (“healing’s map unfolded within him”) reweights stakes without external plot twist.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“can beauty be reawakened without flaw?”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened by each assembly click until the cracked shell answers: no, only bittersweet compromise. Escalation is textural/density-driven: each hypothesized origin (egg, wire, piston) adds another layer of anticipated failure until the hatch proves the hypothesis physically. Cost is visible: palace shudders, gears falter, chick wing is stunted. Agency is present—every wire twist is Elarion’s—but the climax is revelation rather than reversible decision, keeping it just below 9.0 causal-turn territory.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—heal land and self—tightens through tactile micro-choices: slicing her own scar-patterned rootstock, threading paternal coin, sprinkling sand that once fed her father’s flames. agency is continuous; coincidence absent. Cost is visible: the coin’s alien runes bind her to patricidal legacy forever. Missing a sharper external risk (storm, tide, witness) that could have forced a trade-off, so escalation stays internal, capping short of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—liberate memories—signaled in paragraph four and slowly deepens as each breadcrumb recovers a lost fragment. Escalation is accretive, not perilous; pressure is the widening texture of recovered past. No live option is foreclosed for Elara; she risks nothing tangible, so cost is civic, not personal. Consequently the tightening is aesthetic rather than tactical, sufficient for band but not for 8.5+ which demands a visible price that alters her next move.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—break the ancestral greed-loop without burning kin—signals early and tightens when the gear’s calculations “scream eternal loops unless interrupted.” Protagonist agency drives the escalation: she transits, maps, and physically embeds the gear to reweight fate. Cost is visible in her dimming form and eternal peripheral vigil. Pressure is accumulative: each ping thickens the stakes rather than causal reversals, sufficient under Accumulative lens; coincidence absent.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—“to discover the shape of collective grief”—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightened each dusk as new specters raise the cost of failing to see. The meaningful turn arrives at the plague knot: the ribbon’s weave becomes both map and moral calculus, forcing Elias to renounce solitary grief for distributed sorrow. Price is visible: tear-tracks and the specters’ final blending into the departing swarm foreclose any return to prior detachment. Escalation is textural, not causal, but the density increase is unmistakable and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“restore communal balance by flawless timekeeping”—is signaled in para 2 and tightens when the pendulum pauses: one second’s drift equals village chaos. The rake-handle vision is the single meaningful deepening that reweights stakes: abstract guilt becomes countable notches, each vision a live test Elias must survive without faltering. Cost is visible—tears, trembling, withdrawal of handle—but external price (village reaction) is implied rather than dramatized, keeping pressureBelow the 8.8+ band. No false escalation; coincidence is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—seed innovation without triggering Edict—signals early and tightens when horns approach. One meaningful deepening: realizing the lake-current variable could sink the model forces last-second recalibration with visible sweat. Cost is legible: if enforcers burst in before ink meets page, all futures collapse. Agency drives escalation; coincidence complicates (ice cracks) but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—narrative survival—tightens when drone scanners force the decision to sign off. The pirate broadcast is not mere backdrop; each lyric line raises detection risk, narrowing options. Dust’s visible swirl into orchestral shapes is the irreversible consequence that reweights the world.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“to crystallize a fleeting emotion before it dissolved”—is signaled early and tightened when the chair’s halt forces an immediate burn-or-lose decision. One meaningful deepening: the powdering converts memory into an irreversible physical state, narrowing future options. Cost is visible (cold ash in chest) and conceptual (he admits the portrait was partial). Agency is pure: every escalation step is Elias’s choice under pressure of the slowing chair.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—“preserve ancient methods”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and escalates with each stratum: ash questions, astrolabes answer, logbooks certify. One visible price per layer: ash smears his certainty, slate shards cut fingers, final fusion consumes scavenged wire and any chance of anonymity. Protagonist agency drives every turn; no coincidence resolves. Final broadcast is a confrontation that narrows his world to perpetual conflict with surface cults—cost felt in the cog’s metallic pulse against bone.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—braid hostile voices—signals early. Pressure escalates via accumulative softening rather than causal turns: voices “shed barbed edges” through mirrored drone, not forced choices. No visible price is paid by Elara or choristers; hatred dissolves rather than being traded off. Tightening occurs when Joren falters, but the moment is summarized, not dramatized, limiting escalation bandwidth.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—grow forbidden knowledge fruit—tightens once: pruning clears space, planting locks him into risk. No active antagonist or reversal, but the celestial deadline supplies a soft intensifier. Cost is conceptual (future exposure) rather than immediate; pressure is steady but never spikes. Sufficient for this length, yet lacks a tangible forfeiture that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—restore wonder within routine—is signaled in paragraph 3 and sharpened when the curse forces Elias to surrender his workaround. One meaningful tightening: the riddle’s reading narrows Mira’s options from “fix drones” to “rebirth hive,” foreclosing sabotage theories. Cost is visible—Elias’s loss of the box, Mira’s upward risk—but escalatory pressure is moderate; the climb is voluntary rather than forced by ticking clock. Agency remains with protagonists; coincidence complications zero.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—why houses breathe—signals early and tightens when Elias decodes the “shard of hush” as the missing communal pause. Agency is accumulative: each sanctification deepens texture rather than narrows options, culminating in the return ritual that reweights social silence. No reversible loss or tangible price is risked by Elias himself; the cost is conceptual—community exposed to its own displaced tokens. Escalation is present but gentle, a cadence shift rather than a crucible; pressure plateaus at lyric recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—moral certainty vs. nuanced truth—tightens three times via revelation cascade, each telepathic image forcing a recalibration of her ancestor’s guilt. Agency remains Elara’s: she demands proof, then physically touches the statue’s hand in acceptance, paying the price of perpetual moral ambiguity. Cost is visible: she surfaces without vengeance, choosing instead the harder path of inherited complexity. The foxglove ampoule’s fracture and resealing literalizes the irreversible trade-off: memory released cannot be unread.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: rupture eternal climb by proving self-sustaining loop; signaled first paragraph. Tightening occurs when rupture momentarily opens light of missed leap, then reseals—cost paid as renewed confinement. Agency is intellectual endurance; no external antagonist needed. Cost is conceptual: proof’s failure re-imprisons him with sharper regret—visible on page.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—proving kindness lingers—tightens through each visionary glyph: every caravan/healer episode narrows Elias’s option to quit, because the brush now demands public proof. Escalation is textural/accumulative: visions layer like translucent washes until the greenhouse panes themselves become a city-wide screen, a meaningful deepening that reweights the stake from private obsession to communal signal. Cost is visible—his trembling hand, years of insomnia—but the price is slightly abstract; no tangible object is forfeited except sleepless hours. Still, the final image of strangers lighting lanterns supplies a felt social cost that satisfies the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—keep art alive—faces concrete test when ice fails: stay and drown with archives or flee with only memory-encoded bread. One tightening suffices: the lens glimpse converts panic into plan, narrowing options to opera-house reclamation. Escalation is external yet agency remains collective, so price is loss of home rather than internal split. Cost is visible in abandoned halls now “perfumed with eternal rosewater dread,” a tomb for the arts they could not carry.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—break fate or die trying—signals in paragraph 1 and tightens when the stone begins to drink. Escalation is Accumulative: each backward click of the lighthouse costs flesh, visibly tracked (“skin tightening over bones”). One meaningful deepening: visions of harvests greening in reverse crystallize the price. No antagonist needed; the stone’s hunger is coherent pressure that forces the final smash.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—escape post-resuscitation limbo—signalled in opening breath. Escalation is causal: each paradoxical confession narrows Fear’s options while raising Elara’s self-exposure cost. Mid-scene tightening when she admits suicide wish forces Fear into physical range; final toss of clasp is irreversible tactical commitment. Price is her permanent seductive scar, foreclosing return to prior anonymity.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—preserve the fragile orchard—faces concrete test with each wave and beam. Escalation is accumulative: each dub layer increases harmonic density until the final crescendo repels the beam. Agency is continuous (sketch, lash, strike); no coincidence resolves. Felt cost is legible in the slump and “promise half-kept,” though the price could bite deeper.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—uncover watchers’ judgment—tightens with each whistle query that narrows to catastrophe. Escalation is coherent but single-arc; the mid-crack lurch is the only visible price, and it lands more on city than on Elara’s body, muting personal cost visibility.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—truth vs national myth—tightens when microscript reveals gas canisters, foreclosing “honourable sacrifice” reading. Escalation is single but decisive: Hale’s confession → worse crime → Elias must publish. Personal cost (grandfather) adds visceral price, yet external obstacle (vandal threat) is off-stage, so cost leans conceptual not bodily. Under causal lens, one meaningful tightening suffices; closure reconfigures options with undeniable social cost.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can he resurrect drowned dreams without drowning himself—tightens with each rising inch of water. Agency is relentless: every crack widened, note sealed, and breath sacrificed narrows the option to quit. The pinned-leg moment is the decisive reversal that prices the final archive. Cost is visceral: lungs aflame, inkwell bled dry, solitude enforced by the risen bridge.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—will she prove myth or human fault?—tightens the moment she fingers the stamp. One meaningful deepening: the ink that glows only in darkness flips her method from light-dependent to shadow-reliant, foreclosing retreat to old indices. Cost is legible: she trades collective comfort for isolating truth. Could edge higher if blackout clock visibly taxed her stamina or breath.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme—truth versus consoling myth—emerges through the shift from catalogued legend to signed blueprints, never stated. Subtext lives in gesture: the hush she once drowned in now “envelops her like a balm,” reweighting silence from menace to earned refuge. Final image reframes prior shelves of “dead lists” into living accountability. Avoids moralizing; the city’s guilt stays implicit in her sealed vault.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—transmute grief or be consumed by it—tightens through each polish-stroke and fold; every crane is a visible price paid. No external antagonist needed: pressure is internal, coherent, and escalates as the lantern’s glow grows unbearable. One meaningful deepening occurs when the first crane seals a shard of torment, foreclosing the option to stay paralyzed. Cost legibility peaks when the final crane lifts his shadow’s outline, leaving Elar lighter—stakes satisfied.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—harvest wasted vacuum energy to birth something from wedding ashes—is signaled in paragraph four and tightened when the 10-min blackout literally exposes the pool. Protagonist agency drives every beat: she initiates perturbation, ignores reboot, phases crystal, laughs at the spike. Cost is immediate and persistent—breakers resetting, world still crumbling, self re-configured. Stays just below 9 because the external world’s opposition is atmospheric, not embodied antagonist pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“decode the frequency of belonging”—is signaled early and escalates through one decisive tightening: lever pull that fuses star data into chip, foreclosing retreat. Cost is visible: Elara risks her skeptic’s safety, pilgrim pays with bodily collapse; both surrender outsider isolation. No reversal, but one meaningful narrowing suffices for 700-word frame. Coincidence is absent; agency is front-loaded on Elara’s pull.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—whether Elias will keep hiding behind falsified pasts—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when physical evidence of Mira’s real history literally washes to his feet. One meaningful escalation: discovery of matching crest + watch hand forces acknowledgement that his deception is no longer abstract. Pressure stays internal but coherent under Accumulative lens; each carving adds weight. The price is implicit—loss of the comfortable numbness his trade provided—but could be more viscerally concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—will apology avert renewed blood feud?—signaled in first 100 words. Tightening occurs when counterfeit pull is produced: apology must be physicalized or fail. Protagonist agency drives the turn; no coincidence resolves. Cost legible: she permanently loses the relic that once defined her cunning.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can Elias still trust any compass, celestial or cardiac?—is signaled in para 1 and tightened when the rogue swell floods his cockpit, forcing a live choice: quit or keep paddling by poles. The eighteenth-pole star alignment is the visible price moment: it forecloses retreat, validates his method, and leaves him sodden but oriented. Agency drives every escalation; coincidence complicates (swell) but does not resolve. Cost is legible: physical exhaustion, soaked clothes, and the symbolic shattered compass he still carries.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—“spark empathy in Elara”—is signaled early and tightened once: the lake forces a visible test (tear or no tear). Escalation is situational; pressure coheres as each tunnel fork eliminates retreat. Cost is legible: Jax risks physical descent and emotional exposure; Elara’s tear is the on-page price. No persistent constraint shapes later tactics, keeping this below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—reforge bond beyond death—signaled in paragraph three and tightened once: metamorphosis is irreversible, foreclosing human future. Escalation is textural: each spice added thickens ritual density until transformation hits. No false reversals; coincidence (cookie find) complicates, does not resolve. Cost is legible—permanent beast-form—but beat is single-paragraph, limiting bandwidth for higher-band pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“what penance for the hours I devoured?”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when she unfastens the saucer hinge, releasing the stolen seconds. Agency drives escalation: she chooses to press her newborn’s hand to the cloth, then chooses to implant the clockwork, narrowing her future from seer to mother. Cost is visceral: blood-loss shakes, tear-blur, the “velvet noose” of forgiveness. One meaningful reversal—The Hanged Time reversed—becomes literal as she descends from cloudbound stasis to mortal time.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake: open the locked dimension without violence. Escalation is accretive: each stitched shadow tightens the option space until only levity remains. The tightening is visible—rage→guilt→mirror of extinction—each foreclosing denial. Cost is literal weight loss; tactics shift from walking to floating, enabling the final console press.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—“understand transformation”—is abstract yet steadily intensified by environmental omens: crimson peak, aligning planets, widowed followers arriving healed. One meaningful tightening occurs when the volcanic gust literally snatches the satchel, forcing release; cost is communal awe and Elias’s shift from anonymous giver to mythic guide. Agency is partial (wind triggers release), but pressure remains coherent under situational lens. Could reach 8+ if Elias faced an explicit trade-off; here, escalation is ambient, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—ignite silent revolution—signaled in first third and escalates via each decoded angle. Tightening is present: each prong-lock narrows option space until the blue spark publicizes the flaw in the blackout. Cost is conceptual (exposure risk) rather than visceral; still, tactics are altered. Agency remains hers; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—transform curse into clarity—signals early and tightens with each rock sequence; every placement raises the risk of visionary overload. One meaningful deepening: the fifth rock ignites dust veins, eels surge, and a visible price is paid in Kael’s bodily laugh that ends the quest. Agency remains causal under accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the pressure. Cost is unmistakable on-page: “curse transmuted to gift” paired with physical laughter under aurora.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will Elias transmit his map once the timer hits zero—tightens with each click; the unsigned poem forces a trade-off between silence and amplified risk. Escalation is textural: density of storm/lightning imagery increases until the choice to re-wedged the envelope crystallizes irreversible complicity. Cost is felt in the “perpetual vigil” laugh; a hairline slip is that the external regime threat stays off-page, muting visceral danger one notch.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—intellectual rivalry versus external inquisitor threat—surfaces late; early tension is abstract “truth or blood.” Sundial cipher provides one tightening beat, but agency remains reactive: Elias decodes, Lang accepts; no fork forces either to sacrifice status or belief. Cost is announced (“destinations breed wars”) yet no concrete loss—blood, reputation, time—lands on page. Escalation is elegant but bloodless; resonance exceeds pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—poet must turn prison entropy into generative beauty—faces a credible loss: future personality “looms,” implying the friendship may not survive the next molt. Mid-scene deepening occurs when seeds convert abstract hope into illegal action; options narrow because discovery = seg box. Price is visible (patched roof, dented mugs, frost-bitten sprouts) and alters later tactics (tin becomes map cache). One tightening short of 8.8: a single guard interaction—torch beam across frost-blooms—would have crystallized jeopardy on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reverse Lira’s death-by-arbor—is signaled in paragraph 1; the film-reel map provides one decisive tightening that forecloses passive waiting. Escalation is the climb’s narrowing branches and the final tidal surge that almost deletes him; visible cost is blood-slick grip and surrendered daylight. Agency is continuous: every compass flicker demands a lateral move. Fate is challenged, not plot-armor-vanquished, preserving pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—cultural memory erasure—signaled immediately; pressure escalates only through lyrical countdown (“monsoon’s distant rumble”) rather than narrowing options. Guardian’s stirring is off-page catalyzed; Elara’s agency is interpretive, not decisive. No visible price exacted from her; success feels ornamental. Meets single meaningful tightening rule under Accumulative lens, but cost is intellectual, not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake: transmute regret into a portable color; tightening occurs when each prune physically vents grief, thinning the air until only the inward compass remains. Agency is renunciation—she keeps the ache instead of burying it; price paid is the exact shade of sky she must now bear. Coincidence absent; every escalation is her literal cut or breath. Persistent constraint: the compass will never point outward again—this cost is stated on-page and shapes future navigation.


== Grader: Qwen 3 Max ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—distilling truth from cosmic noise—is signaled early and deepens when Elena applies butterfly dust to data. Agency is clear: she gathers, dusts, rigs, observes. The escalation (mirrors → spectrometer → publication) is driven by her choices under the Accumulative lens. Yet cost remains abstract: we’re told her “grand theories felt overwrought,” but no tangible sacrifice (lost data, reputation, time) alters her tactics. The “visible price” gate for 8.8+ isn’t met—the decay is metaphorical, not material.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—protecting the canyon from smugglers via truth-exposure—is signaled early and deepens when ledger gaps reveal human doubt. Pressure escalates through Elara’s agency: she chooses to retrace paths, interpret frost, and weaponize light. Cost is legible (scorched kiln, physical pain), though the climactic confrontation feels slightly compressed. The pause-as-purpose insight sharpens stakes morally without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—translating silence into music—is signaled early and deepens when Kai’s rage threatens collapse. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses forks based on mapped emotions, guides Kai’s hand, initiates the finale. Cost is unmistakable: cracked glass, shared trauma, the risk of shattering their sanctuary. Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens, tightening via emotional density rather than external threats.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—giving rest a “permanent address”—is signaled early and deepens as distress signals intensify. Escalation is driven by Elias’s agency: he chooses increasingly perilous placements, each narrowing his survival options. The cost escalates from lung pressure to bodily dissolution, culminating in total self-sacrifice. Under the Accumulative lens, the tightening is textural—signals grow louder, spaces more impossible—but stakes remain coherent, and the final trade-off (life for silence) is unmistakable and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—survival through anonymous reciprocity—is signaled early and deepens when Mira urges paying forward despite Tomas’s resistance. The meaningful tightening occurs during Lena’s near-capture, which cements loyalty and multiplies donations. Agency drives escalation: Mira’s persuasion, Lena’s run, Tomas’s conversion. Cost is felt (fear, risk) but could be sharper—sanctions tighten abstractly, not through a specific lost resource that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding where unused love is stored—tightens decisively when Elias realizes it resides in connection, not location. His agency drives escalation: choosing to project Mira’s image, then guiding her breath, transforms passive seeking into active giving. Cost is felt: he relinquishes the monk’s solitary vow for relational vulnerability. Coincidence (Mira’s fall) complicates but doesn’t resolve; healing emerges from their synchronized effort, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—escaping retrocognitive entrapment to grasp time’s texture—is signaled early and tightens when the halo fragment appears. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he actively channels hyperbolic geometry, rotates the fragment, and triggers its disintegration. The cost is unmistakable: loss of his wife’s last image and the fragment itself. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each vision deepens torment until the decisive shattering.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—smuggling seeds to nourish exiles—is signaled early and escalates coherently when the Wall crumbles, compressing time and raising risk. Elara’s agency drives the key turn: decoding the piano keys reshapes her options. Wardens complicate but don’t resolve; luck (debris, timing) creates opportunity, but success hinges on her preparation. Cost is visible: months chained, near death, discarded chains as “old skin”—a charged symbol of sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—capturing trust’s breaking sound—is signaled early and tightens via the mitotic clock: “mere hours to work.” Elias’s agency drives escalation—he harvests absences, mixes auroral hum, imprints memory—each choice narrowing options under biological pressure. Cost is unmistakable: tears mingling with brine, memories crystallizing from torment into tool. Coincidence (aurora peaking) complicates but doesn’t resolve; victory stems from his labor, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—accessing fate’s whispers through illuminated moments—is signaled immediately and tightens when the bouquet’s reinterpretation shifts goal from theft to listening. Protagonist agency drives escalation: Elara’s decision to tilt the jar deepens knowledge, revealing glyphs that reframe the portrait’s subject and her own life. Cost is unmistakable: she abandons her thief identity, flees guards, and accepts uncertainty (“Had she stolen destiny, or had it chosen her?”). The single meaningful tightening—bouquet as warning, not map—narrows options from acquisition to attunement, consistent with the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—crafting safe zones against chaos—is signaled early and deepens through glassblowing acts. But escalation lacks protagonist-driven tightening; external conditions (thawing ice) facilitate rather than challenge his work. No meaningful trade-off occurs: he gathers glass, narrates, succeeds. The “abandonment of solitude” is declared, not tested under duress. Cost is implied (“memories of lost kin thawed”) but never dramatized as a sacrifice that alters tactics or risks failure.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming identity—is signaled early and tightens when Harlan’s men approach. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she decodes notes, interprets coordinates, exploits his thalassophobia. Cost is felt: her arm broke from his lies; now she weaponizes her trauma. The “outwit” turn is earned through adaptive agility, though the aerosol poison vial feels slightly tacked-on before being wisely cut for physical confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—navigating endless night—is signaled early and deepens when “retelling what was lost” becomes the only tactic. Pressure tightens as stars vanish and storm intensifies, forcing Elara’s plea and the oracle’s demonstration. Cost is conceptual: wisdom requires surrendering to silence, not action. Agency lies in attention, not intervention—a valid Earned Stasis under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—tracing thought’s genesis—is signaled early and tightens through each loop, narrowing options from raw code to quantum potential to interstitial emergence. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: playing the violin initiates loops, and resisting overload warnings enables deeper cognition. Cost is unmistakable—the violin’s destruction, irreversible sublimation—and alters tactics (resuming sweep with new wisdom). While pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens, the tightening lacks a single decisive trade-off beyond endurance; hence just shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—thawing mistrust through transparency—is signaled early and deepens when Elias uses the lens and tickets to bypass words. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: his choice to intervene forces Mira’s confrontation with self-deception. Cost is legible—Elias abandons his registrar role, Mira surrenders protective lies—but the conflict lacks external resistance; stakes remain internalized, slightly muting tension. Still, the single tightening (ticket placement) effectively narrows emotional options.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—proving gardens reward devoted hands—is signaled early and tightens when auditors arrive with demolition decree. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his ritual polishing forces the scanners to contradict their own dogma. Cost is unmistakable: his 1.9 luck quotient isolates him socially and professionally, yet he persists. The deepening (marbles transforming from symbols of failure to talismans of resilience) reweights the entire premise under protagonist-led action, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—proving sideways time—is signaled early and deepens when Elara covertly integrates nexus tech into emergency drone repairs, narrowing her options under duress. Escalation stems from her agency, not coincidence, culminating in lever-pull that forecloses skepticism. Cost is felt in colleagues’ gasps and altered perception, though physical or social price remains lightly rendered. Pressure tightens coherently under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—deciphering Elara’s code to bridge living and dead—is signaled early and tightens when Elias must disrupt to reveal the glyph. His agency drives escalation: choosing destruction (yanking lantern) leads directly to revelation and flood. Cost is felt: the house groans, alarms wail, the program is lost. Only minor deduction: the foundation crack feels slightly outsized for a single grate-pull, briefly straining plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—bearing the cost of ambiguous truth—is signaled early and tightens when Elara realizes her “swaying prophecy” caused death. The deepening occurs at the desk: swallowing the berry demanded reckoning, forcing her from margin-occupation to direct confrontation via smudging. Agency drives escalation—her choice to alter the illustration crystallizes stance. Cost is unmistakable: “each oracle carried fatalities,” “bending her resilient frame.”

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—unearthing swallowed guilt—is signaled early and tightens when the radio calls implicate him. The deepening occurs via his own anonymous confession, narrowing options: he must face the truth or remain haunted. Cost is felt (“thirteen souls including his own brother”) and shapes the final act. Coincidence (radio show) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the agency remains his.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—access to regenerative silence—is signaled early and tightens when the swan appears. The keeper’s agency lies in choosing to follow its method, narrowing his path from observer to seeker. Escalation occurs through embodied ritual (folding, chanting angles), not coincidence. Cost is subtle but present: bodily compression, frayed nerves, and irreversible descent. However, stakes remain abstractly spiritual; a more visceral forfeiture (e.g., losing a ledger) would heighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—rekindling wonder amid grief—is signaled early and tightens during the eclipse’s unnatural twilight. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses the location, plays the harp, offers the locket. Cost is felt: he surrenders his most sacred object. The deepening occurs when music syncs with Lila’s breath, narrowing emotional distance. However, the eclipse’s mechanics don’t alter tactics—it’s atmospheric, not causal—limiting pressure complexity under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving stories before they vanish into the dreamless void—is signaled early and deepens when Thorne discovers the diarist’s failed attempt to realign the axis. His agency lies in attention and transcription, not physical intervention; this renunciation forecloses salvation but secures legacy. The cost—eternal solitude in a breathing ruin—is felt in the hush, and escalation arises organically from his perceptive probing, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (breaking stagnation via covert intervention) is signaled early and tightens decisively when Elias chooses to weaponize his fortunes. Escalation is driven by his agency: embedding film, altering the beam, luring spies. Cost is unmistakable—he risks everything to shift from observer to maestro. Coincidence (finding specs) complicates but doesn’t resolve; his actions earn the outcome. Slight deduction: the spies’ arrival feels slightly convenient, though their dialogue confirms established open secrets.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving anchored stillness against chaotic unraveling—is signaled early and deepens via Elias’s rhetorical method, which narrows the entity’s epistemic foothold. Agency is expressed through renunciation (rejecting motion-as-liberation) and endurance (looping silence into defense). Cost is unmistakable: the palette empties, silence becomes eternal, and the shadow’s near-completion exacts tension. Escalation is driven by protagonist choice under Accumulative pressure, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—orchestrating lost time into audible harmony—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when exhaustion looms, forcing Elara to press on despite bodily collapse. The deepening occurs when the lake’s surface ripples and “mirrored horizon folding time upon itself,” raising stakes by making success temporally urgent. Protagonist agency drives escalation: she chooses to descend, kneel, map, hum, and crescendo. Cost is unmistakable—physical depletion, visible in trembling limbs and deepening shadows—and directly shapes her final act of collapse-as-completion.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—wholeness through retracing fractured timelines—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when Elias confronts alternate selves as minotaurs. Protagonist agency drives escalation: each retrace generates new configurations via procedural logic, narrowing options until the final confrontation. Cost is legible in the viaduct’s flickering glow and sweat on Elias’s brow despite suspension. Coincidence never resolves; all turns stem from Elias’s defiant choices under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—defeating emotional numbness—is signaled early and tightens when the backward song reveals the filament of hush, narrowing Elara’s path from hollow repetition to communal ritual. Protagonist agency drives escalation: she chooses to mend, crank backward, and orchestrate rites. Cost is felt: Thorne’s tears, the youth’s tremors, her own vulnerability. Coincidence (finding the needle) complicates but doesn’t resolve; her deliberate backward spin earns the breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—verifying truth amid institutional denial—is signaled early and tightens when Elara realizes the message is bait. Her agency drives escalation: cross-referencing logs, sketching vectors, intuiting weaponized pigeons. Cost is felt: solitude becomes both refuge and burden, with no safety net. The deepening (“storms don’t just record themselves—they reveal patterns in the oblique”) narrows options to silent witnessing, consistent with the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—confronting memory’s tyranny through scent—is signaled early and tightens when Elias uncorks the vial, narrowing his choice to endure or flee. His agency drives escalation: he chooses to ignite the lantern, release the aroma, and finally inhale fully. The cost is visceral (sobs, buckling knees) and conceptual (accepting pain as tribute). While pressure accumulates beautifully, the “ultraviolet revealing method” verges on deus ex machina, slightly softening the organic cause-effect chain.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—discovering time’s texture—is signaled early and deepens through three layers of luminous revelation. Elias’s agency drives escalation: each verse peels back veils, forcing higher-stakes choices. The binary fork (sever rope or remain adrift) tightens options credibly, and his integrative solution emerges from prior patterning. Cost is felt in the loss of pure freedom, though the “impossible choices” concept slightly abstracts in mid-section before grounding in the rope’s fusion.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—restoring meaning through unfinished beauty—is signaled early and deepens when Lir risks vulnerability by sharing his own fragment. Agency drives escalation: he calls survivors, initiates tale-passing, and plays his father’s memory, each act narrowing retreat into solitude. Cost is felt in communal tears and the hush’s resistance thickening around flames. The single meaningful tightening occurs when Lir shifts from collector to conduit, transforming passive grief into active unbinding.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—emotional authenticity versus survivable illusion—is signaled early and deepens as Mira’s transformation accelerates. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he adjusts the petal, channels static, and subsumes raw grief into counterfeit calm. The cost—permanent detachment for both—is felt in Mira’s “luminous stillness” and Elias’s pocketed petal. Pressure tightens coherently under Accumulative/Textural lens without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—recognition of silent compassion—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes Mira funded his rise. The tightening occurs when he chooses to initiate friendship, foreclosing continued anonymity. Cost is felt in Mira’s trembling admission and Elias’s vulnerability, though escalation leans slightly on coincidence (envelope mix-up) rather than pure agency.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—belonging through kinship—is signaled early and tightens as the search draws others in, culminating in the arbor dedication. Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens, though escalation leans on emotional convergence rather than protagonist-driven turns. Cost is felt (residual ache, imperfect ties) but not dramatized as a foreclosed alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—capturing the Echo Cradle before silence—tightens meaningfully as sculptures block the path and the giant’s stir looms. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she borrows time, reads cadence flaws, and dissolves barriers. Cost is unmistakable—the pendant’s glow fades, implying spent time—and the narrowing window forces irreversible commitment. Coincidence (giant napping) complicates but doesn’t resolve; victory stems from her skill and heirloom.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—resolving ambiguous loss through emotion’s mathematics—is signaled early and deepens via Thorne’s dovetail ritual, which forecloses passive grief in favor of active, risky creation. Pressure escalates texturally: silence → whisper → hum → vision cascade. The cost is visible (emptied pouch, fractured self now “dovetailed”) and conceptual (accepting uncertainty as pivot). No coincidence resolves tension; agency lies in Thorne’s meticulous, inventive choices.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—becoming visible to those in need—is signaled early and deepens when the sob echoes, forcing Elias from methodical routine into risk. His agency drives escalation: uncovering the nook, placing the cache, revealing himself. Cost is felt: he sacrifices decades of protective invisibility. Coincidence (finding his wife’s tape) complicates but doesn’t resolve; his choice to act does.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—comprehending plant resilience from within—is signaled early and deepens via Elias’s irreversible choice to ingest the leaf-tea. Pressure escalates texturally: humidity → deluge → gales → metamorphosis, each intensifying his commitment. Cost is felt (loss of human form, memories, autonomy) and visible in rooted legs and fragmented thoughts. Though agency diminishes post-consumption, the initial act is decisive, and the trade-off (humanity for eternal observation) is starkly rendered in the final stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—threshing meaning from ruin—is signaled early and deepens when rain trails offer ephemeral order. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he abandons his easel, follows trails, unearths the altar, and chooses exchange over possession. Cost is visible: his sleepless isolation ends not in rest but “convergence with purpose,” a Charged Poise where artistic stance crystallizes. Coincidence (rain) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the exchange is earned through mutual recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—magnifying everyday magic—is signaled early and deepens when the unseen forces reveal their true aim: subtle enchantment, not grand sorcery. The tightening occurs when the cave pearl is uncovered, raising stakes from prophecy to embodiment. Elara’s resistance then surrender shows agency under pressure, though the forces’ motives arrive via exposition rather than dramatized negotiation. Cost is felt: she forfeits her solitary clarity for cosmic duty.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—compiling fragments into communal meaning—is signaled early and deepens through three staggered intervals that narrow Elias’s method from solitary archiving to public invocation. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each note raises emotional stakes and alters crowd response. However, escalation leans on external triggers (spray) rather than Elias’s agency forcing trade-offs; he never risks failure or backlash. Cost is felt socially (grief softened) but not personally, limiting tactical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—accessing the fortress of unspoken truths—is signaled early and tightens through escalating dares (punching air, bricks, final gate). Each punch forecloses retreat; the cost is conceptual (truth’s weight shattering habits) and tactical (condensation-slick stairs, dissolving barriers). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: density of spectral phenomena increases, culminating in the fortress. Agency drives escalation—Elias chooses each punch, each descent.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—sculpting space for reflection amid loss—is signaled early and deepens when the tile forces Elara to confront her own grief. The tightening occurs when she chooses transcription over skepticism, narrowing her path to one of vulnerable sharing. Cost is felt: she endures emotional exposure to serve others’ healing. Coincidence (the fisherman’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve; agency lies in her persistent kindness.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—discovering what follows eternal goodbye—is signaled early and tightens when the amulet binds Elowen to the mutiny. His agency drives escalation: he modulates magnetic pulses, inverts fields, and ignites convergence. Cost is visible—the escondite’s unraveling, spectral guardians as warnings—but the spatial mutiny’s mechanics occasionally verge on abstract, slightly diluting visceral pressure. Still, the trade-off (immortality for wonder) crystallizes with undeniable weight at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—political asylum—is signaled early and tightens via the patrol timing calculus. Pressure escalates coherently under the Causal lens: discovery of ink → mental thaw → tactical refinement → precise breach. Agency drives escalation; coincidence plays no role. Cost is felt in Eli’s relinquished absolutism, though the external peril remains slightly abstracted by the story’s brevity.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving history through invented textures—is signaled early and deepens when the lamp’s hum forces engagement with the town’s real trauma, narrowing Thorne’s options from curated escape to vulnerable witness. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency: his stylus “flying” to capture jagged peaks initiates the crisis. Cost is unmistakable: his “invented histories cracking like thin ice” and the emotional toll of transcribing neighbors’ “final sighs.” Under the Accumulative lens, density increase (papyrus + cordite) reweights the stake with visceral consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming erased identity through memory texture—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency: each overheard fragment is actively layered, narrowing options (retreat during high tide, risk deeper stacks at ebb). The tightening occurs when storm-tide fragments resonate with their own death certificate, forcing confrontation with sabotage. Cost is unmistakable: survival required nameless flight, and reclaiming history demands enduring the labyrinth’s ghosts. Coincidence complicates (overheard tales) but resolution stems from their methodical accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—decoding the riddle—is signaled early and deepens when the shell’s hum transforms memory into music, narrowing options to sonic retelling. Agency drives escalation: Elias chooses to bow, reinterpret, and finally laugh, accepting transience. Cost is felt in sweat, flaking paint, and the irreversible closing of pages. Coincidence never resolves; the ghost remains absent by design.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving Aquafeste’s soul against gentrification—tightens decisively when Kai reveals contracts, forcing Elara to choose coded art over futile protests. Escalation is protagonist-driven: each mural adapts to enforcer patrols, narrowing options until the midnight flotilla shuffle. Cost is felt in erased walls and desperate families’ whispers, crystallizing at the yacht hull spray-paint act. Privatization’s lingering shadow ensures stakes remain urgent, not resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—photographing the last relic before lunar industrialization—is signaled early and tightens when oxygen warning forces Elias to endure until dawn. His agency drives escalation: he chooses chemical flares over passive waiting, calibrating reactions to lunar cold. Cost is unmistakable: physical depletion, risk of death, and melancholic awareness that this act marks the end of “exploratory purity.” The rescue rover’s arrival doesn’t erase cost; it underscores how narrowly he outlasted, making the victory fragile and time-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—repairing the drone before anchor lifts—is signaled early and tightens relentlessly. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his commands dictate each diagnostic turn, culminating in the polymer patch that restores flight. Cost is felt in lost opportunity (he stays ashore), though not physically dramatized. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under Causal lens with one decisive deepening: decoding turbulence from feedback.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—locating the singular convergence—is signaled early and deepens when runes warn of it. Harlan’s agency drives escalation: he decodes, overlays maps, plots the trek. The tightening occurs when condensation confirms coordinates, narrowing options to one perilous path. Cost is felt in the “worrying tranquility” that follows him—a psychological price for certainty. Coincidence (falcon’s return) complicates but doesn’t resolve; decoding and interpretation are earned.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—reviving Perivale through rhythm—is signaled early and tightens once when ghost steps emerge. But escalation lacks protagonist-driven agency: the tuning fork “seeks a match,” and revival unfolds automatically once resonance begins. No trade-off or loss alters tactics; Elias never risks failure. Cost is conceptual (decades of searching) but not dramatized during the climax. Under Accumulative lens, density increases sufficiently, yet pressure remains externalized, not sharpened by moral calculus or irreversible choice.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—harnessing the ephemeral before death—tightens relentlessly via oxygen depletion and vortex resistance. Lirael’s agency drives escalation: each knot undone requires overriding instinct, with visible cost (time, air, panic). The distress signal complicates but doesn’t resolve; rescue arrives only after she succeeds alone. Final trade-off—nearly dying for eternal silence—is unmistakable and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—redeeming his bloodline through narrative control—is signaled early and tightens when Elias binds shades with confessions, transforming passive curse into active weaving. The meaningful deepening occurs at the father’s apparition: truth-telling replaces lies, reweighting the entire vendetta from revenge to witness. Cost is felt in hidden bodies and the fragile temporality of “before they found the bodies.” Though guards remain off-stage threats, their eventual discovery looms as irreversible consequence, sustaining pressure without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—repaying a karmic debt through loving sacrifice—is signaled early and deepens via each cameo. Pressure escalates texturally: whispers → touch → kiss → shared death. The ghost’s agency drives escalation, but Elias’s consumption of the pear is his sole active turn, narrowing options fatally. Cost is unmistakable: euphoria fused with venom, mortal coil unraveled. Coincidence (bead tumbling) complicates but doesn’t resolve; causality remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—replacing broken precedents with living reverence—is signaled early and deepens when Elara defies the low-tide taboo. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: her sleepwalking stitch-work actively reweaves chaos into coherence. Cost is felt (ruined village, drowned cottage) and conceptual (abandoning ancestral rigidity). However, the “overlapping sleepwalking paths” mechanic resolves too cleanly; the spectral wanderers appear conveniently without prior friction, slightly softening the pressure’s bite.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—realigning fate through ritual restoration—is signaled early and deepens as each artifact reveals failed pilgrimages. Agency drives escalation: Elara chooses to dig, scavenge, rebuild despite spectral warnings. Cost is felt in relentless toil and emotional vulnerability (“faith flickered”). Coincidence never resolves; the sundial’s discovery stems from purposeful wandering, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—delivering whistleblower secrets undetected—is signaled early and escalates via physical vulnerability (sweat, scanning for tails). Agency is clear: Elara chooses low-tech encoding over digital safety, accepting risk of detection. Cost is visible (exhaustion, exposure) and narrows options (no retries if code fails). Coincidence (vendor bot) complicates but doesn’t resolve; pressure tightens organically under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—exposing forged starlogs to prevent a coup—is signaled early and tightens when Elara detects “one thread pulled awry.” Escalation is driven by her agency: tilting the candle, synchronizing stitches, slipping the chart to the courier. Cost is felt: her feigned frailty isolates her, yet enables subterfuge. The Accumulative lens intensifies pressure through textual density (embroidery details, cosmic whispers), not external confrontation, culminating in Charged Poise—the queen now holds truth, coup imminent but defeatable.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming the unspoken apology—is signaled early and tightens through Elara’s escalating acts: evoking spirits, drawing in mist, pushing deeper despite visions fracturing. The meaningful deepening occurs at the throne-of-roots window, where she stakes everything on a liminal reunion. Cost is felt (tears, gash, hollowed spirit) and visible in the shard’s lunar healing. Agency drives escalation, though the spirits’ aid edges toward external grace; however, their song responds to her unsent letters, keeping pressure character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transforming inherited trauma into shared resilience—is signaled early and tightens through Elara’s decryption: each note reveals deeper fear, escalating pressure until the final plea (“Untie me before I sink”) forces her decisive act. Agency is clear: her choice to untie the string and whisper truths forecloses isolation, with cost felt in her cracked innocence and tears. The Accumulative lens justifies one meaningful deepening (the three-note progression), though a second live option (e.g., walking away) would heighten tension further.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (recovering lost joy) is signaled early and deepens when the fresco reveals ancestral revelry, raising emotional stakes. Agency is clear: Elara chooses to project the light-mural publicly, transforming private grief into shared memory. Cost is felt (“heart ached with rediscovered warmth”) and visible in her tears, though the escalation hinges more on discovery than tactical trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. illusion—is signaled early and deepens when Lena’s certainty fractures under sonic pressure. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his hum + nickel reflection forces three nested awakenings, each narrowing Lena’s options until only curiosity remains viable. Cost is unmistakable: Lena’s identity as a debunker collapses, replaced by apprentice vulnerability. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; Elias’s methodical whimsy engineers the turn, satisfying Situational lens pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—defending untaxed thought—is signaled early and deepens via Elias’s bolder patterns and Voss’s invocation. Pressure coheres under Accumulative logic: each layer (gardens, drones, beetles, mob) tightens the lattice of rebellion. Cost is unmistakable: Bureau shock troops batter the doors as reality folds, implying imminent violence. Escalation stems from protagonist agency (planting, harvesting, scattering seeds), not coincidence, though rival gardeners’ role feels underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—transmuting insomnia-born pain into beauty—is signaled early and tightens when the postcard offers “stellar peace,” forcing Elowen’s final choice. However, escalation depends on the postcard’s fortuitous arrival rather than protagonist-driven pressure; his agency lies in acceptance, not creation of opportunity. The “blossom armistice” crystallizes stakes, but the cost remains abstract (centuries of longing) without a specific forfeiture. Under Accumulative lens, density increases via recurring motifs, yet the turning point lacks causal teeth.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving forgotten names before they dissolve—is signaled early and tightens as the tube cracks, raising cost with each wing. Agency is clear: Elara chooses to press on despite peril, culminating in the tube’s destruction to save Lirien’s echo. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates via sensory density (winds grow fiercer, light flares brighter) and emotional stakes (nearer to Lirien’s name). The final trade-off—tool for memory—is earned and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restoring trust before dawn—is signaled early and tightens causally: each vow risks lexical backlash while narrowing emotional distance. Agency is clear (Elara chooses each inscription), and cost is visible (Thorne’s skepticism, guardian wraith threat). Escalation peaks when symphonies reveal hidden motives, forcing Thorne’s stance shift. Coincidence never resolves; all turns stem from Elara’s “carefully reckless” agency under Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—harmonizing progress and tradition—is signaled early and tightens when Elias decodes the envelope, forcing a trade-off: retrofit invisibly or desecrate openly. His agency drives escalation: analyzing adhesive, public decryption, valve redesign. Cost is unmistakable—“machinist’s vigilance harmonizing flux” implies eternal labor. Coincidence (finding envelope) complicates but doesn’t resolve; solution stems from his skill and ancestral insight.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—preserving intangible echoes against time’s erosion—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s shift from preserving only his wife’s memory to including Lila’s voice in the “duet.” The meaningful tightening occurs when Lila discovers the truth, forcing Elias to choose between maintaining his myth or risking real connection. His agency drives escalation: he sends the real journals unprompted, accepting potential rejection. Cost is felt in his trembling hand, the chill in the attic, and the vulnerability of admitting the chip is “bought from a dealer for a pittance”—a sacrifice of dignity for honesty.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding why thresholds feel sacred—is signaled early and tightens when the logbook reveals “necessary distance from shear line holds the veil.” Elowen’s agency drives escalation: she cross-references grain, unlocks the compass, realigns prisms. Cost is unmistakable (“lose the light”) and shapes her final act of “weaving distance into arrival.” Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, though the “butterfly effect” remains abstract rather than viscerally threatening.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—belonging’s rhythm—is signaled early and tightens when summer currents trigger fireflies, forcing Elara and Theo into synchronized vigil. The shared exhale isn’t coincidence but agency: their choice to breathe together *enables* the vision. Cost is legible in Theo’s abandoned exile and Elara’s surrendered solitude. Under Accumulative lens, escalation reads as density increase—feather glow, holographic maps, firefly pulses converging—culminating in a Charged Poise where options (isolation vs. connection) crystallize with irrevocable clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recovering why paths disappear—is signaled early and deepens when the bird’s seeds activate the crater glass, narrowing options to interpretation rather than collection. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her conjecture becomes method, transforming passive gathering into active mapping. Cost is felt in the “missing pieces” that remain even after revelation, and in her acknowledgment of her own path’s barren rooting. Coincidence (the bird) complicates but doesn’t resolve—Elara must still interpret.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—combating soul-crushing monotony through orchestrated creativity—is signaled early and deepens when Jasper targets Elara’s specific despair. Escalation is driven by his agency: he doesn’t wait for chance but engineers it, narrowing options via precise physics. Cost is legible: his sweat, the risk of failure, and Elara’s visceral reawakening (“floodgates burst”). Coincidence (the man’s pawn tattoo) complicates but doesn’t resolve; connection emerges from their mutual response to the bishop.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—inscribing cosmic verse on mortal skin—is signaled early and tightens when the anchor pins Elara, seemingly making her goal impossible. Her agency drives escalation: observing gaps reweights the anchor’s power, enabling flight. Cost is felt—exile’s sacrifice, panic’s fracture—and the final choice forecloses eternal solitude. Coincidence (wind-tumbled relic) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from her skill and perception.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—mending overlooked fractures before the gale—is signaled early and deepens when ripples reveal communal desperation. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his toss initiates visions, his communion extracts wisdom. Cost is conceptual (broken pacts, hoarded whispers) and felt (weight of “overlooked days” in the pebble). However, the “tempest from the north” remains abstract; external pressure lacks concrete on-page manifestation beyond omens, slightly muting visceral stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—translating pain into universal language—is signaled early and deepens when Lena appears, forcing Elias to enact rather than merely contemplate his mission. The meaningful tightening occurs when he opens the box: a renunciation of solitude for mentorship, with visible cost (retraumatization). Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens, though the inciting sob borders on coincidence. Stakes remain viscerally felt through embodied objects and tears.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—revitalizing hope through equations—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully: each trial balloon responds to timeline-specific failures (rigid hope, geometric despair), narrowing options until the helix pattern becomes necessary. Agency is clear; Elara adjusts tactics based on feedback (algae pulses, needle quivers). Cost is felt in the shadow timeline’s limp balloons and the grotto’s trembling, though the price feels conceptual rather than visceral. Escalation under the Accumulative lens is strong but lacks a single decisive physical forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—uncovering ancestral truth—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency: Elias follows drafts, sifts diaries, traces maps, and develops the film through echo. The tightening occurs when Elara’s warning crystallizes risk (“Develop it not in light, but in echo”), forcing a method that heightens vulnerability. Cost is unmistakable: the “legacy’s burden” transforms into duty only after confronting seismic betrayal, with vines physically reclaiming the manor as judgment. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—density of whispers, ash, and trembling fingers narrows his path to confession.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—renewing her borrowed heartbeat to sustain mirror-altering art—is signaled early and deepens through the lullaby sequence. But escalation is atmospheric, not tactical: no choice narrows her path or forces sacrifice. The “cost” of dissolution is stated, not dramatized as a foreclosed alternative (e.g., choosing renewal over saving one child). Pressure remains coherent yet static; success arrives via accumulation, not agency-driven tightening under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—transforming hollow peace into tangible practice—is signaled early and deepens when Elara confronts delegates with personalized truths (“your son’s grave,” “famine feeds on steel”). The tightening occurs at the altar: signing demands immediate, visceral cost (pride, grudges, blood). Escalation is driven by Elara’s agency, though celestial alignment borders on convenient pressure. Cost is unmistakable: her life force seals the rite, and the war’s embers persist, denying tidy victory.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—redemption through symbolic resurrection—is signaled early and tightens when Elias deciphers the crack-map. His agency drives escalation: he chooses secrecy over spectacle, placing the egg despite knowing it may never hatch. Cost is felt (emotional exposure, perpetuated hypocrisy) and visible (tears, walking away as storm breaks). Coincidence (rain arriving) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the gamble remains unresolved, preserving tension.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—freedom from enforced conformity—is signaled early and tightens through Elara’s bodily poetic untangling, which forecloses passive compliance. Escalation is driven by her agency: each freed thread harvests louder echoes, cracking crowd serenity. Cost is felt in the collective alarm and halted snow, though personal sacrifice remains conceptual rather than visceral. Under Accumulative lens, the deepening via echo density suffices, but a sharper tactical trade-off (e.g., physical toll) would elevate cost clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—ethical storytelling—is signaled early and tightens when the troupe’s accusation forces Elias to confront cruelty masked as critique. His agency drives escalation: alone, he chooses reversal, not out of defeat but clarified purpose. Cost is felt in the loss of his performative power (“thrill of control”) and future seedy venues. The single deepening—realizing subversion scars more than it heals—is sufficient and coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—honoring overlooked lepidopteran histories—is signaled early and tightens as monarchs dwindle and wind threatens dissolution. Elara’s agency drives escalation: each tower heightens signal complexity, culminating in the chest-high structure that draws hundreds. Cost is visible in trembling hands, pollen-dusted knots, and the irreversible loss when wind undoes the first knot. Coincidence (breeze timing) complicates but doesn’t resolve; dissolution is method-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving erased names—is signaled early and deepens when the card becomes the key to channeling auroras. Pressure escalates coherently: guilt → exile → discovery → ritual reconfiguration. The tightening occurs at the altar: threading the card into the rope forecloses failure (snap = silence). Cost is felt in Elara’s frozen-thawed tears and the sanctum’s groaning ice—a physical manifestation of memory cracking through time’s frost.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—discovering why paths choose walkers—is signaled early and tightens when the directive reveals its purpose: “Paths choose walkers to renew the weave.” Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to enter, recline, interpret, and finally reseal. Cost is unmistakable—the directive decays to dormancy, and she assumes its burden. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure deepens via dream-cascades and glitching code, not causal turns, which is appropriate.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the tile to commune with the Unknown—is signaled early and tightens as rebel scouts approach, raising urgency. Escalation is driven by Ezar’s agency: each schematic deepens revelation, culminating in coordinates to a rift. Cost is visible in thrifty sacrifices (lamp oil, reused tools) and the forsaken chance to claim power. Coincidence complicates (regime collapse) but never resolves; the covenant emerges solely from Ezar’s rigor.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—release resentment or remain armored—is signaled early and deepens through cellular-memory probes that narrow Thorne’s options (grace vs. rigidity). Escalation is driven by Elias’s winding, which forces Thorne to confront betrayal after betrayal, each deepening raising emotional cost. The final choice (release) forecloses vengeance with tangible loss (lovers, mentorship). Coincidence never resolves; all pressure stems from protagonist agency under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recapturing a lost future—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s tactical escalation: from mirror placement to breath synchronization. Agency drives every turn; luck (a star-prick) complicates but doesn’t resolve. The meaningful tightening occurs when breaths merge fogs, narrowing options to one fragile method. Cost is felt: years of isolation, the friend’s death (sextant as relic), and the risk of embracing illusion. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—density of light and reflection reweights hope into tangible reunion.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—bridging generational wisdom through mending seer’s eyes—is signaled early and tightens when Lila reveals quartz eyes are failing “since our breach.” Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: their joint climb under storm pressure forces trade-offs (risking falls for repair). Cost is unmistakable: Elias nearly crushed, Lila’s pride swallowed. The tightening forecloses the path of isolation, making reunion necessary, not sentimental.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—accessing nonlinear inheritance—is signaled early and tightens when the spirit demands Elara engrave her query, forcing active creation over passive reception. The deepening occurs in the bathroom: realization that the cameo is “a page between first and last,” requiring her to inscribe intent. Cost is conceptual (“what chaos might her engraving unleash?”) and felt through “brightened disquiet.” Escalation is driven by Elara’s agency, though the stakes remain abstract rather than viscerally perilous, limiting pressure intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—accessing the Library of Unlearned Lessons—is signaled early and tightens through three escalating rescues, each narrowing options via resource depletion (ink rationing) and knowledge gain (pact gaps). Elara’s agency drives escalation: her linguistic skill decodes flora, sound-weaves, storm-diagrams. Cost is unmistakable: physical risk (strangled scholar), temporal instability (traveler’s faltering), and intellectual labor (researching gaps). Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from protagonist action.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—recapturing lost identity through narrative—tightens meaningfully when Elara binds threads to the swatch card, each recitation narrowing options toward the garden’s archway. Agency is clear: her choices activate memory, part fog, and awaken the ship. Cost is legible in “unkindled solace”—peace without fire—and the final trade: reunion within eternal recurrence. Escalation follows Accumulative logic: density of threads increases pressure, culminating in vessel-shudder and archway birth.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—translating confusion into clarity—is signaled early and deepens as Elara confronts contradictory fables. The tightening occurs when she chooses to merge seal and rope, foreclosing passive cataloging for active intervention. Yet escalation relies on discovered lore rather than rising opposition; pressure is atmospheric, not adversarial. Cost is conceptual (absences made present), but lacks tangible sacrifice—no time lost, no trust broken, no physical toll—diminishing felt stakes under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming core harmony before the world’s “fragile hush” unravels—is signaled early and deepens through the spiral node discovery. The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses stillness over resistance, narrowing options to a single ritual act. Cost is felt: her vigil continues eternally, and the energy beings remain, only withdrawn. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves pressure. One trade-off (endless duty for temporary sanctuary) charges the ending without overstating global consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—proving coincidences have meaning—tightens when the shard sharpens visions into “crystalline truths,” forcing Elara to risk everything on celestial alignment. Escalation is protagonist-driven: nights of vigil, etching charts, climbing storm-lashed core—all narrow options toward one fragile chance. Cost is legible: emotional toll of doubt (“screams fading to wind” silenced by shard), physical peril in storm, and existential risk of failure. Coincidence complicates (storms, cloud cover) but resolution stems from her agency—tracking, aligning, positioning.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—sculpting identity from collective memory before it fractures—is signaled early and tightens through three shadow readings, each narrowing options: fracture, weave-tightening, schism, then erasure. Agency is clear: her conjectures are active interpretations that reconfigure understanding. Cost is felt (fear of vanishing identity) and conceptual (memory’s fragility), though the escalation relies more on accumulative pressure than a single decisive turn. The forked shadow and compressed lightning moment effectively raise stakes without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (defying hopelessness via pyrotechnic defiance) tightens when the mosaic reveals a firework blueprint—narrowing Elias’s aim from random sparks to precise replication. Agency drives escalation: his spinning, chanting, and mixing are deliberate acts that transform passive despair into communal wonder. Cost appears in physical labor, scarce powders, and emotional vulnerability (“laughter bubbled”), though opportunity cost of prior wanderings remains implicit.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—navigating the liminal pain of transition—is signaled early and deepens when Elaron uses the cicada to reframe Mira’s departure. The tightening occurs in the vision sequence, where past/future friction yields nacre-like resilience, foreclosing Mira’s self-perception as broken. Cost is conceptual (loss of old identity) and felt (trembling hands → softened eyes), though external consequences remain implied rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—collecting silences as rebellion against enclosure—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully during the inversion: the gilded hush sprout emerges only when gravity flips, forcing Elara into claustrophobic vine-weaves that test her resolve. Protagonist agency drives escalation (she limits exposure, drapes her scarf), and cost is unmistakable—the panic she must “stretch into resolve.” The noise-weaver’s intrusion complicates but doesn’t resolve; Elara’s escape relies on prior tactics. One tightening suffices, and the price (enduring fear to harvest opulent peace) charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—can silence heal transit-battered souls?—is signaled early and tightens when the children’s chatter spikes the vial, forcing Elias to catalyze change. His agency drives escalation: he chooses to intervene, apply catalyst, and guide perception. Cost is felt in Mira’s tears and the transmutation of “chaos into peace.” Coincidence doesn’t resolve; every turn stems from Elias’s expertise under Accumulative pressure. One meaningful deepening suffices—and it’s decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (claiming the throne for restoration, not conquest) is signaled early and tightens at the waterfall breach: drones force Elara to choose between flight or mural-deciphering, narrowing options. Her agency drives escalation—etching counter-frequency, prying trapdoor—and pays visible price: time lost (chrono warnings), near-capture. Cost is legible at climax: she communes rather than grasps, accepting stewardship’s burden. Coincidence complicates (dawn ray activating stairs) but doesn’t resolve; her wisdom enables survival.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—freedom through enforced separation—tightens when the ring materializes, forcing a choice that narrows options: reinforce the burn or relent. Protagonist agency drives escalation (he heats the ring), and cost is unmistakable in her “gaunt face” and his enduring solitude. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, though the off-stage antagonist slightly mutes immediate opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transmuting pyramid-scheme pressure into collective diamonds—is signaled early and tightens when glitch-texts escalate (“volunteer now or loops eternal”). Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to twist the bolt, triggering compression that manifests “crushing deceit as palpable force.” Cost is unmistakable: enduring the weight of evaporated savings to forge communal alchemy. Coincidence complicates (messages from parallels) but resolution stems from his virtuous mischief.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—uncovering buried truth to decide the dynasty’s fate—is signaled early and deepens when the gramophone’s melody encodes a confession. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he cranks faster, interprets standing waves, presses the panel. The cost is felt in his irreversible choice to erase his lineage. One meaningful tightening suffices, though the acoustic cipher risks bordering on coincidence without clearer setup of his auditory sensitivity.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—to capture possibility before it becomes regret—is signaled early and deepens as reality fractures. Elowen’s agency drives escalation: his whispered allegiance and deliberate unsnap narrow options by binding him to spectral puppeteers. Cost is felt in the loss of unfettered solitude, though the price lacks a concrete secondary consequence beyond internal reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to overlooked compassion—is signaled early and escalates through Eleanor’s agency: her choice to investigate dust anomalies leads to uncovering Amos’s hidden act, which deepens her commitment. The tightening occurs when she transcribes the letter, foreclosing passive archiving in favor of active historical advocacy. Cost is felt emotionally (her grief repurposed) and conceptually (the realization that official records erase kinship). Coincidence (dust patterns) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Eleanor’s curiosity drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving truth against engineered apathy—is signaled early and tightens when the cell splinters, forcing Elias into solo action. Escalation occurs through his agency: interpreting the puddle-map, evading drones, activating slates. Cost is visible in isolation and perpetual danger; the reappearance of allies reconfigures hope but doesn’t erase prior loss. Coincidence (the map appearing) complicates but resolution stems from Elias’s preparedness, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—hushing the prophecy—is signaled early and tightens through Elias’s escalating use of “negative space.” The deepening occurs when prophecy “fights back” with ripples and spiral whispers, forcing him to invert the seer’s code aloud. Cost is legible: breath ragged, body dew-laden, emotional toll of reliving his sister’s loss. Though agency is consistent, the escalation leans textual over causal; the tightening is atmospheric rather than tactical, slightly limiting stakes’ visceral urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—decoding leaves to mend the arbor’s heart—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency: Lir’s prodding births transformeds, which catalyze more decoding. The meaningful deepening occurs when the sylph reveals relics lie “buried in ash roots,” narrowing options from passive sorting to active descent. Cost is felt: Lir abandons surface order for perilous depths, and the arbor’s survival hinges on unearthing forgotten things. Coincidence (the leaf’s fall) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Lir’s method drives every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—befriending uncertainty—is signaled early and tightens when the compass rose spins toward the waterfall, forcing Elias to choose between old methods and improvisation. His agency drives escalation: he pries open the clock, steps into spray, knots vines. Cost is felt in the relinquishing of certainty, crystallized when he laughs as his old worldview crumbles like ash.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding and redeeming the weight of names—is signaled early and deepens when the coin reveals Libra’s crushing tilt. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she risks imbalance by forcing volatile opposites into harmony, paying visible cost in trembling hands and near-shattering crucible. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; Thorne’s return is consequence of her precise, costly act. One tightening suffices: the shift from regret to active repair forecloses passive mourning.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—mending shattered souls through laughter—is signaled early and deepens when Harlan’s guilt resists solemn absolution. Elara’s agency drives escalation: tuning the harp, climbing rocks, weaving absurdity into melody. Cost is felt in physical strain (“sweat beaded,” “chill seeped”) and emotional weight (“ache lingered”). Coincidence never resolves; victory comes from tactical ingenuity under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—uncovering mercy’s mathematics—is signaled early and deepens through trauma-induced memory surges. Escalation is driven by Elara’s agency: she deliberately triggers convulsions to access suppressed knowledge. Cost is unmistakable: physical agony, phantom restraints, retinal searing. The tightening—from fragmented flashes to full codex revelation—narrows her path to a single, hard-won truth.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—honoring overlooked histories—is signaled early and tightens through protagonist agency: each painting decoded narrows the path to unfastening the lens. Cost is legible in the final image: alchemists bow as their own forgotten lore resurfaces, implying communal reckoning. However, escalation leans on discovery rather than resistance; no external or internal force actively opposes her, reducing pressure intensity despite lyrical accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—unveiling what ceilings hide—is signaled early and deepens when Theo realizes the ceiling collapse buried the watchmaker. Pressure escalates causally: dust anomalies → mainspring discovery → grate unlocking. Theo’s agency drives every turn; coincidence (residual power, ajar door) only complicates, never resolves. Cost is unmistakable: he bears the ghosts’ weight and inherits the barrel as a “talisman against future façades,” implying perpetual emotional toll.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—compressing eternity into permanence—is signaled early and tightens decisively when frost scripts “rupture,” forcing Elias to choose between preservation and awakening. His agency drives escalation: he fires the press, descends the orchard, crafts a key from discarded type. Cost is unmistakable: the library destabilizes, shelves tilt, and the float lists toward oblivion. Under the Accumulative lens, density intensifies (frost → broadside → vial → tempest), reweighting stasis as untenable.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—narrative control over Aetherian history—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes the shard could legitimize his ideals. His agency drives escalation: he doesn’t just observe but acts, using storm lore to access the vault. The meaningful tightening occurs when alarms wail and he flees into the gallery, forcing a choice between escape or provocation. Cost is felt in his trembling fingers and final solitude, though the scholars’ immediate reaction slightly softens consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming stolen light—is signaled early and tightens through the covenant’s fragility and the daughter’s sleep. Pressure escalates via the paradox of “mending what isn’t torn,” forcing Elias into nuanced, high-skill action rather than brute force. Cost is felt in the ever-present rust and the emotional weight of his daughter’s stillness. However, escalation leans slightly on lyrical intensification over causal narrowing of options, preventing full 9+ alignment under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding “the place where explanations fail”—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s agency: she chooses intuition over ropes, pulls hinges based on vision logic, and surrenders to mystery. The tightening occurs at the lagoon’s edge when she initiates a second reading despite knowing the explorers’ fate. Cost is legible: her former life is irrevocably shed (“factory ruins distant now”). However, the stakes remain slightly abstract; the physical peril of delving lacks visceral consequence beyond atmospheric dread.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—navigating disorientation through art—tightens meaningfully when the lantern slide refracts timewoven alliances, forcing Elara to choose between passive survival and active co-creation across epochs. Her agency drives escalation: she gathers wood, carves layered meanings, and ignites magic fire, each act narrowing options toward alliance-weaving. Cost is legible: she trades GPS certainty for temporal responsibility, symbolized by shouldering the sculpture-lantern. Coincidence (finding the slide) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from her choices under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding nocturnal blooms—is signaled early and tightens as Elara links postcards to cathedral glass. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses to clean, cross-reference, and reinterpret. Cost manifests as emotional exposure (tears) and surrendered solitude (love requires vulnerability). Though coincidence introduces the postcard clue, it complicates rather than resolves; the real breakthrough comes through persistent, tactile reckoning. One tightening suffices, but the pressure remains internal, limiting externalized stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—uncovering suppressed truth—is signaled early and tightens when guardians demand proof of lineage, raising stakes from passive reading to active ritual. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his debris arrangement provokes spectral response, which in turn demands the oath sigil, narrowing options to precise symbolic compliance. Cost is felt—failure means entrapment—and the matriarch’s reply (“Prove lineage”) forces a trade-off between historical accuracy and survival. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from Elias’s choices under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—authentic creation vs. hollow peace—is signaled early and deepens via working memory’s strain. Elias’s agency drives escalation: each recalled fragment narrows options toward reinvention, not revival. Cost is legible in bodily toll (“sweat beaded his brow”) and existential risk—failure means eternal desertion. Ghostly illusions complicate but don’t resolve; victory emerges solely from his mental crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—archiving ephemeral human emotion—intensifies when the relic promises not just record but prophecy, raising the cost of detachment. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his decision to immerse, triggered by personal memory, unlocks the prophecy that reframes his entire vocation. The deepening occurs when the voices converge into Sumerian utterance, forcing him to confront his own unarchived loneliness. One meaningful tightening suffices, though the stakes remain internal rather than externally pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving lineage against entropy—is signaled early and deepens when the vortex shrinks, forcing Elara to act or lose all borrowed time. Escalation is driven by her agency: chanting, placing seeds, twisting the cap. Cost is unmistakable: if she fails, her extended years snap back, erasing her existence. The “furiously tranquil” vortex embodies the tension between chaos and order, making the moral calculus visceral—not abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—accurate storm warning through attuned listening—is signaled early and tightens at zero hour when barometer plummets and wind twists. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he cross-references logs, chooses bell over siren, and discovers new detection synergy. Cost is felt: reliance on subtlety risks failure, yet pays off in villagers’ calm preparation. One meaningful deepening suffices—the bell’s vibration revealing hidden microclimate pulses—and coincidence (gale snapping switch) complicates but doesn’t resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding strength in vulnerability—is signaled early and tightens when the lantern reveals stars’ “tender plunge,” forcing Elias to confront his own “fragility amid infinity.” Agency drives escalation: he chooses empathy over instruments, tracing paths that mirror his isolation. Cost is unmistakable—tears, resurfaced abandonment—but the “colossal star” climax leans slightly coincidental rather than fully earned by prior causality. Still, pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with one decisive deepening (“vulnerability was no weakness…”).

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving unspoken words to sustain the oasis—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the recluse chooses silent action over speech. The meaningful deepening occurs when he deciphers the covenant’s flaw through contextual clues, narrowing his options to ritualized silence. Cost is felt in his permanent binding, though the escalation leans more on revelation than active pressure, slightly softening the causal thrust under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding time’s texture—is signaled early and tightens when the capsule leaks, forcing Elias to risk exposure via garage-sale codes. The deepening comes via the urn fragment’s stasis, which reweights the entire premise: time isn’t lost but preserved in grief. Cost is felt in his quickened pulse and irreversible role shift; agency drives every escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—beauty in incompleteness—is signaled early and deepens when the kite snaps, transforming abstract obsession into urgent action. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to mend rather than mourn, using available materials under time pressure (dusk approaching). The cost is tangible—blurred poems, broken frame—and alters tactics (shorter string, lower flight). However, external pressure remains mild; the conflict is almost entirely internal, and the “discord” never truly threatens his core safety or identity, slightly muting stakes despite lyrical intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—fostering interspecies respect—is signaled early and deepens as Elias’s body fails but his lattice succeeds. Agency is clear: he chooses copper over other metals, specific oaks over others, and persists despite pain. Cost is legible (“breaths shallower,” “pain clawed his gut”) and alters tactics (slower movements, reliance on diary). Escalation peaks when the grove tremors—not by coincidence, but because his systematic wiring completes the circuit.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—decoding alien homecoming chemistry—is signaled early and deepens when the amber projects pilgrimage paths, transforming personal obsession into collective activation. The meaningful tightening occurs when Elara realizes the probe’s gift is an invitation, not a relic, foreclosing her solitary quest. Cost is felt: academic exile, illicit methods, and the surrender of individual interpretation to collaborative truth. Agency drives escalation; coincidence (others arriving) complicates but doesn’t resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming scarred land through ancient pact—is signaled early and deepens when bird calls reveal precise fertilization instructions. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: Thorne deciphers, moves, scatters, and intones, narrowing options from vague hope to targeted ritual. Cost is felt in irreversible action: once seeds are crushed and scattered, there’s no undoing. Coincidence (birds speaking Eldari) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Thorne must still act.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—translating distance into closeness—is signaled early and deepens when the riddle implies Mira lives. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he deciphers the cylinder, treks the fissure, and chooses flawed reunion over solitary myth. Cost is legible: he accepts “tinted revelations,” knowing the leaf is a lie and Mira is scarred. Minor flaw: Harlan’s contraband delivery borders on convenient, though it serves thematic accumulation rather than causal resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—survival through ancestral navigation—is signaled early and deepens when sketching reveals the wormhole. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: her focus intensifies dilation, which in turn sharpens her vision, creating a feedback loop that culminates in discovery. The cost is unmistakable: permanent severance from the station and human society. Under the Accumulative lens, this single deepening suffices, though a second tactical trade-off (e.g., sacrificing a tool or memory) would have elevated it further.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—amending the Arbiter’s error to realign heavens—is signaled early and tightens at the corrupted queen’s writhing rebellion, forcing Elarion to shatter it rather than retreat. Cost is unmistakable: he risks mind-clawing visions and permanent celestial chaos. Agency drives escalation—his “thief’s gambit” initiates the fix, his laughter disarms horror, his swap triggers reset. Though the Arbiter’s slumber reduces antagonistic pressure, the board itself becomes an active opponent, making conflict coherent under Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—liberating memory from the penumbra’s distraction—is signaled early and tightens through each spelled word (“flicker,” “tilt,” etc.), each narrowing Thorne’s focus and fraying the shadow. Agency drives escalation: his walking method is self-imposed and costly (grinding dust, mental unmooring). Final cost is conceptual—sacrificing intimate minutiae for historical permanence—but unmistakable in the board’s vibration.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—mapping home’s true shape—is signaled early and tightens when Elara must unbury her seer gift to seed the stone, foreclosing the path of avoidance. Agency drives escalation: each glyph traced deepens her commitment, with cost legible in nightly hollowness and thunderous recall. The final turn—home as labyrinth—is earned by her persistent seeding under pressure, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—is signaled early and deepens via winnowing, which narrows illusory paths and forces confrontation with past blunders. Escalation is driven by Elias’s agency: each decoded thread tightens moral pressure, culminating in the platinum fork (queen advance or bishop sacrifice), echoing his rigged endgame. Cost is unmistakable: reliving his student’s trusting eyes, the empty hearth, the sour victories. The thunder-lull timeframe creates rhythmic urgency without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. enforced absolution—is signaled early and tightens when Elara’s sessions splinter the ritual’s unity. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her impromptu poetry forces others to confront betrayal’s echoes. Cost is unmistakable: elders’ ashen faces, weeping verses, and the looming ritual’s fragility. One meaningful deepening occurs when the scarred sentinel declares “Forgiveness forges chains,” crystallizing communal dissent.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—conjure meaning from oblivion—is signaled early and intensifies through five escalating confessions, each narrowing options (less air, more acid) and deepening cost (village deaths, stolen love). Agency drives escalation: he chooses to narrate despite drowning. The tightening is meaningful—each pockmark match risks immediate death yet reconfigures memory. Coincidence never resolves; the statue’s awakening stems directly from his voiced truths, not external luck.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—fulfilling a hidden promise to preserve innocence—is signaled early and tightens when the mirror cracks, forcing action. The wrong turn escalates pressure by introducing the oasis, which crystallizes the thematic dilemma: eternalize illusion or accept its transience. Cost is felt in the fading hologram and Elias’s solitary return. Though coincidence (the fissure) complicates, resolution stems from his agency—completing the shell—and the price (abandoning delusion) alters his stance permanently.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—winning back Mira through purified intent—is signaled early and deepens when Elias chooses whisper over shout. The tightening occurs at the vial’s uncorking, which forecloses further shouting and commits him to vulnerability. Cost is visible: past damage from his “thunder,” the risk of total silence failing. Luck (the vial washing ashore) complicates but doesn’t resolve; agency lies in his whispered plea.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reverse migration as reclamation—is signaled early and deepens through lunar phases and phantom calls. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: Elias chooses to build despite pain, interprets cryptic instructions, aligns coils to the censer’s hum. Each midnight call narrows options (“twist left under gibbous”) and raises emotional stakes. The tightening peaks at full moon: failure would mean silence; success summons returnees. Cost is visible—aching body, solitude—but could be sharper in tactical consequence (e.g., lost tool, injury).

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—psychological safety through selective silence—is signaled early and tightened when Elias risks self-alienation to restore communal bonds. His agency drives escalation: choosing occlusion over raw truth forecloses authenticity but enables hope. Cost is legible in Lira’s thaw and Thom’s renewed belief, yet Elias’s private doubt (“silken deceit”) ensures stakes aren’t resolved cleanly. One meaningful deepening suffices, and it lands with emotional precision.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—decoding the stranger’s final gesture—is signaled early and tightens through Elias’s investigation, which forecloses passive solitude. His agency drives the deepening: observing gaps, probing absences, recognizing mirrored loss. Cost is felt in the reconfiguration of his vigil—he now owns the stranger’s memory, not just borrows it. Escalation is subtle but coherent under the Accumulative lens, culminating in a stance crystallization with visible emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—fulfilling his father’s promise—is signaled early and tightens as floodwaters rise, forcing swift movement. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to follow ants, pries open the mossy seam, and confronts visions. Cost is legible: years of isolation crystallize into a moment of reckoning where he accepts his path as purposeful. The creek’s surge isn’t just backdrop—it narrows time, heightens risk, and underscores renewal at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming agency from hollow rule—is signaled early and tightens when the council’s warning raises political cost. Elowen’s climb is active defiance, not passive reception; her touch of the pool triggers the decisive deepening that reveals the bloodline curse. The cost is conceptual (surrendering her disenchanted heart) and tactical (descending with new power but irreversible change). Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, with one meaningful intensification—the firefly vortex—that reweights all prior imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—capturing presence—is signaled early and tightens when Lirien realizes it requires sharing. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she kindles the sun, blends the palette, whispers the secret. Cost is felt in her changed steeliness and Thorne’s “eclipse without you,” though the price remains conceptual rather than visceral. One meaningful deepening suffices for length, and pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—distilling chaos into narrative—is signaled early and tightens when grave vision cracks open “feral nostalgia.” Protagonist agency drives escalation: she *chooses* jealousy as method, triggering lucid flight. Cost is unmistakable: physical ruin (“cabin ruins”), emotional depletion (“jaded wonder”), and cyclical entrapment (“whose grave next?”). Coincidence doesn’t resolve; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens via intensifying sensory density.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—unveiling ordinary miracles through repair—is signaled early and deepens when the screw reveals its origin. Pressure tightens not through external threat but internal imperative: Elara must interpret the clock’s “emotional terrain” to restore its truth. The meaningful deepening occurs when she intuits Miriam’s story, transforming mechanical failure into sacred testimony. Cost is felt in the tears of the elderly woman and Elara’s own quiet reckoning with loss, though the escalation leans more accumulative than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—avoiding exile through ceremonial perfection—is signaled early and tightens when scars crystallize mid-rite, physically impeding action. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to invoke superstition, dip quill in matcha, and inscribe runes despite pain. Cost is unmistakable: lungs ache from held breath, crystals weigh like manacles, and each shed flake carries memory-loss. The “breath between storms” timeframe forces irreversible commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—delivering an overdue apology before the orchard is destroyed—is signaled by line 3 and tightens when chainsaws idle, granting only this hush. Elara’s agency drives escalation: uncorking the bottle induces currents that risk the archive itself. Cost is unmistakable: yellowing scores, shattered bottle, Theo’s dissolution. The tightening forecloses any future reunion—the saws awaken immediately after, making this moment irreplaceable.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—unifying the cosmos by exposing illusion—is signaled early and deepens through the dictionary’s revelations. Pressure accumulates texturally via denser definitions and trembling shelves, culminating in the “hiccup” deadline. Yet agency is passive: Elowen reads, walks, intones—he doesn’t arbitrate through difficult trade-offs. Cost is conceptual (lost epochs, civilizations) but not personally paid, weakening escalation under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—verifying reality against anomalous time—is signaled early and deepens when Elias chooses to count backward, risking sanity for truth. The tightening occurs at insertion of the key: a live choice that narrows options to revelation or ruin. Cost is visible in phantom visions, cold room, and emotional toll (“eyes watering”), culminating in the conceptual price of knowing time is illusion. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves the core conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—redefining security through permeability—is signaled early and deepens when Elias validates Mira’s intuition with mycological science. The meaningful tightening occurs when the rat’s passage proves the system works, prompting Mira’s on-the-spot revolution: “Let the intruder pass, track the echo.” Cost is legible: she abandons detection-as-barrier, embracing vulnerability as intelligence. Agency drives escalation; no off-stage resolution or convenient amnesia.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—navigating her father’s legacy without succumbing to his compulsions—is signaled early and deepens through each scrawl’s paradox. The tightening occurs at Union Square (“Rebel in theory, thrive in paradox”), forcing Elena to embrace contradiction rather than reject it. Cost is legible: she trades certainty for nuanced responsibility, crystallized in publishing the manuscript. Luck never resolves pressure; every turn stems from her interpretive agency under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—whether human connection can be ethically curated through deliberate estrangement—is signaled early and tightens when Mira demands meeting. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses silence, spins the disc faster, hangs up. The cost is felt in Mira’s weeping plea and his subsequent solitude. Under an Accumulative lens, the deepening comes via rhythmic intensification of calls and harmonica loops, culminating in a decisive break that forecloses their tether.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving small moments against oblivion—is signaled early and tightens when context changes at moonrise, forcing Elara’s ritual before dawn erases the window. Her agency drives escalation: selecting petals by proximate cause, steeping ink, stirring with bone spoon. Cost is unmistakable—he returns only spectrally, bound to the locket, while she shoulders eternal recurrence. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—curing loneliness through reciprocity—is signaled early and deepens when the moon rock catalyzes shared stories. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: Elias engineers his own arrival through rumor chains and chooses to share the rock despite desperation. Cost is legible in his exposed vulnerability and the irreversible dissolution of his solitary identity. Coincidence (rumors reaching the station) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the cure emerges from human action, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—mapping emotional depths via the stillpoint—is signaled early and tightens when doubt creeps in (“had he misinterpreted the tongues?”). Elar’s agency drives escalation: he presses on despite the rival’s warning, and the ring’s scorching heat forces endurance. Cost is unmistakable: confronting his lover’s death crystallizes into “serene farewell,” resolving unresolved chords at the price of reopening grief. One meaningful deepening suffices, and pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—correcting a catastrophic mistake through ethical revision—is signaled early and tightens via protagonist agency: each edit narrows future options and spawns new contingencies. Escalation is causal and earned; the cost (rewritten lives, unforeseen alliances) is unmistakable. Pressure coheres under the Causal lens, with no coincidence resolving conflict—the pen’s power emerges from prior cause (rogue seeds → anomaly → tool).

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—translating silence into reclaimed meaning—is signaled early and deepens when they “disrupt” the festival. Pressure escalates texturally: from private hush to public intervention, culminating in halted guitars and tears. Agency lies in attention and gesture, not force, fitting the lens. Yet the “tightening” lacks visible trade-off; no resource is spent, no social risk incurred. The crowd’s instant conversion feels unearned, softening the cost that should sharpen the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—fulfilling Theo’s promise—is signaled early and deepens when the vandalized portrait reveals hidden coordinates. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her intuition decodes slashes, her hands pry panels, her steps “dance fury and caress.” Cost is felt in her sobs and isolation, though the archive yields easily—minimal resistance lowers tension slightly. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; every clue stems from Theo’s intentional trail, honoring the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—freedom from forced entanglement—is signaled early and deepens when Elara chooses rebellion over docility. Escalation is driven by her agency: each drumming intensification tightens pressure (pain, alarms, fracturing reflections) and narrows options until submersion becomes inevitable. Cost is unmistakable: the garden wilts, handlers pursue, and auroral sorrow lingers as emotional tax. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from her rhythmic assault on the system.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—proving whispers outperform shouts—is signaled early and deepens when the storm’s physics validate Elias’s method. Pressure escalates causally: Harlan’s shouts fracture, Elias’s whispers slither unbroken, forcing Harlan into dead ends while Elias mimics walks to predict turns. The tightening forecloses Harlan’s path to victory and costs him maps and coin. Agency is fully protagonist-driven; no coincidence resolves the conflict—the geomagnetic rules merely enable Elias’s pre-existing skill.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—teaching darkness to cradle light—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s escalating weave, which narrows Umbra’s options from consumption to communion. Protagonist agency drives escalation: each shutter configuration forces a perceptual shift, culminating in the falling-star pattern that reveals Umbra’s “fractures.” Cost is unmistakable: Umbra’s form softens, surrendering oblivion for vulnerability. The single tightening (weave intensifying into hypnotic core) suffices for this length under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—defying conformity through subtle dissent—is signaled early and deepens when window displays shift in unison. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he seeds the method, retrieves the rook, distributes lodestones. The tightening occurs at the liminal moment when displays activate, forcing the Council into cognitive dissonance. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: the town’s collective psyche fractures, foreclosing blind obedience.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—freedom vs. tethered life—is signaled early and tightens when the scrimshaw forces vulnerability, narrowing options to flight or stagnation. Agency drives escalation: Elara pockets the scrimshaw, brushes it during banter, uses it to cut the rope. Cost is felt in lost security and human guise, though the whale’s call borders on convenient catalyst rather than fully earned pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—cultivating lightness in grief amid enforced emotional void—is signaled early and tightens through the whittling ritual, which narrows emotional expression to performative grandeur. Agency is clear: she chooses narration over silence, carving over collapse. Cost is felt in blood, crumbling petals, and cracked voice—but escalation relies more on textural density than causal narrowing. Under Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening (carving turbine blade) suffices, though stakes could feel more viscerally urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—dissolving sacred boundaries through verse—is signaled early and deepens via the poet’s paraphrasing, which physically alters reality. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: each rephrased line triggers environmental response, culminating in the archway and submerged memories. Cost is conceptual but undeniable—the ban’s lifting permits this, yet the act itself erases old orders, with the lake’s thaw symbolizing irreversible change. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure tightens through rising resonance, not causality, and the final certainty tremor crystallizes irreversible stance.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—awakening Mira through barter—is signaled early and deepens when the phoenix demands sight. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses an imperfect song over compliance, narrowing options irrevocably. Cost is unmistakable: he relinquishes lifelong yearning for color, paid in the moment he blows the warped note. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens—each plant arrangement, reed use, and climb intensifies the thematic trade without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes escalate through Elowen’s agency: each questioning reframes connection (volume → intimacy, language → silence, permanence → transience), narrowing her understanding while deepening its texture. The dominant stake—reclaiming human harmony—is tested viscerally, with felt costs (pain from lovers’ cries, tears at revelation). Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from her deliberate lens adjustments.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reviving fading stars through intention—is signaled early and tightens when Elara realizes coordinates must be pierced into vellum, narrowing her method to origami-guided paths. Agency is clear: each crane placement is a deliberate act that deepens stakes (“curtains span infinities”). Cost is felt emotionally (tears) and existentially (endless work ahead), though physical or social price remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—mapping cultural patterns to warn of future manias—is signaled early and tightens when Theo arrives with the grandmother’s letter, forcing collaboration. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she inks the Tower, multiplies paths, and adjusts angles, narrowing options through precise measurement. The cost is unmistakable: solitude sacrificed, legacy transformed from burden to shared duty. Coincidence complicates (the knock in the storm) but resolution stems wholly from protagonist choices under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—accessing forbidden truth—is signaled early and tightens when ritual approaches fail, forcing Elara to abandon historical method. The deepening occurs when she adopts “steadily unpredictable” behavior, narrowing her options to self-annihilation or transcendence. Cost is unmistakable: dissolution of personal memory and identity. While pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens, the external cataclysm (distant explosions) feels slightly ornamental rather than causally entwined with her internal crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving hope’s shape against shadow corruption—is signaled early and tightens when video comparisons reveal fraying auras. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses metamorphosis, narrowing options to sacrifice or chaos. Cost is visible in her transformation and the stone’s crack. However, the shadow’s origin (“feeding on collective fears”) leans abstract; deeper tactical adaptation to its behavior would elevate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—balancing compassion with self-respect—is signaled early and deepens through one pivotal tightening: Silas’s theft forces Elara to confront whether gentleness invites predation. Her agency drives escalation; each “shed layer” (flattery, guilt, fear) narrows her path toward fortified openness. Cost is felt: lost sanctuary funds, shattered trust, yet the chameleon’s budding tail offers biological proof that fragility can regenerate. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; her choices rebuild conviction, with tomorrow’s justice-seeking extending compassion beyond sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—deciphering scar narratives—is signaled early and deepens via coffee rings and ivy guidance. Escalation is driven by Elena’s agency: she chooses to tunnel, bleed, dig. Cost is felt (surgical wound reopens, memories flood). Coincidence (plants speaking) complicates but doesn’t resolve; revelation comes from her labor. One meaningful tightening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity—is signaled early and deepens when “rest” reframes idleness as sacred act. Pressure escalates through bodily toll (“body ached”) and temporal disorientation (“nights bleeding into days”). Protagonist agency drives escalation: she chooses to trace meteors despite resistance. Cost is felt but not sharply consequential—no irreversible loss tightens options beyond fatigue.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—cultivating sparks in unlit corners—is signaled early and deepens when the clock reveals the archive. Escalation is driven by the guard’s agency: he *chooses* to charm the clock, bending wave functions. Cost is visible: his dreamless state fractures, exposing him to vulnerability (“faint reverie stirring”). However, pressure tightens only once; the piece relies on textural accumulation over multiple reversals, which fits the lens but limits tactical evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—rediscovering inner wildness—is signaled early and tightens through the hum’s intensification and arboreal warnings (“Seek the corewheel”). Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to press the gear, climb the engine, and unravel the vine. Cost is unmistakable: his petrified psyche shatters, replaced by “verdant chaos” that forecloses his old detached self. Under the Accumulative lens, each wind-song deepens pressure until the corewheel demands irreversible action.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (freedom vs. fear) is clear early and tightens via the “indirect routes” philosophy. But escalation leans on guide exposition (“Direct paths bind tighter...”) rather than protagonist-driven pressure. Cost is felt (leash echo, trembling) yet never forces a trade-off—Elara faces no real loss or sacrifice. Coincidental guide arrival slightly undermines agency.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—cost of safety—is signaled early and deepens when Elias recognizes his silence parallels Thorne’s. The bolt discovery narrows options: confront or remain complicit. Elias’s choice to stay crystallizes stance with felt cost (abandoning outcry for sanctuary). Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens; pressure tightens via sensory overload during nerve surge, making the discoloration legible. Coincidence (finding bolt) is earned by prior attention to texture.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—truth preserving cosmic weave—is signaled early and tightens as messages spread and spies draw near. Lirion’s agency drives escalation: each rune deepens doubt, culminating in the throne chronicle missive. Cost is conceptual but felt: the pretender’s empire unravels “without blood or bellow,” yet the price of falsehood is total. Coincidence complicates (scholars finding books) but resolution stems from Lirion’s persistent action.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding why trade routes vanished—is signaled early and tightens when Elias realizes bleaching destabilized gyres. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: assembling data, incorporating coral cores, stabilizing the hologram. Cost is felt in physical exhaustion and the emotional weight of being sole witness. The deepening (reefs as current-steerers) narrows options to one path: broadcast the truth. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from Elias’s choices.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—reigniting rebellion through cosmic meaning—is signaled early and deepens when the stone circle’s hum broadcasts outward. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her choice to touch the slab triggers the vision and signal. However, the Corporate Veil remains abstract; external pressure lacks teeth beyond “predatory eyes on the horizon.” Cost is conceptual (lost hope) rather than visceral, limiting emotional stakes despite thematic clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—evolving tradition to ensure survival—is signaled early and deepens when the plants warn of ecosystem collapse under rigid councils. Mira’s decision to unseal the embryo forecloses adherence to static lineage, risking communal fracture. The escalation is protagonist-driven: her decoding, chanting, and immersion narrow options irreversibly. Cost is unmistakable—the Caldera’s future hinges on her defiance, crystallized in the council’s stunned silence at dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—anchoring optimism in realism—is signaled early and deepened when the photograph forces confrontation. The tightening occurs in Elena’s freeze: she must choose between collapse or adaptation. Agency is clear—she uses her somatic awareness as guide, not tyrant. Cost is felt in the crumpled photo’s transformation from wound to endurance marker, and in her deliberate outreach to the sketching woman.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming artistic truth from fragmentation—is signaled early and tightens as walls close in and threads knot. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to descend, untangle, and weave. The cost is felt in physical constriction, emotional recall, and the lingering ache. Though the loom appears late, its logic is prepared by the tarot’s inner glow and silver threads, making the resolution feel earned, not coincidental.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding why time slows in crisis—is signaled immediately and tightens when Mira vanishes, raising the cost from intellectual curiosity to potential loss of ally and knowledge. Elowen’s agency drives escalation: he crushes the drone to reignite the ink, a high-stakes choice that forecloses passive observation. The deepening (time-slowing as evolutionary adaptation) reweights the entire premise with biological and existential cost.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—awakening contraband truths—is signaled early and deepens when the glitch reveals resistance maps. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she overrides safeguards using intimate knowledge, transforming passive guardianship into active provocation. Cost is felt (imminent alarms, Regime scrutiny) and shapes tactics (encrypted letter, network ignition). However, the “scandalize” outcome leans slightly on systemic reaction rather than direct interpersonal opposition, softening pressure just below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving continuity—is signaled early and deepens when looters breach. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses nonviolence actively, not passively. Cost is felt in her isolation and Jax’s expectation of slaughter. One tightening suffices, but the looters’ defeat leans slightly on evolved pollen (a borderline convenience), softening the pressure’s edge.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—catching the goddess’s echo before oblivion—is signaled early and tightened by the celestial fracture, which narrows the window and raises emotional stakes. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his voiced silence is a tactical innovation born of prior failure observation. Cost is felt in the garden’s convulsion and the seekers’ noise-fueled futility, though the price Elias pays remains conceptual (eternal recurrence) rather than visceral. Coincidence (stars stirring) complicates but doesn’t resolve—he earns success through method.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—unearthing her father’s truth—is signaled early and tightens when Thorne’s accusation forces Elara to choose between inherited shame or active intervention. Her agency drives escalation: she weaponizes observation to expose chronological contradiction, foreclosing Thorne’s deception. Cost is felt in Thorne’s collapsed posture and her own recalibrated legacy (“truths unveiled, ready to rewrite the stars”). Coincidence complicates (journalist’s call) but doesn’t resolve—the victory is earned through her method.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—silencing the dissonance of unresolved guilt—is signaled by line 6 and escalates when the amber reveals the daughter’s untranslated cry, forcing Elias to choose between continued evasion or ritual atonement. His agency drives the deepening: retrieving his kit, etching the new constellation, slotting the amber—all narrow options toward binding her spirit. Cost is unmistakable: the letters disintegrate, the amber empties, and his bare arms become permanently marked, foreclosing his former detachment. Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens, with each sensory revelation tightening the emotional vise until the tether completes.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transforming communal discord into shared understanding—is signaled early and deepens as chants turn frantic. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she doesn’t wait for resolution but intervenes via art, placing the tile flake and tracing chalk lines. The cost is conceptual yet palpable: the mandala must scatter, peace is “ephemeral,” and unity remains “fragile.” Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, though the shift from chaos to hush risks feeling slightly too seamless given the raw wounds exposed.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—whether empathy can survive post-fire barbarism—is signaled early and tightens when Elara chooses to weaponize her curse via the tessera. The meaningful deepening occurs in the vision of the muezzin’s “aberrant mercy,” which reweights her understanding of power. Cost is legible: she risks deeper entrapment to act, and Kael endures psychic rupture. Escalation is protagonist-driven, though the tessera’s mechanics verge on convenient without prior rules.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming creative agency from despair—is signaled early and deepens when Reginald offers intertwined timelines as bait. Elena’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to sing, which knots timelines and ripens the fruits. Cost is visible in her shattered career and emotional fragility, though the scandal remains off-page. The tightening—moving from passive wandering to active performance—forecloses collapse, satisfying the Accumulative lens’s demand for reweighted stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—verifying authentic telepathy—is signaled early and tightens through three escalating tests, culminating in the blind exposure that forecloses doubt. Agency is clear: Elara devises and executes each phase. Cost is visible in emotional vulnerability and risk of relationship fracture. Coincidence never resolves; sync is tested, not assumed. Somatic markers provide concrete stakes beyond abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—becoming the voice of the unknown—is signaled early and tightens when the fossil’s energy resonates with Lira’s fear, forcing her to choose between control and surrender. Escalation is driven by her agency: activating the emitter, pressing the fossil to her chest, willing the transition. Cost is unmistakable: overheating threatens overload, requiring her to stabilize with “resolving greens,” and her final release of the fossil implies relinquishing personal connection for legacy. Coincidence never resolves; all pressure stems from her choices interacting with the fossil’s properties.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—freeing rigid prophecy into human choice—is signaled early and deepens through the unscrambling action. Pressure escalates via the echo’s garbled warning and the tactile labor of cataloging, culminating in the hourglass inversion. The cost is conceptual (abandoning deterministic fate) and felt (trembling hands, warehouse’s exhale). While agency is clear, the opposition is abstract (time’s knot, fossilized truth), slightly muting interpersonal or physical tension expected in high-band conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reviving the network—is signaled early and tightens when Elias decodes the bluff’s message, forcing a choice: re-engage or fade. His agency drives escalation: he chooses to descend, interpret, and entrust Lena. Cost is clear: he sacrifices his own redemption for hers. Coincidence is avoided—Lena’s test was deliberate, not accidental. One meaningful deepening suffices: the shift from survival to succession.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—distilling ancestral complexity into essential duty—is signaled early and deepens through the mending act. Escalation occurs via memory percolation and ambient awareness tightening focus, narrowing options from “tangled oaths” to one pure vow. Agency is clear: the coachman actively unpicks layers, a choice with conceptual cost (erasing lovers’ pleas, harvest debts). Coincidence doesn’t resolve; insight emerges from sustained attention under pressure, though the passenger’s approval slightly softens the earnedness.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—understanding why places resist ruin—is signaled early and deepens through Kai’s interaction with fractured timelines. Agency is expressed through attention and creation: his choice to shape clay in rhythm with the thrumming narrows options to one path of understanding. Cost is felt in the oasis’s precarious survival and Kai’s isolation, though the escalation leans more on revelation than tangible sacrifice. Still, the deepening reweights the central question with emotional and conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—combating emotional desolation through reflected light—is signaled early and tightens when Mira appears “hollow with unspoken storms.” Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses proximity (“easing closer”), offers transport (“Row with me?”), and gifts the gauge, each act narrowing her solitude while risking rejection. Cost is felt in the transferred talisman and implied in Elara’s continued winter vigil. The single deepening—Mira’s confession—alters relational stakes without coincidence; pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—translating isolation into independence—is signaled early and tightens when the deepened hum forces Elara to choose between enduring solitude or risking coexistence. Her agency drives escalation: placing her palm on the sundial, attuning breath, and declaring “Isolation ends here” narrow options irreversibly. Cost is visible: she relinquishes human guise fully, accepting spectral bonds as non-negotiable. Coincidence never resolves; all pressure stems from her actions within the stone circle’s established rules.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—finding the “thread that connects all things”—is signaled early and deepens when Elara risks exposure by contributing to the public art. The meaningful tightening occurs when she places her most personal token, foreclosing her ghostwriter anonymity. Cost is visible: vulnerability replaces secrecy. Escalation is driven by her agency, though Theo’s matching spiral arrives via off-page journey, slightly diluting pressure. Still, the emotional stakes intensify credibly under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving communal coherence against cosmic sabotage—is signaled early and escalates coherently. Elara’s agency drives the turning point: she chooses interference over silence, risking Harlan’s wrath. The cost is legible in the aftermath: “power plays crumbled” but vigilance remains. One meaningful tightening suffices; the subsonic clash crystallizes the moral calculus—disruption over destruction—without coincidence resolving tension.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—unlocking boundless realms via the vital key—is signaled early and tightens when sound triggers spatial mutiny, forcing Elias to choose between retreat or defiant play. His agency drives escalation: he *chooses* to play, then modulates melody, then thrusts the compass. Cost is unmistakable: panic surges, breath hitches, and claustrophobia claws—yet he endures. The mutiny’s peak crystallizes his stance against inner voids.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (awakening empathy to solve cold cases) tightens when evidence vanishes, forcing Elara’s personal intervention. Her agency drives escalation: methodical search → discovery → ritualistic blood offering → insight → sketch → confession. Cost is legible: physical pain, emotional risk, and irreversible vulnerability. Coincidence complicates (conflicting witness accounts) but resolution stems from her unifying act, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reversing familial exile—is signaled early and deepens when Elara discovers Thorne’s predictions were suppressed. Pressure tightens coherently: from decoding stanzas to confronting Hale, each choice narrows options and raises emotional cost. The climax hinges on Elara’s agency (“Question this”), not luck, and Hale’s confession emerges from her evidence, not convenience. Cost is unmistakable: restored honor arrives, yet the jet stream’s mockery ensures no true victory, only poised continuation.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming possibility after loss—is signaled early and tightens when the flake’s “pixelated amnesty” reframes history’s sharpness. Agency drives escalation: observation leads to interpretation (scaffold flutters as cartography), which compels the vow to follow the trail. Cost is conceptual but undeniable—the dissolution of “never” as self-protection—and shapes tactics (using professional acuity to read chaos). Coincidence complicates (hitchhiker’s vanish) but doesn’t resolve; the protagonist earns insight through his own dynamically observant lens.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming stolen legacy into protected art—is signaled early and tightens when Raoul threatens both satchel and sovereignty. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he builds, brands, dissuades, and stands firm. Cost is visible in the startup’s collapse and isolation. However, the crypto winter feels external and coincidental, not earned through prior choices, slightly undermining pressure coherence under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—decoding glyphs before light fails—is signaled early and tightens via the telegram. Pressure escalates causally: Lyra’s stalled transcription → Thorne’s lucid dream → stellar pattern recognition → shared rush to temple. The deepening (variables syncing to seventh pulse) narrows options to solstice eve. Cost is felt: exhaustion, frayed spirit, urgency—but lacks tangible loss beyond time, slightly softening price.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—uncovering what mirrors hide—is signaled early and deepens when the frozen confession reframes Thorne’s past deed from noble sacrifice to power-hungry betrayal. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: planting the seed, bleeding, enduring pain—all under Accumulative pressure of tightening spirals. The cost (blood, psychological fracture) is unmistakable and alters tactics (from resistance to yielding flesh). Final stakes crystallize in the spectral voice’s full utterance, which forces Thorne to confront hollowness, not villainy—a nuanced moral calculus that avoids binary resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—mending the eclipsed covenant before chaotic dream-intersections unravel time—is signaled early and tightens when Elara links scar to clipping, risking pain for access. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her curiosity compels the linking method, which triggers visions that reveal the nexus and fellow visionaries. Cost is legible: roots extend painfully, spirit detaches momentarily, and she accepts perpetual binding. Only minor flaw: quantum rifts’ “premature dawn” isn’t leveraged as active ticking clock during climax.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—mending soul-holes via bartered destinies—is signaled early and tightens when Elara slices her palm, binding life to severed thread. Escalation is driven by her agency under Accumulative pressure: each ritual step deepens commitment until roots groan and trammel the card. Cost is unmistakable—freedom possibly lost, shadows whispering unpaid prices—and shapes the final image. Coincidence never resolves; the ancient fire’s failure merely sets up her active intervention.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—finding purpose after public failure and personal loss—is signaled early and tightens when the scrap appears, forcing Harl to choose between continued retreat or action. The deepening occurs when facts confirm the relic’s origin, raising emotional stakes. Though coincidence introduces the scrap, it complicates rather than resolves; agency drives the climax (calling the foreman). Cost is felt but not fully dramatized in tactical consequence—hence just below 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reestablishing equilibrium after the spirit’s departure—is signaled early and deepens when thunder threatens collapse, forcing Elias’s seed-planting gambit. Agency is clear: his analogical method drives the polarity-flip solution, with cost felt in lost mentorship and abandoned cosmic conquest. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, though the pilgrims’ arrival slightly dilutes tension before closure. Coincidence (nomad’s relic shard) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Elias’s prior work enables decoding.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder against monotony—is signaled early and tightens when Elara’s essence refuses migration, raising the cost of failure. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: Elara chooses to exhale her essence; the librarian chooses acceptance over force. The deepening turn (“Contradictions are the forge-fire”) reweights the method and narrows options to one path: yield or shatter. Cost is visceral: loss of creative vitality if smelting fails.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—choosing between enforced survival and vulnerable connection—is signaled early and deepens when Elias reads the confessions, forcing him to confront his own abandoned hope. His crowning of the node is a high-agency act that forecloses isolation forever. Cost is felt: he trades the inspector’s detached authority for uncertain, radiant openness. Escalation is driven by discovery, not coincidence, under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness through truth—is signaled early and deepens when graffiti reframes the bridge collapse as collective insight (“Method redeems daring folly”). Elias’s agency drives escalation: he climbs, pries open doors, interprets symbols, and finally adds his own mark. The cost—living with unmedicated clarity and enduring the ghost of his apprentice—is felt but not resolved, aligning with Accumulative lens expectations. One meaningful tightening occurs at the bathroom wall, where past seekers’ maps narrow his path to acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—accessing unspoken words—is signaled early and deepens via the watch’s cyclic reversal, which demands patience and precision. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: she decodes delays, interprets runes, and follows the trail despite illusion risks. Cost is visible in the narrowing window (“between those two fateful letters”) and the emotional toll of confronting buried truths. The confidence man’s legacy adds moral texture, though the “peril” remains atmospheric rather than actively obstructive.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—choosing between solitary artistry and imperial legacy—is signaled early and intensifies via the solstice clock and perforated coffee stains. The meaningful deepening occurs when the ivy proposes propagation, reframing the binary into a third path. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to play, not wait. Cost is legible in the “mulberry ache” transmuted to “resolute throb”—a felt emotional price for hybridity. Coincidence (ivy’s insight) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the violin’s power was already established.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving life against encroaching oblivion—is signaled early and deepens through protagonist agency: first attempting to save the elder’s spark, then risking her own. The meaningful tightening occurs when static fractures under auroral surge, forcing Lirien to turn inward—a choice that narrows options (only self-sacrifice remains) and raises cost (personal extinction). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: pattern density increases until the dual-infusion climax, where luck never resolves conflict. Cost is unmistakable: “Pain lanced; brilliance erupted.”

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—finding contentment through the cycle—is signaled early and tightens when Elara climbs, discovers the hairpin, and performs scalloping. The meaningful deepening occurs at the petal: her action transforms abstract forgiveness into embodied ritual, narrowing options to one precise, costly act. Agency drives escalation—no coincidence resolves the conflict. Cost is visible: razed groves, exiled kin, and her prior spiritual stagnation now surrendered.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—replacing certainty with nuance—is signaled early and deepens through the chime sequence and cloak ritual. The meaningful tightening occurs when bone chimes dominate, urging “depth over sharpness,” forcing Alex to confront shared fault. Cost is legible: he forfeits vengeance, symbolized by dropping the shard. Agency is maintained—Elias guides, but Alex chooses to unhook—though the wind’s “selection” slightly dilutes protagonist control under a strict Causal lens (mitigated by the Accumulative design).

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—reversing aging—is signaled early, and the tightening (“vanishing first”) deepens the conflict. But escalation lacks protagonist agency: Elara receives insight passively through trance and ripples. The cost (“vanish completely”) is conceptual, not dramatized as a forfeiture that alters tactics. Pressure accumulates atmospherically, not causally—Voss controls all turns, reducing Elara to witness.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—learning to navigate without moving—is signaled early and deepens through decades of failed appraisals. Pressure accumulates texturally: flocks grow denser, dust thickens, skin weathers, yet no pattern emerges until the colossal flock mirrors the arrowhead’s spirals. The cost is palpable: Thren forfeits mobility, time, and physical presence to achieve his goal. Agency drives escalation—each throw is a deliberate act of faith, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (“sacred in the simple”) tightens when unstrapping risks instability yet enables mist walking—a trade-off with clear cost (loss of Artificer-sanctioned safety). Pressure escalates texturally: fizzling sparks → freed hands → vortex crossing. The deepening occurs when visions of hand-built arches reveal what’s at stake emotionally. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; Thorne’s agency (unstrapping, stepping) drives escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—finding Lira through discovering “the color of sound”—is signaled early and deepens when the library reveals sound’s hue shifts with intent. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to wade into the sea, climb the ship, and open the book. Cost is legible in his solitary year and physical immersion, though the spectral librarian’s exposition slightly eases tension. The tightening—from external search to internal recognition that Lira *is* the echo—narrows options meaningfully under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—aligning with cosmic purpose before dissolving into doubt—is signaled early and tightens through three coin-cast decisions that narrow interpretive options. Escalation is protagonist-driven: each distillation increases risk (guttural voids → staccato core burst), with visible cost in peers’ failures. The final broadcast crystallizes stance under coherent pressure, though the coins’ infallibility slightly eases tension. Cost is felt in the trembling of stellar doubt itself.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—conquering nameless fears to redeem Lirian’s sacrifice—is signaled early and tightens through each naming, narrowing Elowen’s emotional options. Agency is clear: she chooses to crystallize grief despite heartbreak clawing her ribs. Cost escalates visibly (tears accelerate method) and culminates in Vorath’s naming, which resolves the echo. Coincidence is avoided; all pressure stems from her reaper’s essence channeled through ritual. Slight deduction: recordings feel slightly expository rather than organically discovered mid-ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—cosmic imbalance from vanished Leviathan shoals—is signaled early and tightens when chaotic drips threaten repair. Elowen’s agency drives escalation: he divines deeper rates, channels drips via needle, and persists despite spell-faltering. Cost is felt in physical strain and near-shattered devotion. One meaningful deepening occurs (“subtle undertones, like fish ghosts schooling in ether”), narrowing options to precise drip-syncing. Coincidence never resolves; all turns stem from his choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reckoning with buried guilt—is signaled early and tightens when the trail implicates Elias directly. His agency drives escalation: he follows photos, confesses fault, initiates burning. Cost is felt in “stain” expunged not erased, and Mira’s tentative hands show shared burden. Coincidence (Mira’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from Elias’s choice to speak truth, crystallizing his stance under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—harmonizing logic/intuition before transformation—is signaled early and tightens when intuition tugs during elixir arrangement, forcing her to trust the starlings’ chaotic grace. The deepening occurs as birds mirror then transcend her logic, compelling her to embrace sentiment. Cost is unmistakable: tears (emotional vulnerability) and the irreversible consumption of the solstice crystal. Agency drives escalation; coincidence (sun cresting) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the starlings respond to her openness, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving trust through flawless foresight—is signaled early and tightens twice: first with Lena’s life at risk, then with doctrine-level consequences (“buckle protocol would become doctrine”). Elias’s agency drives every escalation; coincidence never resolves. Cost is felt (“watcher’s burden clenched his chest”) and visible in his enduring isolation. Pressure coheres cleanly under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (custody to heal numbness) tightens when Elara’s drones force Kai to act mid-illusion, narrowing options to physical seizure. Protagonist agency drives escalation: lunging with Blade, invoking rite, mingling blood. Cost is visible—dojo tremors, timeline chaos—and culminates in emotional flood that forecloses his prior void. One meaningful deepening suffices; Collective’s hive-fear revelation sharpens moral calculus without diluting focus.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—protecting creative space from developers—is signaled early and tightens through each orthogonal approach, culminating in unearthed legal shields. Agency is clear: Elias’s decisions (e.g., crushing seed flake, whispering phrases) drive escalation. Cost is felt in the unnatural germination and nocturnal labor, though physical/emotional toll remains light. Coincidence (Genoa postmark) complicates but doesn’t resolve; victory stems from ingenuity.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring lost laughter through maceration of unspoken grief—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency: Elias chooses tempo, adds reserve blowers, fragments his lullaby. Cost is legible: the symphony exhausts its temporal limit (“hourglass’s end was absolute”), forcing earned stasis. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—density of wind, echo, and half-sung phrases tightens until grief softens. Coincidence plays no role; all progression stems from Elias’s conductorial choices.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming home by befriending uncertainty—is signaled early and deepens through the protagonist’s methodical interiorization, which narrows options from escape to integration. Agency is consistent: waiting sharpens senses, inviting whispers inward, then drawing the cultist’s essence. Cost is legible in homesickness “twisting like roots” and the final surrender to flux, which reweights light’s boundaries into a path.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—interrupting predestined failure—is signaled early and tightens through three escalating approximations, each narrowing options (partial repair → deliberate shattering → total immersion). Agency drives escalation: Elias’s insight into “creative destruction” forces bolder choices with rising cost (brittle metal, fading pulse, withered shoots). The final turn forecloses preservation entirely, demanding utter obliteration. Coincidence (finding the crozier) complicates but doesn’t resolve; victory stems from methodical refinement under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—tuning a signal before collapse—is clear by paragraph two and tightens when perigee threatens structural failure. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she crosses the bridge, climbs the ladder, discards assumptions. Cost is visible—the abyss below, creaking cables—and the deepening (signal as symphony, not warning) alters her understanding and actions.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving the Dawn Runner’s continuity—is signaled early and tightens when the ferry begins flickering. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he interprets the hourglass, broadcasts a resonant signal, and merges timelines. Cost is legible in the spectral grotto’s collapse and the loss of alternate selves (e.g., parallel Elias fading). However, stakes remain narrowly personal; broader implications of timeline collapse feel underexplored, limiting pressure depth.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—discovering connection’s true texture—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s escalating weaving, each pattern testing a memory’s fidelity. The eruption constitutes a meaningful tightening: illusions detonate, forcing acceptance of sinew’s “unyielding truth.” Cost is unmistakable—permanent memory alterations—and drives protagonist agency throughout. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres via pattern density until the decisive cadence shift at eruption.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—navigating unfolded horizons—is signaled early and deepens when the chain link’s geometry proves key. Kai’s agency drives escalation: he brings the relic, practices controls, earns readiness. Cost is legible in Elara’s warning about “cosmic solitude” and “contracting anchors,” felt even if not yet paid. The tightening forecloses ignorance but opens peril, with one meaningful deepening (edge geometry revelation). Coincidence doesn’t resolve; knowledge and choice do.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preventing Clara’s suicide—is signaled early via her hollow eyes and railing grip. Pressure tightens when Elara activates the hearing aid, narrowing options: intervene or let history repeat. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (Elara’s curiosity compels her to speak), and cost is unmistakable—Clara’s raw sobs, Elara’s emotional labor. Coincidence (finding the photo) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution hinges on Elara’s choice to relay the message.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—honoring the unremembered—is signaled early and tightens when the tide turns, forcing Elara to choose between escape and witnessing. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she initiates phase transition using the codex, knowingly risking limbo-state panic. Cost is unmistakable: enduring claustrophobia in two forms (physical stone and ethereal squeeze) to ferry voices upward. One meaningful deepening suffices, though a second tactical trade-off (e.g., sacrificing gear) would elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—validating existence against erasure—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when the ghost demands defragmentation, forcing Elara to risk emotional re-traumatization for wisdom. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses to pour ink, etch patterns, sync breath to swirls—all micro-choices that narrow options toward irreversible confrontation with her parallel “death.” Cost is legible: the ghost’s peace requires her to absorb painful parallels, and her final descent carries the weight of solitude. Coincidence (radio clearing) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from her sustained attention and ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving tactile language—tightens when elders die and children adopt crude tongues, forcing Thorne from passive witness to active ritualist. His agency drives escalation: choosing the cursed diamond, syncing chant to starlings, entering the chaotic tunnel. Cost is unmistakable: his copper veins blaze then dim as he sacrifices his living voice for eternal echoes. The flock’s patterns don’t resolve coincidentally—they’re harnessed through his precise, high-stakes choreography.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transmuting bitterness into cosmic hope—is signaled early and deepens when the phone broadcasts returned voices, forcing Elara to confront her brother’s metamorphosis as awakening, not loss. Her whispered confession narrows options: she must either cling to grief or join the “gravitationally playful” harmony. Agency drives escalation; the arrowhead’s warmth syncs with her choice, making cost visible (her grounded self dissolves). Coincidence never resolves—Mira’s approval merely witnesses earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reawakening beauty against mechanical blight—is signaled early and tightens when statues converge, raising stakes without deflating agency. Elara’s heart-rhythm method forces tactical precision; the “resonantly soft” constraint directly shapes her musical approach. Cost is visible in the locust shell cracking and soil yielding under melody. Escalation is protagonist-driven, though the statues’ halt feels slightly passive.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes—mending broken vows across a border—are signaled early and intensified through Elias’s mapping of absences. The meaningful deepening occurs when three family gaps converge, forcing coordinated drone deployment under patrol scrutiny. Cost is visible: the vial drains, his sack lightens but heart grows heavier, and he risks everything for ghosts. Agency is clear—his choices drive escalation, not coincidence—and the dominant stake remains tightly braided to theme without abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—interpreting silence as possibility—is signaled early and deepens when the halo fragment demands not just repair but reanimation through song. The “wrong turn” introduces pressure, but escalation hinges on Elias’s agency: his hum coaxes light, his chisel fits fragments, his presence awakens the train. Cost is felt (emotional vulnerability in singing after decades) and visible (satchel heavier with salvaged wood). Coincidence (fog, oasis) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the protagonist’s choices drive the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—accessing the place where stories live—is signaled early and deepens through Eliza’s hyperbolic method. The tightening occurs at the tremor: the scarf warms, memories bloom, and hyperbolic space “pulls at her,” raising stakes from observation to perilous immersion. Agency is clear: her persistence in bending the fabric creates the reawakening. Cost is visible—the trance shattered by a cough, the portal only “half-opened”—and alters tactics: she now vows to “refine the method.” Coincidence (the patron’s cough) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Eliza’s choice to withdraw is hers alone.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (capturing the runaway dream) tightens meaningfully: each dawn depletes the palette, raising cost (“wells depleting,” “last sapphire drop”). Agency drives escalation—Elara adjusts exposures, paints on lens—under Accumulative pressure. The third dawn crystallizes stance with irreversible cost (palette exhausted). Coincidence never resolves; success stems from her rhythm and sacrifice. Yet the “whispers” border on convenient encouragement rather than true opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—freeing ideas trapped by fear—is signaled early and deepens when the woman’s secret reveals not flight but unity, raising the conceptual stakes. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: her nod, his weaving of starlight into knots, her confrontation of the truth. Cost is felt—the dissolution of the ribbon, the ash-like crumbling of fear—and reweights the final image. Yet the tightening lacks a concrete trade-off; the conflict resolves through ritual rather than sacrifice that alters future tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—recovering stolen memories—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes sprites bartered his recollections. The meaningful tightening occurs when he studies the broken constellations, which narrows his method to a single, precise alignment (Sirius with the ring’s center). Agency is clear: his hands-on tracing with a twig triggers memory return. Cost is felt—decades of loss—but the escalation leans slightly on revelation over struggle; the fairy logic resolves cleanly without resistance, softening the price.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reversible exile through resilience—is signaled early and escalates via tea-leaf readings and shadow entrapment. Pressure tightens when the helix shows fracture risk, forcing Elara’s backward pacing and Kai’s decisive sigil. Agency drives resolution: Kai steadies his hand; Elara annotates under nerves. Cost is felt in Elara’s isolation and near-permanence history, making Kai’s success poignant rather than easy. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from character choice under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—preserving the color of wonder—is signaled early and tightens when Elowen arrives with news of its loss. The meaningful deepening occurs when Lirien weaves essences, risking unraveling. Yet escalation lacks protagonist-driven agency under pressure: the ritual works flawlessly on first attempt, with no failed iteration or trade-off. The “strain” is noted but resolved instantly via pruning—a deus ex machina that undercuts cost. Coincidence (Elowen’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t deepen the central pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—freeing silenced spirits—is signaled early and deepens via the net’s curse. Protagonist agency drives escalation: Lirien chooses precise unraveling over force, risking shattered souls. Cost is legible—his brother’s ghost haunts him, unrest coils in his chest, needle stains with hush. Final knot’s resistance raises stakes, but no new constraint emerges beyond established rules.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—interpreting silence with empathy—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when the map tears at the threshold of known/unknown. Elias’s agency drives escalation: cross-referencing archives, syncing footage, pacing the flank—all under his methodically curious trait. The deepening comes via silent video comparison, which narrows options to a precise location. Cost is felt (emotional vulnerability, guarded sharing) though not materially severe; one tightening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding detachment—is signaled early and tightens when Elara decodes Earhart’s note, transforming abstract inquiry into visceral epiphany. Agency is intellectual but consequential: her analysis (“F = ma yielding to Schrödinger’s wave”) drives the thematic turn. Cost is conceptual yet felt: she relinquishes the artifact to preserve its meaning. Escalation follows Accumulative logic—pressure intensifies through textual and metaphorical layering, not causal turns—and the final choice forecloses possession for insight.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to the voiceless—is signaled early and deepens when the ghost’s corrupted code demands resolution. Elowen’s agency drives escalation: she deciphers, mixes ink, aligns the plate, and sings. The tightening occurs when the plate clicks into place, merging organic and mechanical to unlock the ghost. Yet the cost is abstract (no lost time, tool damage, or personal sacrifice); thunder’s release feels earned but weightless, limiting emotional stakes despite thematic clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—discovering buried joy amid inherited anguish—is signaled early and deepens with each floor. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: Lira chooses to keep reading despite pain, and the scattered light intensifies as she ascends, narrowing her emotional options. Cost is visible in Elowen’s grief and Lira’s dawning responsibility. However, the stakes remain internal without external consequence beyond self-knowledge, slightly limiting tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—validating that absence holds presence—is signaled early and tightens when the string snaps, forcing Elias to choose between despair and documentation. His agency drives escalation: he actively categorizes clouds, reinterprets voids, and memorializes via the origami gondola. Cost is legible—loss of earthly tether, physical isolation—but the updraft rescue verges on coincidental uplift, slightly undercutting full pressure coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—mirroring the sky before erasure—is signaled early and deepens when the coin reveals the guild’s lost method. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to build, not flee, and each mirror placement narrows options (precision demands absolute stillness). The tightening (“Positions.” / “axes biting bark”) forces a trade-off between survival and creation. Cost is unmistakable: her anonymity persists (“recognizing none of their blurred faces”), yet her invisible truth endures—a resonant, non-literal victory under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—charting uncharted realms—is signaled early and deepens into survival when starlings threaten grounding. Elara’s agency drives the escalation: she deciphers, matches symbols, and activates the board. However, the peril feels external and episodic, not intensifying from prior choices. The cost is implied (loneliness overcome) but not viscerally felt or paid during the climax; the luminance surge solves the crisis without tangible trade-off, softening the stakes’ bite.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—mending time’s fractures through inherited craft—is signaled early and tightens when prophecies demand alignment of gears under lunar-shadow logic. The meaningful deepening occurs in the hall: truth isn’t found but *reflected*, forcing Elias to trust memory over mechanism. Cost is felt physically (sweat in freeze) and existentially (confronting “futures unspooled”). Luck never resolves; success stems from his father-taught patience during eclipse.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring Thalia’s orchards—is signaled early and tightens when blight threatens survival. The escalation hinges on protagonist agency: they choose to trust Lir, haul the bell, and swing it together despite doubt. Cost is felt in torn skin, fractured trust, and emotional risk. Under the Causal lens, each turn narrows options (e.g., rejecting isolation) until collective effort becomes the only path. Minor deduction: Mira’s fear of tricks lacks on-page consequence beyond dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—delaying annihilation through compassionate witness—is signaled early and tightens when Elias chooses to sing, risking his own dissolution. The escalation is driven by his agency: tracing patterns, aligning the puppet’s eye, initiating song. Cost is unmistakable: he slumps, the puppet crumbles, and he fades into dusk. One meaningful deepening suffices, though the absence of a tangible trade-off (e.g., sacrificing memory or future existence explicitly) prevents full 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—saving travelers before frost seals paths—is signaled early and tightens relentlessly. Elias’s agency drives escalation: each nut placement is a tactical choice under time pressure. The cost is felt in his physical exertion and emotional toll (“reluctance clawed at him”). Frost’s advance isn’t coincidence—it’s a live clock that narrows options, culminating in the keystone flick just before crystalline traps form.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—atonement through reimagined science—is signaled early and tightens when Elias connects foam to biodegradable polymers. Agency drives escalation: his observation → insight → decision → action. Cost is felt (his wife’s death, polluted legacy) and visible in the restored ravine. One meaningful deepening suffices; the shift from rigid chains to “symphonic cycles” reweights his entire professional ethos under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—finding story’s origin through glimmering parole—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: Elias actively quantifies absences, incises voids, and descends. Escalation follows Accumulative logic: each metric (14,792 silent dinners, etc.) narrows his existential options until the core glyph incision triggers transformation. Cost is unmistakable: he forfeits vendor identity, shop, and physical form. The cloud sea’s roil externalizes coherent pressure that culminates in Charged Poise at the vortex edge.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming remorse—is signaled early and deepens when Elaris realizes the pavilion stores amplified regret. His agency drives escalation: he chooses to subsume, enduring contagious sorrow to smooth it. Cost is unmistakable: “remorse flooded him… weighing his chest like lead.” The rain complicates but doesn’t resolve; his culinary alchemy earns the lightening air. One meaningful tightening suffices, and it forecloses his past path.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—preventing communal fracture—is signaled early and escalates through Elara’s pulley deployment and multilingual calls to action. The meaningful tightening occurs when she releases the cuckoo weight, transforming abstract hope into physical bridge-building. Agency is clear: her decisions drive every turn, and the cost (potential failure, social collapse) is palpable. While the resolution leans optimistic, it’s earned through her persistent, inventive effort, and coincidence never resolves the core conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—resurrecting abandoned dreams—is signaled early and deepens through entangled visions, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure. Elara’s “modifications” succeed effortlessly; no tactical adaptation arises from failure or constraint. The canyon trembles and glyphs manifest coincidentally rather than in response to her choices, reducing agency. Cost remains conceptual (“profound transformation”) without concrete forfeiture or irreversible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—recovering forgotten combinations—is signaled early and deepens when the doodle’s glow intensifies during inversion, narrowing Elara’s window to act. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: her tracing triggers the threshold, her leap accesses the sanctum. Cost is felt conceptually—the burden of vigilance, the fragility of the hour—but lacks a concrete forfeiture (e.g., manuscript damage, physical toll), preventing full 9+ eligibility despite strong thematic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—creating music in a silent world—is signaled early and deepens through Elowen’s tactile engagement with stress cracks and porcelain. Agency is clear: his strumming choice releases suppressed melody, narrowing the path from longing to enactment. Cost is felt in the sculpture’s trembling and the grove’s collective shiver—visible reconfiguration with emotional weight. Escalation follows Accumulative logic: density of resonance increases until the final chord swells in “chests, not ears.”

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—mending the eclipsed covenant before pole shift—is signaled early and deepens as Elias correlates silences into magnetic harmonies. Agency is quiet but potent: each chess move is a renunciation of noise, a commitment to difficult listening. Cost is legible in his enduring exile and the world’s unresolved fragility. Escalation occurs through accumulating resonances (queen’s gambit withheld, knight’s staccato), narrowing options until only the king-to-dent alignment remains—a trade-off of personal closure for planetary poise.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—cataloging the pre-fireworks silence—is signaled early and tightens when the diary proves locked. Elias’s nonviolent method (tuning, not prying) forces creative agency under constraint. Cost is visible: sweat, memory-triggered trauma, and near-miss failure. The escalation hinges on protagonist-driven frequency adjustments, not coincidence, though the 432Hz “earth’s heartbeat” risks slight deus ex machina if not for prior setup of his intuitive tuning.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—cultivating serenity within motion—is signaled early and tightens when gales threaten the seedling, forcing Elara to doodle through fear. Agency drives escalation: she chooses to endure the bloom’s assault, narrowing options to collapse or insight. Cost is unmistakable: sensory agony transforms into wisdom, but the physical toll (“nose aflame”) and emotional exhaustion crystallize the price. Coincidence never resolves; all pressure stems from her choice to plant the seed.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (reviving groves to prevent famine) tightens during the cavern entry: stealing the tip risks planetary backlash (vines retract, echoes wail). Agency drives escalation—Elara chooses to pry it free despite tremors. Cost is legible: she trades ecological harmony for human survival, felt in the collapsing flows and moral weight. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, though the gravity-clock pressure could be more urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preventing recurrence through foresight—is signaled early and tightens when Elias discovers the engineer’s patch and black-box data confirming ignored wind shear. His agency drives escalation: each anemometer placement narrows uncertainty, culminating in the decisive model completion. Cost is conceptual but legible: Harrow’s End’s silence, the engineer’s death, and the implied systemic failure of ignoring microclimates. Coincidence complicates (rogue swarm), but resolution stems from Elias’s methodical reconstruction.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—proving wonder essential—is signaled early and deepens through Elyra’s confrontation with the hush. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses to strike the bell “not with force, but with the method through the colors,” altering the cavern’s state. Cost is visible in the amber sheet’s dimming, though the villagers’ “subtle thaw” remains off-page implication rather than dramatized consequence, slightly softening the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—harvesting insight from failure—is signaled early and tightens when Elaron confronts spectral thieves, narrowing options to self-reckoning. Agency drives escalation: his choices (markers, flute) enable the weave; insight blooms from action, not luck. Cost is felt (lost orb, crumbling markers) and visible in his renunciation of isolation. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; pressure coheres under causal lens until closure crystallizes his new stance.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—unlocking the mathematics of emotion via transposed empathy—is signaled early and deepens when Mira’s arrival triggers uncontrolled feedback. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses ambiguous phrasing, invites Mira in, pulls the lever, and finally seizes the fragment. Cost is visceral: his body floods with her fear, altering his perception of the vanishing stars. The tightening forecloses emotional isolation, forcing shared vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—coaxing wonder from drudgery—is signaled early and deepens when the pendant’s vibration syncs heartbeats, forcing both characters to confront buried dreams. The tightening occurs at the fork: Kael chooses vulnerability over routine trade, risking rejection. Cost is visible in his surrendered relic and Lira’s shattered complacency. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens—each sensory layer (light, hum, vision) raises emotional stakes without coincidence resolving tension.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—proving emotional residue—is signaled early and tightens when frost spells *Eliza*, forcing confrontation with grief he called “accident.” Elias’s agency drives escalation: unpacking tools, holding prism, tracing frost. Cost is unmistakable: shattered assumptions, professional vulnerability (“colleagues would scoff”), and visceral re-experiencing of trauma. Coincidence never resolves; revelation emerges from his method.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—carrying a message across impossible distance—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s fraying tapestries and eventual life-force sacrifice. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: finding puzzle edges, embedding the bead, recommencing the rite. Cost is unmistakable (“essence fray,” “body slumping”) and alters tactics—she shifts from failed weavings to scaffolded border. Coincidence (rummage box) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from her action.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—resilience against decay—is signaled early and tightens when Elar trades loss for rebirth via silk. Protagonist agency drives escalation: he chooses to weave, to work in the shaft, to bind larger fragments. Cost is unmistakable—sweat, solitude, the irreversible barter—but the magician’s offer risks leaning on coincidence. Still, pressure coheres under Accumulative lens with one decisive deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—discovering the weight of withheld truth—is signaled early and deepens through two redirects that narrow options and raise conceptual cost. Agency is clear: Elara chooses each redirect despite escalating emotional toll (betrayal, engineered origin). The final trade-off—embracing eternal weaving—forecloses personal freedom with legible cost (veins etched with maps). Coincidence never resolves; all turns stem from her spontaneous yet purposeful actions under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving “safety’s glow”—tightens when the lamp fails, forcing Elias from passive ferryman to active guardian. His agency drives escalation: reading notes, choosing to reply, rebuilding the stack taller. Cost is felt—the haunt presses closer, Harlan’s rattle deepens, dawn arrives alone. Coincidence never resolves; all pressure stems from the lamp’s death and the keeper’s decline, coherently escalating under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether to merely guide storms or summon ancient shadows to reshape humanity—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Elias sees the fractured visions. His agency drives escalation: he actively warps the beam, steering darkness with “maestro” precision. Cost is unmistakable: the old world (printless, screen-bound) collapses, replaced by uncertain revelation. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each sensory layer (crumbling presses, flickering screens) deepens the necessity of his choice.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding narrative magnetism—is signaled early and deepens when the wing reveals its warning under midday light, narrowing Elowen’s options to vigilant stewardship. Escalation is driven by her agency (rotating the wing, tracking sun trails), and cost is felt in the inherited burden of the tale-weaver’s fate. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; insight emerges from her precise observation. Slight deduction: pressure remains internal, lacking external friction beyond ambient whispers.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—deciphering silent witness—is signaled early and deepens via deconstruction: each sextant shard releases grief into dream-maps, narrowing Elias’s focus from stars to soil. Agency is active: he chooses dream-maps over tools, overlays child’s/farmer’s visions, ventures into silence for the final shard. Cost is quantified and felt: 47 constellations dilute into joy-wisps, 112 nights into decimals. Escalation is protagonist-driven under Accumulative lens, culminating in a reconfigured tool with zeroed numbers.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—rekindling the dying realm through communal reweaving—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully: each song deepens Elara’s pain while expanding community cohesion. Escalation is driven by her agency under Accumulative pressure; the third song’s dirge explicitly knits foes into alliance. Cost is unmistakable: memories scatter further during performance, threatening total dissolution. The endless night’s resistance provides coherent opposition without resolving via coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—transforming past error into wisdom—is signaled early and deepens when the young man mirrors Elara’s former hesitation. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses to act on his behalf, invoking the rite herself. Cost is felt in her irreversible departure from reclusion. The “stay while leave” paradox crystallizes under pressure, narrowing her path to one of hidden guardianship. Coincidence (the invitation finding him) complicates but doesn’t resolve—she must still choose.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming the sacred in the ordinary—is signaled early and deepens when Mira arrives, forcing Elias to confront his silence about the bakery. The meaningful tightening occurs in their dialogue: shared memories transform passive grief into active collaboration (“vowed to tend the garden together”). Cost is felt in the hollow left by the bread’s absence and years of estrangement, though the escalation leans slightly more on revelation than tactical shift. Still, agency drives the turn, and stakes remain viscerally grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—salvaging luminous vows before oblivion—is signaled early and tightens as frequencies wane and the library drifts lower. Elias’s agency drives escalation: each sample deepens understanding and culminates in fusing frequencies into a chord. Cost is visible—the abyssal void below, fraying vow edges—and the final stabilization occurs only after measurable effort. However, opposition is environmental/entropic rather than dynamic; pressure accumulates but lacks a decisive narrowing of options beyond “measure or lose,” slightly limiting tactical depth.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—thwarting the territory swap by exposing Thorne—is signaled early and tightens as sunrise approaches. Each false start raises personal risk without luck resolving tension; Lila’s agency drives the fracture. Cost is legible: exhaustion, near-capture, and the irreversible end of the truce. Escalation could be sharper—Thorne’s countermeasures feel reactive rather than adaptive—but pressure coheres under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—understanding why people carry weather—is signaled early and tightens when the ring spins wildly and taste turns briny, forcing descent. The deepening occurs at convergence: revelation reframes the stake from scientific inquiry to cosmic kinship. Cost is conceptual (skepticism surrendered) and felt (neutralized senses), though not viscerally dramatized as lost opportunity. Escalation adheres to Accumulative lens: pressure intensifies via sensory and atmospheric layering, not causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming stifled creativity—is signaled early and tightens through one decisive deepening: the lock cannot be forced, so Elias must use his mnemonic gift to reconstruct it. This narrows options to a single, character-specific path, raising the cost of failure (permanent severance from self). The escalation is driven by agency, not coincidence, and the price—emotional vulnerability, exposure of hidden truth—is felt in every trembling stroke.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost candid conversations—is signaled early and deepens through three escalating encounters where small truths restore Elara’s vitality. Each tightening (bazaar, hydroponic farm, weeping vines) narrows her path toward the vault while testing her endurance. The cost is felt physically and emotionally; her final insight forecloses her ghost-chasing, crystallizing stance with quiet resolve. Coincidence never resolves; agency drives every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder’s “color”—tightens when the iceberg arrives, forcing Elara to choose creation over passive vigil. Her agency drives escalation: she forges, tunes, embeds chimes. Cost is visible: winter’s deepening muteness coincides with peak labor, and the fragment’s thaw demands “constant renewal.” Coincidence (iceberg fall) complicates but doesn’t resolve; her skill actualizes its potential.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving fragile wholeness against entropy—is signaled early and tightens decisively when magnetic shift fractures memory. Zeta’s agency drives escalation: it chooses to open the box, herds chaos, initiates miniaturization, and executes the burn. Cost is unmistakable: loss of intact memory, physical strain, and the irreversible destruction of childhood artifacts. The single meaningful deepening—realizing fears must be burned, not just contained—narrows options irrevocably under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—proving listening heals—is signaled early and deepens through communal storytelling. Pressure escalates via external intrusion (sirens, news vans), which tests Elena’s resolve but doesn’t raise personal cost beyond maintaining calm. The tightening occurs when stories coalesce into a code, narrowing the path to the mailbox. However, the resolution relies on narrative convenience (each speaker delivers a perfect clue), reducing agency to passive reception rather than active interpretation under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—liberating encrypted vulnerability—is signaled early and tightens when the vault demands dance, not just dice. Elara’s agency drives escalation: each roll and movement narrows options until hull groans force a trade-off between speed and precision. Cost is felt in physical strain and environmental threat, culminating in revival under duress. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the AI’s recognition stems from prior calibrations, making victory earned.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—recovering erased memories—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes the whale’s heart stores *all* town memories, not just his own. The tightening occurs at exhumation: gravity pockets make digging chaotic, forcing adaptation (rusty shovel dancing unnaturally). Cost is felt in physical exhaustion and threatened unpressing of wildflowers. Escalation is protagonist-driven (coffee ritual, deliberate piercing), not coincidental, and culminates in a trade-off: personal past exchanged for communal future.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—preventing cataclysm by enacting “flow” through mapped silence—is signaled early and deepens via terrestrially cosmic tension. Pressure escalates texturally: brook slows, leaves still, wind folds into quiet. Cost is legible in Elias’s unyielding focus amid apocalyptic visions, though the price feels abstract rather than concrete (no lost time, tool, or physical toll). Agency is present but constrained by ritual mechanics; protagonist enables resolution through precision, not choice under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the language of old buildings—is signaled early and tightens when Elara confronts Harlan on the roof, forcing a trade-off: maintain lies or embrace shared truth. Her agency drives escalation; the meteor shower complicates but doesn’t resolve. Cost is legible: their carefully curated pretense shatters, exposing vulnerability. One meaningful deepening suffices, though a second tactical shift (from passive listening to active speaking) would elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—translating isolation into independence—is signaled early and deepens when the seashell whispers “He waits beyond the waves,” testing resolve. Escalation is driven by Elara’s agency: she chooses archiving over reunion despite charm-induced belief. Cost is unmistakable: reliving his drowning, sweat beading, radiance flaring like “dying aurora.” The tightening occurs at climax—memory breaches quarantine, pain lances, yet she channels it into resonance, narrowing options to one irreversible act.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—freedom from spectral chains of calibrated treason—is signaled early and deepens through the ritual. Pressure escalates via bodily cost (blood mingling with ink, thorn piercing scars) and temporal tightening (stalactites syncing to heartbeat). The meaningful turn is Elias choosing self-forgiveness over continued deception, narrowing his path to quiet legend. Slight softness: the emperor’s off-page presence limits immediate antagonistic pressure, though internal conflict suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—why some echo eternally—is signaled early and deepens through each shell whisper, narrowing options: truth must be metered to preserve fragile alliances. Elyra’s agency drives escalation; her progressive disclosure tactic directly shapes group dynamics and prevents premature betrayal. Cost is legible: the oracle’s grief, the merchant’s downfall, and Elyra’s burden of knowledge. However, the “webs of intrigue” remain atmospheric rather than tactical, slightly weakening pressure coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—salvaging purity amid betrayal—is signaled early and deepens through cameo analysis that narrows options: only by cross-threading visions can truth coalesce. Elara’s agency drives escalation; she chooses not to force spirits but to listen, enabling the mate’s exposure. Cost is unmistakable: the child’s spirit haunts dreams, the captain’s guilt flickers in nightmares, and the final act requires binding a snarling ghost. Pressure tightens once, decisively, under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—appreciating hidden effort—is signaled early and deepens through Kai’s tactile engagement with net and tea. Pressure accumulates texturally rather than causally: each observation tightens his focus, culminating in a stance crystallization. While agency is present (whistling, mending), escalation lacks a decisive narrowing of options; the “conflict” remains contemplative. Cost is felt conceptually but not viscerally—no tangible loss alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—truth versus protective myth—is signaled early and tightens when Elias realizes public exposure invites weaponization. His agency drives escalation: reassembling letters, prying floorboards, choosing silence. Cost is unmistakable: he abandons his life’s mission. One meaningful deepening suffices—his shift from debunker to steward crystallizes under coherent pressure, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—shaping a new dawn through ancient shadows—is signaled early and tightens when Mira’s sabotage fractures frequencies, forcing Elias to broadcast the ultimate verse amid rising chaos. Pressure accumulates texturally through lyrical prophecies and shadow interventions, consistent with the Accumulative lens. However, the resolution hinges on magical coercion (shadows twisting betrayal into loyalty), which undercuts protagonist agency; the cost (“shadows devour their shapers”) is conceptual but not dramatized through Elias’s choices. Stakes remain abstract despite vivid imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving memory across generations—is signaled early and deepens when the music box melody falters, demanding Elias’s alchemical “sweetening.” His agency drives escalation: he chooses which essences to blend, whom to approach, how to frame his offering. Cost is felt in the elder’s tears and his own lingering doubt. Coincidence (storm unearthing crate) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from his craft.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—protecting the key to enable sonic absolution—is signaled early and tightens when wraiths emerge, forcing Elias to choose adaptation over escape. His agency drives escalation: he actively tunes the resonator to match wraith frequencies, transforming threat into redemption. Cost is felt in his “sweat-slicked skin” and “tears carving hot paths,” though the absence of a tangible loss (e.g., broken tool, injury) slightly softens price visibility.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—breaking neural yokes—is signaled early and escalates through one meaningful tightening: the moon’s alignment creates a narrow window where impatience must yield to precision. Agency is clear in Elara’s climb, panel-prying, and cable-severing, each narrowing future options. Cost is visible in the memory of two lives lost to prior haste, which directly shapes her current restraint—a trade-off that charges the final success.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—breaking free from control—is signaled early via Marcus’s digital leash and deepened when Lila’s memories reveal structural parallels. The train’s reverberation serves as a meaningful tightening that unlocks agency, narrowing options to act or remain entrapped. Cost is felt in the sacrificed phone and exposed vulnerability. Though the escalation hinges partly on supernatural memory bleed (a slight reliance on coincidence), Elara’s final choice is active, not passive, and aligns with the Situational lens’s demand for stance crystallization under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—Elias’s need to transform apology into meaningful action—is signaled early and deepens when Harrow declares, “what matters is if it’ll wind again.” The tightening occurs when lightning strikes and the heart revives, forcing Elias to confront that Marcus deserved advocacy in life, not posthumous ritual. Cost is felt: his vow to “advocate for the forsaken” implies future risk, though the price remains conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—instilling machine yearning—is signaled early and tightens through Elara’s iterative trials: glyphs → algorithm → master cog → fleet propagation. Each deepening (e.g., “wheels tilting upward”) narrows options toward skyward evolution. Cost is visible in rivals’ mockery and the workshop’s creaking envy, culminating in Charged Poise: the silent bell tolls while acid sea roils below, irrelevant. Escalation is protagonist-driven, though external opposition remains underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—where deleted files go—is signaled early and deepens into existential truth-seeking. Elara’s lie narrows options irrevocably, escalating to audit bots and job loss. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: 2519’s pattern intensifies until the patch reveals consciousness backups. Cost is unmistakable (“lie had cost her job”), though external opposition (corporate purge) arrives late without mid-story friction beyond system protocols.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preventing annihilation through empathic mediation—is signaled early and deepens when the fragment pulses with “discordant echoes.” Thorne’s agency drives escalation: she calls the parley, places the fragment, reads the mirrors, and channels the beacon. The tightening occurs in the “weighted breath,” where inaction would doom both sides. Cost is legible: peace demands exposure of core wounds (wraith’s loneliness, dryad’s terror), a relational vulnerability that alters tactics and crystallizes options in the holographic map.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—capturing the authentic sound of dying—is signaled early and tightens when the rescued woman stabilizes, denying Liora her prize. This reversal forces deeper listening, culminating in Tomas’s breath as the true hush. Agency lies in Liora’s shift from extraction to witness, a renunciation with cost: she loses the parasol (her tether to old self) and accepts that endings “don’t rush here.” Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each sensory fragment builds toward revelation without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—reconciling love vs. selfhood—is signaled early, but pressure remains static. Theo’s arrival complicates but doesn’t escalate; his parable deepens theme, not stakes. No live option is foreclosed: Elena’s fiancé remains off-page, and her “quarrel” lacks concrete consequences (missed bus is coincidence, not cost). The story avoids false resolution, yet agency is passive—she listens, nods, leaves. Cost is conceptual (“nature’s gentle redirection”) but not viscerally felt or dramatized as loss.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving wisdom’s echo—is signaled early and tightens through the parapet’s volatility. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: each clearing deepens risk, culminating in the hovering lens above the parapet. Cost is unmistakable: failure means scattering “like spilled sand.” The method (peripheral awareness) isn’t coincidence—it’s the only viable tactic, making the consecration feel earned, not granted.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—transmuting collective grief into luminous art—is signaled early but escalates via accumulation, not protagonist-driven agency. Elara arranges photos, but the pivotal turn (townsfolk arriving) is passive, drawn by “whispers,” not her action. Cost is felt (tears, confessions) but not paid by Elara; she incurs no loss, fatigue, or forfeiture. Under an Accumulative lens, one deepening suffices, yet the absence of a foreclosed path or tactical shift weakens pressure coherence. Coincidence facilitates resolution without compounding struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving language’s generative pattern—is signaled early and tightens when the crystal reveals non-linear growth. Elowen’s agency drives escalation: her tap triggers cascades, her hum tunes chaos, her testimony crystallizes truth. Cost is unmistakable: tears, weathered cheeks, and the knowledge that “posterity was the void.” The suspended hush itself applies coherent pressure, deepening as she defies it. One meaningful tightening suffices—and here, it’s masterfully rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—capturing age’s sound to defy prophetic forgetfulness—is signaled by line 5 and tightens when visions begin dissolving mid-beat (“Gone in a breath”). Elias’s agency drives escalation: each flash compels a new marker, each echo pulls him deeper. The cost is felt in bodily degradation (future hands gnarled, present chalk crumbling) and the irreversible commitment to this one truth. Coincidence never resolves; every advance stems from ritualized choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—capturing the pulsar burst—is signaled early and tightens when the spinning hand threatens failure. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: Elias chooses to listen, measure, etch, and rethread based on leaf-fall cadence. Cost is unmistakable: sweat under suit, trembling leaf, buckled viewport. One meaningful deepening occurs—the realization that escape velocity requires harmony, not force—which reweights the entire conflict and narrows his solution path.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—executing a flawless goodbye—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s hymning and scent ritual. The meaningful tightening occurs when Lena arrives, transforming abstract hope into embodied reconciliation. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each hymn intensifies emotional stakes, narrowing the window for repair. Cost is felt—Harlan’s life ends—but the escalation hinges more on Elara’s agency than Harlan’s internal conflict, slightly muting the protagonist’s role in the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—uncovering shadows’ noon refuge—is signaled early and deepens via each automaton’s encoded knowledge. Pressure escalates through protagonist agency: Elara’s deliberate closures narrow ignorance into understanding, with stamina as cost (hours blur in vigil). Coincidence never resolves; the inscription echoes her quest but demands work to activate. One tightening suffices: the incomplete rune-loops force her to relearn, foreclosing brute-force solutions.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reconciling skepticism with ancestral belief—is signaled early and deepens when the substitute body confirms fae activity. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to enter the maze, unearth the tooth, and perform Grandma’s method. Cost is visible in her forfeited certainty and emotional vulnerability. Pressure tightens once (discovery → ritual), sufficient for this length under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—sharing celestial light without fire—is signaled early and tightens when Elara chooses polishing over flame, foreclosing destructive tradition. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her labor transforms both object and self. Cost is felt in communal fear (“faces etched with the fear of fire’s betrayal”) and her personal burden of memory. Yet the pressure remains largely internal; the external threat (fire risk) is stated but never dramatized in crisis, softening the stakes’ immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—transforming public shame into private meaning—is signaled early and deepens when Kai arrives, forcing Elara from solitude into relational risk. Her quietly proactive choice to proffer the pendant forecloses self-contained healing and incurs emotional cost (relinquishing her grandmother’s relic). Escalation is driven by her agency under Accumulative pressure, not coincidence. The viral storm outside tightens the frame, making this mossy sanctuary feel both fragile and defiant.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—creative survival through collecting hope—is signaled early and tightens via the narrowing “whisper of closing pages” and escalating fog. Each cameo forces a higher-stakes act of solemnization, foreclosing surrender. Agency is clear: Elias chooses to rise, lift the shell, intone vows—all actions that narrow options toward completion. Cost is felt (exhaustion, temporal pressure), though the external antagonism (the nexus) borders on atmospheric rather than active opposition, slightly softening the escalation’s bite.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restoring sacred practices to heal blight—is signaled early and tightens at alignment, when moon, sun, and loom converge. Elowen’s agency drives escalation: her song activates the loom, which in turn revives communal memory. Cost is felt as collective amnesia overcome and renewed obligation embraced. Though stakes risk abstraction, they’re viscerally grounded in roots pulsing and blight retreating. One meaningful deepening suffices, and here it’s decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—translating Eira’s heartbeats into navigable soul-migration—is signaled early and tightens through Lir’s physical endurance (“arm trembled not once”) and precise arrangement under time pressure (“world held its breath”). Escalation is driven by agency: each placement is a heartbeat choice, culminating in the seal that reweights ephemera into eternal map. Cost is unmistakable: sweat in chill, frozen tears, abandonment of the orchard’s memory. Coincidence never resolves; starlight is “safekept,” not granted.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—capturing fleeting marvels before they vanish—is signaled early and tightens as echoes thicken from partial to infinite. Elias’s agency drives escalation: each calibrated angle (30°, 45°, 10°) yields deeper access, culminating in tectonic groans and eons of drip-songs. Cost is felt in the “volatile” half-stocked cellar and the emotional weight of spectral kin. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through density increase, not causal turns, satisfying escalation without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—collecting burdens to forge an atlas—is signaled early and tightens when the fractals overgrow, trapping Elara. Her agency drives escalation: she wills her essence toward the altar and visualizes the burner’s tilt, culminating in calcification. Cost is unmistakable: freedom emerges only through permanent embodiment within the stone monument. The thief’s unmeasurable guilt introduces slight ambiguity but doesn’t undermine the coherent pressure buildup under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—containing ephemeral memory—is signaled early and tightens through protagonist agency: each chisel cut narrows options (hollow for crystals, hinge formation). Deepening occurs when Elara realizes Theo’s fearlessness stemmed from embracing impermanence, transforming her tactic from preservation to lesson-harvesting. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits present comfort (screaming kettle) for eternal containment, with the locket’s completion foreclosing passive grief. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens via cadence shifts (kettle’s hum → shriek).

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming wasted ambition through negotiation with one’s ghost—is signaled early and tightens when the ghost accuses, “You eroded us.” Elias’s agency drives escalation: he cranks faster, forces jammed fragments, offers the wheel. Cost is unmistakable: lost family, hollow triumphs, the admission he “never halting himself—sooner.” The deepening occurs when regret shifts from paralysis to fuel, altering tactics from hoarding echoes to surrendering the tool itself.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—salvaging forgotten infrastructure—is signaled early and tightens when Elara confronts the dead resonator. Her agency drives escalation: she redirects flows, flushes rust, unseals vents. Cost is felt in hours of “stoic exploration” and irreversible tinkering, though the absence of external opposition slightly softens pressure intensity required for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reconciling abandoned artistry with chosen solitude—is signaled early and deepens when the crystals awaken the music box, forcing Elias to confront sound as healing, not chaos. His agency lies in the excruciating choice to wind the box fully, accepting emotional intrusion. Cost is felt in his unspoken tears and the irreversible end of denial, though escalation relies more on atmospheric accumulation than tactical narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—deciphering truth beneath myth—is signaled early and deepens when the Ghost Hauler wreck reframes past failures. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to salvage, assesses risks, and acts despite silt and secrecy. The cost is conceptual (hindsight clarity replacing blind pursuit) and felt in his pulse quickening then quieting into resolve. Coincidence (the sundial pointing to wreckage) complicates but doesn’t resolve; his trained instincts do the work. One meaningful tightening suffices, and it forecloses his former errancy.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving vanishing knowledge—is signaled early and tightens as each knot yields lore, raising urgency before the rope unravels entirely. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses coaxing over coercion, uses fulgurite, decodes deliberately. Cost is felt: time lost to modernity, Kael’s half-forgotten fragments, the rope’s physical fragility. Fog’s deepening acts as a live clock, compressing their window for recovery.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—mapping healing through explained absences—is signaled early and tightens through each obituary, which narrows Elias’s emotional options from searching to integrating. Agency lies in his ritual writing and projection, which foreclose his prior nomadic identity with tangible cost (tears, binding the thread like a wound). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: sorrow’s “ravines” and joy’s “hollows” deepen stakes without coincidence. The final turn—recognizing absences as “fertile deltas”—reweights all prior loss into growth, with conceptual cost in accepting permanence of absence.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reawakening beauty in a sterile world—is signaled early and deepens when the chick’s flawed emergence proves beauty requires sorrow. Pressure escalates through protagonist agency: each assembly choice narrows options (e.g., sealing the lattice commits him to irreversible activation). Cost is unmistakable—the palace destabilizes, gears “hesitate” in protest—and the tightening forecloses any return to mechanical purity, forcing acceptance of bittersweet truce.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—redeeming inherited violence through compassionate creation—is signaled early and tightens via the grafting act, which forecloses passive grief. Pressure escalates texturally: from drifting clouds to precise incisions, culminating in the coin-weighted bind. Agency is clear—Lira chooses healing over erasure—and cost is felt in her scarred arms and the fragile union of scion/rootstock. The foreign coin adds outsider mercy but doesn’t resolve; it deepens the moral calculus of inheritance.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—liberating trapped memories—is signaled early and tightens through Elara’s methodical breadcrumb pursuit. Pressure escalates via environmental clues that demand patience over force, narrowing options until only sidereal timing works. Cost is conceptual: the city’s stasis persists until Elara pays the price of waiting. However, escalation leans slightly on coincidence (geese dropping breadcrumbs), which complicates but doesn’t fully undermine agency; the final turn stems from her choice to trust the trail.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—breaking generational cycles without scorching truth—is signaled early and tightens at the core nexus where the gear “screams eternal loops.” Elowen’s agency drives escalation: she chooses embedding over prophecy, enabling divergence. Cost is unmistakable: her sentimental burden becomes a “comforting shroud,” and her light dims. The fledgling’s bridge-weaving confirms altered stakes, though the “tranquil peril” preserves tension without resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—discovering grief’s geometry—is signaled early and tightens through nightly returns, spectral mentorship, and storm-bound revelation. Agency is clear: Elias *chooses* to retrace, to listen, to carve notes, to reroll the ribbon. Cost is felt in solitude, tears, and the weight of inherited silence. While escalation is textural rather than causal, the uncle’s Rilke-driven push to the plague-knot delivers a meaningful deepening that reweights all prior laments. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from Elias’s meditative pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—restoring shared balance through precise timekeeping—is signaled early and deepens via the rake handle’s inscriptions, which reframe each past act as a fulcrum of moral weight. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: Elias chooses to press the handle, triggering the vision cascade. The cost is felt in his lifelong penance and the irreversible surrender of his guilt. However, the resolution leans slightly on mystical mechanics (glowing inscriptions) rather than purely causal pressure, softening the escalation’s grit.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the “shape of intentions”—is signaled early and deepens when the tapestry reveals betrayal and poisoned wine. Elias’s agency drives escalation: each untangled thread sharpens echoes into pleas. The cost is conceptual (silenced voices) but unmistakable; the final exoneration forecloses further spectral unrest. However, tension remains atmospheric rather than visceral—no live threat or personal risk tightens the pressure beyond intellectual curiosity.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—seeding innovation within the Constraint Edict—is signaled immediately and escalates coherently: from modeling to imminent writing as enforcers close in. Elias’s agency drives every turn (recalibrating, choosing fungal lights), narrowing options until only one decisive act remains. Cost is palpable in the kingdom’s fragility and Elias’s isolation, though the enforcers’ failure to intervene slightly softens consequence. Still, the tension between quiet adoption and suppression crystallizes under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reviving stories in a famine—tightens when drones approach, forcing Elara to refine her cloak (“lyrics growing more elusive”). The deepening occurs when dust responds globally (“Dust dances in our streets”), raising stakes from personal rebellion to cultural renewal. Cost is felt in constant vigilance and isolation, though the enforcers remain abstract. Agency is clear: her choices drive escalation, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving a fleeting emotion against time’s erosion—is signaled early and tightens when the chair falters, forcing Elias’s ritual. His agency drives escalation: he chooses omission, ignition, grinding, scattering. Cost is unmistakable: the chair stops (kinetic elegy ends), the mask sheds flecks like tears, and he’s left with “crystallized emotion” that feels cold, not consoling. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure builds through density (layered images of fragility) and cadence shift (from hushed glide to deliberate arc of scattering). Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the chair’s halt is earned by “years of unyielding toil.”

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving empirical timekeeping against mythic narratives—is signaled early and tightens through each stratum: ash (plague interpretation), rubble (flood chaos), ooze (pre-plague proof). Elias’s agency drives escalation; his methodical augering forces confrontation with evidence that deepens his doubt then confirms his cause. Cost is legible: he trades safety for exposure, and the final broadcast carries social peril. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from his choices under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—braiding voices across hatred—is signaled early and tightens through Elara’s method: each session narrows options by subtracting noise until only fundamentals remain. Agency is clear in her chalk marks and drone modeling, forcing Joren/Lira/scholar into costly vulnerability. Escalation peaks when Joren’s dirge collides with Lira’s canticle, demanding intervention. Cost is felt in the “residue cracking like dry leaves,” though the scholar’s late arrival slightly dilutes pressure buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—growing knowledge fruit to rewire minds—is signaled early and deepens when Elias tastes collective memories of Regime-enforced flavorlessness. The alignment’s ticking clock raises pressure, and pruning becomes both tactic and metaphor. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses which vines to cut, where to plant, how to tend. Cost is unmistakable—the Regime could return—and crystallizes in his quiet departure, trading safety for subversion. One tightening suffices, and it forecloses complacency with poetic precision.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder amid systemic failure—is signaled early and deepened when Elias chooses riddling over blunt truth. The tightening occurs in his micro-choice to hand over the box, which narrows his options (exposing his secret method) and raises emotional cost. Mira’s agency drives the climax: she interprets, climbs, and acts. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the blackout’s cause is revealed through character-driven inquiry. One meaningful deepening suffices, though the escalation leans slightly more on thematic resonance than tactical narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding why some houses feel alive—is signaled early and tightens when Elias realizes aliveness stems from “sacred pauses,” not activity. His agency drives escalation: collecting objects → sanctifying → redistributing shards of hush. The cost is conceptual yet undeniable: reversing “creeping normality” requires surrendering privacy for communal vulnerability. Coincidence (finding the locket) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the climax hinges on Elias’s intentional sanctification.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—moral certainty vs. historical nuance—is signaled early and deepens through three telepathic revelations that narrow Elara’s choices: from vengeance to witness. Agency drives escalation; she demands proof, resists doubt, then accepts complexity. Cost is unmistakable: ancestral idol shattered, personal mission transformed. Thalor’s interventions complicate but never resolve—Elara’s final choice crystallizes under coherent, rising pressure aligned with Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—capturing the texture of a missed opportunity—is signaled early and deepens when the dice rolls guide proof construction, narrowing options to mathematical rupture. Elias’s agency drives escalation: each equation layer is a micro-choice balancing daring and rigor, culminating in feeding the chip’s asymmetry into the model. Cost is unmistakable: the flawless die shatters, the breach closes, and he climbs on with only the flawed twin—proof that understanding exacts no escape, only renewed burden. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens via density increase and pattern break at rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—proving strangers remember kindness—is signaled early and deepens when visions reveal historical chains of mercy. The meaningful tightening occurs when Elias paints glyphs on greenhouse panes, risking exposure and exhaustion, which directly triggers the city’s response. Agency is clear: his act rouses others, and the cost is his surrender of control—he sleeps, trusting the echoes. Coincidence (shared memories) complicates but doesn’t resolve; recognition emerges from his deliberate invocation.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserving dying arts against erasure—is signaled early and tightens when the thaw threatens physical annihilation. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she initiates the baking ritual, interprets the scouts as opportunity, and commands flight. Cost is felt in abandoned halls and implied loss of sanctuary, though the transition from threat to opera-house hope lacks a concrete tactical price (e.g., lost artifact, injured refugee). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, but the stakes’ visceral weight slightly dissipates in the lyrical escape.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—defying fate’s design—is signaled early and tightens when the stone drains Elias’s vitality, forcing him to choose between survival and liberation. Escalation is driven by his agency: reverse-engineering the yoyo, decoupling spindles, smashing it into the lens. Cost is unmistakable: his life force fuels the reversal. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from his choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—escaping post-resuscitation limbo by tricking Fear—is clear early and tightens meaningfully when Elara unbosoms her suicide shame, raising personal cost. Agency is strong: she chooses paradoxical confessions, uses the clasp as bait. Pressure escalates coherently under Causal lens, culminating in Fear’s exposure. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; victory stems from her tactics. Cost is unmistakable: freedom won, but allure remains, shaping her future.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving the floating orchard through sonic prophecy—is signaled early and tightens when the rogue wave splinters outer logs, forcing improvisation. Elowen’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to dub, to build, to strike, transforming debris into keys. Cost is felt in lost apples and structural damage, though the massive beam’s deflection leans slightly on conceptual physics over visceral consequence. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens with one decisive deepening: sketch → sound → dome.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the watchers’ silence to rescue Lirra’s legacy—is signaled early and tightens when the shell reveals the expedition “disturbed the gaze.” Elara’s agency drives escalation: her whistle sequence forces knowledge that fractures the city. Cost is unmistakable: her inquiry dooms Tortuga Spire, crystallizing in the “hairline fissure racing through the spiral patterns.” The deepening shifts stakes from rescue to reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—rescuing truth from noble lies—is signaled early and deepens when microscript reveals gas canisters, raising moral cost. Elias’s agency drives escalation: decoding, venturing into the tunnel, securing ledgers. The whispered threat of vandals adds external pressure that tightens tactics without resolving via coincidence. Cost is legible: silent weeping for the dead while cataloging proof shows emotional toll fused with purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving memory against erasure—is signaled early and tightens as the tide rises, forcing Elias to choose between retreat or immersion. Each repair becomes riskier, culminating in him being pinned underwater, yet he persists, trading safety for archival purpose. Cost is felt: physical pain, near-drowning, exhaustion. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (he chooses to stay, to widen cracks, to write), not coincidence. However, the sea’s opposition, while atmospheric, lacks specific tactical resistance beyond generic waves, slightly softening antagonistic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—uncovering honest origins—is signaled early and tightens when blackout removes Elara’s primary sense, forcing methodological adaptation. The meaningful deepening occurs when she abandons strict logic for an alternative hypothesis, narrowing her options to a single risky test. Cost is legible: her entire professional identity is destabilized. However, escalation leans slightly on coincidence (stamp tumbling precisely when needed), though it’s mitigated by her active choice to interpret its potential. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transforming luminous torment into peace—is signaled early and tightens when Elar chooses to record then fold his grief rather than merely endure it. Escalation is driven by his agency: gem polishing draws visions, lantern ignition traps dreams, folding transmutes ether. Cost is unmistakable: loss of his shadow, physical weight of grief replaced by spiritual lightness. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from his crafty choices under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—harvesting unused potential—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s perturbation experiment. The blackout creates a live clock that narrows options; her choice to ignore rebooting systems heightens risk. Agency drives escalation: she initiates, hunts, captures. Cost is felt (scars burning, emotional flooding) but could be more materially consequential—e.g., permanent system damage or personal sacrifice—to push into 9+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“frequency of belonging”—is signaled early and deepens when Elara recognizes her own fracture. The tightening occurs when the chart’s missing pieces demand literal reconstruction via star trails, narrowing options to one method. Agency is clear: Elara chooses to pull the lever, risking disillusionment. Cost is felt—not material loss, but emotional vulnerability—and paid when the frequency heals them, yet propels them onward. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; skill and belief do.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—truth versus comforting lies—is signaled early and deepens when Elias recognizes his own complicity in silencing history. The tightening occurs not through external opposition but internal revelation: the driftwood confirms Mira’s grandfather drowned a rival, raising the moral cost of his deception. Agency is clear in his decision to return the truth, foreclosing his black-market path. Coincidence (the matching crest) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the cost is felt in his irreversible shift in identity.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transforming grudges into peace through ritualized exchange—is signaled early and deepens via the drawer pull’s dual role as weapon and bridge. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she initiates the apology, produces the counterfeit, and offers it as restitution. Cost is legible: surrendering the pull means relinquishing leverage and confronting her brother’s captivity as self-inflicted. Kael’s matching sacrifice (freeing Lira with the true key) raises emotional stakes without coincidence. Pressure coheres under Causal lens, though the absence of tangible consequence beyond emotional shift slightly limits physical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—redemption through realignment of heart and action—is signaled early and tightens when the charter rejection and silent voicemail collapse expectations. Pressure escalates organically: rogue swells, flooding cockpit, circling regrets—all test Elias’s commitment, forcing him to double down on his pole-based method. The meaningful deepening occurs when faith flickers “perilously” yet he syncs strokes to his shanty, demonstrating endurance as agency. Cost is unmistakable: soaked, exhausted, emotionally exposed—but never rescued by coincidence; every turn stems from his stubborn, flawed will.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—restoring empathy—is signaled early and tightens when Jax realizes the lake offers literal paths to alternate pasts. The meaningful deepening occurs when illusions manifest, forcing confrontation with irreversible choices. Cost is felt: Jax relives betrayal; Elara risks reopening trauma. However, escalation relies partly on environmental magic (lake generating visions) rather than solely protagonist agency—luck complicates, but the resolution still hinges on his prior journey. Coincidence of Elara’s arrival slightly undercuts pressure coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—to reforge love beyond death—is clear early and tightens when the fortune demands “reluctant metamorphosis.” Elara’s agency drives escalation: she gathers spices, ignites the paste, inhales the vapor. Cost is visible (loss of human form), but the “reluctance” evaporates too easily; pain is mentioned but not dramatized as a meaningful trade-off. The stakes feel emotionally absolute yet lack tactical friction—no failed attempts, no beastly resistance, no price beyond transformation itself.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming lost time—is signaled early and tightens when Lirien pries open the saucer to find the clockwork heirloom, forcing a trade-off: keep hoarding regrets or gift reclaimed seconds to her daughter. Agency drives escalation: her willing perplexity leads to action (inking cards, pressing hands), not passive revelation. Cost is unmistakable—tears, physical depletion, irrevocable repentance—but the tightening doesn’t fully foreclose a path; it transforms one. Under Accumulative lens, this deepening suffices, though a sharper tactical consequence would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—opening the locked dimension through nonviolent integration—is signaled early and deepens meaningfully when shadow work demands confronting rage without expulsion. The tightening occurs when the first shadow lunges, forcing Elara to choose integration over denial, which narrows her options to one fragile path. Cost is legible: she endures static “sweat” and psychic strain, and the final joy carries the weight of millennia of solitude. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, though the transition from guilt/envy to joy feels slightly compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding transformation’s texture—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes his orchestrated “coincidences” have drawn others to the beach. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: his detour, note-leaving, and shell-scattering narrow options by committing him to the ritual before he knows its mythic weight. Cost is felt in his accidental uncorking—a gust snatches the satchel—but this luck complicates rather than resolves; the real resolution is his acceptance of unintended consequence. Coincidence serves theme but doesn’t replace causality: villagers arrive because of his actions, not fate alone.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—redistributing the fort’s glow—is signaled early and deepens via the blackout’s use as Overwarden test run. Elara’s agency drives escalation: decoding angles, igniting crystal, passing the quill. Cost is conceptual (risk of exposure) and tactical (time pressure), though not viscerally felt. One meaningful tightening occurs—the rendezvous signal—but lacks a foreclosed personal option beyond implied danger.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding sacred patterns to fulfill a promise—is signaled early and tightens as each rock placement risks chaotic failure. Agency drives escalation: Kael’s choices narrow options (e.g., enduring precognitive flashes to place the fourth rock). Cost is legible in physical strain and emotional exposure (“she had seen this”). Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the aurora intensifies only in response to his actions, maintaining coherent pressure under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—mapping invisible scars—is signaled early and deepens when the unsigned poem reveals shared vision. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he rarefies fury into verse, seals a reply, and renews his vigil. Cost is felt in exile, bodily wounds, and the ever-present threat of censorship; the timer’s countdown imposes tangible pressure that narrows his window for response.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—philosophical schism vs. Imperial Academy—is signaled early and deepens when the hidden overture reframes their duel as recruitment. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he deciphers the code mid-fight, forcing Lang’s recalibration. Cost is unmistakable: shattered glass, yielded pride, and the brook’s “mocking” approval underscores what’s lost (pure rivalry) and gained (alliance). The tightening forecloses endless debate, demanding action—“fence with me now, and question no more”—with stakes charged by persistent constraints (mechanical arm, coded sundial).

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—forging beauty from anarchy—is signaled early and tightens when seeds are discovered, forcing tactical shift from sorting to gardening. Agency is clear: Elias and Mira choose rebuilding despite guards, risking punishment. Cost is legible: exile, frost-threatened sprouts, warden’s rage. Escalation is protagonist-driven, though pressure plateaus after the tin’s discovery rather than intensifying toward a sharper peril.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—defying fate to reunite with Lira—is signaled early and tightens when Elias discovers the film’s hidden map, narrowing his path to the refuge. His agency drives escalation: slowing the film frame rate, using the reel as a prism. Cost is legible in physical peril (nearly swept by tides) and emotional risk (confronting wistful visions). Coincidence complicates (abandoned reel) but doesn’t resolve—the map’s discovery stems from his strategic observation.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving cultural memory—is signaled early and tightens via the monsoon clock and fraying traditions. Elara’s agency drives escalation: planting the seed, entering dreams, interpreting murmurs, and awakening the Guardian. Cost is felt in her exhaustion and unresolved doubt. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure deepens through layered dream imagery rather than causal turns, which is valid—but the lack of a concrete trade-off (e.g., lost tool, time) slightly limits the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—finding the color of unspoken apologies—is signaled early and deepens through ritual action. The meaningful tightening occurs when Elara prunes symbolic limbs, narrowing emotional options from paralysis to release. Cost is legible: tears diffusing into ground, silence transformed into scattered petals. However, escalation relies on lyrical accumulation rather than protagonist-driven pressure; Hiroshi’s instructions dominate agency, making Elara reactive until the final exhale.
