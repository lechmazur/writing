  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (survival and truth) is signaled early via the firebomb. The frost-reading discovery and furnace-building choice constitute one meaningful tightening under the causal lens, forcing the protagonist to commit smuggled charcoal and craft skill to proof-making. Agency is clear: the decision to "make a vessel" rather than "march back with proof" narrows options and charges the final confrontation. The councilman's pale pause and later arrest provide closure, though the arrest itself is told rather than shown, softening the felt cost at the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (translate silence into tactile music and fix the system flaw) is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: Orren's memory-test reveals the forks prevent vibration collapse, enabling the choir effect. Agency is present in his alignment of forks and silent conducting, but the escalation is modest—Mara's problem is posed, Orren solves it in one attempt without visible cost or trade-off. The child's bright vibration is a micro-turn but does not narrow Orren's options; the resolution feels gentle rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: "give rest a permanent address when land forgets names." Pressure tightens through accumulative layers—kelp curtain, clicking receiver, catalog card in Marek's handwriting—culminating in the realization that "the dead are drifting through impossible spaces into the open sea, unnamed and cold." One meaningful escalation: Marek must "brace it with my hands" despite bleeding ears and seam whispers, a visible trade-off between bodily integrity and the task. Agency is clear: he wires the lens, uses his own breath bubbles, and refuses to quit. The resolution is earned by his persistence, not luck. Cost is on the page: hours of physical suffering, the library's acceptance binding him as "the last volume," and the permanent scar of the cracked lens. One micro turn—the catalog card listing him—deepens personal stakes without fracturing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—sustaining anonymous aid under threat of exposure and extortion—is signaled early and tightens through the rumor and officer visit, forcing Amira to change routes and articulate the fund's purpose without revealing donors. The midnight decoy/elder-guided delivery is a causal escalation driven by protagonist agency, and the satchel returning heavier than it left demonstrates visible accumulation of support. The final daylight bell-ring crystallizes the stance (public defiance, collective endurance) with felt cost (ongoing sanctions, future inspections). One deduction: the officer's departure after weighing the bell's "authority of older faiths" reads slightly convenient, lowering the immediacy of threat at that pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—where is unused love stored?—is signaled early and drives the breath-work discovery. The sternum knot and ember-face vision deepen rather than reverse, consistent with the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible: Mara empties pride and blesses the soldier's departure, foreclosing her habit of withholding. However, the pilgrim's intervention supplies the method without Mara encountering prior failure or resistance, so agency tilts toward guidance rather than protagonist struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—discovering time's texture without cutting the bridge—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when the protagonist learns she must "let the photographs finish fading" to free the trapped designer. Agency drives escalation: planting in hyperbolic geometry, carrying the fragment to the maze entrance, guiding it in a circle at the center. The final tightening ("every corridor toward a single impossible point") forecloses the path of preservation, and visible cost appears (photos to dust, woman disintegrates, Lio's voice "suddenly absent"). Coincidence does not resolve; protagonist's geometry and fragment use produce the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (plant resilience) is signaled early and tested once meaningfully when engines arrive. Her response—false key arrangement, piano wedge—narrows militia options and buys time with visible cost (trembling wrist, dragging weight). The escalation is clean under a causal lens: rumor → decoding → discovery → militia → improvised impediment → escape with seeds. No coincidental save; her patience and prep enable the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—catching the sound of trust breaking to understand Jory's death—is signaled early and tightens when Mara agrees to fit Rell with the prototype "because she wanted to stand close when his words finally failed." The prototype's imprinting of collected absences escalates pressure: as Rell speaks, gaps bleed in, the sharp click surfaces, and he confesses. Agency is clear: Mara's choice to implant Jory's brass and replay absences forces the revelation. Visible cost: she records the confession, will report it at dawn, and renounces personal possession by melting the brass—foreclosing her brother's memory as talisman in favor of systemic work.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to keep the stolen portrait and let the subject vanish, or return it and "save" the moment—is signaled early and converges at closure. One meaningful tightening occurs when Lio holds the portrait over the jar and sees the outline of the door, escalating his recognition. However, the stakes remain largely internal and abstract; no live opposition or trade-off tests Lio's commitment before the final beat. The choice to tear the portrait is presented as singular moral calculus ("strange mercy") without prior micro-choices that narrow options or reveal a hierarchy of values, weakening the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (craft safe zones for inquiry vs. shame and silence) signals early and tightens once: the glass-panel construction and bookmark placement are deliberate moves that foreclose the path of continued flight. The piece leans accumulative rather than causal reversals; the tightening occurs when Mara stops narrating and lets the quiet open rather than seal. Cost is visible in her throat tightening and the decision to wait for "the first stranger to enter and ask," a renunciation of performance with on-page consequence. No explicit antagonist, but the prior committee's surveillance and her own verdict create coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is clear: survive Vaughn's erasure and reclaim identity. One meaningful tightening: the cipher resolves into location/time, forcing the confrontation. Agency drives escalation—Mara flees, decrypts, recruits the boy, and confronts Vaughn with evidence. Visible cost: she lets the boy see her tears, accepts vulnerability. However, the crew's immediate turn on Vaughn after hearing the shell dilutes pressure—no negotiation, no risk of disbelief, no tactical struggle. The shell's "recorded confession" feels convenient (Vaughn's own voice stitched from old takes?) without sufficient groundwork; if it were dramatized as fragile or ambiguous, the cost would sharpen.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: map the failing constellations before memory loses its lights. Pressure tightens when Lyr commands the narrator to retell the journey "using only what the ruined gold did not say," forcing a shift from visual to auditory/silence-based navigation. The storm's arrival and the last star's winking out provide situational escalation. However, the narrator's final agency—beginning the map—is more an acceptance than a choice with visible trade-off; the cost (lost booklet, abandoned star-paths) is conceptual rather than a dramatized forfeiture that alters immediate tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—finding the origin of thoughts—is signaled in paragraph two and sustained throughout. Agency is renunciation with visible cost: J-17 stops using the violin to preserve it, foreclosing infinite investigation in favor of what it has already collected. One meaningful tightening occurs when the hairline crack appears ("each return cost the instrument a little of itself"), forcing a trade-off between continued search and mercy. The resolution is protagonist-driven: J-17 chooses to "amalgamate only what mattered" and plays a final sustained note to align variations, then walks on—an Earned Stasis that charges the closure without requiring external confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is legible early: Mara must decide whether to reveal the lens and risk betraying Eli or remain complicit in mounting mistrust. Her choice to decode the tickets (midpoint) narrows options, and her final act—placing the lens on the counter and signing her ledger—forecloses her prior evasion with visible social cost (exposure of her complicity). The tightening is meaningful under the accumulative lens, though the benign resolution (caption system vs. sabotage) softens the stakes retroactively; the friction was more internal than external, which fits the "resonant hush" frame but limits felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Elias wants "something stricter than forgiveness" and asks to prove "gardens know their gardeners." The night ritual deepens pressure by forcing public confession to the roots, and the meter's climb provides a meaningful tightening. Agency is present in the confessional act and in naming each cultivar. However, the resolution feels more like external validation (Mera's screen) than a trade-off with felt cost; the cost is his vulnerability, but the payoff (rising score) arrives too neatly without a visible price paid after the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—preventing rotor failure and glider panic—emerges clearly by midpoint and tightens when Mara sees the vision of the cracked blade. The lever pull initiates escalation, and Mara's roof repair enacts agency with visible cost (choosing a stable past, foreclosing Sen's data-gathering). The conflict between Sen's theoretical ambition and Mara's practical caretaking is legible and resolved through Mara's decisive action. One meaningful pressure point drives the turn, appropriate for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: unravel Varga's code to understand how the ruined house can sing. Pressure accumulates through the program's water-stain maps, each marking a new in-between space, and deepens when the ledger reveals the dispersed-instrument plan. However, the escalation is lateral (moving from mark to mark) rather than tightening options or raising cost; no reversal tests Lena's commitment, and the final gathering occurs off-page ("other displaced musicians came quietly") without dramatized friction or trade-off. Under the Accumulative lens one meaningful deepening is present but cost legibility at closure is weak.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: finding and voicing the weight of the swallowed truth (the false wind report). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: fever-break clarity → Mara's gentle questioning → smudged notebook enabling ambiguity → final confession to Eli. One meaningful deepening: the narrator's realization that the secret's mass is loneliness, not meteorological guilt. Agency is renunciation of false certainty with visible relational cost. Minor gap: Eli's survival in a rock hollow arrives as summary convenience rather than earned complication, slightly softening the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether to expose Mara's hidden truth or let it remain buried—is signaled early and tightens through the tunnel journey. The discovery of the note with Mara's handwriting reweights the confession from witness-failure to active crime, narrowing options. The protagonist's agency at closure (turning the wheel back and calling Mara) forecloses complicity with visible relational cost. One small gap: the ghosts "lean in, waiting" externalizes pressure that would land harder if the protagonist's internal conflict were more visibly torn in that beat.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—witnessing without judgment—is signaled early but generates minimal pressure because the protagonist never faces a choice that would violate that vow. The journey to the refuge and back unfolds without reversal, complication, or visible cost. The other keeper's question ("what I would record here") is deflected rather than deepening conflict. One tightening moment (realizing silence is a workshop for self-remaking) shifts understanding but does not narrow options or foreclose a path with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—reaching Mara through music and shared grief—is signaled early and escalates through the eclipse plan. Liora's choice to show the curl is a genuine risk with relational cost (exposing her own wound to a grieving child). Mara's hum, then whisper, emerge from prior causal pressure rather than convenience. The lack of a clear secondary complication (e.g., mother's hesitation, Mara's fear during darkness) leaves the escalation curve somewhat gentle, but the single tightening is sufficient for this length and the cost is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: to collect and preserve knowledge of the displaced axis before it vanishes. Pressure accumulates through the nested artifacts (diaries, tapestry, shadows) that reveal the library's hidden purpose. The tightening occurs when Lysa realizes no restoration is possible, forcing renunciation with felt cost: she must settle for cataloging rather than repair. Agency is clear—her probing, reading aloud, and pinning the tapestry are deliberate acts that foreclose the path of hoping for axis restoration. The plea "Set the axis back, or at least remember where it went" directly tests her against an impossible demand.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Lian's desire to transpose life and escape passive prophecy—is signaled early and converges with survival pressure when the patrol boat arrives. One meaningful tightening occurs: the searchlights force Lian to push the courier into the cleft and redirect the beam, a protagonist-driven choice with visible cost (exposure risk, abandonment of the coded-cookie channel). The resolution is earned by her decision to burn the fortunes, foreclosing the spycraft path. However, the storm arriving "exactly as her own earlier fortune had promised" introduces a coincidence that complicates but borders on resolving tactical problems (Mara uses it to signal "come tonight" vs. "stay home"), weakening agency slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—stopping the possession before completion—is signaled immediately and sustained through the encounter. Pressure escalates as the parasite fights and the basalt trembles, but the tightening is more textural (looped prayers, accumulated rhetorical moves) than a sharp reversal. Mara's agency in drawing the circle and declaring the unknown a neighbor constitutes the decisive turn, though it arrives somewhat gently. The cost is legible (shivering, the rift's near-unbolt) but muted in scale; the resolution feels more philosophical than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: alleviating chronological homesickness by conducting unheard symphonies. One meaningful tightening: the protagonist writes a new slip for the lake, triggering the alignment of memory map and mirrored horizon. Agency is present—the protagonist chooses to conduct silence—but the escalation reads more as accumulation of mood than narrowing options with visible cost. The final shift ("no longer afraid of time") is asserted rather than dramatized as a trade-off, and no live option is foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—conquering the labyrinth of self by facing avoided versions—is signaled early and tightens when the tablet teaches that fear produces the widest branching. Lysa's testing of the maze (stepping left then right, watching timelines collapse) is on-page agency that narrows options. The final choice to stay in one timeline rather than float away forecloses the evasion pattern with visible cost (she rises heavier). One meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: defeating the filament of hush that feeds on unattended sorrow and causes emotional numbness. The stake is signaled early (Mara's "blank stare," Kerrin's muted drums) and tightens when Mara realizes the filament is "a parasite of feeling." The backward-phonograph sequence is protagonist-driven and narrows options—"she could not simply break the phonograph, because the cavern would spin new silence from the shards"—forcing the scored-record tactic. The Listener's appearance and the filament's snap constitute one meaningful reversal that forecloses the parasitic cycle. Cost is legible (Kerrin's fierce hope, the Listener's retreat, Mara's pocketed needle as a material remnant), though the victory could land with sharper relational or occupational consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: protect integrity and avoid detention/false-report conscription. The warning message tightens options; the protagonist chooses lateral progress over direct bureau confrontation, a decision with clear trade-off (slower, riskier route). The warehouse discovery escalates stakes (fever-culture dumping, emergency-power plot), and the notebook-copying/pigeon-release choice forecloses the hero's-spectacle path with visible cost (reliance on airborne data, no guarantee of safety). The escape completes the pressure arc. No convenience: each turn flows from prior causality and protagonist agency under the inferred causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: discover time's texture without quickening the beings' feeding or losing one's own memories. The impossible-choice framing is signaled early and tested at the grotto when the beings demand a final exchange. One meaningful tightening occurs: "cut the rope and free them…or keep it whole and trap them." The narrator's third option (slipknot tied to the verse) narrows tactics and forecloses the binary, introducing a constraint that recurs when drivers later must recite the verse. Cost is conceptual and restrained—ongoing drift rather than decisive forfeiture—which fits the Accumulative lens but stays at the threshold of higher bands. Agency is present but the protagonist's restraint (keeping the knot closed, staying outside) reads more as endurance than transformative choice.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—unbinding the chronic hush to find beauty in the unfinished world—is signaled early and coheres under the Accumulative lens. Pressure tightens when Mara hears "resistance, like twine around her wrist" and must change pitch, a tactical choice driven by her agency. The cost is visible: she forgoes restoration ("not to restore the old world") and accepts incompleteness. The music hall's final night adds urgency. No antagonist needed; the hush itself applies coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake is clear early: Mira must decide whether to sell absolution or honesty as Orin's transformation completes. The appraisal tightens when static reveals the unspoken sentence—"he had pushed his brother away"—narrowing her options from bright counterfeit to bitter courage. The choice forecloses the easier path (manufactured comfort) with visible cost: she gives him guilt alongside courage, takes payment as a boundary, and writes the brother's name to resist her own half-truths. One meaningful deepening driven by protagonist agency; the cost is legible in the final lines.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—uplifting silent contributors—is signaled early and sustained through Mara's proposal and the subsequent envelope chain. One tightening occurs when Mara moves from private impulse (carrying the envelope) to public structure (the reading series), but the escalation is purely additive: no option is foreclosed, no cost dramatized. Eli agrees "on one condition" that feels ornamental rather than a genuine trade-off, and the final image of the janitor's letter arriving "by accident" again reads as serendipity rather than protagonist-driven pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: grafting onto community. The search for the tag provides coherent pressure; the pivot at the arbor (tag = invitation, not signature) narrows options and reweights the task. Sava's agency is clear in offering the search, weaving the arbor, and asking to be named, with the final act foreclosing retreat. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the artist "had been building a new kind of orchard" and commits her craft. Cost is legible but muted—she risks refusal and binds herself permanently—though the price is conceptual (social exposure) rather than viscerally felt. No antagonist; coincidence complicates (arbor discovery) but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—reaching the Echo-Forge and uncaging it—is signaled early and tightens when Orren explains she needs borrowed time the nap won't give. One meaningful escalation: Rin steals seconds from condensation and her own breath-pauses, accumulating heat in the pendant, then uses the borrowed time to stretch the moment and break the cadence lock. The final image shows her ferrying the freed echo while counting repayment, making cost legible on the page. Agency is present in her choice to break the pattern rather than close it, though the tactical sequence (borrow, descend, tap, break) proceeds without setback or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (finding/reaching Orren within ambiguous loss) is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure tightens when the sequence reaches thirteen and the seam opens; Lysa's choice not to run but to "demand proof" and adjust the glass eyes introduces a meaningful trade-off between impulse and discipline. The final tightening occurs when she turns the ladder into a spellwork bridge, an act of agency that transforms grief into structure; Orren's refusal to cross and her acceptance of "reachable, though not retrievable" forecloses retrieval with visible emotional cost. One credible deepening that narrows options under the Accumulative lens suffices here.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—Lio's desire to be visible to those who need him—is signaled early and tightens when he finds the tape fragment and leaves the note. The child's arrival and palm-press provide one meaningful deepening that reconfigures Lio's stance. However, escalation is conceptual rather than pressure-driven: no live opposition tests Lio's choices, no cost narrows his options mid-scene. The agency is mostly attentional and preparatory; the final act (pressing the fragment to his own cheek) is a private realization rather than a decision that forecloses a path with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (Mara's boundary between observer and subject) is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful escalation: the metamorphosis forces her to choose between resisting (lists, scrubbing) and yielding (letting vines choose their path). The trellis reconstruction becomes the on-page test where agency (releasing control) forecloses her prior method with visible cost ("felt like failure"). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; the plants' steadier growth proves the stakes. Minor: the university mailing at the end feels like a light add-on rather than a charged final move, though the pressed leaf carries thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—finding meaning and something paintable beyond ruins—is signaled early and tightens when the narrator discovers the second brooch and map, then deepens when the convergence device reveals the sister's face. Agency is clear: the narrator chooses to exchange one brooch with Mara, foreclosing the option of keeping both pieces for personal use. The price is visible and felt—the narrator gives Mara access to her own lost child, accepting shared grief over sole possession. One meaningful pressure point: the metal ring's activation shows what the narrator seeks, raising the cost of letting go. Minor slip: the escalation from search to exchange could be sharper; the convergence device's mechanics arrive late and resolve quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (Sera's wish to notice everyday magic) is signaled early, and a secondary thread (Lan's unreliable gift) braids alongside. The inhabitation by the unseen force creates a meaningful tightening, but escalation relies on sudden rule introduction (the force wants to be noticed) rather than prior causality. The resolution—singing of mundane acts—feels thematically apt but lacks visible cost; the force exits "without violence," and the final image restores equilibrium without foreclosing a path or altering tactics. One meaningful deepening occurs when the pearl's light shifts to Lan, but the peak choice (to sing) is executed off-pressure rather than under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—compiling fragments so the town can exhale a future—is signaled early and tightens through Mara's method: spacing intervals to let memory thaw, copying even missing page numbers, assembling townsfolk across three evenings to cool anger. One meaningful escalation occurs when Sorrel's confession (Ilven secretly removed the valve) reconfigures Mara's chart: the council relied on sound for obedience, and Ilven drew a corridor of silence. The valve restoration and trumpet's first note constitute the closure turn. Deduction for the summarized three-evening assembly and the townspeople's responses (some thanked, some slammed shutters) that remain abstract rather than viscerally tested on the page; the peak choice feels more methodical than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—proving the Midnight Line exists and confronting unspoken truths—is signaled early and tightens through the punch's test and the train's arrival. The ticket-punch confession ("I kept drinking because silence felt safer") narrows options and the conductor's gate ("no returns, unless you arrive honest") raises cost. However, boarding the train and stepping onto the platform feel like acceptance rather than a trade-off with visible forfeit; the price is implied but not dramatized in a specific loss.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: whether shared transcription can hold grief without swallowing it. Escalation proceeds through Mara's agreement to sit with Jory, then inviting Leena, each choice narrowing her skepticism and opening her to "other lives spilling through." The blank space that forms in the star chart is a meaningful tightening that forecloses easy answers with visible cost. The whale-interval alignment feels coincidental rather than protagonist-driven, softening the final turn slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—discovering what happens after goodbye—is signaled early and coheres under the Causal lens. One meaningful tightening: the corridors' mutiny forces Ilias to choose, and his decision to hold the fragment aloft and step through narrows all options. The cost is legible: his immortality peels away on the page. Agency is protagonist-driven; Maris's backstory and the storm complicate but do not solve. The trade-off between eternal safety and honest goodbye forecloses the immortal path with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: Sami's asylum versus deportation, braided with Mara's search for fair trade. Pressure tightens when agents arrive, and Mara's gambit—showing the margins, sliding the toe tag—narrows Ivo's con and opens a path for truth. The agent's face "tightened, then softened" is a micro turn; questions shift from traps to openings. Cost is visible: Ivo's con collapses, the breach between father and daughter opens. One escalation point is sufficient at this length; the stakes remain coherent under causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: collect time-textures before they fade. Pressure deepens once—from thin indoor hum to rougher outdoor grains—and the tightening is a meaningful escalation under the Accumulative lens: the combined rhythm refracts more fiercely, Haru invents broader histories (war years, romances), and the split oak becomes the site where silence shifts from loss to scored pause. Agency manifests as attention and method that foreclosed naive hope (no prediction, only cataloged sensation). The cost is conceptual and legible: the town may stay mute, yet he can "still name their time." One deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: recovering erased identity (self and collective). The piece tightens once with visible cost: discovering Container 9H proves erasure was systemic, shifting the goal from personal restoration to archival witness, and the final act—redistributing folders, whispering names—forecloses legal resurrection in favor of nameless stewardship. Agency is renunciation with on-page cost: "I did not claim them as mine, yet…my own erased history gained a grain." The tidal timeframe and Container 9H's inaccessibility create pressure, though the lack of an active antagonist or competing danger keeps escalation more textural than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.1)
    One dominant stake—decode the universal riddle—signals early and sustains pressure. The compass pointing toward the wooden case and the subsequent hum-and-retell sequence form a single meaningful tightening, but no live option is foreclosed; Eli completes the experiment without visible trade-off. The story deepens understanding without escalating cost, leaving escalation coherent but consequence light.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving Cadenza's autonomy against privatization—is signaled early and tightens when the security launch arrives, forcing Ira to act. One meaningful escalation occurs: her graffiti warnings graduate to real-time reorganization under engine-threat. Agency is clear in her choice to flash the stone chip and guide the raft moves, but the Vell confrontation undercuts protagonist-driven resolution; his sudden agreement feels coincidental rather than earned by Ira's prior pressure. The cost at closure is conceptual (exhaustion, the mural's cracked-heart image) but lacks a visible forfeiture—no loss of berth, paycheck, or relationship is dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (photographing the last dark sky before tracking lights) is signaled early and tightens through the chemical clock beats and the approaching dawn. The timed messages force micro-choices ("OPEN SHUTTER," "WAIT FOR HUSH") that narrow options under accumulative pressure. One meaningful deepening occurs when the wind drops and the summit holds its breath—a crystallized moment where the cost (the end of the old constellations, Eli's future as watchman of "nothing beautiful") becomes undeniable. The final act (opening the shutter one last time, tucking the grain beside the negative) is driven by Mara's agency and forecloses the path of pure detachment. Escalation is driven by accumulative density and cadence shift rather than causal reversals, consistent with the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake (repair the drone before the Meridian departs) is signaled early and tightens through the harbor horn booms and Sera's arrival "boots dripping." Lio's agency is clear—he diagnoses, patches, calibrates—and the cost is implicit in the timeframe and Sera's trust. The piece offers one meaningful tightening (the two-hour window, the ship beginning to drift) rather than multiple reversals, which fits the length. The final turn is Sera's acceptance of Lio's method and her choice to navigate by sound, but the cost remains atmospheric (fog, risk) rather than a visible forfeiture or trade-off on the page that would push this into the 8.5+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—finding the river origin to solve the blank-space error—is signaled early and deepens when the vellum says "Converge." Pressure tightens through the window-tracing epiphany and culminates at the spring where three rivers split from one source. The cost is legible (Ministry will "kill to own" this knowledge; Riven must "deliver them to people who think maps are weapons") but remains slightly abstract rather than viscerally tested in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—prove the district alive to prevent abandonment—is signaled early and tightens when the decree carrier arrives. Pressure accumulates through each corrected cadence (shutters, lintel, bell ringing untouched), but escalation is additive rather than forecloses options. Sava's agency is present (he walks, tunes, recruits), yet the final solution—collective footsteps make the carrier fold his paper—arrives without visible cost or hard choice. The carrier's reversal is told ("proven itself alive") rather than dramatized as a difficult calculus, reducing the felt price of success.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is legible early: send the distress signal before air runs out. The wire-knot discovery tightens pressure (beacon sealed in silence), and the relief's mouth opening narrows options to a gambit with the perfume vial. Two override-instinct moments escalate agency with visible cost (time bleeding away, memories exposed). The mirror-touch resolution is earned by her prior choice to share rather than steal, and the cost is felt: gauge at last bars, personal memories poured out, and the hush—her potential treasure—now ordinary water. The phrase "sensed answering thoughts like distant bells" delivers closure participation with undeniable pressure. One reversal (lock tightens when pulled) and one deepening (perfume drop transforms darkness) are sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—finishing the story his father began—is signaled early and drives all choices. Pressure accumulates through the Accumulative/Textural lens: discovering the corridor sounds through the lattice, learning to hover, following the scuffs, hearing Morrow's voice, finding the bodies, and finally leaving evidence for searchers. The choice to whisper his father's warning into the lattice rather than announce the discovery represents a meaningful tightening with visible cost: he forecloses the path of vindication to preserve "hush" and accept being called a liar. The final image—waiting for the shout, knowing the hush will belong to the dead—charges the resolution with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—awaken the orchard to fulfill the debt and save the valley—is signaled early and tightens when the bride reveals "you owe me" and explains completion requires her death-frequency. Escalation is clean: bead pulses → trees tremble → bride returns with demand → Eli builds resonator → final act of matching heartbeat. The cost is visible: Eli must give up the bead (his only keepsake) and risk his pulse to unlock the orchard. However, the choice itself is not dramatized as a difficult trade-off; Eli moves straight to building the resonator without on-page hesitation or competing desire, which mutes the pressure at the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—transforming the labyrinth from forbidden ruin to passable covenant place—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through rockfalls, vanished lovers, and smuggler misuse, but no on-page reversal tightens options; the smuggler's "soft apology" and children's safe passage arrive without dramatized cost or a visible trade-off. Escalation reads as texture rather than causal narrowing, fitting an Accumulative lens, yet the lack of a felt price at closure limits the score.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—restoring faith through work—is signaled early and tightens when the tremor interrupts, forcing Liora's admission that "faith had been depending on arrival." The notebook discovery deepens the stake by reframing interrupted journeys as legitimate paths. Agency is decision and endurance: she rebuilds after collapse, reads aloud to Sava, carves the new gnomon, and chooses to stay. Cost is visible: she forecloses departure and accepts local, incremental restoration over distant pilgrimage. One meaningful tightening (tremor/admission) plus a deepening (notebook) satisfy the length requirement under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—providing a clean pseudonym under the threat of margin-surveillance—is signaled early and tightens when ghost-notes reveal "DO NOT TRUST THE ARCHIVE." The courier's trembling fingers and the stacked intercepted skins escalate pressure, but the resolution (setting a trap via chalk codes) narrows options more through ingenuity than through a forced trade-off with visible personal cost. One meaningful tightening is present; agency is clear but the price feels procedural rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: expose the coup conspiracy before it hardens. One meaningful tightening occurs when the Guard lieutenant enters, forcing Liora to deflect via misdirection (orrery nudge). That move is clever but the on-page cost is minimal—he leaves "puzzled and laughing," she succeeds without visible forfeiture. The escalation reads more as puzzle-solving than forced trade-off. Under the Causal lens, the sequence tightens logically but the final act (sealing and sending the chart) is recounted rather than dramatized with immediate bodily or social price, leaving the cost conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—finding "the moment before deciding" to rehearse an unsent apology—is signaled in the opening and tightens across three beats: reaching the stilt house, tearing the first letter (spirit warning "DO NOT CHOOSE YET"), and the three-night vigil that earns the brother's arrival. Mara's agency drives each step (carrying the shard, evoking the courthouse scene, staying until she can speak), and the cost is legible: she renounces the fictional safety of sealed letters for live vulnerability. One escalation note: the spirits' warning and the subsequent vigil deepen pressure accumulative-textural rather than narrowing options causally, consistent with the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (prevent ambush/mourning miscommunication) is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful reversal: the map-time note that could mean "funeral" or "meeting." Lani's agency (translation, radio calls) forecloses the revenge march with visible cost (captain's command, villagers' vigil). Escalation is driven by protagonist decision under the Accumulative lens; the false-friend homonym and smeared ink deepen pressure. Cost is legible in the standdown and candlelit vigil, though the final beat slightly summarizes resolution rather than dramatizing the captain's or liaison's micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—rediscovering lost joy—is signaled early and deepens through the discovery that the saint is a teacher and the projection of children at play. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mara presses the fragment into the recess and threads the film, unlocking the light-painting sequence. However, the escalation operates primarily through discovery and accumulation rather than narrowing options; no live choice between competing goods or unavoidable harms appears on the page. The resolution (sharing the method, inviting others) is conceptually coherent but lacks an on-page trade-off or visible price that would elevate pressure into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether to cling to certainty or trust curiosity—is signaled early and tightens through the nested loops: each awakening tests Mara's willingness to let answers dissolve. Her agency crystallizes in the renunciation of mid-stroke certainty (stopping to listen) and the final reply, which forecloses the path of declarative knowing. The cost is felt as vulnerability: saying "I do not know yet" leaves her exposed to Tomas's judgment. One meaningful deepening (the realization that "the wall was not resisting; it was testing") narrows her tactics and charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving private thought against taxation—is signaled early and coheres through escalation. One meaningful tightening: the Bureau's raid forces the protagonist to lead auditors into a prepared trap (butterfly spiral) while the network activates. Agency is embodied in the narrator's choice to host the club and execute the decoy tactic. Cost is legible in the ongoing evasion and the collective risk now crystallized. The resolution is earned by prior setup (humidity as defense, patterns as code) and the protagonist's micro-choices under pressure, though the lack of a second reversal or deeper internal trade-off keeps this from the high 8s.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake signaled early: renew the armistice before war returns. The drought-lean sea and blackening lilies raise urgency; Mara's solo descent into the Heart-Cistern tightens options (only she can deliver the message). The postcard's sacrifice—tearing and sinking it—is a visible cost that narrows tactics and triggers the lilies' revival. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through myth-layering and culminates in the sing-and-sink ritual that transforms the captains' grandchildren from anger to listening. One meaningful escalation; the final image of blossoms opening and anger softening forecloses the path to war with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving forgotten names—is signaled in the opening paragraph and coheres throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when the protagonist identifies the cracked tube, realizes repair requires the museum wing, and crosses into the Hall of Apologies where "old words tried to return," forcing a micro-choice to steady and continue. The final act (replacing the tube, lighting orchids, writing names) is driven by protagonist agency, and the cost—ongoing solitude, "Until then I would keep my rounds"—is legible. The journey involves problem-solving rather than high-stakes reversal, and no live option is foreclosed; the caretaker simply completes the intended repair and returns to routine with a tonal shift from regret to gratitude.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (restore trust before the team scatters) is signaled early and tightens when the ritual begins. One meaningful turn: the codex reveals it does not erase names but "erases spaces between promises," reweighting the threat from annihilation to coercion and offering a path to repair. Mara's agency (send notes, perform ritual, confess) drives escalation under the causal lens. The cost is legible: her reputation for caution is risked, Ilyon's counter-confession exposes mutual poisoning, and the final pledge commits them to speak when silence tempts—foreclosing the old pattern with visible relational price.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—harmonize conflicting factions without betrayal—is signaled in paragraph three and sustained throughout. The pulse-gate discovery narrows options by offering a technical solution that honors both sides, and Mara's public explanation forces her to risk faction anger. Rolen's confession escalates by exposing the encrypted compassion, raising relational and political cost. The accord signing forecloses the rigid-seal path with visible cost: Mara's trembling and Rolen's shaking voice make the emotional and social price legible on the page. One clear tightening (decoded settings) drives the resolution under a causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—whom to trust with the songs/network—is signaled early and tightens when Oren's chip and Merek's ledger receipt force Mara to weigh betrayal risk against preservation duty. The midnight skylight scene narrows her options (send or withhold), and her final choice to trust both men forecloses the safer path of isolation. Cost is present but slightly diffuse: the phrase "feeling a small bloom" and "trusting" are more emotional summary than dramatized consequence. One additional visible price (a named rooftop contact, a concrete network node exposed) would sharpen the stakes' on-page weight.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is clearly Mira's quest to understand her father's "necessary distances" and why thresholds feel sacred. The weather code discovery, the timed corridor, and the final crossing provide one meaningful tightening (the seven-minute window). However, the escalation is more accumulative than urgent—Mira's agency is mostly interpretive (reading grain, waiting, counting breaths) rather than a choice that forecloses a competing path with visible friction. The crossing itself is described as silent and smooth ("her landing was silent"), which softens the cost. Pressure coheres but does not sharply narrow options under causal tension.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—Mira's search for "the rhythm of belonging"—is signaled early and tightens when Jonah's loneliness intersects her mission. The terrarium clamps and firefly release form one meaningful on-page turn that narrows Jonah's isolation and reweights Mira's solitary practice into shared witnessing. The sunrise deadline creates temporal pressure, and the final walk forecloses Mira's prior stance ("you do not find a constellation alone") with felt relational cost. One clean deepening under the Accumulative lens suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering why paths vanish—is signaled early and tightens when the narrator finds Mira and the emotional gap on the shard. Mira's apology is an on-page reversal that narrows options (no more evasion) and restores the ridge with visible cost (public confession of shame). The escalation is modest but coherent under the Accumulative lens: the seeds guide, the glass diagnoses, the pool receives, and the trail returns. No secondary pressure or antagonist appears, which is acceptable at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—proving orchestrated serendipity can transform monotony into meaningful intervention—escalates cleanly when the boy's entrapment tests whether Milo's calculated system can handle real crisis. Agency is consistent: his choice to follow wet footprints and improvise the bishop-wedge solution alters tactics under time pressure with visible cost (abandoning his planned escape act). The night watch's skepticism provides secondary pressure. One meaningful tightening occurs when the door won't open and water rises, forcing Milo to repurpose his symbolic tool into literal救援 implement. Cost is legible: he converts performance into救援, reweighting his entire evening's purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: preserving nostalgia by inscribing it on the body so censors cannot erase it without drawing blood. The keeper's bargain—give up the speck or stay anchored and learn—tightens options in scene, and Mira's choice to keep it narrows her path. The anchoring shifts from restraint to fulcrum, enabling the tattoo that forecloses return to passive exile. Cost is legible: her body becomes the page, and she commits to a fugitive network. One visible trade-off dilutes high-band entry: the anchoring releases too easily once the lesson concludes, softening the price paid for transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether the atrium will be demolished or spared—is signaled early via the council notice. Ilya's agency (choosing plain glass, demonstrating ripple patterns, translating the checklist into human stories) drives the tightening, and the inspector's torn notice provides on-page cost that forecloses the marina path. However, the escalation is thin: Ilya faces no real opposition from the inspector, who listens and capitulates after one metaphor. The lack of friction or complication before the reversal keeps the pressure from fully accumulating. One meaningful deepening occurs (the ripple-stillness vs. ripple-meeting contrast reweights efficiency vs. care), but the ease of persuasion undercuts the stakes' felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—Mara's moral debt and Jonah's paralysis—is signaled early. Escalation occurs when Mara narrates the Eli bargain, which shifts Jonah's fear into resolve, but this turn is conveyed through monologue rather than contested action. The cost (Mara's lost sleep, Eli's lost responsibility) is conceptually clear but not paid on the page; we see intent to confess, not consequence. No on-page reversal forces a trade-off; coincidence (Jonah waiting) enables the teaching moment without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled immediately: Mina seeks equations for hope before "despair turned habitual" in a politely collapsing town. Pressure escalates through three balloon launches, each yielding new data (flashing mirrors, sideways units, ensemble proof, stable updraft), and the protagonist's agency drives every turn—she revises formulas, encodes patterns, climbs to town, and co-creates the canopy. The final basket ascent forecloses her solitary grotto work and commits the community to shared risk, with visible cost: "she did not know which world would be saved." One minor slip: the town's gathering feels slightly convenient (drawn by rumors), though Mina's demonstration with gauge and pages earns their shift from "polite collapse" to action.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether to restore or protect the wall archive—is signaled early through Liora's dual motivation (Restoration Office commission vs. personal curiosity) and tightens when the drones arrive and she realizes the tourist-installation threat. The diary and film strip discoveries escalate pressure by revealing Arlen's encoded intention and her mother's voice, narrowing her options to public exposure or protective deception. The final choice to submit a false map and play one chord forecloses the public path with visible cost (professional dishonesty, solitary burden), though the escalation could gain sharpness if the drones' pressure or the council's prior refusal created one more on-page complication that forced an immediate tactical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: return the borrowed heartbeat with "a truth worth keeping" or it stops when bells ring; secondary is saving the sister. The mirror-vision sequence tightens options to a binary (keep heartbeat/sister lives a day but boy dies, or return it/boy lives and surgeons gain steadier hands). One meaningful reversal: the protagonist enters believing she needs a future where her sister survives, but the painter's mirror reveals the moral cost of that choice, forcing renunciation. The final act is protagonist-driven (pressing palm to mirror, letting the heartbeat go) with visible cost. However, the "guided the surgeons with steadier hands" clause introduces ambiguity—does the sister still survive via an alternate causal path?—which softens the price and pulls the escalation slightly toward convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: achieve a treaty that binds through ritual sacrifice, not paper alone. One meaningful tightening: Maro and Odran hesitate, then surrender directive and medal, narrowing their exits and forcing public vows. Agency is Sera's design of the ritual and her own map-burning, which forecloses redemption-as-absolution and commits her to daily labor. The ritual "cornered them into arguing details instead of denying the humanity"—a clear tactic shift with visible cost (lost orders, lost medals, voiced vows). No explicit antagonist; pressure is the Forever War inertia and mutual distrust, coherent under the Situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (atoning for extinction she caused) is signaled early and tightens through escalation: she follows the fissures, finds the convergence, kneels at the stake, presses the egg to her ear—then the wafer cracks. The reversal (silent hiss instead of chorus) forces the climactic choice to shatter the egg, a renunciation with visible cost that forecloses any mechanical redemption. Her agency drives every beat, and the final act is hers alone. The drought's engineering and the petrels' island both feed the pressure with specific prior harm.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—freeing her sister and the city from coerced vows—is signaled early and tightens when Maris hears her sister's pledge while unlocking the seal. One on-page reversal: the governor expects the prism to sing his authority, it stays mute, and Maris gains control. Agency is clear: she brushed the lock earlier, untangles threads, speaks the invitation. The scattering of echoes forecloses the governor'sScript-based power with visible cost (his hollow phrases, the city's fracture). Pressure coheres under the Causal-Situational lens and the resolution is earned by her prior preparation and present action.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—can Ilya reconcile artistic freedom with consent—is signaled in the opening accusation and tested through the reversed puppet narrative, which makes harm visible by inverting causality. Pressure escalates when the audience's laughter turns to "quiet that felt like the radar dome," then again when Mara appears and her veto demand forces a concrete trade-off. The napkin contract forecloses his former method with visible cost (shared proceeds, subject veto). Agency drives each turn: his choice to reverse the alphabet, to start the thief story at the gallows, to offer Mara the stick as microphone. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake (guiding the last monarchs with reliable signals) is clear from the opening and tightens through discovery of the failed 1952 beacon and its stuttering cadence. The gust that breaks the frame is a meaningful complication; Arin's addition of the clacking reeds is a visible tactic shift that narrows options (he commits to sound plus color). The monarchs' arrival and alignment demonstrate on-page success with cost: he must dismantle everything afterward, honoring transience. One deepening, one escalation, visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving forgotten names and mending the memorial chime error—is signaled in the opening paragraph and tightens through the rope-reconfiguration sequence. Agency is technical: the protagonist chooses to align knot to gap, pricks wax, pours bronze. The escalation is driven by craft precision under the inferred Accumulative lens: each step narrows the method and raises the stakes (if the pattern fails, the names remain lost). Cost is visible in the labor, the public commitment, and the protagonist's acceptance that forgiveness is "learning the exact way to mend it." No major reversals or sharp turns, but the deepening through tactile craft detail and the final forfeiture of silence is sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: discovering why paths choose walkers, evolving into proving oneself worthy of being chosen. One meaningful tightening occurs when the blood-print ritual grants the final directive ("WALK UNTIL THE WALKING WALKS YOU"), narrowing the protagonist's options to acceptance or refusal. The storm functions as temporal pressure. However, escalation relies more on dream logic and symbolic gestures than protagonist agency with visible tradeoffs. The ash woman's questions and the bunker's prompts guide rather than oppose, reducing friction. Cost is present but oblique: leaving completes the bunker's purpose and commits the protagonist to an open-ended walking.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—seal the covenant by offering what he most conserves—is signaled midway and drives the climax, but early escalation reads passive (accepting, waiting, recording) with the tile supplying most causality rather than protagonist agency shaping each turn. The stylus sacrifice is a genuine on-page cost that forecloses certainty, and the final image (constellations on his palms) reweights options, qualifying as meaningful deepening under the accumulative lens. One tightening choice is sufficient at this length, but the peak decision arrives late with minimal friction dramatized beforehand, keeping the score in mid-7s rather than 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake (release resentment) is signaled early and pursued through Lio's scheme. Escalation: Mara's weapon audit → night when city shifts hardest → glass walls and panic → Lio's gambit with the box. One meaningful tightening when Mara's soldiers crowd and resentment thickens into certainty. The knife drop forecloses a path with visible cost (her role as threat-keeper). Agency is Lio's decision to open the box and Mara's choice to stop reaching for the knife. Minor: coincidence allows the pin to reappear "at the instant it was required," which complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake signaled early: capture the runaway dream that "slips from him" each night. One meaningful tightening: the sextant measurement fails because "the dream had learned to flee," forcing Lio to shift tactics from trapping to inviting. The breath-holding at the climax and the mirror's stillness deliver visible cost (he anchors the moment "with all his grounded will"). The dream's evasion and Lio's tactical pivot cohere under the Accumulative lens, but the escalation reads more as patient accumulation than urgent narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—Mira's tension between contract-bound ethics and direct care—is signaled early and tightens when the boy demands help. One meaningful reversal (boy's challenge, "vows were for adults and adults broke them first") forces Mira to act with improvised tools. The repair and ribbon-return narrow her future path (she vows to keep repairing illegally), but the cost is declared rather than dramatized: no guild consequence, client reaction, or tangible forfeiture appears on the page. Escalation is coherent under the Situational lens but lacks a visible price that would enter the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to carve the cameo and steer timelines—is signaled early and accumulates detail. Yet escalation under the Accumulative lens requires a meaningful tightening or reweighting that narrows options; here, Mara discovers facts (tags dated next year, the cameo already carved) without her agency driving the pressure. The final moment ("she had already carved the face, in a future that had inherited her curiosity") is a realization of fait accompli rather than a choice under duress. No on-page reversal or deepening driven by protagonist decision with visible cost; coincidence (the cameo's disappearance and reappearance) complicates but does not test commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—finding the library of unlearned lessons to enable future rescues—is signaled early and sustained. Lysa's twin renegotiations (clerk, curator) create local reversals that advance the goal. However, pressure does not meaningfully tighten: both negotiations succeed on first attempt without forcing a trade-off or narrowing options. The curator's demand to return captives is resolved by recitation of its origin story, not a choice with visible cost. The piece operates under a Causal lens but escalation is lateral (deeper exploration) rather than intensifying through protagonist sacrifice or error.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: recapture Lio by following narrative threads and weaving a net strong enough to hold him. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mara realizes the garden is "not a place to reach but a plot to keep telling" and that she must trade certainty. The protagonist's kneeling narration of every rescue causes the fog to thin and the hatch to open, linking her agency to escalation. However, the final act—pinning fabric and speaking the line—resolves without visible friction or cost on the page; the ship "finally chose a direction" but what Mara loses or forfeits remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—restoring the erased treaty to correct institutional harm—is signaled early and shapes every beat. The progression tightens meaningfully: seal discovered, rope puzzle solved, diplomat encountered, text revealed, public filing scheduled. Mara's agency drives each turn, and the final act forecloses the path of continued erasure with visible cost (institutional reckoning). The "merge" concept operates both literally (braiding the seal into the rope) and thematically (merging river and scholarship categories), creating layered escalation. One reversal (the door opening to a gap archive rather than a hallway) deepens rather than deflects pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—finding quiet in the storm to protect people and restore the caves—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates as Sava follows the tremor downstream, discovers the Forge, and deploys the echo chamber stone to slow the energy beings. The climactic conjuring represents one meaningful tightening where her intervention redirects the beings' hunger, altering the tactical landscape. However, no live option is visibly foreclosed; the resolution reads as competent problem-solving without agonized trade-off or visible sacrifice that would charge the final image more intensely.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—proving coincidences have meaning—is signaled in paragraph two and drives all choices: touching the prism to see sabotage, retrieving the shard, tracking stars nightly, assembling the apparatus. One meaningful tightening occurs on night seven when star corridor and cold shard converge, forcing the custodian to trust the pattern and fit pieces "like petals around a seed." The answering flash and caravan arrival validate the work with visible cost (solitary weeks, physical risk, emotional vulnerability in "knees shook with thistle-blown hope").

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preventing the Archive's collapse and the erasure of collective lineage—is signaled early and tightens as the storm rises. One meaningful deepening occurs when the archivist moves from passive retrieval to active contribution, narrowing options to a "risky conjecture" with clear cost (potential loss of self). The final act reweights the fog from threat to stabilized architecture through the protagonist's choice. However, the escalation path is somewhat diffuse; the middle beats (pillar to pillar) accumulate texture more than they narrow tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.0)
    One dominant stake (opening the gate to relieve famine vs. fortress pride) is signaled early and tightens when Jorin reads the hidden note. The fireworks sequence escalates by redirecting attention from sky to wall to river passage, narrowing the council's options. Agency rests with Jorin's tactical reframing (serious playfulness as political lever). However, the climactic gate-clearing occurs off-page via Mirel's order rather than Jorin's on-page choice under duress, and the "not a mob, because the fireworks had turned the night into a stage with rules" reads as assertion rather than dramatized consequence with visible friction.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is Mara's autonomy over her records versus the council's harbor claim, signaled early through Iven's demand. One meaningful tightening: Mara foresees Iven's failure at council and her own obsolescence, then proposes relocation instead of confrontation—narrowing her options from hidden defiance to shared adaptation with visible cost (trust deferred, copies unspoken). The council pressure operates off-page, slightly limiting immediacy, but Iven's presence and Mara's internal stakes cohere. Agency is renunciation with on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (overcoming claustrophobia to collect the strongest silence) is signaled early and tightens when the rope web hangs the body free, forcing the three-breath method under maximum pressure. The choice to pursue gilded hush despite panic narrows options (must cross void or abandon the lesson) and the cost is visible: "my lungs finally filled without scraping." Agency is clear—the child decides to follow the method and reach for the scorched vines—and the escalation is driven by protagonist action under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: teaching silence to comfort Mara through the crossing. One meaningful tightening when the storm glass clumps and Elias slows the car to prevent cable singing, then instructs Mara to count pauses—agency that narrows her panic into method. The final cost is Mara's acceptance of quiet with her pulse audible, forgoing the distraction she had chased. No antagonist required; wind pressure and Mara's grief cohere. Elias's brake-lever vigilance and roof-tap are tactical choices under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake is signaled early: find the stairway before sunrise. The clock is present ("until sunrise," "dawn pressed pale light") but never tightens a decision or creates a close call. Ione encounters obstacles (waterfall, gate disguise) that she solves via tools (badge, ruby flake) without trade-offs or cost. The throne's question ("name your lineage") could be a pressure point, but her answer is immediate and uncomplicated—no want vs. fear friction, no visible price for renunciation. The escalation reads as spatial accumulation (deeper into the mystery) rather than narrowing options or raising stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—maintaining the sanctuary's threshold against encroaching grief—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when Lio's panic threatens to flood it. One meaningful escalation: Mara must extend her private method (tracing scars) to another person, a renunciation of total isolation with visible cost ("accepting that some contact must be cut so that others can breathe"). The doorknocker strike and Lio's exhale mark the turn; the resolution is earned by Mara's agency (opening the door, guiding his hands) under the Accumulative lens. The cost is felt: she remains alone at dawn but no longer calls the emptiness poison, a Charged Poise moment. No luck solves; coincidence (Lio's shadow-crossing) complicates but Mara's ritual choice resolves. Pressure coheres and deepens once, sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (pay Old Sen's debt in diamonds) is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mara rejects the pyramid-scheme shortcut and volunteers her own memory, narrowing options. The drum's pressure-into-diamonds mechanism provides a clear escalation path, but the neighbors' participation arrives without on-page resistance or tradeoff—no one hesitates, pays a visible price, or risks exposure. Cost at closure is conceptual (uncertain future) rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (find proof to justify abdication) is signaled early and escalates through one major reversal: the standing-wave pattern redirects his search from aimless browsing to the specific book. The final choice—abdication with treasury redirection—emerges from his discovery and forecloses dynastic continuation with visible cost. Agency is clear: Leander's intuition-bridge and physical actions (cranking, adjusting horn, presenting evidence) drive each turn. Coincidence does not resolve; the hidden mechanism was planted by Nara for exactly this purpose, lending causal coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—"to capture the shape of possibility"—is signaled early but remains conceptually vague throughout. The unsnapping sequence provides a causal chain (each clasp released → greenhouse sighs → strings loosen → seed unfolds), yet this tightening feels mechanical rather than a choice under pressure. No live option is visibly foreclosed: Calven faces no on-page dilemma between competing goods or costs. The "murmured allegiance" and recitation of the cast list are acts of compliance, not decisions that alter tactics or reveal internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—why Josie's file ended with a blank page—is signaled early and drives Mara's archival detective work. Pressure tightens when the dust pattern leads to Cabinet H, the bundle's discovery narrows options (she must decide whether to contact Josie), and the button forecloses easy erasure. Josie's arrival crystallizes the relational cost: "eyes guarded," she asks "why a soldier would write such a thing," and Mara's answer—"sorrow makes people cruel, but sometimes it also opens a door"—reweights the premise with visible interpersonal stakes. One meaningful deepening under the hybrid lens; the cost is clear but not a decisive confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—preventing erasure and exposing revised histories—is signaled early and tightens when Mara learns the courier has been taken and she "should have been dead in their version." The booth-to-ledger-to-press sequence narrows options through protagonist agency, and the plate-swap forecloses her original pamphlet plan with a visible trade-off (immediate exposure for broader reach). Cost is legible: sirens converge, and the pages must "chase" future revisions, establishing an ongoing price. One meaningful deepening under a Causal lens with Accumulative texture is present, and the final image reweights the tactic with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—stop the prophecy before it fully takes hold—is signaled early and remains coherent. The escalation is accumulative: dewdrops form faster, coded warning stutters, then the final drop is caught and exhaled as blankness. Agency is renunciation with on-page cost: he erases his mother's voice to save neighbors. The vest enables tactics (gathering sound in his chest) and the whisper-not-melody choice narrows options. One visible tightening when the grotto quiets its drip-song "for one heartbeat," showing his method works but isn't finished.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—decode the leaf message to prevent Veyroot's descent—is signaled early and tightens through the spiral's "DESCEND" reveal and the vault's confession. Lio's agency drives the key beats: scraping the dust, building monuments, prodding the vault seam, scattering cairns as a trail, carrying the book public. The foreman's dismissal provides a credible obstacle, but his opposition evaporates without cost or reprisal on the page. The arbor steadies and the sky brightens, but no character faces a trade-off or visible price in the final image—no elder's rage, no social exile, no monument destroyed—so the closure lands with conceptual weight but muted felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: whether to recover the compass rose to restore naval certainty or transform it into a tool for living with doubt. The escalation tightens through serial clues (feathers, midnight chimes, hidden chamber) and culminates in Mara's bargain with Corin, which forecloses simple restitution. However, the tension remains situational-accumulative rather than agonistic; Mara never faces a moment where returning the rose conflicts with her philosophy in a way that costs her something on the page. The final "probability clock" lands as conceptual repricing but the trade-off—what she or the admiral gives up—stays abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is clear early: redeem Orin (or at least his name) for his mother. Escalation occurs when Mara's first name-drop into the coin reveals only a partial clue (the gold line sketching a circle), forcing her to grind her own kintsugi cup and speak all stolen names to complete the inlay—narrowing her options and raising the cost. The coin then resolves to ELLIS, opening the path to Orin's body. Agency is consistent: Mara chooses the smaller redemption and pays with her shortcuts. The confrontation with Ellis and the culvert retrieval feel slightly compressed, reducing the visceral cost of that turn, but the final placement of the coin reweights prior material with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (bring back Elowen's soul by finding the note that turns to laughter). One meaningful tightening: Elowen's confession escalates from "missed the moment" to "wanted to run," forcing Mara to recite the frog rhyme—a choice rooted in her own plague-era guilt. The invisible bundle dissolving is a visible cost that forecloses Elowen's calcified loop, and Mara's own grief "laugh[s] softly, integrating into healing" with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: find the forest formula to release others. Pressure tightens when the protagonist realizes "the forest is the archive" and that only trauma-tuned bodies can read it without lying. The climax—reading the equation aloud and accepting mercy's function—is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens. Cost is present but oblique: the protagonist gains a "map in my skin" and starts toward dawn, which implies release but does not dramatize a visible trade-off or forfeiture in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—honoring overlooked histories by keeping the seam open—is signaled early and tightens when the shard begins to darken ("as if someone on the other side was unfastening its light"). One meaningful deepening occurs: the narrator finds the missing half, fits the fragments, and hears the names, which narrows options (the seam could close) and changes knowledge (the rejected painters' names are retrieved). Agency is present (the narrator chooses to return, trace the spiral, unfasten the hatch, fit the lens), and the cost is felt (the shard's darkening, the risk of losing the seam). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, though a second on-page reversal or sharper trade-off would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—"to discover what ceilings hide"—is signaled in the opening and pursued through each beat. Pressure accumulates under the Accumulative lens: dust analysis → ghost engagement → ceiling exploration → mainspring discovery → mechanism history → cabinet opening → chain release. The tightening occurs when the protagonist opens the modern cabinet and cuts the zip tie, releasing the hidden chain; the cost is the responsibility to carry the barrel out as witness rather than evidence, and to mark the crack for sealing, which will "seal the leak between eras" and end the haunting. Agency is clear: the choice to engage the ghosts, to climb and search, to cut the tie, and to carry the object out all narrow options with visible consequence. One meaningful deepening: the ghosts' request transforms repair work into spectral custodianship.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: stop the constant bargaining and hold Mara. Pressure accumulates through the spiral frost, catalog flicker, leaning aisles, and the whisper's directive. The rupture decision narrows options with cost: breaking the seal lets books reorder by desire rather than title, and the mirror-instant forecloses further negotiation. One meaningful tightening (frost spiral to rupture) is sufficient for this length. The vial-under-platen mechanics feel slightly convenient—why this object at this tree?—but the causal chain from frost-demand to Lio's action holds under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake is legible: control of the narrative around the buried court (Academy emblem vs. Diggers' reimagining). The dispute escalates when the storm reveals the alcove with the intact vase and star-routes map, forcing a choice between Yara's publication (imperial claim) and the Diggers hiding it (weaponization). Len's agency drives the resolution—he and Yara devise the third act exhibition—but the tightening arrives late and is compressed. The cost is conceptual (both factions lose certainty, the vase's ritual breaking is validated) rather than immediately visceral. One micro turn is present (covering the mirrors stops the branching futures, creating the hush for confession), but the final turn (staging the exhibition) is told in summary rather than shown as a difficult negotiation with visible trade-offs on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming stolen light—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the Thief opens its chest and admits its hollow, narrowing options to repair rather than combat. The oathfern and Covenant constraints apply pressure, and Ivo's choice to mend "what isn't torn" with the chip and wire forecloses a path with visible cost (rust approval, borrowed dawn). However, the Thief's immediate cooperation after one honest offer undercuts escalation; no second reversal tests Ivo's commitment, and the resolution lands without a trade-off between competing goods, keeping the score in the mid-7s.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—"to find the place where explanations fail"—is signaled early and pursued through each beat. Escalation unfolds as accumulative deepening: Mara moves from collecting rain in jars (control) to reading the compass (borrowed vision) to wading into the lagoon and releasing a jar (renunciation). The discovery that the factory was planned to "bottle this hush" transforms the stakes from personal quest to ethical choice, and her pouring the petrichor forecloses the collector's path with visible cost. Agency is consistent: she chooses to enter, to press the compass to the wall, to wade, and finally to leave the compass and pour. No antagonist required; pressure coheres through her own questioning.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: repair the alliance/sea wall through shared symbols. The lantern encounter introduces a tightening when Nora gestures and Mara realizes she must translate across tribal divides. Carving the spiral deepens the stake by operationalizing the concept, and planting three sculptures narrows the town's options at dawn. Agency is decision and craft, not renunciation. The closure shows collaborative success (sandbags lock, turbines hum) but the cost—what Mara forgoes or risks by committing to this mediator role—is implied rather than dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding why flowers bloom at night and what her mother was trying to tell her—is signaled early and tightens through Lina's custodial work, her noticing the night-blooming stock, and the postcards' clues. The window discovery is a meaningful deepening that narrows options by providing a concrete answer with visible cost: Lina must accept that her mother's journeys were acts of care she can never reciprocate directly. The piece lacks a traditional reversal or antagonist, but under the Accumulative lens the escalation reads as density increase culminating in the palimpsest revelation. Agency is present in Lina's choice to climb the stair, interpret the layers, and paint the new panel, though the discovery itself arrives without prior struggle or failed attempts.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—uncover the encrypted diary and honor Lila's testimony—is signaled early and tightens through three beats: vision of Lila's moonlit encoding, lagoon discovery, parley negotiation. The protagonist's agency (arranging debris, promising redaction) forecloses the path of unredacted publication with visible cost. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens but escalation is moderate; the parley outcome feels collaborative rather than fought, and no live opposition forces a hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Sen can rebuild meaning without miracles—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates through the iterative craft sequence and the returning families' requests to open the bottle, but no single on-page reversal meaningfully narrows options: Sen never wavers, the families acquiesce after a single exchange, and the charter proposal faces token resistance ("Some wanted another wish instead") that dissolves without dramatized cost. The accumulative deepening reweights the town's economy from wishes to labor, yet the transformation occurs largely in summary ("By the month of new tides...") rather than through a visible, felt sacrifice that forecloses a live alternative. The cost of rejecting miracles—what Sen or the town loses by choosing soap over wishes—is implied but never made concrete on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: will Erem's act of listening/archiving bind the city to disaster? One meaningful tightening: the lullaby names the grid failure hour, and Erem fears "by listening he has sworn the city into that failure." His broadcast choice forecloses inaction with visible cost (unease, Registry scrutiny). The "emotional patterns suggest a loophole" moment pivots tactics under causal pressure. Minor gap: the grid crews' readiness feels slightly convenient; a line showing prior skepticism would sharpen the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding and managing the vortex inheritance to prevent further hatchling escapes—is signaled early and tightens through the sorting ritual, corridor vision, and restoration sequence. One meaningful deepening occurs when Lio learns the family debt ("every time the family stole a moment, they had to mend a little chaos somewhere else"), reframing his seed work as payment rather than vocation. Agency is decision and endurance: he chooses to enter, accepts the obligation, and executes the restoration. Cost is conceptual—eternal custodianship—but visible in the final image. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, though the restoration tasks (reopening schedules, writing labels) feel low-stakes compared to the cosmic stakes declared.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clearly signaled early: test the siren to prove readiness for the blue-front gale while respecting sanctuary peace and the glue-drying constraint. Pressure tightens through causal escalation: Office demands full siren at zero hour, Maris must choose between compliance and her new approach, and she waits until the splice cures to flip the switch—a decision with professional risk (dispatcher's anger). The escalation is earned by protagonist agency, and the cost is legible on-page (dispatcher demands explanation, Maris answers with data, risking censure). One visible trade-off: loud alarm vs. quiet vane that "invited hearing rather than fear." Minor deduction: the gale "arriving right on time" and "spent itself by dawn" feel slightly convenient, though Maris's prediction work justifies the timing.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: finding strength in vulnerability by letting grief breathe rather than armoring it. Escalation is textural: from solitary mopping to charcoal tracing to tunnel discovery to communal ritual. The converging meteor paths narrow options, forcing Lio to follow and uncover the director's parallel loss. Agency is clear: Lio chooses to reopen the dome and invite others, forecloses solitary endurance. The final meteor breaking apart is marked collectively, and their laughter is earned renunciation of the demand for wholeness. Visible cost: reopening the dome risks exposing his grief to others, a departure from the "cold corridors where nobody demanded he be healed."

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: untangle the covenant and honor Mara's memory versus preserve unspoken words. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mara's gesture and the ghosts' clustering force the narrator to choose release over hoarding, narrowing options with visible cost (the ghosts depart, Mara nods and goes, the oasis shifts from grief-locked to tendable). Agency is clear—decision to read aloud—and the final line reweights the stakes under the Accumulative lens. The price is legible: solitude deepens as companions vanish, but the path forward opens.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding time's texture—is signaled early and drives the climb into the silo. The capsule exchange is a meaningful tightening: Eli's borrowed year "slips off," options narrow to custodian duty. Cost is visible (timelessness replaces countdown) but the final move—writing a tag and waiting—reads passive, lowering agency at closure. Mara's invitation and the tag sequences deepen the accumulative lens without requiring reversals. One persistent constraint (grief as ballast) shapes the exchange, but the ending's open patience slightly diffuses the felt price compared to a decisive forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—proving beauty lives in the incomplete—is signaled early and tested across three repair sequences (net, kite, drake). Each act narrows Rian's options by requiring him to invest time and materials, and the final choice to return the feather forecloses keeping the "proof" he initially sought, a visible cost scaled to this length. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens as each repair deepens his commitment, but escalation is gentle; the brothers' quarrel and the child's worry introduce external complications without forcing Rian to choose between competing goods or risk failure. The drake's injury provides the peak tightening, yet resolution arrives without visible struggle—his method succeeds in every application.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—fostering interspecies respect before death—is signaled early and tightens once when Mara discovers the seed pods, reweighting the temple's architectural purpose. Her remodeling work creates visible pressure (chest aching, monks complaining), and the gathering at the end forces communal commitment. However, the monks' opposition dissolves without forcing Mara to pay a tactical price or make a hard trade-off; their conversion after watching crabs feels convenient rather than earned through escalating conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (understand the chemistry of homecoming vs. council's scripted pilgrimage) is signaled early and tightens through accumulative pressure: signal→footprints→amber→door→pedestal. The narrator's agency drives escalation (listens unfiltered, follows off-path, cracks vial, cuts shard). One meaningful tightening occurs when breath reaches the crystals and lab dyes make the narrator "easier to read," narrowing options and forcing the theft. Cost is visible (defiance, theft) but the renunciation could be more viscerally felt; the piece leans analytical rather than agonized.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: secure the submerged concord by making the poisoned soil accept new growth. Pressure coheres through the accumulative ritual—each act (naming the dead, pouring seed pods, spreading silt, speaking the invitation) tightens the pact until the water answers with assent. One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator shifts from commanding to inviting, "offering the dead a future tense," which reweights the relationship and earns the clacking response. The final image—roots threading through bullet fragments "without hatred," the gulls' command "Keep it"—forecloses retreat and commits the narrator to tending this fragile garden. Cost is legible: the coachman accepts the vastness "asking whether my small fertilizing can count as peace," a felt wager against the empty sea.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is legible: expose the council's betrayal and protect Sera. The riddle-solving beat tightens options (copper coils traded, cylinder decrypted), and the broadcast decision at the relay station forces Lio to stand beside Sera against armed guards—a turn with visible cost (guards running, camps mobilizing). Morrow's choice to bark "at the lies" rather than at people crystallizes stance and participates in resolution. The warlord-coordinate setup raises external pressure efficiently. One hairline weakness: the camps' instant coordinated response ("closing the wasteland with voices") compresses collective action without dramatizing friction, slightly softening the final cost's texture.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: turning confusion into exploration, signaled early and sustained through the protagonist's return despite crew exile. One meaningful tightening occurs when the sketch reveals directional drift, forcing the choice to trust the alignment and open the hatch. Agency is decision with visible cost: accepting solitude and leaving the station behind. The temporally stretched sensation creates escalating disorientation that the protagonist must navigate. No antagonist required; the situational pressure coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—rescuing Serren and proving the protagonist can embrace the unknown—is signaled early and drives each beat. The chess swap tightens pressure briefly, and the final choice (opening arms to the storm) narrows options by forcing trust. However, escalation feels declared rather than dramatized: the Skywrights shout below but never catch up; the chains crack conveniently; the ledge and map appear without prior setup. The cost of the leap remains conceptual—no visible loss or forfeiture on the page makes the stakes visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving small-gesture testimony against erasure—is signaled early and tightens when the vellum arrives ("Unbind the archive before midnight") and guards thunder overhead. One meaningful escalation: the protagonist's paced unlocking and cord-ripping under immediate threat narrows options and forecloses the loyalists' rewrite with visible cost (imprisonment, reliance on the child attendant). Agency is clear: the decision to descend, split bundles, and hide the satchel drives the reversal. The final cost—imprisonment traded for public disclosure—lands on the page when broadsheets quote the archive and the crowd shifts. Coincidence (the attendant's success) does not resolve but enables the earned turn.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding the shape of home by recovering the lost language stone and reclaiming the naming talent—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure escalates in a clear sequence: the seer's recognition triggers numbness, the stone demands a true memory (raising cost), midnight approaches and reality begins to shuffle (narrowing the window), and the protagonist must name each turn aloud to resist the mountain's substitution. Agency is visible: the choice to seed the raw memory and the active naming that pins corridors in place both foreclose retreat and earn the final escape. The cost is legible on the page (the spilled grief, the refusal of gentler histories). One meaningful tightening—midnight's approach and the blur of shelves—forces the protagonist to commit the talent in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—self-forgiveness via puzzle-solving that might free the village—signals early and tightens once when the woven hush "pressed on her ears," forcing Mara to choose the longer labyrinth route that "preserved the frozen townsfolk's unbroken lives" over clever shortcuts. That turn narrows options and raises cost under a causal lens. The final gate confrontation deepens stakes by requiring her to "offer a draw to the past" rather than conquer, a choice that forecloses heroic recognition with visible cost (her exit without applause). Agency is present: decode, navigate, renounce. The coincidental spell-breaking setup (rumor said tapestry could unpick the hush) slightly softens the causal chain, keeping this below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—expose the killer without being silenced—is signaled early and tightens once: Mara refracts the accusation across many voices, forcing a confrontation. The crowd's echo and Jalen's intervention provide one meaningful escalation under the causal lens. However, the killer's lunge and capture occur in summary, and the elders' judgment arrives without visible negotiation or resistance, reducing the felt cost of each turn. The final sacrifice (ink and prisms) forecloses her art with on-page cost, satisfying the requirement, but the speed from exposure to resolution compresses the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—save the workshop and self from the acid sea while salvaging meaning—is signaled early and tightens through the pontoons softening, the Lung dive under breath constraint, and the final resin pour. The piece delivers one major deepening: Lysa's realization that "the statue is not asking for more potions, only for an honest pattern," which shifts her tactics from alchemical control to kintsugi acceptance and charges the closure. Agency is clear (she brews, dives, narrates, clips the charm, pours resin) and the cost—accepting the brother's loss, forgiving herself—is legible on the page. Escalation reads as accumulative pressure rather than reversals, consistent with the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—fulfilling the hidden promise and confronting his aloofness—is signaled early and tightens once via the cave discovery and the forced admission. The escalation reads as deepening rather than external reversal: the mirror crack prompts urgency, the cave offers the test, the admission reweights the shell's meaning. Agency is clear in the cave monologue and the decision to repaint the shell, forecloses aloofness with visible cost. However, the pressure is largely internal and reflective; no live opposition or trade-off sharpens the choice, and the fisherman's exit is convenient rather than complicating.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (prove whispers travel farther than shouts) is signaled early and tested on the page. The narrator's whisper-into-cork action tightens options when Jonas's far-point light blinks in non-standard rhythm, providing causal confirmation. Jonas's arrival "ashamed of the dents his foghorn had punched" forecloses his prior method with visible cost. The final choice to "listen for the tremble" represents protagonist-driven escalation under the Accumulative lens. One reversal (from volume to vibration) with felt price: Jonas must abandon his insistence on blast-after-blast.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—navigating returners safely through altered terrain—is signaled early and tightens when the censer foot validates cryptic numbers, forcing the navigator to trust an unknown caller. One meaningful escalation: the full-moon weight swing points toward aqueducts, compelling the night journey that risks the group. The reunion resolves through protagonist agency (building the armillary, following the numbers) and the boy's parallel action (sending calls), not coincidence. Visible cost: the navigator shifts from solitary technician to communal promise-keeper, foreclosing the option of mechanical distance. Sera's search for her son provides secondary pressure that converges cleanly at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (psychological safety for survivors vs. Mara's involuntary truth) is signaled early and braided tightly with the glass-eye tool. Pressure escalates through one meaningful turn: Ministry arrival forces immediate choice between transparency and protection. Agency is clear—Mara's occlusion tactic and decoy planting drive the resolution with visible cost (she must bury the tool that gave her grace). The coincidence of Ministry timing complicates but does not resolve; Mara's prepared deception (hollow casing) shows prior constraint shaping tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: decode the stranger's final gesture. Pressure accumulates through Eamon's method—each gap (no sand, wrong knot, empty grip) narrows options and deepens the mystery. The tightening occurs when the packet is found and the letter read aloud, transforming the stranger's "offering of absence" into an act Eamon can witness and archive. Agency is clear: Eamon chooses to pin the boutonniere and place it in the logbook, a renunciation of ownership that forecloses other responses (e.g., personal possession, official filing). Cost is legible in the final line: his isolation is redefined as a burden of witnessing.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: find the doorway and choose a future. One meaningful tightening: the rising creek narrows the window, and Ellis's fork (dry/wet) crystallizes the trade-off between inheritance-plus-debt versus clean escape. The wet-passage choice forecloses the dry path with visible cost (Ellis, the presswork, the note surrendered). Coincidence (printer's delivery) complicates but does not resolve; Mara's agency drives the climb.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—stop dreaming or the kingdom wakes to bleeding sky—signals early and tightens when the grotto ritual reveals the cut star pulsing wetly. The voice's bargain (close the wound and lose the throne vs. keep it open and rule) is a clear escalation that narrows Maelin's options. Her descent into the fissure is protagonist-driven agency with visible cost (soot-streaked, ember heat). The final plainness of the sky is a felt reconfiguration: the choice is now hers, which "frightened her more than any omen." One meaningful pressure point suffices at this length; coincidence does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: whether Lio will commodify his suns or preserve their original purpose. Toma's warning ("They want you to license…I refused to sign") narrows options sharply, forcing Lio's agency. The escalation is driven by protagonist choice under the Accumulative lens: Lio decides to "return differently," pours solar dust into the shell, releases each sun through it, creating a visible protest constellation. The cost is legible on the page—forgoing income, defying institutional pressure, binding himself to Toma's shared risk. One meaningful tightening (the decision to release "here, now") is present, and the Academy watchers' observation makes consequences immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (distill chaos into narrative before it eats me) is signaled early and drives the protagonist's lucid-dream interrogations and writing acts. One meaningful tightening: the ridge-swap crystallizes the method (jealousy of past selves) and narrows options by revealing the grave as calendar-puncture rather than prophecy. The gratitude beat in the second dream breaks the loop, and the final choice to "keep writing" forecloses spiraling with on-page cost (continuous authorial labor vs. becoming a rumor). Agency is renunciation and endurance (Earned Stasis), not decisive external action, which fits the lens. Minor slip: the second dream's thread-map and thanking-the-younger-self beats feel more like affirmation than escalation; the pressure plateaus rather than tightens further, though the closure choice remains earned.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Iris proving her post-anosmia method can still help—is signaled early and drives the delivery choice. One meaningful tightening occurs when Iris reads Aster's fear and the father's rigidity, then stages a resolution by repositioning sight lines and offering validation. The intervention narrows options (passivity vs. active humanizing) and alters the room's emotional state with visible result (the father speaks, asks to thank). However, the cost to Iris herself is not dramatized on the page; her internal risk or trade-off remains implicit. The father's shift is told quickly ("not to accuse but to ask"), compressing what could be a higher-stakes beat.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake signaled early: transform scars into stories. One meaningful tightening when Ila adds the fourth circle ("giving the storm a mouth") narrows options—the platform levels, storms pause. Agency is clear: she writes runes on the table and on her arm, risking crystallization failure. Cost is visible: holding breath under storm pressure, revisiting childhood trauma, shedding shame. The master's promise of "narrow, living interval" provides a constraint, but his whispered guidance lowers earned escalation slightly. Deduction: the storms' anthropomorphic "hesitation" and "listening" soften the mechanical stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear: deliver the apology to June before the archive (and orchard) are erased. Pressure tightens through the wire setup, the memory flood that tests Marin's resolve, and the fuse-pop that forces her to commit via the correction. Agency is Marin's throughout—her shop-work exorcism, her spoken apology, her decision to write the retraction despite knowing it won't save all the trees. The cost is visible: bottle cracks, chainsaws rehearse, and Marin is left "gritty with sweat and holy smoke," knowing her act is partial and imperfect. One micro-turn (fuse pops, June's warm breath) sharpens the final choice without breaking the causal thread.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: unraveling cosmic illusions after the universe's hiccup. The spiral arbitration process provides one meaningful deepening as the narrator moves from examining mirrors to stepping into the spiral's center, unifying contradictions. However, escalation is impressionistic; the narrator's agency is declarative ("I swore," "I realized") rather than tested by live opposition or costly choice in scene. The resolution (stepping into the center, climbing back) feels ordained rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: maintain accurate national measurements under physical constraint (ice, fog, missed supply boat). The ice discovery narrows options (can't chip from outside), forcing the warmed-probe tactic. The fog complicates the sighting, and the inspector's arrival escalates the test of Ivar's methods. The final joint action (rewarming, resetting, leaving the mantle clock wrong) reflects protagonist agency, though the inspector's participation dilutes solo cost slightly. One meaningful tightening—ice to probe to late sighting to inspector confrontation—suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding her father's double life without inheriting it—is signaled early and tightens as each scrawl narrows her interpretation. The scavenger hunt escalates from contradiction ("CERTAINTY IS A COIN WITH TWO HEADS") to cost warning ("DO NOT CONFUSE EDGE WITH ESCAPE") to plea ("TEACH THEM ODDS, THEN TEACH THEM COST"). The exhibit decision and lantern visit are protagonist-driven with visible cost: she accepts the burden of teaching his lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: whether Mara will remain in her safe loop of cultivated estrangement or risk genuine connection. The woman's confession at 2:17 is the key tightening—it mirrors Mara's own hidden choice (ceasing contact with Lena) and forces recognition. Mara's agency drives closure: she turns the dial-out key, an active violation of operator protocol, and speaks a line that names the paradox ("a wrong number that has been trying to become right"). The cost is double: she forfeits her safe distance and risks Lena's refusal. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens—wrong-number friendships accumulate until the pattern must break. No coincidence resolves; Mara chooses.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is established early: whether the regenerated covenant will repeat the old lie or admit the council's complicity. Pressure tightens through Mara's discovery (locket), her archival decision (writing the confession), her confrontation (reading proximate causes to the mayor), and the public ceremony where multiple characters pay visible prices—the mayor's shaking hand, Jun's mother dropping the locket, Mara tearing out the false page. Each turn forecloses options: once Mara writes the new preface, the council cannot ignore it; once she hands them the locket, their rehearsed lines "sound like lies." The final ceremony crystallizes the shift from denial to accountability with social and emotional cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—curing loneliness—is signaled early and tightens through the moon rock's reciprocity rule: each use must be passed on or "it went cold." The escalation is driven by protagonist agency (narrator initiates the exchange chain) and the cost is legible when the rock cools "from completion" and must be relinquished. The reversal at "the story changes" when Mara is revealed as patient rather than courier is earned. One persistent constraint—the reciprocity binding—shapes all tactics. The piece narrowly misses high-8s because the evacuees and thieves arrive suddenly without prior setup, slightly softening the turn's groundwork.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: navigate emotional grief through finding the stillpoint. The piece delivers one meaningful tightening when the observatory stone forces Iris to absorb her brother's panic, and the compass "bit her skin, urging her onward"—a tangible reversal that narrows her option to flee. The pool's completion of the hidden melody and its translation into "you can miss him and still live" constitutes earned closure under the Accumulative lens. However, agency at the climax is passive reception rather than a difficult choice; Iris kneels and absorbs rather than deciding between competing paths. Cost is felt (she must face the panic rather than run) but the price could be more viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: whether Mara can correct the garden error through her editing method. The new cadence forces the unbending choice, which narrows options—she must loosen her own certainty to proceed. The resolution (inserting the tea moment) alters tactics and forecloses brute decree as a method. Cost is visible: she accepts that kindness matters more than grand correction and signs nothing, releasing control. One clear tightening under a causal lens is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—combating erasure by translating silence into sound—is signaled early and tightened at the foghorn failure, which forces faster signing and creates urgency. The protagonist's agency is clear in the decision to map silence and to offer the camera at closure. Cost is visible: the camera (father's relic, "only thing that still belonged") is set down as offering, foreclosing personal possession. The musician's acceptance and the tune's effect provide a meaningful deepening that changes the protagonist's social legibility, though full transformation remains open.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—rescue a forgotten promise and reveal regime lies—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the trail (bent bird, charcoal spiral, vandalized portrait, mosaic footprints, clay hands), but the escalation is puzzle-解答 rather than choice-driven tightening. The climax (finding the reel, copying it, broadcasting) lacks on-page cost: Sera does not forfeit a live option or face a trade-off. The instruction "start burning what keeps them blind" is external direction, not protagonist agency under pressure. One meaningful deepening occurs (understanding Miko's message), but the final act feels more like completion of a treasure hunt than a decision that narrows options with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—to breathe life into the narrator's brother through the entangled-memory experiment—is signaled early and coheres throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when the narrator's drumming becomes audible to Sato, forcing her to admit her own motive and raising the cost (neural overload alarms). The final choice to stay perched and "hold the dream steady" forecloses safety with visible cost (shaking, wet-eyed, data handed over). Agency is present in both the shared defiance and the solo return, though the reversals are modest in number for a piece of this density.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake signaled early: prove the whisper system to save her job and prevent future harm. The challenge from Len creates a clear tightening with visible professional cost. The crane-brake slip escalates from test to genuine emergency, forcing real-time application under duress. Agency is clear: Mara's decision to use the secret conduit and orchestrate whispered coordination forecloses the option of retreat. The resolution is earned by protagonist action with felt cost (job security, professional validation). One small dock: the stevedore rescue, while dramatic, slightly dilutes focus from the central whisper-proof stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—moral reckoning with complicity—signals early when the girl carries the mirror and half-spoken secret. Pressure tightens through the guardian's shutter lattice and the mirror descent, forcing her to witness the drowned fisher. The confession to the patrol is protagonist-driven agency with felt cost (blood, breaking voice). One meaningful deepening: the star-in-eye moment narrows her options from evasion to accountability. Under Accumulative lens, the star-net and mirror descent suffice for escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (save the grove) is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the synchronized windows compel the mayor to walk into the library, but escalation is largely offstage—we're told "unspoken irritation turn[ed]...into curiosity" and that the mayor saw the display, then proposed a delay. No on-page reversal tests Eli's commitment; coincidence (the mayor's childhood memory) resolves the conflict without visible cost to the protagonist. The midnight grotto assembly and text-trigger are clever tactics but do not narrow Eli's options or force a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—freedom versus binding—is signaled early and tightens through the protagonist's choice to detach rather than chain. The scrimshaw's unlocking of Rusk's guarded heart is a genuine reversal that changes his stance from command to invitation. Agency is clear: the protagonist uses the knife as lever, works the chains with Rusk, and finally detaches from the dock. Cost is visible: Rusk loses his worker, the daughter drifts seaward, the protagonist abandons planks. The whale call operates as situational pressure that forces crystallization rather than solving the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: cultivate lightness in grief without lying about it, signaled in the co-op posting. The goat-milking beat produces the first "short sound... that might have been laughter," a meaningful tightening that shifts the narrator from purely frozen to capable of involuntary lightness. The bouquet release at the fence line is protagonist-driven agency (endurance and permission rather than cure) with visible cost—"no surge of comfort" but acceptance of grief's movement. Orin's presence applies continuous pressure through his confessed complicity, keeping the moral stakes live.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—reaching her brother across the border of the dead—is signaled early and drives Lira's choices. Pressure accumulates as each paraphrase loosens the carvings and the mist thickens, narrowing her path toward dissolution. However, escalation remains textural rather than a sharp reversal; no moment forces a trade-off or forecloses an option with visible consequence until the final crossing. The cost of becoming "simply air" is conceptually present but not felt as a tangible sacrifice on the page—no specific ability, memory, or connection is named as lost.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake: Mara needs the reed tongue; secondary: Joren's fear of emptying himself through trades. The plant-language negotiation tightens when Joren refuses her first awakening ("not enough"), then Mara shifts tactics (portrait, spiral arrangement). But the escalation depends on Joren's emotional shift rather than a narrowing of Mara's options or a visible cost paid before the final beat. The closure trade—she asks for his "bubbles as stars" awakening and he "still remembers it, because the gift is shared"—feels like a workaround that sidesteps the story's own rule (awakenings are lost when given), undercutting the cost legibility the premise promised.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (can artificial pilgrimage heal civic trust without scripting comfort) is signaled early and braided with the narrator's personal stake (discovering texture of connection). One meaningful tightening: Mara's decision to play raw archive instead of polished loop forces officials to answer on the spot. Agency is present in that choice, but the turn itself is compressed into a single paragraph of summary ("we propelled the lens toward honesty") rather than a dramatized beat with visible resistance or cost in the moment. The press walk's outcome—reporters meet their own doubts, questions leap hand to hand—is recounted at distance rather than shown with immediate pressure. Escalation reads more as conceptual deepening (the pilgrimage design shifts from spectacle to conversation) than a sequence of narrowing tactical choices under mounting opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake signaled early: Mara's pull toward oblivion versus finding direction after rock bottom. One meaningful tightening: Sen's origami method transforms her isolated grief into outward teaching, narrowing her options from passive despair to active craft. Lysa's arrival and the basil sprout crystallize the method's cost and efficacy, foreclosing retreat. The imagined husband's constraint ("keep the light from spilling into harm") adds moral calculus. Agency is renunciation and endurance with visible cost (carrying ashes, "the old hunger for oblivion loosen its grip"). The strangers' arrival escalates via accumulation under the Accumulative lens. No explicit antagonist; coincidence (birds found) complicates but does not resolve—Mara still must perform the ritual and teach each person.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—understanding and continuing grandmother's cultural-pattern research—is signaled early and pursued throughout. The narrator's agency is present: choosing to unspool the tape, aligning sketches with beams, taking deck and tape into streets, promising to publish. One meaningful tightening occurs when Aurel confides his shame over guiding traders, raising ethical stakes. The resolution (accepting the inheritance, promising return visits) feels earned by prior work but lacks a sharp trade-off or visible loss. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens but the cost remains diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—pursuing forbidden Keth knowledge—is signaled early and tightens when the historian learns the archives are traps. One reversal occurs: the purification intended to cleanse instead reveals the contagion and its cure. Agency is present in the choice to rotate the pagoda irregularly and to copy the formula, but the final teaching decision feels like an add-on rather than a forced trade-off with visible loss. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, yet the escalation lacks a moment where the historian must sacrifice a live option to gain the formula.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake (preserve damaged dreams / the shape of hope) is signaled early. Pressure tightens when Mara refuses the purge, then escalates through her investigation and the shadow's recognition. The final metamorphosis is enabled by Mara's choices (comparison footage, offering her unshared dusk, stone and name), so agency is present. The cost—giving the river stone and true name—is visible, though the shadow's cooperation reduces friction. One meaningful deepening: realizing the shadow is shed disappointment, not invader.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (balancing self-respect and compassion) is signaled early and tightens through the call with Tessa, where Mara's anger thins "layer by layer" yet she still files the report. The decision to offer legal aid while reporting fraud is a forced trade-off with visible cost: emotional labor, risk to her credibility, extended responsibility for animals. Agency drives escalation—Mara writes lists, initiates the call, drafts the public statement, and delivers animals—foreclosing the path of simple anger or avoidance.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: move the miracle to heal both neighborhood and self. Mara's agency drives each beat (peeling gauze, contacting ivy, tunneling, opening jar, pouring light), and one meaningful tightening occurs when she makes the wound "worse on purpose" to let it speak. The final pour into the pavement crack is protagonist-driven with visible cost (reopened wound, pain quieting to "distant pulse"). However, the miracle's discovery and the plants' instructions feel convenient rather than hard-won; no competing option is foreclosed with dramatized sacrifice, and the neighborhood's healing is summarized rather than shown as a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (to find where unused love is stored) is signaled early and tightens through accumulative pressure: looping lyrics, torn letters, the film strip's blankness as vault. The psychometry vision deepens stakes by revealing Eli's parallel struggle, and Mara's choice to project nothing and read aloud forecloses her prior method (tearing to teach song) with visible cost. Agency is renunciation and ritual completion. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful turn—projecting emptiness, speaking into it—suffices; the cost (years of silence, "brave enough to finish the goodbye") is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity—is signaled early and sustained. Escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as density increase: each night's meteor observation tightens resolve ("murmurs grew louder, almost impatient"), and the elders' "unsaid confession" deepens urgency. The vault's opening is the single meaningful tightening that narrows options (Sel commits to the spiral map). However, no live trade-off or visible price alters tactics; the resolution feels granted rather than won through a costly pivot. Coincidence (meteors returning when Sel watches) complicates but does not resolve, consistent with the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake signaled early: guard the archive's bloom and prevent collapse into "a single profitable history." Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens as the guard learns wave functions, walks shelves, reroutes a crate, plants seeds, all building toward the auditor confrontation. The peak choice—offering auditors "a pattern of choices sung through wave functions"—narrows options (they back away), but the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt. One meaningful tightening occurs when the shack opens and the guard splits across timelines, but agency reads more as distributed attention than a decision with visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—rediscovering the wild frontier of the mind before it rusts shut—is signaled early and pursued through a series of deepening confrontations (bridge of magnets = fear of certainty, clockwork orchids = need for applause). The piece delivers one meaningful tightening when the protagonist places the gear under the tongue and wills the forest to take them to the hinge, then turns the crank at the cathedral. However, the escalation is Accumulative rather than Causal, and while the crank-turn forecloses the old belief with tenderness, the cost remains oblique—more conceptual repricing than a lived tradeoff visible in tactics or a renounced alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—finding the lost dog and confronting her own paralysis—is signaled early and deepens at the vigil when Mara remembers other broken leashes, reweighting the search as internal test. One on-page tightening occurs when she hears the yelp and chooses the darkest descent despite fear, narrowing options and escalating risk. The rescue itself (using the punch to free the dog) provides a visible agency moment with cost: her hands shake, but she acts. However, the guides solve logistical problems (finding the thicket, knowing the fence route) without Mara's direct input, softening her agency in the approach. The ending forecloses the path of tight-holding control, accepting looser trust as price and gain.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake is clear: whether enforced silence will continue to erase suffering or whether the protagonist will risk speaking to support Edda's nerve recovery. Escalation is causal and tightens: Edda's mute question → the wobbling bench preventing therapy → the hidden discovery of surveillance machinery → the bolt repair → Edda's whispered note → the protagonist's whisper that triggers the REMAIN alert and approaching footsteps. The final image crystallizes the trade-off: "a quiet that protected without erasing, a frostbitten hope." Agency is present (the protagonist chooses to whisper, to guide Edda under the piano, to stand and meet the director's eyes). The cost is legible: surveillance activated, potential exposure to hunters or directors. One substantive pressure arc sufficient for this length. Does not reach 8.5 because the hunters remain abstract (we never see them test the protagonist on the page), so the final risk feels conceptual rather than viscerally immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—unmasking the pretender—is signaled early and drives every move. The escalation is clear: pellet instructions → drift through time → discovery of the crownmark annotation → sealed chamber → sundering the false star → public confrontation. The story delivers one meaningful tightening (the rune guides Orun past sealed barriers, narrowing his path to the one proof that can topple the usurper). However, the confrontation itself is passive—Orun "lays" evidence and "asks" a question; the pretender's collapse is elegant inevitability rather than a contested turn, and no live choice or trade-off is dramatized in the throne hall.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—discovering why paths disappear—is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful escalation: the beacon meeting reweights the mystery from loss to intentional timing, forcing Mara to choose between transparency and complicity. Agency crystallizes in her decision to encode rather than publish the schedule, foreclosing open guidance with on-page cost ("so that those who listened could find...while the careless would keep following"). The hooded woman's explanation functions as reversal that narrows options. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: monthly failures → chart assembly → beacon pattern recognition → timed revelation → encoded transmission. The piece leans heavily on contemplation; a second micro-choice during the confrontation would have sharpened escalation further.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—reconnecting the fractured rebellion—is signaled early and tightens when Ilya decodes the hum, tunes the console, and sends the burst. One meaningful escalation occurs: moving from passive observation (opera glasses, notebook) to active transmission with jammer-evading risk. The console reply validates her method and supplies new coordinates, deepening commitment. However, agency at closure is muted; the footsteps arrive but produce no on-page choice or tactical shift. Cost is implied (exposure, next mission) but not viscerally demonstrated—no loss of resource, no immediate danger crystallized, no visible price paid that alters her next move on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: prevent weaponized destiny from recurring. Pressure builds through the plant-communication discovery, then tightens when the decode reveals imprinting risk ("the embryo would imprint on the first will it sensed"). Agency is clear: Nara chooses the narrator as "witness and counterweight" and speaks her story to rewrite the script. The unsealing sequence is a visible, on-page turn that forecloses the oracle path with felt cost (the priests' relic is destroyed/transformed). One brief micro-turn when the salamander crawls toward the garden. No explicit antagonist but the weight of tradition and the relic's latent program supply coherent opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (can Mina return to purposeful work in the presence of triggers?) is signaled early and tightens when the hobby drone forces real-time somatic management. The freeze mid-sentence is a visible cost that narrows options. The final windbreak construction and photograph burial constitute an earned stance crystallization: survival without lying. One meaningful escalation (drone buzzing → freeze → request → later gull misidentification) suffices under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—redesigning fractured portraits to restore coherence—is signaled early and tightens when the library walls press inward and Mara descends to the lens mechanism. Her agency is clear: she unknots filaments and weaves them into the canvas, altering the portrait's eyes and stabilizing the beam. The coincidence that the Tower card matches her childhood sketch and that untangling filaments releases "slivers of another world" feels convenient rather than earned by prior causality; the mechanics of how threads align realities remain impressionistic. Cost is present but oblique: the sister is "changed, carrying a calm that made room for pain," which reads more as thematic claim than on-page forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—discovering why time slows in crisis—is signaled early and drives every beat. Pressure escalates: Keir recovers the map, risks the ink-pool journey, confronts the obelisk replay under slowed time, and sabotages the device. The knife-strike is protagonist-driven agency that forecloses the Council's control, a meaningful tightening with visible cost (he leaves evidence behind, elders demand proof he cannot give). The secondary layer (Council exploitation) converges cleanly at closure. One limitation: the obelisk's mechanics and the canyon ambush replay feel somewhat expository; the tension is declared ("slowed fighters blinked in stretched surprise") more than viscerally dramatized, reducing the felt weight of the confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—exposing corruption versus protecting Mara—is signaled early and tightens through the protagonist's realization that the letter is bait and that silence enables deeper rot. The on-page choice to feed the letter into the console is driven by protagonist agency and narrows options irreversibly, forcing the Council's hand. The cost is legible: the protagonist expects arrest ("they could seal me in my own cryo drawer") and Mara's potential disgrace, and the final confrontation dramatizes those stakes without letting coincidence resolve them.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—Maris protecting Lio from capture while changing her father's stance—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure escalates through the militia's approach ("engines through the sand like distant drums") and Tarek's reflex reach for his rifle. The roses' refusal to open is the key reversal that narrows Tarek's options and forces him to kneel, a tightening consistent with the Accumulative lens. The cost is visible: Tarek abandons the bounty, defies the new council, and stays to plant seeds. However, the militia's withdrawal feels slightly convenient—"unsettled by the roses flaring like a tranquil blaze" reads more metaphorical than tactical. The final act (planting archive seeds) is earned by Tarek's prior causality and forecloses his bounty-hunter path with on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear early: catch Sileth's echo. Pressure tightens through protagonist agency—voicing silence tightens the line, choosing the quietest harmonic narrows options, and the final release forecloses the prize path with visible cost (empty hands, echo sealed). The trade-off between possession and protection emerges through his own realization and action. One meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens is sufficient and the cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: uncover the truth without collapsing honest work. Celeste's agency drives escalation: she hears the tremor, requests the darkroom tour, spots the dust, then forces the bargain with documented contradictions. One clear tightening when the plates' fresh dust and Sato's confession narrow options to "expose and destroy" or "intervene with proof." The final bargain forecloses spectacle with visible cost (no planet story, Sato must admit damage). Minor deduction: the "orbit of regret" framing occasionally summarizes emotional stakes rather than showing contradictory impulses in action, and Sato's colleague's death is told rather than dramatized as a pressure point.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—confronting the abandoned sister's cry—is signaled early and drives every beat. Pressure tightens when the letters describe the device, escalates when Lio enters the lab, and peaks when the translation delivers coordinates and "I am cold." The tether action (drawing the comet tail, clipping the wire) is protagonist-driven and narrows options to confrontation. The cost is visible: "his own heartbeat had been the static" reweights his guilt, and the firmware's release marks irreversible closure. One meaningful deepening (the cry becomes words, not just sound) suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—discovering meaning in the mess of forgetting—is signaled early and coheres through the accumulative lens. Pressure deepens when the boy blurts a proverb and the circle freezes; Inez's tap of the tile flake refracts the fragments into "something gentler," easing the teacher's fear. But this turn lacks visible cost; no resource is spent, no path foreclosed. The resolution feels given by the tile flake's properties rather than won by Inez's choice under constraint. One meaningful tightening occurs, but the stakes never force a trade-off with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: rename survivors to shift posture and forestall vengeance. The retrocognitive vision tightens by forcing Lina to see her cousin as the arsonist, escalating her internal conflict. Samir's choice to offer the Grasp instead of a blade narrows options with visible cost (the boy's restraint, Lina's bitter laugh). The shared loaf is a meaningful deepening that reweights the truce. One micro turn (Lina's recognition) sets up the closure without diluting pressure. Agency is clear: Samir's renaming act and Lina's decision to bring the cousin drive the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—luring possibility from despair via the coin and Silas's unfinished trick—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the synesthetic voice-and-color echoing, which intertwines past and present until Silas can complete his finale. The tightening occurs when Mara realizes the fractured timeline holds Silas "forever one beat from applause," then chooses to catch the coin on the Fool and press it to the stage. The cost is visible (Silas vanishes, the garden stabilizes) but the final choice feels more like executing a known ritual than a decision under competing pressure; there's no meaningful forfeiture or trade-off dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake (test the recall effect, preserve agency for recalled users) is signaled by paragraph two. Pressure escalates through Jory's plea → Mara's empirical test → recall agents' arrival → tunnel expedition proving utility → company buyout attempt. The final refusal carries professional and legal risk, foreclosing the safe path. Jory's agency is genuine (he volunteers, navigates by markers), and Mara's protocol offer is her own tactical pivot. However, the recall agents' "polite threats" and company lawyer encounter lack on-page friction; the conflict resolution feels compressed rather than tested, capping escalation credit.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: mapping what sleep will not, crystallized as "become the voice of the unknown." Pressure tightens causally: tide seals exit → fossil floats → Mina follows into deeper passage → handprints reveal non-human presence → she speaks aloud and is guided to escape. Agency is clear (she chooses to follow the fossil, to speak, to leave it behind), and the final act—singing the cave its own name—forecloses the path of neutral observation with visible cost (solitary communion, relinquishing the maternal object). One meaningful deepening transforms her from cataloger to co-voice.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—unscrambling the prophecy to empower the workers—is signaled early and pursued consistently. However, escalation is accumulative rather than a tightening that narrows options: Lysa sorts, listens, invites, catalogs, without a moment where failure or opposition forces her to choose between competing paths. The foreman's seizure attempt arrives at the end and is deflected off-page by collective action, robbing the climax of individual agency and visible cost. The prophecy's resolution feels additive (more voices = clearer echo) rather than earned through a protagonist decision that forecloses a live alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is fixing the relay/mending courage; signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening: Rina's discovery of Elsi's paralysis, the radio repair, and the broadcast that saves villages. Rina's agency drives each beat (codes, solder, frequency tuning), and the cost—her burned status unresolved, the pillbox left as vow—is legible on the page. The escalation is accumulative rather than causal-reversal, fitting the inferred lens, and the price shapes the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—recover Mara—is signaled early and tightens when the gutter-tick countdown begins. Rowan's demand that Senn strip the promise to "names, not seals" is agency that narrows options and forces cost. The fog's release of Mara after Senn's confession is earned by the setup. Visible price: Senn's admission, Rowan's anger transformed but not erased.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: understanding why places resist change. Pressure escalates through accumulative density (fractured shadows, overlapping timelines) and tightens when Galen meets Sera, whose dual states embody the fracture. The final act—rotating the lantern by sun patterns—narrows options: the oasis must choose a timeline, and the cost (loss of refuge, crumbling combs) is legible on the page. One meaningful tightening is present, driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—validate vertical-garden instincts beyond flowers—signals early and tightens through one key choice: kneeling beside the cage to reflect light, which narrows options and exposes Mara to disaster. The scratch-mark discovery and radio call escalate under the Accumulative lens via a credible agency choice with visible cost (standing "one mistake away"). No antagonist on the page and the smuggler truck is stopped off-stage, lowering confrontation pressure slightly. The ending forecloses retreat with felt cost scaled to this length.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—translating isolation into independence—is signaled early and tightens through the curator's request, the stone-circle encounter, and the transcription choice. The hum-to-script reversal narrows options: the narrator must stop resurrecting the extinct and learn coexistence. Agency is embodied in speaking aloud, copying with errors, and choosing imperfect permanence over brittle perfection. Cost is visible: wrinkled pages, acknowledged errors, and the emotional forfeit of redemption ("without needing it to forgive me"). One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (finding connection/the thread) is signaled early and tightens through the day's confessions until Arin's arrival forces the narrator to choose between secrecy and honesty. The turn—admitting the withheld letter—is driven by protagonist agency and forecloses the hidden path with visible relational cost. Pressure coheres under the Hybrid lens; the accumulative texture (public confessions) feeds the causal pivot. One meaningful escalation, one felt price, clear agency at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether to silence the signal or answer it—is signaled early and tightens when Mara recognizes the trickster pattern. Her decision to send a subsonic countercurrent is protagonist-driven and narrows options: she risks exposing her tactic to both factions. The beacon's attempt to reassert and then slip along her false map constitutes a meaningful reversal. The cost is visible (she locks the door, defies both manager and chair, surrenders her recordings), though the final beat's explanatory mode slightly softens the felt price. One deepening turn is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (uncover the vital key) is signaled early and drives action. Escalation tightens when the wall hinges inward, forcing the compass-point strike that opens a seam—a meaningful choice with immediate cost (fear recalibrated, seam grudgingly given). The mentor's revelation redefines the key from object to consent, and the final planting forecloses the prison-state with visible consequence (corridors snap apart, mentor released). One substantive reversal and one deepening occur under the Accumulative lens; pressure coheres through the organ's pulse and spatial resistance. Cost is conceptual but legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (reconstruct vanished dancers to "awaken dormant empathy") is signaled early but remains abstract until the shed confrontation. One meaningful tightening occurs when the ribbon on the wall lance narrows Maren's options, but the escalation bypasses embodied resistance: the protagonist's pencil gesture is metaphorical ("lance the air...to pierce the rehearsed story"), and Maren's shoulders sag without a fought choice. Cost is declared ("unite guilt with grief") rather than paid through visible trade-offs or foreclosed paths. The investigation coheres under the Causal lens, but the climax substitutes symbolic gesture for pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—restoring Elias Kline's name—is signaled early and drives all major beats. The piece delivers one meaningful tightening when Mara places the copper nail on Sato's desk, which unlocks the annex and proof. The escalation is Causal and driven by Mara's agency (parsing, climbing, confronting, unlocking). The cost is conceptual and legible: the sacrifice can "someday be undone," and Mara's dread drains as she sends the correction. The pressure coheres and narrows options under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—finding refuge from a traumatic past and legal constraints—is signaled early and coheres through the discovery sequence. Pressure tightens once (finding the camera, deciding to expose oneself), but the escalation lacks a meaningful trade-off or visible cost: the protagonist follows clues without internal friction, and the self-exposure decision arrives as a smooth epiphany rather than a choice that forecloses another path. Coincidence (the flake fitting the lock, the hitchhiker reappearing) complicates but does not resolve, yet agency remains passive. One tightening without clear cost places this in mid-6s under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—understanding why paths loop and escaping that pattern—is signaled early and tightens when LoopLine's algorithm traps real users ("complaints sounded like sirens in my skull"). The protagonist's agency drives escalation: he reopens the train, marks territory, dissuades rivals, realizes the bills record repetitions, and ultimately lays new markers to break the loop. The final act forecloses the inherited pattern with visible cost (startup collapsed, venture path abandoned). One structural weakness: the lawsuit/collapse happens off-page in summary, muting what could be a sharper turn; the rival crew encounter reads as a mid-story demonstration rather than a raising of external stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—decode before erasure—is signaled in the opening third. The piece tightens once: the narrator enters the lucid dream, decodes the star-timing inscriptions, and translates them for Nera, which enables the temple rite. The rite itself (two witnesses, speaking and listening) is the on-page cost that forecloses solitary mourning. Pressure accumulates under the Accumulative lens through the observatory → dream → translation → temple sequence. However, the middle turn (the dream decode) feels more revelatory than contested; the narrator succeeds without visible friction or trade-off, and the cost materializes only at the rite. One meaningful deepening is present, but escalation feels modest.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: discover the frozen confession and break the curse. Pressure tightens when Thalen descends, finds the twin and the hungry plant, and must reverse the mirror-cage to free the apology. The choice to plant the second seed and sing the war-chant is causal and narrows options—no other path is offered. Cost is visible: the twin thaws, the vortex stops, and Thalen stands between guards with the confession paid for. One meaningful escalation under the Causal lens is sufficient; the lack of a second reversal or internal dilemma keeps this from higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake signaled early: "to find the intersection of dreams... where my mother's sleep meets the place she vanished." One clear tightening: the visionary's demand "the covenant can open it only if you offer a wound" narrows Lysa's options to a blood-price, and she acts. The climax—tracing her scar until it bleeds, touching blood to seal—is protagonist-driven agency with visible cost (pain, shared wound). The overlapping dreams "began to tear at one another like dogs" raises immediate jeopardy. Minor slip: the linked dreamers' chorus appears suddenly to "stitch the crack with a living thread" without prior establishment of their collective power; the mechanism feels convenient rather than earned by prior constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (Jory's wholeness) is signaled in paragraph seven and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira discovers the harvested thread, narrowing her options from "demand the trade be mended" to accepting a new, harsher bargain. Agency is choice: she rejects the broker's "cruel option" of stealing a stranger's destiny and instead offers her own ability to forget pain, with visible cost that forecloses the path of future relief. The escalation is causal (first trade slipped → discovery of theft → second trade with permanent cost) and the final price is legible: she will carry all pain forward without reprieve.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring professional credibility after public failure—tightens when the protagonist shifts from defensive cataloging to meaningful documentation, narrowing options from self-protection to vulnerable connection. The reversal occurs when "the more I stared at it, the more I heard the old after-applause hush," forcing engagement with avoided loss. Agency is clear: the overnight work request, the cross-referenced report draft, the choice to tell Marla about a listening station rather than hide behind jargon. Cost is visible in the abandoned appraiser armor and the acceptance that "purpose was not applause but what you do after it." One escalation beat (pinning cloth, drafting report, delivering findings) creates sufficient pressure for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake signaled early: can the physics of transition be understood without trapping the dead? One meaningful tightening: Nerin's ambition rises again to chase warmth, the arbor's field snaps a warning, and he chooses to let the light pass—narrowing options from possession to observation with visible cost (he plants the seed rather than holding it). Agency is renunciation that forecloses chasing spirits back. The stakes remain abstract ("comprehension" vs. "madness") more than viscerally immediate; foregrounding a sharper trade-off at the peak beat would lift this into the 8s.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—preserve wonder in routine when tomorrow is absent—is signaled early and tightened through the smelting invention, which moves from problem (repetition souring) to ritual solution. The creel use evolves from relic to active fishing tool, and the climactic reading-aloud of Lio/Liora's contradictory lives dramatizes acceptance. The narrator's agency culminates in receiving a new name and continuing the wade, foreclosing the need to remember origin. Cost is visible: forgotten identity, sustained effort, and the acceptance of perpetual flux. However, the escalation is primarily additive (new practices layered in) rather than a sharpening conflict with clear tradeoffs; the city's participation feels cooperative rather than testing the narrator's method under opposing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Mara certifies bunkers while "the surface towns argued about who deserved shelter," and the widower's confession introduces the interpersonal cost of isolation. One meaningful tightening occurs when the widower leads Mara to the caves and explains the pearl's function, narrowing the choice to whether she will use it. However, escalation is largely handed to Mara by the pearl's latent radiance rather than driven by her agency under pressure; she asks about the pearl, listens, recites confessions, and the pearl does the work. The final act—crowning the entrance—feels more like enacting a provided solution than a trade-off with visible cost. No persistent constraint (time, resource, social cost) visibly alters her tactics or the widower's stance on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—finding a path to self-forgiveness for the inspection failure that contributed to the brother's drowning—is signaled early and tightens when the graffiti reveals the grid number matching the skipped intake gate. The protagonist's agency drives escalation: the choice to follow the tunnel, play the accordion, photograph the latch, and send the report with name attached all narrow options and foreclose the evasion path. Visible cost is legible: the act "does not bring my brother back" but stops future harm, and the protagonist must accept ongoing surveillance rather than arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—recovering his voice by finding the library and decoding its cipher—is signaled early and sustained. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure builds through the propagation-delay decoding process and deepens when the cipher spells his own name and points him to the unsent apology. The tightening is meaningful: realizing "the library stored the words people refused to release" narrows his quest from external search to internal reckoning. However, protagonist agency is limited; the library reveals rather than the dreamer forcing a choice under competing costs. The resolution (mailing the apology) is earned but arrives without a visible on-page sacrifice—no moment shows what he gives up by speaking.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake signaled early: certify the relic versus protect the orchards from being cut for cannonwood. One meaningful tightening occurs when the figs pulse terror and Liora sees the burnt roots, forcing her to choose between imperial approval and living things propagating without permission. The coffee-stain futures (crown split by white gap, Sorell taking blame) narrow her options before the envoy arrives. Agency is decision with on-page cost: she tells the truth, opens the hatch, smuggles the violin, and leaves the report blank—forecloses the imperial path with visible threat. The price is legible in the envoy's curdled smile and Sorell's potential blame.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.1)
    One dominant stake—capturing Orin's final spark before oblivion—drives the entire arc. The ritual's escalation (unpacking tools, placing the chip, drawing circles, counting crackles) tightens coherently under the Accumulative lens, and Mara's final decision to release rather than hoard the spark constitutes a meaningful deepening of her stance. However, the stakes remain largely internal and abstract; no live obstacle or counterpressure tests her agency, and the cost of her choice (what she loses by not keeping the spark) is felt more as philosophical acceptance than as a trade-off with visible consequence on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—finding contentment's source after forgiving her brother—is signaled early and tightens when the grotto pool reweights emptiness as furrow, enabling Mara's shift from seeking to cultivating. The vision of her brother arriving with saplings provides a future scenario that she can now meet with work rather than pardon alone, a meaningful deepening. One cap: the peak choice (assigning him replanting duty) is referenced as future action in the vision rather than dramatized on the page with present cost, so the escalation reads more as thematic reconfiguration than immediate tactical trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: will Mara deliver the easy permission Sile wants, or risk honesty? One meaningful tightening occurs when the chimes warn against certainty and the mirror shows her past clients, narrowing her options from "sell the story" to "wear the cloak and speak truth." The escalation is accumulative rather than causal-turn driven, aligning with the inferred lens. Agency is present—Mara's decision to wrap the cloak around herself and later to tell Sile the honest warning. Cost is legible: she forfeits the easy transaction and takes on the burden of the cloak ("a promise to keep questioning for both of them"). No coincidence resolves the conflict; the choice is hers.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—learning the vanishing technique before Sato loses language—is clear and present throughout. Pressure accumulates through instruction (pond patterns), revelation (grotto history), and trance immersion; the protagonist's agency is receptive but purposeful. One meaningful tightening occurs when Sato reveals he must teach now or lose the capacity ("before his mouth could only cry"), which forecloses delay. The cost is legible: Sato vanishes into youth, foreclosing his ability to teach again, and the narrator inherits responsibility. The escalation under an Accumulative lens works, but the final turn (Sato's disappearance) happens off-stage during the narrator's trance, reducing immediate felt pressure at the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—learning to navigate by thought and tone—is signaled in paragraph one. Pressure accumulates through the ritual: appraising the arrowhead, climbing the tower, waiting for the birds, tuning the hum to their angles. One meaningful tightening occurs when the wandering pulse slides into his humming and he "sees" the far canyon mouth, then sends his resonance along it. Agency is present in his refusal to chase grief-sounds and his choice to stay still. The cost is time, patience, and the discipline of listening rather than acting—felt but not urgently visceral. No antagonist or reversal is required under the Accumulative lens, and the ending reweights options with a credible new capability.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (finding sacred meaning beyond automation) is signaled early and tightens once: unstrapping the harness mid-climb is a visible forfeit that narrows options and forces trust in mist walking. The terrace confrontation with the automaton deepens pressure by forcing a stance crystallization (leaving the keystone versus retrieving it), and Davin's final action forecloses the path of possession with on-page cost. Under the Accumulative lens, escalation reads as a cadence shift from ascent to confrontation to renunciation. One issue: the automaton's mid-stair prayer offer is a micro-reversal that dissipates without compounding, slightly diluting the final turn's inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—to discover the color of sound—is signaled early and remains live throughout the descent. The key-tag find initiates the quest, the underwater passage tightens access and air constraints, and the vow's utterance produces the violet answer, narrowing the protagonist's future path to service rather than solitary pursuit. However, the escalation lacks a true reversal or forced trade-off; the luminous vow functions more as a reward than a costly choice, and no live option is visibly foreclosed until the final commitment, which arrives swiftly. One meaningful deepening occurs (the honesty-as-lens realization), but pressure feels more accreted than sharpened under crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—wavelength align with purpose to send a signal through contracting walls—is signaled early and tightens when the backwards prophecy "becomes personal," forcing Mara to choose split-dish despite strain and doubt. The tightening forecloses the core-vs-rim binary and raises cost (cracked bearings, thin reserves, possibility of "hearing its own ghosts"). Agency culminates in locking the transmitter and distilling fuel into a single capacitor burn, a renunciation of safety with visible cost (trembling deck, crew stares). The prophecy complicates rather than resolves; Mara's choice to act despite uncertainty drives closure.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake is clear early: to give names to nameless fears in order to ease grief. Pressure accumulates through the Accumulative lens as each recording yields a crystallized name that softens terror ("the sea monster...shrank to a mere wave curl"). One meaningful tightening: when the reaper's own chest loosens after naming the cook, proving the method works on their personal grief. The final act of tucking the crystal under the blank ocean forecloses the path of carrying these specific deaths as raw wounds. Agency is present: the reaper chooses to angle mirrors, write names, and preserve discoveries for future keepers.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is signaled early and sustained: right the cosmic imbalance that stopped the fish. Evin's agency is clear—he chooses to rebuild the bell to the drip's rhythm, waits for the exact interval, rings it timed to the pattern he measured. The steward's laughter tests his brittle devotion (a micro-reversal), but the basin's indifference reassures him. Escalation: from broken bell to repaired bell to the ringing that elicits the distant answer and the silver ripple. The cost is legible: fish don't return, only a "promise," and Evin must leave the bell to keep counting, trusting incomplete resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—truth versus institutional expungement—is signaled early and tightens through the photograph trail. The boot print discovery is a clear micro-reversal that narrows options: Mara can no longer deny the evacuation was incomplete. Her final decision to display evidence forecloses the silence her father maintained, with visible cost to his reputation and her inherited role. The escalation is meaningful but relatively smooth; the piece would benefit from one additional on-page moment of hesitation or friction before the town meeting decision.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—achieving the council-demanded transformation—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when Liora cannot settle the heat/time ratio by calculation alone, forcing her to interpret the starlings' flight. However, escalation is modest: her hands shake, but the orchard immediately supplies solutions (the starlings, the perfect hearth, spring water). The resolution arrives without on-page trade-off or visible price; she succeeds cleanly, and the narrative does not test her commitment through competing pressures or force a choice that forecloses an option. Agency is present in her decision to watch the birds and "let intuition set the rhythm," but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—preserve trust in the flight chain under pressure from a cargo thief—is signaled early and drives all tactics. One meaningful tightening occurs when the buckle-check confirms the impostor, forcing the trap revision; this forecloses the option of simple accusation and raises the cost of error. Agency is decision (revising coordinates, keying the real Nine, binding the clerk) with visible consequence (trust returns, clerk bound for judgment). The choice to speak truth publicly rather than let the clerk fall demonstrates moral calculus with felt cost, though the resolution feels assured once the impostor is caught.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake: proving personhood and escaping the custody battle's ownership logic. The trial demand on the dojo edge tightens pressure, and the protagonist's paired motion (push/pull, protect/risk) forces the factions into shared breath, which shifts the outcome. The escalation is clear under an Accumulative lens, but the cost at closure—what the protagonist or factions lose by forming co-guardianship—is more conceptual than visceral. The clone body's animation from "attention without ownership" introduces a mechanism late, softening the protagonist's direct agency in the final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: restore lost laughter to break the household's airtight grief. Escalation under Accumulative/Textural lens: Bram progresses from lining blowers to singing the lullaby, hearing the giggle, realizing it's trapped in grime, macerating the pulp, lifting it into mist, facing the unspoken shapes, and finally extracting the laugh that ricochets free. Each step tightens the ritual and raises sensory/emotional intensity. The mist-shapes ("the argument before the pool party, the unreturned apology, the slammed door") add psychological pressure and force Bram to "conduct harder, letting the blowers roar…daring the tunnel to say what his family could not." Cost is visible: Bram's secrecy isolates him further, and placing the handle on the windowsill signals readiness to repeat the ritual rather than confront grief directly. One reversal: the giggle is trapped, requiring the maceration step.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is dimensional homesickness seeking resolution; pressure coheres as the pendant tries to widen the vision into passage. One meaningful tightening: the guardian lunges to tear the pendant away, and the protagonist's choice to wait at the edge shifts tactics from individual escape to shared renunciation. Visible cost is the forfeiture of the impossible home and the pendant's power (it becomes dull). Agency is shared decision and endurance under the Accumulative lens. No antagonist required; the "living boundary" provides situational pressure that complicates without resolving through convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.1)
    One dominant stake is signaled early: interrupting the charter that chains Mara. The crozier's transformation narrows options (no return to obedience) and the seal-breaking is an on-page reversal driven by protagonist agency. Mara admits fear yet acts, and Jun's hesitation briefly complicates before resolution. The cost is legible—risk of punishment, loss of the old future—but the furnace's collapse feels slightly convenient, lowering the escalation charge by a notch.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—salvage a pattern to map "what might start next"—is signaled early. Pressure tightens when Mara hears the "door shutting" break and follows the gap past expected frequencies; this narrows her options and forces a trade-off: dismantle the tallest mast (agency-driven) to reconfigure the city. The cost is legible: one tower lost to the gorge, a page torn from the notebook, and the villages will "hear nothing for a while." No antagonist, but the council's prior lock-down and the city's scrapping deadline supply external friction. One meaningful escalation under Causal lens; no need for multiple reversals at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—stopping ferry vanishments by merging timelines—is signaled early and tightens when Lina realizes "the seam could be stitched, but only by matching patterns exactly." Her agency drives the escalation: she climbs back, radios the code, and waits as the transmission aligns. The reversal (ferries shudder, sand appears, clocks straighten, commuters blink) is earned by her action. Cost is legible: she accepts "whatever now was" and commits to "keep working it," foreclosing any return to a single, stable timeline. The older self's nod ("not like strangers, but a workman's nod") underscores the enduring labor required.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake signaled early: discover the texture of connection when words fail. One meaningful tightening occurs when the mirror/maze traps the protagonist, forcing the structural solution to erupt. The eruption narrows options (sinew doesn't fall, it rises into new geometry) and the cost is legible: memories alter again, but the lattice anchors what might be lost. Agency is clear (yanking the mirror, choosing eruption). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens through pattern deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—learning starlight navigation before the next alien signal—is signaled early and tightens through Mara's request for ascent. The surface test constitutes a meaningful escalation: she fixes position without a beacon, foreclosing reliance on sonar. Cost is visible ("grief and wonder braided together," the risk of one tide window) but remains modest in consequence; the council grants permission readily, and no live option is permanently lost. The piece deepens understanding more than it narrows choices, fitting an accumulative-textural mode with a single decisive intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—preventing Eli from succumbing to the dead voice—is signaled early and tightens in the stairwell confrontation. Mara's choice to sit beside him rather than grab him, then to name the traced connections and revise the photograph's meaning, shows protagonist agency that narrows options. The hearing aid pulses provide escalation cues. However, the resolution hinges partly on Mara's exposition about what the dead can "only repeat" and the living can "revise," which borders on convenience; the voice retreating feels more facilitated by explanation than by a dramatized, costly trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—repair the cable to honor Ken and prevent the coast's erasure—is clear from paragraph four. Tidal clock and claustrophobia apply persistent pressure. One major tightening: the collapsed corridor forces the phase-transition gambit, narrowing options to vapor-passage or retreat. Agency is pure: Mara chooses to enter the gap, power the coil, clamp the joint, and route the log. Cost is visible (terror, physical exertion, foreclosed safety) and scales appropriately for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: defragmenting Mara's bureaucratic erasure by repairing Lyle's fragmented code through the ink ritual. The spiral drawing and Lyle's instructions tighten pressure ("my memory is fragmented…so we will defragment together"), narrowing options to this ephemeral-pattern method. The file that rewrites the ledger and the annotated-mistakes archive arrive as closure moves with visible cost: Mara stops counting, a renunciation of the denial reflex. One meaningful tightening (the ink ritual's irreversibility and Lyle's guide) escalates under the Accumulative lens. Agency is clear: Mara's strokes and the decision to stop counting foreclose the prior defensive stance.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (preserve Vey's texture-words as sound before all speakers die) is signaled early and tightens through Toma's inability to name velvet versus bark. Escalation is Accumulative: Ilen progresses from single-word experiments (roughness) to silk/grit pairs timed to bird-flight, then to the crisis night when unpatterned repeats threaten uniformity. Agency drives resolution: Ilen enters alone, uses his own body as tuning fork, and aligns breathing to the late flock's spiral—choices that foreclose easier paths (waiting for ideal conditions, relying on others). Visible cost: Toma's death, the risk that the diamond's hunger will erase faster than death, and years passing until "no living person could speak Vey from birth." One tightening moment (the curse shows itself as hunger) narrows options with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: prevent Jonas from becoming a doorway for the Pulling Choir. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mara and Edda lure Jonas into the garden and plant the arrowhead, forcing his choice to offer bitterness rather than vanish. The escalation is visible (music thickens, pots lift, shadow peels), and Jonas's agency—speaking into the phone, making bitterness the punchline—drives the resolution under the Hybrid lens. However, the Pulling Choir remains abstract; its pressure is atmospheric rather than a force with tactics that adapt to protagonist moves, and the gravity "hiccup" reads as convenient coincidence rather than earned consequence of Jonas's decision.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—reawaken beauty vs. mechanical control—signals early and tightens when Lio finds the tree chained. One meaningful escalation: matching pulse to tree → amplified drone → tree uproots → struggle with statues. Agency is clear: Lio's knocking patterns and heartbeat trigger the tree's response. Cost is legible: "Stone hands seized Lio, yet the statues could not hold both him and the moving trunk." The price of confrontation alters the final image—statues now follow rather than police. Minor: the statues' shift from antagonist to follower reads swift; a beat showing their internal friction would have sharpened the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: Ivo's search for where broken promises heal, braided with Nela's immediate need. The smuggler confrontation is a clear escalation driven by Ivo's agency (blocking the stairwell, uncorking the bottle, negotiating passage). The drone-reply beat narrows options (mother's directions, tomorrow's gate crossing). Cost is visible: he risks treason and shoulders foster responsibility. One meaningful tightening (linking absences to missing block to smuggler timing) forces the rooftop choice. The thunderstorm intervention feels somewhat convenient but is primed early.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (interpreting silence as possibility after it ruined his life) signals early and tightens when Rowan chooses the wrong turn over the exit, a decision with immediate risk. The repair work deepens pressure: using the fragment transforms the task from routine carpentry into a threshold moment. Singing—shaped breath rather than words—becomes the protagonist's agency that forecloses the old relationship with silence. The cost is visible: his voice returns not as speech but as a constrained medium, and the train stirs in response, reweighting what "possibility" means.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—finding where stories live—is signaled in paragraph six and tightens through Mara's geometric plotting, the bookcase discovery, and her guiding the young patron to the bent aisle. Agency is clear: Mara's measurements and hand rotation unlock the pocket, and her choice to guide patrons is a renunciation of private hoarding with felt cost ("her own loneliness had been a kind of closed system"). The patron's dream feedback provides a visible consequence. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through increasing density (scarf → measurement → discovery → guidance). One on-page reversal (from suspicion to confirmation via the opened bookcase) and one deepening (from discovery to sharing) are sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake: recapture the runaway dream before it dissolves. Pressure accumulates through repeated attempts—palette fills with dawn-color, prints yield "hints," then a silhouette appears on the horizon. One meaningful tightening: Mina scrapes the figure's light into "the deepest well" and feels it throb, escalating her method to "vitalize the cipher." The climax turn—photograph within photograph, doorway forms, figure speaks—is driven by her choice to aim the camera at the cipher during sunrise. Cost is visible: she must release the dream rather than possess it, photographing the "empty space it left." Minor friction: the middle beats (skimming light, developing prints, fishermen weeping) cycle without a sharp narrowing of options until the final sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—freeing the trapped idea—is signaled early and pursued through the locksmith encounter. The ritual sequence (hair into pool, naming Altair, silver comma click, speaking constellation names) provides one meaningful deepening: the protagonist moves from silence to voice. Agency is present but passive-adjacent; the locksmith's questions and tools guide each step, reducing the protagonist's own tactical adaptation. The warning at the end ("fear will try new locks") acknowledges future cost but does not show a live on-page trade-off that narrows immediate options. Escalation reads as deepening rather than tightening—pressure accumulates through ritual density, not narrowed choices.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: recover stolen memories. The pressure accumulates through her decades-long search, learning to dive, and the descent to the greenhouse. The key tightening occurs when she realizes the ring is a latch and chooses to pluck the mushroom without counting—a visible act that forecloses her old habit and opens the path to restoration. The cost is legible: she breaks her protective ritual and commits to annual dives. However, the escalation feels more textural than causal; the sailor's tip and the notebook's presence are convenient rather than hard-won, and the Ring Court's mechanics are told more than tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is Mara's reversible exile; secondary is Lio's commitment to mentor despite hating the tribunal's cynicism. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: Mara's initial scoff, her shaking fingers, her wobbling letters, then her choice of the afraid angle. One meaningful tightening occurs when her strokes stop shaking and the shadow straightens into a door. Agency is clear—Mara selects the mirror shard, annotates with care, speaks her name—and the tag falling is visible cost. Escalation is modest but sufficient for this length; the piece deepens rather than reverses. Minor gap: the consequence of failure is told ("the exile becomes permanent") but never tested on the page, so the stakes feel declared rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—restoring Nela's health and the narrator's creative color—is signaled early and coheres under the Accumulative lens. Pressure tightens when Soren asks for "one thing I feared to give" and the narrator admits losing blue, narrowing options to crossing the threshold. The climax drawing action produces the impossible fruit with visible cost (the narrator's fear harvested into essence). However, the escalation lacks a second meaningful reversal or complication; the sequence from admission to crossing to drawing to cure proceeds without significant resistance or trade-off that forecloses another path. The cost is felt but the tightening is single-step.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—freeing the storm-spirit to ground wandering dead—is signaled early and sustained. The knot-unraveling sequence provides one meaningful tightening when the protagonist learns the spirit is their ancestor, forcing a trade-off between vow and liberation. Agency is clear in the choice to speak the true name and stitch the breath into the mask. Cost is legible: the family vow is broken, the ancestor is bound anew (though voluntarily), and the protagonist forecloses the hush-feeding pattern. Escalation under the Accumulative lens succeeds through density increase (each knot releases sound, spirits gather, starlight wraps wrists). Minor gap: the spirits' restlessness and the protagonist's courage faltering feel declared more than tested through competing on-page pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—interpreting silence with empathy to honor erased lives—is signaled early and coheres throughout. The investigation tightens through layered discovery: map tear → video shadows → henge seam → vault alcove → parish records. However, escalation relies on accumulation rather than a visible choice under pressure that narrows options or imposes cost. The climax ("she sat on the damp floor, let the silence settle, and practiced the craft") is reflective summary, not a dramatized decision with competing goods or felt forfeiture. The archivist's initial resistance vanishes off-page, and Lena's final framing choice—though thematically apt—arrives without visible struggle or trade-off that would ground the cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: "to understand the physics of letting go." The tightening occurs when the narrator connects Earhart's question about release to Vaughn's answer, then makes the choice to let the reel drift free—a renunciation that forecloses the path of public discovery. Agency is clear (decision to release evidence) with opportunity cost implied but not dramatically felt. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens through layered discoveries. No explicit antagonist; coincidence (finding the reel) complicates but does not resolve. The escalation is more deepening than reversal, sufficient for this length but without a sharp turn that narrows options under fire.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (articulate unspoken needs through encoded graffiti) signaled early and tightens through the ghost's urgency before thunder erases the moment. One meaningful deepening: Lio realizes the ghost wants routing, not resurrection, which narrows his choice to committing as a quiet carrier. The tightening forecloses the alternative (resurrecting the ghost's voice) with visible cost: Lio accepts perpetual silence and walking. Agency is decision and endurance; the final glyph and promise constrain future paths.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—Lysa's desire to be more than a carrier of secrets—is signaled early and tightens when the diary addresses her by name at floor six, then escalates when she must act on the captain's instructions to stop a conspiracy. Agency is clear: her decision to unfold the wire, read the code, and pull the brake forecloses the path of passive service with visible cost (she evades danger, climbs stairs, and accepts the magistrate's praise without promotion enthusiasm). One meaningful reversal: the diary shifts from captain's grief journal to conspiracy warning. Pressure coheres under the causal lens and narrows options at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (survival after the tether snaps) is signaled immediately. One meaningful tightening: Mara's gamble with the dropped telescope narrows options under the Accumulative lens—if the "remembered corridor" fails, the storm swallows them. Agency is decision and renunciation (risking Juno's telescope to prove atmospheric memory), with visible cost: the instrument could be lost. The supercell "Fury" and dead radios escalate pressure. The resolution is earned by Mara's prior pattern-building and her willingness to test Juno's axiom. Minor gap: the tower's sudden carrier-wave response feels slightly soft; one more sentence showing the haze's effect on signal propagation would tighten causality.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: complete the ceiling map before demolition while preserving the hidden book. The coin puzzle tightens pressure by requiring fractal translation under time constraint. One meaningful deepening: discovering the book reweights her task from commission to philosophical acceptance—she must honor both the guild's secrecy and her own limits. Agency is clear: she translates the code, paints the sky, negotiates five more minutes, and seals the safe. The foreman's pause and the first hammer strike land as visible cost. No reversals required under the Accumulative lens; the single tightening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—chart the next great discovery—is signaled early and remains clear. Pressure tightens when Lio realizes the hopscotch spirals match the starlings' arrow and discovers Yara's secret chart, narrowing his path toward the unmapped glare. The escalation is driven by Lio's agency (greeting the light, tracing patterns, opening the phrasebook), and the engines waking represent a meaningful turn. However, the cost of steering into a region "marked only with old warnings of glare" is declared rather than viscerally felt; no visible sacrifice or foreclosed option lands hard enough to enter the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (learn repair, mend father's clock without stealing) is signaled early. Pressure tightens when the note warns "Take only what you can return" and deepens when the second scrap instructs "Return by making, not by taking," forcing Mara to file a new gear instead of taking the originals. This meaningful tightening forecloses the easier path with on-page craft cost (time, skill, locksmith picks traded). Agency is clear, but the hall-of-mirrors showing her father's bench feels slightly convenient—coincidence complicating rather than resolving—holding the score below 8.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake (reach the nebula of respite) is signaled early and tightens once when Serren reveals the relay-well route. The work montage ("every beam we raised seemed to attract windblown thorns") gestures at difficulty but remains summary rather than dramatized conflict. The grave-visit beat reweights trust but does not narrow options—the crew's course does not change. At closure, other crews appear conveniently, and the relay opens without on-page resistance or trade-off, undercutting agency and felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—prevent midnight from arriving too early or too late while smuggling mercy into the hush—is signaled early and tightens through Mara's screwdriver adjustments and the puppet's activation. The escalation is accumulative: each beat (loosening the escapement, singing into the puppet, syncing heartbeat to gears) narrows her options and raises the cost until her life becomes the payment. The closure forecloses the path of individual survival with visible cost (her breath, her heartbeat) and reconfigures the doomsday strike into a dimming rather than erasure. Agency is clear and the price unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—guide the travelers before frost turns corridors to mirrors and birds to knives—is signaled early and tightens when the child is found pinned. Agency surfaces in the protagonist's choice to plant the nut and assemble the waystone despite the curse's cost, a decision that enables escape and forecloses solitary refusal. The forty-seven-minute clock and the birds' adaptive confusion create escalating pressure. The resolution is earned by the protagonist's alteration (committing to finish the remaining waystones) with visible cost: "every rescue tightens the curse." One clean reversal: the waystone's song breaks the birds' patrol pattern, opening the path.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is atonement through technical and ethical repair, signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening: foam insight enables a stress-responsive adhesive, which unlocks the settlement/license path and new bridge construction. Agency is clear—Mara drafts the formulation, writes to families, volunteers patent rights, testifies—and each step forecloses comfort (corporate resistance, public exposure). The corporation "balks" and the technician's testimony "cracks the narrative in the right direction," providing a reversal with visible cost. Escalation is modest but coherent; the resolution avoids passive luck. The final walk across the bridge tests her belief under self-imposed scrutiny, completing the arc with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—finding the place where stories begin—is signaled early and ties to the protagonist's erased past. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira presents the parole docket and the task shifts from selling blanks to measuring absence, narrowing options. The incision opens a doorway, and the final discovery that the freed story is the vendor's own origin forecloses the blankness, a credible cost. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens relies heavily on symbolic accumulation rather than a series of narrowing choices or visible trades; the protagonist succeeds without friction, and no live option is dramatized as foreclosed until the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (proving that tasting pain can be turned into craft) is signaled early and escalates when Safi chooses to descend without a guard, then unwraps his hands to accept raw contagion. The tightening is causal: touching the resin floods him with workers' and soldiers' stored shame, forcing him to blend it with his own failures to soften it. Agency drives the turn—he kneels, unwraps, accepts—with visible cost (the first soldier weeps when touched). The broth scene completes the transformation by distributing controlled doses, teaching containment rather than spread.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (rehabilitate Nine, construct bridges), but pressure does not meaningfully tighten. Mara's petitions have been dismissed, yet when she rings the storm bell farmers arrive and comply without dramatized resistance or competing agendas. The mayor's appearance at dawn is coincidental rather than earned by Mara's agency. Elevator Nine's cooperative testimony and the rapid, successful repair grant Mara complete goal achievement without a trade-off or visible cost. The piece declares escalation ("tender, vigorous decision," "she would do it before sunrise") but does not dramatize a moment where success narrows options or forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Nira's need to sort entangled memories without losing "the threads that mattered"—is signaled early and tightens when the mirror reveals the hospital corridor and her mother's face. The modification of the copper helix and the synaptic plasticity rehearsals are on-page tactical choices. However, escalation is more conceptual than visceral: no external opposition tests her method, no memory threatens to overwrite her identity in real time, and the ending's "ready to excavate" posture is future-facing rather than a paid cost. The piece delivers one meaningful deepening (mother reveal reframes inheritance), but agency is more cognitive than decisional, and the cost remains oblique—she accepts entanglement but doesn't visibly forfeit a path or relationship on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (find forgotten combinations before smugglers/kings) is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful escalation: the door test (SOW, WATCH, RETURN) that transforms his vigilance seeds from habit into keys. Agency is decision and renunciation—he enters knowing memories may rearrange again, a visible cost. Pressure accumulates under the Accumulative lens via the spiral path, lost memories resurfacing, and the final dial discovery. The grotto's threat (feeding on forgetting) remains abstract rather than forcing a live tradeoff between staying and leaving.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: making connection audible in a mute world. One meaningful tightening occurs when Lysa presses the carved block to the insulator and the grove "seems to sway"—a turn from failed sound to successful tactile transmission. Agency is renunciation (accepting silence) and endurance (continuing to read cracks), with visible cost in her solitary labor and the neighbors who "avoid looking at one another." The plan to carry this method to the settlement narrows options (she commits to mediation) and forecloses retreat. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens through incremental wire-stringing and the siskins' participation.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding and honoring the covenant before the next moon phase—is signaled early and tightens through Sable's experimental placements. The story delivers one meaningful deepening: his realization that the covenant asks for restraint, not power, which reframes the entire conflict. The council's narrow vote provides on-page cost (political risk, potential enemy mockery), and the choice forecloses the military option. Escalation is more conceptual than visceral; the pressure operates through accumulation of symbolic meaning rather than rising external threat.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—unlock the diary to catalog a new silence—is signaled early and braids with the secondary stake of preventing the misfire. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mara's entry reveals danger, forcing Lio into the square. The watchman's challenge provides a brief reversal, resolved by reading the apology aloud. Agency is present (Lio's choice to tune rather than pry, then to act on the warning), and the cost is the public vulnerability of performing sincerity. However, the watchman's "suspicion softened into attentive hush" resolves a bit too smoothly, reducing the felt price of the intervention.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—obtaining the seed to brew serenity—is signaled early and tightened when the wardens refuse, then deepened when Etsu reveals the flower's ecological role and tests Jun's motive. The bloom scene is the escalation point: Jun must endure the reek and observe without stealing, and her discovery (moths follow decay, serenity is riding motion) changes her understanding. The conditional gift forecloses pure ambition and binds her to reciprocal service, a visible cost. One meaningful tightening (the test) is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—discovering the source of resilience—is signaled early and sustained. The inversion hour provides a timed constraint; following water upward tightens her path. Crossing the hollow threshold deepens pressure through echo-layering and warmth cues. The arrow-tip legend escalates from dismissed superstition to tested tool to revealed origin. However, the climax lacks a decisive reversal or trade-off; Lysa's choice to embed the arrow feels confirmatory rather than a forced renunciation with visible cost, softening escalation impact.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: solve the vanishing plane and break the silence. One clear tightening when the data spiral converges at Dock Twelve, forcing entry into the cylinder. Escalation is agency-driven—lifting the patch as sensor, completing the circuit, then sprinting to ruin the spiral's symmetry. Visible cost: cut fingers, minutes before crew returns, the risk of re-engagement. The forklift cough creates urgency that narrows options. Entering 8+ requires the tightening forecloses a live option; here the investigator's sprint alters tactics under time pressure, meeting that test.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—certifying wonder as essential before music is rationed—is signaled in the opening and drives both the underground expedition and the Council testimony. The chisel-strike crisis (Maera's voice trapped in sculpted silence) provides a meaningful on-page tightening that narrows options: Lio must "do the opposite and unfetter her voice." The bell-playing solution is earned by prior setup (synesthesia, the amber sheet, prism bells), and the Council's weeping and charter represent a visible outcome. However, the victory feels more declarative than costly—Lio acknowledges fragility but does not sacrifice a tangible resource or relationship to secure it, and the return to bell-ringing reads as continuity rather than a stance crystallization that forecloses an alternate path.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (understanding her failure and the pilgrim's loss) is signaled early and drives all choices. One meaningful tightening: playing the flute opens the corridor and forces confrontation with the lost pilgrim. The pilgrim's question and the spiral driftwood deepen her understanding, narrowing her options to accept she "had feared the flute, and feared herself with it." Agency is clear—her choice to play, to listen, to accept help—and the cost is legible: she must acknowledge her deafness and shift from guarding rules to wayfinding. No multi-reversal needed at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (Kestrel's coherence threatened by borrowed personalities) is signaled early and escalates through each print job: first the stranger's fear swap, then the auditors' mass disorientation, finally her own crisis at "the darkest interval." The equation E(x,y)=S(x)−S(y) provides a conceptual constraint that shapes tactics. The final act—printing the blank sheet, pouring out borrowed selves—is protagonist-driven with visible cost (loss of all borrowed voices to recover her own). One meaningful tightening occurs when "every transfer cost her a little coherence," making the price unmistakable before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake: whether Rook can honor Nera's cryptic instruction and his own desire to coax wonder while carrying the grief of her absence. The handover moment tightens when "his fingers would not let go"—a visible hesitation that opens the beat. Mara's refusal to accept the pendant deepens pressure by removing the transactional exit. The cost is legible: Rook relinquishes both the pendant and the hope of Nera's return, choosing to plant rather than possess. One clear escalation under the Hybrid lens; a second micro-turn (the lamplighter's unexpected connection) primes but does not over-complicate.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: understanding the sister's last drive and processing unresolved grief. One meaningful tightening occurs when the narrator hears the sister's voice "weight" in the mirror and realizes "I was the one who had left it unopened"—this deepens from seeking external answers to accepting responsibility for the sealed sorrow. Agency is exercised through attention (naming anger, listening to the mirror, taking the prism home) and renunciation (stopping hatred of the car). The cost is visible: the narrator's assumptions shatter, and she must live with the "truthful lie" told to her parents, carrying the prism as a nightly reminder. Escalation coheres under the Accumulative lens via density and pattern break.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (reach Jun across impossible distance) is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening: the puzzle edges provide direction, unlocking the weaving after three winters of paralysis. The weaving steals her laughter then her voice—escalating cost that narrows options and charges the final act. Yara's agency (pressing the bead, mouthing Jun's name, teaching him the pattern) drives closure. Minor deduction: the arrival of Jun "weeks later" after the weaving succeeds feels coincidentally timed rather than causally motivated by the panel's delivery; the mechanics of how the message compelled him to return remain off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: prevent orchard starvation by stabilizing the arches. Lio's trades with the boulder deepen pressure (each memory slice raises the cost), and his final choice to bury the silk rather than keep it is agency under the Accumulative lens—he forecloses future trades with visible cost. One meaningful tightening occurs when he learns the arches' roots were mined away, narrowing his options to forging new anchors. The magician's return adds a beat but doesn't escalate; Lio's decision was already made off-page, so the handback moment lands as confirmation rather than a live choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—discovering and correcting the withheld truth about Jalen—is signaled early and tightens when the beacon clicks with his call sign. The narrator's agency drives escalation: using the shard to redirect the seam, stepping through universes, and amending the log. Visible cost appears on-page ("the withheld truth lift from my ribs even as its full weight settled"), and the correction forecloses the lie-protected path. The bound-Jalen confrontation compresses motive into a single speech, reducing earned friction, but the stakes remain coherent under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—restoring the beacon to protect the sea lanes—is signaled early and tightens through the radio mast failure, forcing reliance on stones and paper. Noah's agency shows in building cairns, writing the letter, and climbing to repair the lamp; each move forecloses passivity with visible cost (bleeding fingers, exhaustion). The trawler's horn-answer and the lamp's return provide on-page consequence. The pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, deepening through the letter chain and stone messages until the final glow "left his chest sore."

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.2)
    A single dominant stake—warning the coast before the flood—is signaled early and tightens when the narrator's accidental prophecy forces immediate action. The protagonist's agency (redirecting light, creating moving shadows) drives the reversal, and a visible cost (throat raw, routine "unbroken") appears. However, the mayor's clearing of streets and fishermen turning boats occur off-stage via summary, diluting on-page escalation at the climax. The tightening forecloses the path of careless prophecy with a promise to "choose words carefully," meeting the band guardrail for 7+, but the lack of on-page friction or tradeoff during the storm sequence caps higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (learning why stories magnetize) is signaled early and tightened through the sun-trail quest: each dot narrows understanding until the dye jar and morpho spark force the insight that stories stick to service, not volume. Agency is present but muted—Maru follows Eno's guidance more than she drives reversals herself. The vow at the end crystallizes stance with visible cost (accepting caution over chasing light), meeting Accumulative escalation requirements, though the protagonist's active resistance to the lesson is more told than dramatized in high-pressure choices.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—discover what trees witness—is clear, but escalation under the Accumulative lens feels diffuse: the pin-drop tightens silence, the sapling introduces weight, the sextant reveals a hidden route, yet each beat adds texture more than narrowing options. Agency is present (following the sound, setting the sextant, deconstructing stones) but the worker faces little opposition or visible cost on the page. The final reconfiguration (smaller labyrinth leading outward) closes the arc, yet the price paid—municipal defiance, lost job security, exposed dreams—remains conceptual rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (rekindle the dying realm through communal dawn) is signaled early and agency is present—Lysa chooses to weave for villages rather than princes, and her singing pulls the necessary thread. One meaningful tightening occurs when the night "tightens like a collar" during weaving, and the swaddling choice narrows options by binding fragile light to infants. Cost is visible: she trades her own memories and leaves some borrowed yesterdays behind. Weakness: the escalation reads more as accumulation than true pressure—no live resistance, failed attempt, or tactical shift tests Lysa's commitment; the night's opposition is atmospheric rather than forcing adaptive choices.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Lysa's mistake will be punished or reframed—is signaled early and tightens when Marin places the torn invitation halves together, a concrete act that forecloses accusation and opens acceptance. The Archivist's arrival escalates pressure, and Marin's non-argument response (showing the seam) narrows options with visible cost: he risks the Society's secrecy to extend mercy. The final note to himself, "every mistake is a map, if you read with mercy," reconfigures the opening stake (unearth wisdom in a mistake) and closes with felt cost—solitude steadied but not cured. One micro turn (Lysa's accidental test-passing) deepens the premise without requiring multiple reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: resist incremental erasure of memory and community. Pressure tightens when Mina confesses her complicity (signing the complaint), which forecloses the path of passive observation with visible emotional cost. The tea house invitation and guerrilla gardening method escalate from solitary preservation (keeping the loaf) to collective micro-resistance. Sada's offer of "tenuous absolution" and the act of planting wheat constitute agency with consequence. One clear tightening and one deepening choice suffice at this length; the sprout through mortar at the end confirms the stakes remain live.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: preserving luminous vows against oblivion. One meaningful tightening occurs when Ilian must whisper his own promise to stabilize the script, forgoing detachment and accepting personal cost. The courier's fear and the bride's vanishing raise external pressure. Agency is clear (measure, listen, conjure, vow), and the final stance forecloses the path of passive recording. Cost is legible—he becomes entangled in the Archive's mission—but the escalation is gentle, more deepening than reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—capturing proof to thwart the Strake-Lorne deal—is signaled early and tightens through three failed attempts that narrow Mara's options (wax ruined, drunk rigger, groaning pier). The final tightening (knocking over cups to expose Lorne) escalates pressure and forces a choice with visible cost (blood, hiding until dawn). However, the resolution relies on luck (the quartermaster's loyalty, the chaos allowing her to plant the fob unnoticed) rather than a fully earned reversal driven by Mara's prior choices. Coincidence complicates but also solves, preventing 8+ reach.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—learning why some carry weather—is signaled early and pursued on the page. Pressure accumulates as the protagonist follows the ring's pull, encounters the circle, and tastes their converged weather. The decision to join is a tightening that forecloses solitary doubt, but it arrives after exposition rather than through escalating attempts. The cost of joining (becoming a ballot, committing to the carriers' vote) is conceptually present yet not dramatized as a visible tradeoff; agency reads more as acceptance than difficult choice under competing pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—uncorking suppressed creativity before it turns to ash—is signaled early and Mara's descent into the cave tightens pressure through locked door and hidden notebook. The lock-picking with a crystal wedge and canvas provides one meaningful turn, but escalation remains linear: each obstacle yields to her skills without forcing a trade-off between competing goods. The ending's "stage wakes" suggests transformation yet the cost of stepping into the vocation versus staying in the fairground artist role is not dramatized with a visible price that narrows options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—finding where lost conversations go, driven by Lio's silence—is signaled early and tightens through the climb, the hatch unlock, and the conduit revelation. One meaningful escalation: Mara's realization that only candor will reopen the cistern forces her to write an honest admission of dual wants (water and brother), a trade-off with visible emotional cost. The resolution is protagonist-driven (her choice to write plainly) and the cost is legible: she must face Lio with vulnerability rather than accusation, and the water remains conditional on their future exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving wonder against standardization—is signaled early and sustained. The Auditor's arrival creates one meaningful tightening (ledger stone vs. sculpture), but his defeat comes too easily: the cold burns him, he releases, he watches passively. No trade-off or visible price is paid by Lysa; the crowd's conversion happens off-stage in a summary beat. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen through density or pattern break, but the resolution delivers convenience rather than cost.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake is survival of the roses (and by extension, the caretaker's purpose); secondary accent is resolving inner static. The jammed hatch forces a decision—burn or cook—and the controlled burn narrows options visibly: he must walk beside flame, prune sparks, trust containment. Agency is clear: choosing to miniaturize fear into the bead, igniting it inside a ceramic collar, smothering the burn post-vent. Cost is on the page—pruning with a shovel, pinching sparks, risking flame under glass—and the closure plants a cutting over the cooled bead, foreclosing return to unprocessed static. One tightening (hatch forces burn) and one deepening (static thins as fears find proper size) suffice.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.2)
    One dominant stake emerges—solving the mailbox mystery to enable communal healing—but escalation is mild: Mara follows chalk arrows, gathers stories, finds a key, unlocks a panel. No meaningful tightening or trade-off appears; the developer's truck idles passively rather than forcing a live choice. The resolution arrives through discovery rather than agency under pressure, and no visible price is paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is legible early: liberate detainees without triggering alarms. One meaningful tightening occurs when the guardian cuts lights and demands an access key, forcing Lyra to dance the answer and reroute alarms—a reversal that narrows options and raises cost. Agency is present (she spins the wheel, scribbles final entries, leads researchers out), and the resolution is earned by her layered encryption. However, the escalation feels more procedural than visceral; each obstacle is met with a pre-planned cipher layer rather than a desperate improvisation that forecloses a live alternative. Cost is visible (she leaves the journal, exits into night tide) but the trade-off lacks the sharp sting of a forced sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—retrieve deleted memories—signals early and tightens through the coffee-ground reading, the saltworks infiltration, and the choice to break the council's seal. The exhumation narrows options (defying the story of mercy) and the beach ritual delivers visible cost: the parasite stirs, pockets snap shut, ordinary grief returns. One pressure gap: the council's potential opposition is declared but never dramatizes resistance, leaving the escalation slightly unopposed in the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—hush the prophecy before factions weaponize it—is signaled early. The prophecy rising from the brook creates one meaningful complication: erasing it would silence the warning about poisoned wells. Liora's choice to filter rather than erase narrows options and shows agency, but the execution feels more like insight than a forced trade-off; no live opposition tests her resolve on the page. The final act (guiding the wings to meet, carrying the warning privately) reads as a decisional deepening but lacks a visible price paid in the moment—patrols arrive after she's gone, so no immediate consequence materializes.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—save the Dovetail from demolition—is signaled early and tightens when the inspector schedules the final walk-through. The narrator's agency drives escalation: interrogating Ilyas, stamping clay, following stone sentences, slipping documents. One credible reversal occurs when the sealed box of permits is discovered, transforming the narrator's options from rumor to proof. The sleight-of-hand resolution carries risk (landlord could discover, inspector could reject) and visible cost (shared deception, Ilyas's fading). Coincidence (grandmother's seal matching the parapet) complicates rather than resolves; the narrator must still act.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—Mira's refusal to lose her brother twice versus the city's archival mandate—is signaled early and tightens when Sol labels the shell "unregistered memory… must be archived." The compromise (resonance-structure translation) narrows her options with visible cost: she hears the brother's goodbye, then chooses sealing over clinging. One credible reversal (agreement to archive after initial refusal) and the final workshop decision foreclose grief-hoarding, making "isolation… forged into choice" concrete. Agency is Mira's throughout; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: whether Liora will sign the forced confession or rewrite her father's unfinished story with autonomous truth. Pressure escalates causally: Senn's ledger revelation → Liora's discovery of her father's papers and Senn's original treason → her choice to write in meltwater and walk out. The thorn trade and public tribunal threat foreclose easy resolution; visible cost (guards moving to stop her, "coming judgment") charges the exit. Agency is hers: she rejects the quill, uses the key to uncover truth, and chooses exposure over complicity. One meaningful tightening fits this length; no unnecessary reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—recover Senn's stolen echo and prevent further harm—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when Lira realizes the shell has a twin and confronts Mael. However, escalation is muted: the journey is episodic (argument → confession → riddle) without mounting resistance, and the climax resolves via a single counter-song without visible cost or tactical sacrifice. The protagonist's agency drives the ending, but no price is paid on the page; Mael's defeat and Senn's restoration feel convenient rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—expose Fen and salvage the child's memory—is signaled early and pursued across all beats. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mara aligns the globe through the ice lens, narrowing her method and revealing Fen's pattern, which enables the pier confrontation. Cost is legible: she returns the globe to the shrine, relinquishing its evidentiary use to restore its memorial function. Agency is consistent: Mara tracks, witnesses, and confronts using her skills. Weakness: the crowd's shared dream and the guards' arrival feel convenient—coincidence complicates the setup but also resolves the exposure, slightly undercutting earned escalation. Fen's capture is efficient but the price paid (social, legal) is told rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—teaching Ren to see hidden effort—is signaled early and tightens when the smuggler crisis forces application. Agency is decision and instruction: Jiro chooses to teach, Ren chooses to learn and then act on the pattern. The market-net sabotage escalates by requiring active watchfulness rather than passive reflection. Cost is visible: Ren's mockery stance is foreclosed, and he accepts unrewarded labor. One micro turn (the sliced nets) pivots reflection into investigation. The piece leans accumulative, so pressure coheres through pattern recurrence rather than multiple reversals, fitting the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: excavate truth from the Ministry's lie. Pressure tightens when the reassembled letters reveal coordinates, deepens when the protagonist risks the storm journey, and peaks when the ledger proves systemic relocation. Agency is present—choosing to travel, staging findings, mailing copies—with visible cost at closure (Ministry seizure). One meaningful reversal: the "cursed" diamond reweights from superstition to beacon, which narrows mystery and raises tactical risk. The ending gambit (mailing ledger to rival bureaus) is driven by protagonist decision and accepts imminent consequence. However, the middle sequence (cart journey, orchard entry) compresses several investigative beats into summary, slightly dulling escalation texture.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—using ancient shadows and broadcasts to "shape a new dawn"—is signaled early and tightens when Mara arrives. The plan to project silhouettes on clouds raises conceptual stakes, and the final broadcast delivers a tightening (divided loyalties "folded into one shared breath"). However, the escalation feels more Accumulative than Causal; the story layers imagery rather than narrowing options through reversals. The conflict (Eli vs. Mara's rival sermons) dissolves into alliance without a costly pivot, and the price (ongoing solitude) is more stated than felt in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—become the translator between generations—is signaled early and pressure accumulates: Sato practices his craft nightly, hears the melody, carries the box to the shore, releases sounds, completes the melody, and finally brings the groups together at dawn. One meaningful tightening: the widow's confession that the box belonged to her lost sister raises the emotional cost and transforms the jar from commodity to bridge. The final act—standing between youths and elders, winding the box, uncorking jars—is driven by Sato's choice to ask for stories and permission rather than coins. Cost is visible: he gives the jar for free, asks for hidden stories, and his penny poems become "receipts of belonging rather than performances for strangers." The escalation is accumulative rather than causal, and coincidence (the box begins to play) complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—protect the relic to keep drowned sailors' souls anchored—is signaled early. Escalation occurs when the thieves lunge, but Lio's response (striking a tuning fork to align vibrations and "loosen their craving") bypasses genuine conflict; the traders fold immediately without testing his commitment or forcing a trade-off. The hand-back of the key in the final beat gestures at reconciliation but carries no visible price: Lio still controls the crypt, the relic remains safe, and the thieves depart voluntarily. One tightening is present but the cost is abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: teach rebels to move like the moon and slip past the empire without losing gentleness, signaled early through Irena's belief that maps are her "lever against the empire." One meaningful tightening: Irena's impatience surges at the viaduct, but she resists sabotage and instead watches nightly, charting shadows until she hears "a seam for freedom" in the softening hum. The third full moon becomes the window, narrowing options and forcing disciplined waiting. Agency is visible: Irena's signal initiates the unyoking, and the rebels' silent labor and refusal to snap forge the tactic. Cost is legible on the page: "restrained wildness...held back like a wolf behind a half opened door," the long nights of charting, the discipline that shapes patience from impatience. The resolution is earned by protagonist choice under the selected lens.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear early: prove the death was preventable and escape Kellan's control. The discovery of the cut brake line and worker's suppressed complaints tightens pressure by narrowing Mara's options to complicity or external action. The lit lantern functions as a micro-reversal, fortifying her resolve through connection to historical fugitives. Cost is visible: she uploads evidence knowing Kellan will retaliate, forecloses the safer path of silence, and accepts that fear "no longer owned her" (endurance with cost). Agency drives escalation—Mara's empirical method uncovers evidence, the entangled memories provide the escape route, and her decision to copy the message to three recipients forces the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.7)
    The dominant stake—whether Darren's contrition is genuine—is signaled early and tightens when Lena proposes action over theater. The reversal occurs when Mrs. Halden validates the labor's rhythm without granting forgiveness, narrowing Elias's understanding of what repentance costs. Agency is clear: Elias chooses to support the unconventional plan despite institutional weight. The cost is visible in his shift from certainty to openness, though the escalation is more a deepening than a high-pressure turn.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—understand and activate the yearning algorithm to ring a silent bell—signals early and tightens when Mara transliterates the marks, launches despite skepticism, and lands to insert the arrow tip into the socket. Agency is clear: her choices (studying the tip, strapping the kaleidoscope to her goggles, following the algorithm's ribbons) narrow options and foreclose passive ignorance. The socket discovery and bell-ringing impose a conceptual cost—she becomes complicit in an evolutionary dare with no immediate proof—and the towers' glimmer confirms stakes without resolving ambiguity. One meaningful escalation occurs when the glider's prow hums and the kaleidoscope pattern matches the bell's shiver, forcing the final choice. No explicit antagonist, but the acid sea and unproven algorithm supply pressure throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—finding where deleted files go, for the families and for Mara's missing mother—is signaled early and coheres across beats. Pressure accumulates through the recurring numbers, the locked folder, the anomalous access log, and the revelation of nine living voices. However, escalation is largely retrospective summary rather than on-page tightening: "for months recurring numbers have been appearing," "I follow the numbers like breadcrumbs," "at midnight I slip into the Chute." The final act—walking into Legal with the patch, lying while seeding a message—should force a trade-off between safety and truth, but the decision is narrated as already complete rather than dramatized under pressure. The cost (career destruction, legal jeopardy, the gamble that the families will act) is legible in concept but not viscerally felt in the moment. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mara realizes "the case was never about bodies; it was about silence, engineered," yet this realization is told rather than discovered through a specific on-page action or sensory trigger.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—how to use the fragment without repeating the Bureau's failure—is signaled early and tightens when Mara recognizes the anomaly as communal courage, not the shard. Her agency (silence, mirror-work, map-making, assignment of duties) narrows options for both men and forecloses unilateral disposal or hoarding. The cost is conceptual (mutual exposure, ongoing shared risk) rather than visceral loss, and no explicit trade-off or renunciation by Mara herself is dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—learning the sound of approaching endings—is signaled early and tightens through the storm rescue (bone tip finds the knot, engine coughs "like a patient deciding to stay alive") and Signe's challenge to "stop chasing loud finales." Agency is renunciation with on-page cost: the narrator's hand rises to escort Signe, then accepts her parting instruction, foreclosing the euthanasia-tourist pursuit. One meaningful tightening (storm forces embodied choice) and the final trade-off (stop chasing vs. let them pass) are sufficient at this length. Escalation coheres under the Accumulative lens; coincidence (storm) complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—whether to burn the relationship's record or honor it whole—is signaled early and tightens through the sentinel's parallel confession and the mirrored scraps. Pressure accumulates (Accumulative lens) via the sentinel's persuasion ("sap refuses and the cut must be made clean") and the shared realization that "burning words is just another way of speaking over someone's experience," narrowing Mara's options with clear cost: she keeps the pages, relinquishing the erasure impulse. Agency is present (the sentinel's gentle redirection, Mara's final choice), yet the resolution is achieved largely through dialogue and reflection rather than embodied action under duress, limiting urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake signaled early: preserve the sages' echo without becoming its owner. Escalation operates under Accumulative/Textural lens: the parapet's twitch at noon raises the problem, the prophet's confession of restraint (tremor near his cup) complicates motive, then the dawn ritual deepens through matched rhythm and confessed doubts, each a "stone set true" that widens the clearing. Agency is shared but clear: Iri's bargain ("a bargain of ritual and risk") and the prophet's breath-matched participation drive the resolution. Cost is visible in the parapet's "steadier sleep" and Iri's acceptance of "the right kind of secrecy," foreclosing simpler refusal. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: transmuting communal pain into a navigable archive. One meaningful tightening occurs when the anniversary storm forces participants to hold acetate steady, converting passive viewers into co-authors. Agency reads through Mara's placement rules (hard diagonal for anger, soft bend for guilt) and the town's decision to widen the path and hang sheets. The resolution is earned by collective labor with visible cost in the time spent and emotional exposure ("looking hurt"), but individual prices—what anyone sacrificed or risked—remain offstage. The shift from "your loss" to "our hurt" is asserted rather than dramatized through a specific choice under competing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—decode the pattern, protect the apprentices, testify without offering blame—is signaled early. The three sequences tighten knowledge: Lysa tapping, the childlike laugh, the hidden door. However, escalation reads as accumulation of discovery rather than narrowing of options under protagonist agency. The narrator never faces a live choice where one path is foreclosed with felt cost; instead, all moves are investigative and retrospective. The Council's demand for blame could have forced a higher-stakes choice on the page, but the narrator's "plea to listen" arrives without visible friction or cost in the testimony scene.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: capturing the sound of aging before her mother stops speaking. Pressure coheres through the search (driftwood map, Orrin's slipping memory) and tightens when Orrin whispers Mira's own rasp, making the project intimate and urgent. The discovery of the capsule archive and decision to add her mother's name constitute a meaningful deepening—Mira shifts from solitary recording to contributing to a communal archive, accepting that preservation requires sharing rather than hoarding. The cost is felt (trembling chalk hand, "tidal longing") but remains oblique; no live option is visibly foreclosed on the page. Escalation is driven by accumulation and cadence shift rather than causal reversal, fitting the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—capturing the micrometeor swarm before dawn—is signaled early and tightened by the spinning clock hand and worsening quake. The tightening is causal: without stable tracking, the camera cannot lock; Mara's leaf-tick governor narrows the runaway feedback loop into a usable signal. The launch command is an on-page act of agency that forecloses the alternative of waiting, and the cost is felt in the phrase "let loss escape," linking technical success to unresolved grief for Lio. One meaningful escalation drives the closure under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is reunion before death, signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening: Jonah's guarded phone response shifts when Mara mentions the record, and his decision to walk the skybridge forecloses years of avoidance with visible cost (trembling hands, the inability to throw away his half). The taped vinyl wobbling yet holding narrows options—this is the only chance—and the final exhale in time with the warped chorus lands as earned closure. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens. Minor friction: the six-year estrangement and the argument's nature are told rather than dramatized in flashback or choice, so the weight of reconciliation rests more on the record as mechanism than on tested commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—where shadows go at noon—is signaled early and tightens once when the automaton reveals the hidden stair and again when the sealed door opens to the reservoir. Pressure accumulates through Liora's problem-solving (wind, trace, close the loop) rather than forced trade-offs. The cost at closure is conceptual: Liora binds herself to the reservoir to send shadows home, but no live option was foreclosed by mistake or renunciation on the page. Agency reads as discovery and enactment rather than decision under competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—whether to accept the changeling and pursue the real Lina—is signaled early through the torn death note and "cleft in certainty widening." Pressure tightens causally: notebook → tooth → case notes → body's bone-setting marks → the girl's misaligned jaw. Each discovery forecloses the skeptic's retreat. The girl's appearance and Rowan's decision to set her jaw, then step through the door, constitute agency with visible cost: he abandons the known world on a supernatural promise. The bone-setting of the changeling's jaw—relief as ordinary work—deepens his professional identity even as it undermines his rationalist stance.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—sharing light without fire—is signaled early and drives all major beats: the search, the polishing ritual, the installation. One meaningful tightening occurs when Lio realizes "his fear of fire had also been a fear of failing again," which narrows his emotional options and charges the polishing action with visible cost (he breathes apology, foreclosing pure avoidance). The resolution is earned by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens: each polishing circle loosens memory, and the final teaching turn reweights the stake from solitary penance to communal practice. Pressure coheres throughout without requiring multiple reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—redeem the data theft by creating a public archive and confessing buyers—is signaled early and coheres. Pressure tightens when the narrator must ask Jun to meet (risking refusal) and deepens when Jun's "what I planned to do now" forces the reveal. Agency is clear: the narrator builds the archive, translates the drip pattern, and proffers the pendant with visible cost (losing the last protected relic). One meaningful escalation under the Accumulative lens: Jun's arrival converts solitary penance into shared risk, narrowing the narrator's control and raising relational stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake signaled early: Mara is "contracted to deliver a bright ending, yet obsessed with the darker courage of going against the current" and enters the nexus "to collect the shapes of different hopes" so she can "write an ending that does not lie." Pressure coheres and tightens: the ink river tugs at her ankles with "promises of ease" versus her upstream wade; she understands "resisting meant risking silence"; the climb up the bank and the cut thumb are physical costs. The final turn is protagonist-driven: she lays the gathered shapes on the cover, speaks her vow, opens the book "against its will," and writes the stepping-stone scene instead of the contracted ending—altering her own manuscript and foreclosing the commercial path with visible cost (applause replaced by "quiet, multiple shapes of hope"). One meaningful tightening occurs (the upstream struggle, the vow, the reversal of the river). Minor: the cameos' return after the vow feels slightly unmotivated within the established causality of the nexus; the mechanism is poetic but not fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—restoring the forgotten harvest rite—is clear from the summons and drives each beat. Marn's device fails until the keepers offer honest breath, creating one meaningful turn that narrows options. However, the escalation lacks a visible price: no tool breaks, no keeper refuses, no alternate path is foreclosed with felt cost. The coincidental alignment ("when everything aligns") complicates rather than resolves, fitting the Accumulative lens, but the final success feels gifted by the moment rather than earned through protagonist trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving starlight for guidance—is signaled early and tightens when Eira seals the plate to the well, foreclosing panic or theft. The cartographer's arrival introduces a micro-turn (invitation to read the map), and the aurora's response deepens meaning without a reversible conflict. One meaningful escalation occurs (sealing the plate), and cost is legible in the binding act, though the piece avoids a sharp trade-off or visible price paid in tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake is signaled early: fix the timer mechanism and understand the echo-swallowing cavern. Pressure accumulates through study, marking, and gear-fitting across days; the nightly tremor introduces overflow as complication. The Accumulative lens supports one meaningful deepening when Ivo realizes "the swallowing was not hunger but overflow" and responds by rebuilding the escapement to let echoes settle. The cost is legible—the timer now holds gathered sound—but the protagonist's agency at closure reads more as completion than a choice that narrows live options.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (collect burdens without becoming stone) is signaled early and tightens once: grotto traps → orientation → calcified thread → release with cost. The final choice (marking palms, orienting each time) forecloses drift and accepts ongoing discipline. Escalation reads under Accumulative lens as a cadence shift that reweights the task. However, the trap itself feels self-resolving once the alignment trick is discovered; the protagonist's prior choices don't deepen the predicament.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: transforming grief into teachable form, signaled early ("harvest lessons from loss"). Pressure tightens through the kettle's boil timeframe and three carved lessons, each narrowing her options from raw grief to deliberate containment. Agency is renunciation and construction: she chooses what to preserve and how, foreclosing passive mourning. The final act—lifting the panel, drinking tea—earns closure via visible cost: "what is here will go, so build hands that open" reconfigures her stance with the panel as proof. No antagonist needed; the accumulative design coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: Mara wants to negotiate with her ghost to stop running in circles. The ghost demands payment; Mara offers her images; the ghost provides the missing bolt. One meaningful tightening occurs when the ghost "tests whether Mara will flinch" and she does—raising the cost of the exchange. The resolution is earned by Mara's choice to give up her images and ambition, forecloses a path (no longer trying to be the park's savior), and carries felt cost. However, the escalation is more declarative than dramatized—we're told she "flinches," told her ambition "fades," rather than shown the internal struggle in real time. The bolt repair itself is summarized ("climbs under…fixes the bolt") rather than enacted beat-by-beat, which dulls the agency and caps the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (understand versus demolish) signals early and tightens when Lina's water-loop gambit commits her beyond survey duties. The pump resurrection narrows options from passive documentation to active intervention. Cost is visible in her hands shaking from cold and ignoring supervisor instructions, with professional consequences implied. One meaningful escalation (beacon transmission) forecloses the demolition path and stakes her claim for preservation under causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—making peace with the abandoned dream—is signaled early and tightens when the protagonist confronts his own wound rather than enduring it passively. Agency manifests in micro-choices: slipping out with the ledger, tearing a strip from its margin, pulling the ice free, and writing measures instead of ticks. The bear encounter is a reversal that narrows options: shared stillness forces the realization that silence is a wound, not a vow, foreclosing the path of pretense. The cost is legible: he will never hang bells again, but honest longing becomes the substitute music. One meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—exposing the engineered myth versus preserving communal comfort—is signaled early and tightens through discovery (tape/notebook), decision (splice and broadcast), and consequence (the slow turning). Mara's agency drives escalation: her training and forensic instinct enable the salvage, her choice to broadcast forecloses the option of private knowledge, and the visible cost is the community's loss of faith-as-comfort. The bargeman's confession deepens the moral calculus. One meaningful pressure point (broadcast) narrows options with felt cost, meeting the length requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving rope-based knowledge against wire replacement—is signaled early and drives Lio's sequence of moves. Escalation is causal: decoding the pattern grants access to the weaver, learning the council's plan raises urgency, and demonstrating the clerk's family name in the bowline reverses the threat. The black lotus seed's "refusal" and Lio's choice to plant it rather than hoard it represent a visible cost (relinquishing possession, embracing openness over secrecy). The reversal when the clerk agrees to keep rope is earned by Lio's demonstration, though the council's capitulation feels swift and the ethical calculus of the trade-off (secrecy versus teaching) could be sharpened on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—providing the queen an "explained absence" that turns "a missing son into a map rather than a wound"—is signaled early and drives the projection method. One meaningful tightening occurs when the queen asks the narrator to "write her son dead without killing him," forcing a moral calculus that the projection answers by relocating the absence "between the garden gate and the far horizon." Agency rests on the narrator's choice to guide the projection "gently so the absence would be explained instead of reopened," and the cost is felt in the intimate weight ("my breath stutter"). Escalation is modest—pressure deepens rather than reverses—but fits the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—reawakening beauty—is signaled early and drives every beat. Pressure accumulates through the trail of impossible odds, the egg's discovery, and the assembly sequence. The release of pigments is a meaningful tightening that narrows the world's mechanical uniformity and forces the automata to slow and wonder. Cost is present (the nun's confession, the unguarded Cradle as an open wound) but remains largely conceptual; Lorian's personal forfeit or trade-off is not made concrete on the page, capping escalation slightly below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—proving scars can heal rather than condemn—is signaled early and tested in the rescue, but pressure plateaus after the extraction rather than tightening. The copycat coin discovery is a complication, not a true reversal driven by protagonist agency; it arrives via the investigator rather than her own choice. The field graft is a high-cost action, yet its aftermath (the girl's fear, the protagonist's counsel) is summarized rather than dramatized, losing escalation potential. The final act (leaving the coin) is a symbolic gesture of compassion but does not foreclose a live path or force a trade-off with visible consequence. One meaningful deepening occurs (rescue → counsel → symbolic offering), satisfying the 600–800 word floor, but cost legibility at closure is oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—opening the box to free trapped memories—is signaled early and sustained. The quest structure delivers one meaningful tightening when Mara realizes "unstick was not only force but release," shifting her tactic to sidereal patience. Yet this shift reads more as thematic insight than a choice that forecloses a live option or imposes visible cost in the moment. The revelation about her mother raises stakes conceptually but does not alter Mara's immediate action at the closure beat, leaving escalation under the Accumulative lens coherent but thin on protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: find a way to share light without repeating ancestral harm. The automaton's warning—"if he carried this radiance home, his people might replace their furnaces and forget the discipline that kept them from colder darks"—meaningfully tightens options and introduces trade-off cost. Lior's agency drives escalation: he builds the harness, follows the grooves, offers the gear, then chooses the slower path with visible consequence (foregoing immediate return, accepting generational timescale). One beat deepens under the Accumulative lens when the gear's radiance spreads and redefines what "sharing light" means. The resolution is earned by his renunciation of the furnaces with felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—discovering the shape of collective grief—is signaled early and coheres across beats. Pressure accumulates through retracing stones, spirit mentorship, and the family dinner, then tightens when Jonas carves interlocking arcs and sees "every family had repeated the same three pauses." The dinner braids private losses into one chord, and the final stone placement reweights the question with visible cost (spectral release, butterflies lifting). Agency is clear: Jonas initiates, the spirit guides, and the communal tablet emerges from his synthesis. One meaningful deepening—identifying shared pauses—narrows options and alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—restoring mechanical truth to prevent future deaths—is signaled early and tightens through Mara's discovery of the engineered drift. Pressure escalates via accumulation: paused hand on crank → pendulum stilled → latch clicks → lead sliver removed → marker recalibrated → widow confronted. Agency is decision and renunciation with visible cost: removing the sliver "felt like taking a hot coal from her own throat," and the widow's nod (not smile) refuses easy absolution. The final acceptance that "absolution would remain incremental" forecloses reconciliation and charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—discover Tomas's intentions—is signaled early and tightens once: the cipher reveals the ledger's location, reframing the chess games as refugee protection. The final act (digging, returning the case, planting the sapling) is protagonist-driven with visible cost (uncharted echoes ease, night feels less like shroud). Escalation is modest but sufficient for this length. One gap: Alvera's question "was it love or fear?" receives an answer from the narrator without dramatized friction or trade-off in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: draft a one-page forecast charter that seeds innovation within a strict constraint without robbing villagers of adaptive freedom. Pressure tightens through the Warden's objection and Jora's need to convert forecast into action within the page limit. The moment "before the pen meets the blank page, when every option is perfect and therefore useless" is the narrative fulcrum, but it resolves via telling ("let the silence press her") rather than dramatized struggle. The spring payoff demonstrates that her charter worked—villages transform iteratively—yet that validation arrives off-page. Agency is present (she measures, models, drafts conditionals, defends margins to the Warden), and the cost of error (her father's fatal map) shadows the stakes. One meaningful tightening occurs when the model produces a pattern and she must compress it to one page.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—reviving narrative in a censored city—is signaled early and accumulates through Mara's successive acts (copying, cloaking, concert). One meaningful tightening occurs when the Censors post their inspection notice, forcing Mara to cloak the pages; this narrows her options and raises cost. The concert itself delivers the peak pressure, yet the resolution hinges on the dust whispering back and the Censors being stopped by ambient sparkle—outcomes that feel more thematic assertion than earned reversal driven by protagonist agency. The "dust shimmered and whispered" moment lacks prior dramatization of how the copied lyrics would transfer to the ground or compel the Censors' confession.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—complete the portrait without arrest—is signaled and sustained. The inspectors' arrival provides external pressure, and the rocking chair's groan creates a micro-reversal that buys Lira time. However, escalation is thin: she answers questions carefully, the inspectors leave without taking the work, and she resumes. No tightening of options or visible trade-off is dramatized; her careful truths succeed without cost, and the inspector's softening happens independently of her choices. One meaningful deepening is present (the inspector recognizes his own father) but it does not narrow *her* options or force a renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving ancient methods against institutional erasure—is signaled early and tightens when Orin moves from agonizing to boring, then narrows further when Mara offers validation-for-ownership and he refuses. Agency is clear: he chooses the teaching rig over a meal ticket, forecloses Council alliance, and accepts marginality. The escalation is steady but gentle; Mara's refusal could have been dramatized with higher friction (dialogue would have sharpened the either/or calculus), and the final cost—building alone in a sewer—feels more principled than viscerally costly given the modest on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (saving the arts wing) is signaled early and tightens through the fundraiser's approach. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mara records the chaos and asks each singer to subtract one noise, narrowing their tactics and raising the performance's stakes. However, the final turn—the councilman's decision to keep the arts wing—arrives off-page in his internal reaction rather than through a dramatized negotiation or visible tradeoff, reducing agency and felt cost. The method ("subtracting noise") constrains rehearsal choices with visible progress, but the resolution feels granted rather than won.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: transform the Ministry's control tool into a memory-restoration aid before the alignment. The tightening is signaled (alignment approaches, fruit swells) and one meaningful turn occurs when Mira prunes away propaganda-tasting shoots, narrowing the fruit's effects. The final distribution and pruning impose cost (exposure to patrols, neighbors' vulnerability) but the escalation unfolds through summary rather than on-page reversals that test Mira's commitment. The coincidence of finding the seed in the botanist's pocket complicates setup but does not resolve; Mira's agency at closure (pruning into an open canopy) is visible, though the specific price she pays—what she gives up—remains implicit rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: restoring the grid and gardens by speaking the buried truth. The riddle discovery, uphill walk, and truth-speaking form a single causal arc with one meaningful tightening when Maro grasps "open what cannot lie." Agency is clear: Maro's candor forces the box open. The cost is visible—publishing the fault, abandoning comfort legends—and narrows options (no more small lies). Escalation is driven by protagonist choice under the Causal lens. The resolution (drones revive, lamps blink on) is earned by the truth-speaking act and forecloses the prior evasion path.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—understanding why some houses feel alive—is signaled early and deepens when Mara tests displacement (clock experiment drains warmth, proving attention's role). Pressure tightens through escalation: solo cataloging → nightly visits with shard-compass → storm blackout communal gathering where keepsakes are returned. Agency is clear: Mara chooses to sanctify via object placement and ultimately releases the shard with visible cost (losing her compass, accepting future discord). One meaningful tightening via the clock beat narrows her hypothesis and raises stakes for the communal restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: whether Ilyan will welcome nuance into his testimony before more harm hardens. The Founder's telepathic pressure and the ampoule's use escalate causally—each revelation narrows Ilyan's options and reweights his certainty. The final directive imposes conceptual cost (acknowledging the whole seam means undoing his first disclosure's harm). One meaningful tightening occurs through the cascade of contradictions. Agency is present in Ilyan's threading action and acceptance of the revelations, though the final cost is conceptual and relational rather than viscerally painful on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: "to capture the texture of that missed opportunity before it wore smooth in memory." Pressure accumulates through repeated proof attempts, contradictions filling the notebook, and the perpetual motion puzzle. The protagonist's agency drives the climax: writing the final lemma and refusing to imagine redemption stalls the wheel, a meaningful tightening that forecloses the loop. Cost is visible—"each one was mine"—and the ending reweights the infinite staircase from hopeful to honest. One reversal (machine stalls) earned by the protagonist's shift in belief.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—proving strangers remember kindness—is signaled early and pressure tightens when Ro arrives questioning the "secret graffiti," then deepens when his grandmother's memory unseals and he commits to the rooftop alphabet project. The escalation is primarily Accumulative (single skeptic to multiple passersby returning with offerings) rather than a causal turn that narrows options. The visible cost at closure is implied (Mira's vigil ending, the word "rouse" inscribed) but the price paid—what she forfeits by trusting sleep—remains abstract rather than a dramatized trade-off that forecloses a live alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—rescue the arts and shelter the displaced—is signaled early and tightens when the eviction notice arrives. The ice-door thaw is a meaningful escalation driven by Maris's agency (baking honey loaves, enlisting refugees). However, the captain's conversion at the end lacks a visible trade-off or friction; he simply leaves after breaking bread, and no on-page cost or consequence is shown. The piece delivers one clear tightening (eviction threat) and one deepening (thaw reveals the cache), meeting the length requirement, but the resolution feels more like persuasion than a choice with felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: rescue the sister by breaking fate's lock. Escalation: Orin maps the yoyo puzzle, spins it backward, and the stone rewinds the drowned day—offering the chance to call his sister from the pier. The peak turn is his refusal to intervene, recognizing the stone's hunger for certainty and his own need to force outcomes as the true lock. This choice forecloses the rescue path with visible cost (he leaves the past unchanged) and reconfigures his goal from control to acceptance. Agency is clear; coincidence does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is clear and urgent: break the photographic curse before fear consumes the protagonist. Pressure coheres through the accumulative lens—each encounter (photo strips, advisor, booth) layers dread. The final booth confrontation narrows options decisively: press the clasp during the flash or remain cursed. Cost is legible (advisor revealed as self, fear departs, funhouse darkens) but feels somewhat abstract; the protagonist's agency is a ritual act rather than a wrenching trade-off between goods. One meaningful tightening is present, sufficient for this length, but the escalation lacks visceral friction—no live option is visibly foreclosed with pain.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—avoiding collision with steel hulls in the shipping lanes—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the approaching freighter light, the sudden squall, and the loose spar threatening to smash Leeward's perch. One meaningful tightening occurs when the squall arrives and the crew must catch the swinging spar with ropes, then repurpose it as a beater; this choice forecloses the option of passive waiting and commits them to Leeward's method. The cost is legible: they exhaust themselves in the restless euphony and trade safety for the gamble that sound will alter the freighter's course. Minor deduction: the freighter's response ("confused by what sounded like a floating harbor") and the storm "hearing itself mirrored" both lean toward convenience rather than fully dramatized causality.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (discovering the watchers' nature) is signaled early and tightens through Lira's pattern-reading. One meaningful deepening: realizing the watchers are built into the gate, not outside it. The journal's account of the expedition adds pressure and narrows her options to replicating their approach. Agency is clear: she composes the whistle-rhythm answer that opens the gate. Cost is felt at closure (stepping through forecloses return to unmapped safety). The expedition's prior failure and the gate's resistance provide escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is the recapture of truth vs. civic stability, signaled in the opening paragraph. The confrontation tightens when Hadrin reveals the letter and Mara's parallel to dock strikes forces his admission of the "one small edit" spiral. The bargain (curated exhibit + annotations) narrows options with visible cost: Hadrin faces exposure, Mara accepts mediated truth. The hawk's judging gaze is a strong pressure image. No coincidence resolves; agency drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Lira seeks to preserve her mother's memory by mapping the drowned pavilion and hiding notes in its foundations. Pressure tightens when she places the first stone "while the river presses back," then escalates when Beran appears with a hook, demanding the inkwell and threatening to end her survey. The reversal—she shoves his skiff into a pillar, creating a silt cloud—is earned by her established determination and physical capability. The cost is visible: she defies authority, risks injury, and commits to a clandestine memorial that may never be acknowledged. The final choice to wedge the note "I am still listening" and escape to the far shore forecloses reconciliation with the council and locks her into solitary defiance.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—trace honest map origins to expose forgery—is signaled early and drives the investigation. One meaningful tightening: the catalog-as-code reversal leads to the stamp, which unlocks the folio forgery, narrowing options to covert evidence collection. The final choice to photograph and conceal carries visible cost (personal risk, isolation from Guild protection). Pressure coheres under the causal lens; the blackout and underwater setting maintain urgency without requiring multiple reversals at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (retrieve Jalen's shadow to fill the empty cranes) is signaled in paragraph four and tightens through escalating costs: months learning gem polishing, the vertigo stair, and the priests' price ("leave part of herself in the light"). The Archive Spire climax narrows options—Mira must step into the dream and split herself—forcing a visible trade: flame polishes from within, paper folds grief, and she weeps only after the shadow returns, marking the forfeiture. One meaningful deepening occurs when the shadow "turns, sees her, and returns," shifting from lost to reclaimed. Agency is clear (she chooses each step), and coincidence does not resolve. The piece could benefit from a live obstacle mid-journey (a priest's refusal, the lantern malfunctioning) to force a second tactical pivot, but the escalation present is sufficient under the Accumulative lens and the final cost is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—finding and seizing "unused potential" pooled in algorithmic pauses to cancel future strikes—is signaled early and guides every move. The twelve-minute window and manual thruster adjustments create tactical pressure, and the gradient hunt narrows options as the protagonist steers toward the pool's edge. However, the final act lacks a visible price or on-page resistance: "I fed the pool into the guidance net" reads as a button-press solution rather than a turn earned through sacrifice or irreversible trade-off. One meaningful tightening occurs (the overload trip revealing the signature), but closure cost remains implied rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake: decode the frequency/assemble the missing alphabet to understand belonging. Pressure coheres through the pilgrim's arrival, the chip exchange, the star-trail mapping, the wall discovery, and the tuner activation—a single meaningful tightening under Accumulative logic. The final assembly (chips forming READ, tuner humming) forecloses the search path with on-page success; the cost is the pilgrim's long journey and Mara's surprise at "a family could be spelled, tuned, and shared." Agency is present in Mara's choices to launch the drone and pull the masonry. The escalation is smooth but not highly dramatic; the moment when "the whole word READ formed a key" narrows options and changes knowledge as required by the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: Mara must decide whether to deliver the false memory or confess. One meaningful tightening occurs when she discovers her surname on the dolphin carving, which narrows options and raises cost. The confession forces a visible trade-off—her practiced scripts crumble, fear of blame is named, professional complicity acknowledged—and Jonah's choice to reject the capsule adds a micro turn. Pressure coheres under the causal lens. However, Jonah's arrival and his question about hurt feel convenient rather than dramatized resistance; his agency is minimal until the final acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: complete the exchange without reprisal, with Lena as first hostage if anyone breaks protocol. Pressure tightens when wire restraints appear (a field cruelty that tests procedure) and Lena's choice to untether with the drawer pull becomes the pivot—humanizing the boy triggers both commanders' apologies. The exchange completes with visible cost: Sarin's trembling signature, Vek's murmured apology to an absent mother, and the boy crossing with memory in hand. One meaningful tightening and deepening, consistent with causal lens; cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—confronting the unanswered call sign—is signaled early and tightens when Theo aims for the museum despite the squall. The utility poles create a stepwise escalation ("the next one, then the next") that narrows retreat options. Lita's shout and the squall's arrival force the final choice to keep paddling. Agency is clear: he chooses transparency over evasion, foreclosing the hiding path. The cost (public apology, documented failure) is legible on the page and scales appropriately for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming humanity through choice—is signaled early and guides the journey, but escalation under the Accumulative lens is more thematic than tactical. The thief-rescue and wallet-refusal show micro-choices with modest immediate consequence, yet the labyrinth's harder quotes and the final testimony decision are presented as inevitable rather than earned through visible narrowing of options. The time traveler's late exposition ("I had seen you choose cruelty in a hundred timelines") tells rather than dramatizes the cost of the protagonist's past. No persistent material constraint (stamina, tool, social credit) shapes tactics across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (reforge bond beyond death) is signaled in the opening beat and Mira's agency drives escalation: she crushes spices, lays the fortune, breathes the conjuration, and chooses transformation when Sable demands equality. The corridor offer is a meaningful tightening that narrows options—cross as equal or remain alone—and her choice to let the human body fall forecloses the keeper role with visible cost. Under the Accumulative lens, the spice-breathing and bone-loosening deepen pressure toward the climax. Coincidence (orchard's appearance after phoenix) complicates setup but does not resolve; resolution arises from Mira's acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost postpartum time—is signaled early and tightens when the protagonist finds her own pouch "fat as a plum" containing confessions she'd "begged for sleep, bargaining with the universe." The reversal pivots on agency: instead of snatching the pouch, she chooses to "relive them without trying to escape," trading convenience for integration. The tree's physical constraint ("tightening the air around me until I could barely breathe") literalizes the pressure, and the cost is visible: she must endure "washing blood from sheets, rocking through feverish dawns" again to reclaim coherence. One tightening is sufficient at this length under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—opening the locked dimension to restore births—is signaled early and tightens through Mara's shadow work: each memory she confronts narrows evasion and brings the seam closer. The final tightening (naming cruelty/envy/love at the hatch) forecloses retreat and the cost is legible: she must accept buoyancy and vulnerability. Agency is decision and renunciation (letting herself lighten, no longer suppressing joy), meeting the 9+ quick test. Minor gap: the story tells us the seam "responds to honesty the way metal responds to heat" rather than dramatizing failed earlier attempts that taught Mara this rule, slightly reducing earned escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—understanding transformation—is signaled early. The detour into the cave and the choice to uncork the jars constitute on-page agency, and the tremor raises immediate physical pressure. However, escalation remains narrow: the "safe crack" reveal happens via convenience (lifted lantern) rather than through a trade-off rooted in prior choices, and the insects' path-choosing feels coincidental rather than costly. The ending shift to "gathering stranded villagers" introduces a new action layer without demonstrating how the cave experience forecloses prior options or imposes visible cost on Amina's methods.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—sparking a silent revolution—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when Captain Orven arrives, forcing the narrator to hide the pick and misdirect, but that reversal resolves immediately without lasting cost or tactical shift. The blackout complicates timing but does not genuinely narrow options; the protagonist's plan unfolds as rehearsed, with allies slipping through and Orven turning "too late." Agency is present but unchallenged, and the final image of empty Cradle and intact locks asserts success without visible trade-off or loss on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—honoring Lysa's promise and understanding the sacred patterns—is signaled early and drives Eren's nightly ritual. Pressure tightens when the dust falls in a helix and Marel's arrival forces collaboration, then peaks when the sea "lifts like a door" to reveal the rope and Lysa's message. One meaningful turn occurs: Eren's precognitive glimpse of two futures forces the choice to stay. The stakes feel somewhat diffuse across multiple beats (eel-herding, dust patterns, Marel's navigation need), and the climactic sequence resolves quickly once the pieces align, with less friction than ideal.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake signaled early: understanding "the cartography of scars" through timed exposures rather than censored verse. One meaningful tightening: the father's confession narrows options—the narrator must integrate betrayal with love, abandoning simple anger. Agency is decision and endurance: choosing to measure hurt with light instead of fighting censors with speech. The climax (reading the note, loading plates all night) is driven by protagonist choice under accumulated pressure. Cost is legible: accepting the father's complicity forecloses the path of pure righteous fury, and the new atlas carries both hurt and latitude.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—control of the hidden overture and its evacuation route—is signaled early and drives escalation through the duel. Lysander's agency is clear: he decodes the sundial, refuses Veller's demand, initiates the duel, and uses footwork to memorize the route. One meaningful tightening occurs when Veller reaches for the card, forcing the challenge. However, the "evacuation when the brook becomes a river" stakes feel abstract and are not tested on the page; the cost to citizens is told rather than felt, and Veller's defeat resolves the conflict too neatly without a visible price paid by Lysander himself.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—forging beauty from anarchy—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. Escalation is conceptual rather than tactical: riots happen off-page, the library reopens via summary, and Len's personality shifts are told without visible friction. The final exchange (catalog for seedlings) is a thematic gesture, not a pressure-tested choice with legible cost. No reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: repair time and self after his wife's departure, dramatized through the broken clock and Lio's search for patterns. One meaningful tightening: entering the hidden room forces a choice between refuge (looping the performance forever) or release (playing the goodbye chord). The turn is driven by Lio's agency—he strikes an unplanned encore "not in the film"—and narrows options with visible cost: he leaves the loop, the clock begins to tick, and he returns to the hall to play for travelers rather than hold them. Coincidence (the film reel's arrival) complicates but does not resolve; resolution depends on his decision to play the avoided chord.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—anchoring collective memory before the monsoon washes it away—is signaled early and remains coherent. Tavo's choice to plant the seed in a specific way, guided by interpreted dreams, constitutes one meaningful tightening, and the tree's emergence narrows options (either it holds or the island loses its memory). However, the escalation feels more like a confirmed hypothesis than a pressure turn: once the seed is planted correctly, the tree simply grows and the villagers arrive. The cost of "surrendered certainty" is present but somewhat abstract; we lack a concrete forfeiture or trade-off that makes the price visceral on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: finding "the color of unspoken apologies" as a proxy for reconciling the father's disappearance and the protagonist's own complicity. One meaningful deepening occurs when the compass needle turns inward, forcing the protagonist to confront their silence. The pruning of the brittle twig is an act of agency with symbolic cost, but it reads more as ritual than a choice that forecloses a live alternative—what does the protagonist sacrifice by admitting complicity? The story gestures toward renunciation of blame, but the price paid is conceptual rather than viscerally felt in lost relationship, time, or future option. Escalation is textural rather than decision-driven, which fits the accumulative lens but softens the stakes' urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake (finding truth) escalates through Mara's agency: the prototype imprints silence, forcing Rell's confession. Cost is unmistakable in his whispered admission and her realization about memories. One meaningful tightening under causal lens forecloses options.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (whether to enter destiny's door) is signaled early and escalates through the discovery of the map and flower code. The final choice is driven by protagonist agency and carries a visible cost (the untaken line is foregone). Under the accumulative lens, the tightening is meaningful and reweights options.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (creating safe inquiry) is signaled early. Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the causal lens: firing the kiln, shaping panels, and framing them constitutes a meaningful tightening that forecloses her former passivity. Cost is legible in the "seam" of the bookmark and the memory of silent coworkers.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation is driven by Mara's agency (decrypting notes, confronting Vaughn) under the causal lens; dominant stake (autonomy) tightens meaningfully, and cost is legible in the confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake (mapping the endless night) escalates under accumulative lens via density of silence-imagery and Lyr's teachings. Protagonist's agency—accepting the method of summarizing silence—forecloses the star-mapping path with cost (booklet destroyed) and reweights the stake convincingly.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes (finding origin of thoughts) escalate through loops and the crack discovery; J-17's agency in stopping and amalgamating drives tightening; cost is legible on-page via the violin's degradation.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (mistrust vs. honesty) is signaled early and escalates through Mara's agency—her eavesdropping and decoding tighten options and raise the cost of her silence. One meaningful turn (using the lens to reveal the key) deepens knowledge and forces her stance crystallization. The resolution is earned by her choice with a visible price (board's potential distrust).

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (proving gardens know their gardeners) escalates via Elias's agency: he requests the night, performs the ritual, and confesses aloud. The tightening forecloses his shame and forces a trade-off, with cost unmistakable in his breath and pulse aligning and the physical toll of polishing until his thumb ached.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (station integrity) escalates via Mara’s agency: she pulls the lever, sees the future rotor break, and chooses repair. Cost is legible in the vision’s stomach-tightening risk and the final reconfigured understanding between practicality and theory.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (unraveling the code to disrupt performance) escalates through Lena's agency as she follows maps and replies with taps. One meaningful tightening occurs when the swollen door creaks open after her fermata, foreclosing isolation and enabling the ledger's discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake (the weight of the swallowed truth) is signaled early and escalates through the narrator's internal pressure and Mara's interventions. Under the accumulative lens, density increases via the illustration exercise and the revelation of Eli's survival, forcing the confession. Agency rests with the narrator, whose choice to confess forecloses the path of secrecy with a felt cost—the loneliness and risk of fury. The tightening is meaningful and driven by character, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—finding the weight of the swallowed truth—escalates cleanly under the Causal lens through the protagonist’s agency (driving, using the wheel, questioning the ghost). The cost becomes legible at the climax with the “physical heft” of the discovered note and the consequential decision to end Mara’s hiding. The tightening is meaningful and the price is visible.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (witnessing without judgment) tightens via the refuge encounter and the lesson about non-ownership. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency—choosing to observe, let words fall, accept decay—with cost visible in the collapsed ceiling and absorbed words.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes (Mara's silence) escalate through Liora's adaptive methods, culminating in the high-risk eclipse moment; the turn is driven by Liora's agency and pays off with a visible cost (emotional exposure).

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes (understanding the displaced axis) are signaled early and escalate through Lysa’s active probing and reading. Under the accumulative lens, density increases until the decisive realization forecloses the option of restoration. The cost of acceptance is legible in the final cataloging act.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake (control one's narrative) escalates through protagonist agency under causal lens: patrol boat arrival forces Lian to change the beam and burn fortunes. Cost is legible in the destruction of old fortunes and the redirected searchlights.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preventing possession completion—escalates through Selo's and Mara's agency under a causal lens. Each rhetorical device tightens options, with cost visible in the ring's tremor and Mara's shivering. The parasite's fight and the circle drawing form a meaningful turn that forecloses possession.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under the accumulative lens, escalation reads as a decisive intensification of pattern and density culminating at dawn. The dominant stake (to alleviate chronological homesickness) is signaled early and deepens through the mapping ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=9.5)

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (breaking the curse/tricking fear) escalates through protagonist's agency under causal lens: entering funhouse, consulting dictionary, using clasp in final booth.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (survival) is signaled early and escalates coherently under the causal lens: drifting toward freighters → storm → hunger. Each tightening is driven by Leeward’s agency, forcing trade-offs (e.g., using the spar as a beater). Cost is legible on the page (thudding fruit, threatened tree, spent storm). The crew’s adoption of the method after the crisis is an earned deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (answer the question of the watchers) is signaled early and escalates coherently through Lira's discoveries (fracture, journal, code). Each find narrows options and deepens knowledge. Agency is clear: she uses her craft to test, trace, and map. The cost is the dread of understanding the gate's true nature. The escalation is strong, though the final unlocking, while earned, happens with relative swiftness, slightly compressing the peak choice's weight.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake (truth vs. noble lies) escalates through Mara's agency: she confronts, draws parallels, and offers a bargain that forces Hadrin's admission.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes escalate from personal quest to physical confrontation with Beran, driven by Lira's agency; cost is visible in the struggle and escape, tightening under causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (proving forgery) escalates through Maren’s agency: decoding the catalog, stamping the folio, reading impressions. Each tightening narrows options and raises cost, culminating in the risk-laden decision to leave physical evidence.

    The dominant stake—finding where unused potential pools—escalates through the time-pressure of cooling breakers and the protagonist's perturbation-theory-driven hunt.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes (decoding belonging) escalate through Mara's agency: drone mapping reveals gap, pulling masonry opens passage, fitting chips triggers realization. Cost is felt in the reconfiguration of "missing pieces."

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (the weight of withheld truth vs. the comfort of falsehood) is signaled early and escalates under the causal lens through Mara's discovery of the driftwood dolphin.

The cost is legible in his slide of the "unopened capsule back into his coat."

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.2)
    The stakes are modest but clear: practically, whether the greenhouse can be restored; internally, whether Mara can live with messy, story-laden data after losing her telescope nights. Pressure escalates not through big reversals but through accumulative discovery—finding the spiral, tracing it to the leak, patching it, and then reading the changed dust patterns. The cost is subtle but legible: she relinquishes the comfort of “clean signals” and her self-protective disdain for “drama” in favor of a more vulnerable engagement with change. A slightly sharper on-page moment of doubt or near-failure could have intensified the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stakes—personal survival, exposing corruption, and claiming a more courageous purpose—are clear early and develop coherently. Escalation is more atmospheric and investigative than confrontational, but there is a meaningful tightening as she discovers the bomb rehearsal site and realizes the councilman’s involvement. Her choice to craft a glass vessel for the truth rather than confront directly or stay silent is a true narrowing of options with consequences. The relative lack of on-page opposition in the canyon sequence keeps the pressure strong but not maximal.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central stake—whether emotional expression can be translated into reliable, communal “music” in a noiseless world—is clearly signaled through Mara’s stated flaw in the system. Pressure coherently tightens as Orren tests the calibration on his own trauma and then on a roomful of staff and finally a flinching child, with the risk of flattening or drowning emotions if the system fails. The conflict is primarily problem-solving and existential rather than oppositional; there’s no antagonist beyond the broken system and past trauma, so the sense of jeopardy is subtle. Still, Orren’s choice to keep using his most painful memories as raw material for stability provides real cost and earns the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—whether the restless dead can be given a stable “address” instead of drifting forgotten—is clear and present from early on. Pressure escalates as the taps turn from distant signals into personalized coordinates, then into a desperate plea, and Marek responds by going deeper, stepping into impossible spaces, and finally sacrificing comfort and safety to sustain the light. Conflict is mostly situational and ethical rather than adversarial, but his agency directly resolves it by repairing the machine at significant cost. Stakes remain slightly abstract in emotional texture; one more beat of visceral dread or doubt could push this to an even higher level.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stakes—feeding the hungry without exposing donors to punitive authorities—are established early and tightened by the laundering rumor and the officer’s inspection threat. Amira’s choice to protect anonymity, even at the risk of official suspicion, and to alter the midnight route with decoys shows adaptive agency under pressure. The ethical calculus (gratitude vs safety; visibility vs protection) is clear but mostly handled in summary rather than dramatized confrontation, which blunts visceral tension. The story would benefit from one sharper on-page consequence or near-loss to fully foreground cost.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether she can transform paralyzing, stored love into a living current—is clear early and tightens through the breathing ritual and the demand to “heal it the way she would heal a cracked negative.” Escalation is primarily internal but legible: from abstract ache → visualized embers/face → direct confrontation with the knot → imaginative re-do of the missed blessing. The cost is visible in her surrender of pride and willingness to re-enter painful memory, and in the relinquishing of her image-hoarding artistic stance. The conflict is intentionally quiet; a touch more resistance or risk in the interaction with the pilgrim could push pressure higher.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether and how to reconcile the bridge’s looping dreams and trapped histories with the need for a livable, humane path—is clear and escalates from design challenge to metaphysical and ethical choice. The main tightening occurs when the narrator reaches the maze center and must accept that freeing the woman (and Lio) requires sacrificing the photographs and allowing the maze to “consume its own map.” Stakes skew conceptual rather than visceral, but the loss of concrete artifacts and the risk of being trapped as she was lend weight. The resolution is credibly rooted in the narrator’s agency and comes with a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake (saving food for the future before the militia can destroy it) is clear early and escalates coherently when the engine growls and she must trade speed for misdirection. Her choice to impede rather than flee, and to hide only two drums in the bear, marks a real narrowing of options with implicit cost (limited capacity, time pressure, personal risk). That said, the militia never force a hard near-failure or moral dilemma; the path through the problem remains relatively smooth. Tension is strong but not quite bracing at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—uncovering what truly happened to Jory and whether trust can be re-engineered— is clear early and tightens as Rell asks for the prototype, forcing Mara into proximity with the suspected betrayer. Escalation is focused in the testing scene: the aid ramping up imprinted silence, Mara catching the click, and Rell flinching and confessing. Conflict is primarily psychological and ethical, and it interweaves external risk (Rell’s diving safety, legal consequences) with Mara’s internal calculus (proof vs. the possibility of “forgiveness as growth”). The only limiting factor is that Rell’s resistance collapses relatively quickly; a touch more push-pull could heighten the sense of price at that peak.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether you enter the door and vanish or step away—is clearly signaled and sharpened through the moonbeam revelation that Lio’s “thefts” are hinges of fate. Pressure escalates once the bouquet marks the door’s opening and peaks with the jar casting “moonbeam script” while he hears your name and must decide. The conflict is primarily internal and moral rather than kinetic, which fits, though the on-page sense of danger could be intensified slightly to make the life-or-vanishing cost more visceral. Still, the final trade (keeping vs returning the portrait) feels like a genuine narrowing of options and is resolved by protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central conflict—whether Mara can transform a site of coercive surveillance into a place safe for inquiry, and thaw her own frozen shame—is clear and escalates through her making and retrospective self-indictment. The main tightening is the shift from joking narration as defense to deliberate silence as openness, which forecloses her old coping strategy. However, external pressure (the committee, structural danger) remains offstage, so the price paid is mostly internal and conceptual, keeping the stakes intimate rather than acute. This works but limits the sense of escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—Mara’s autonomy and survival versus being treated as an “asset”—is clear from the file discovery onward. Pressure escalates from private horror to collaborative decoding with the boy to a high-risk public confrontation with security present. Her agency drives the key turns: fleeing instead of taking the hush money, choosing to decode, then staging the reveal. A slightly longer dwell in the confrontation could have sharpened the felt price, but escalation is still coherent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—how to navigate an “endless night” when stars fail—is signaled early and deepens as Lyr forces the narrator to abandon trusted instruments. Escalation is primarily internal and textural: the storm intensifies, the last star looms and then goes out, and the gold booklet is ruined, narrowing options to the new method. The decisive act (accepting the ruined map and mapping by silence) constitutes a credible trade-off, sacrificing external certainty for internalized direction. Pressure is consistent but not razor-tight; the garrison’s rush and physical danger stay more backdrop than fully exploited counter-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—J-17’s search for the origin of thoughts versus the finite, self-eroding nature of the violin’s magic—is clear and coherently pressured. Escalation occurs not through big reversals but through the discovery of the crack and the realization that each loop exacts a price, which forces a trade-off between continued experimentation and mercy/inventory responsibility. The choice to use the remaining loops selectively and then renounce the tool is an earned stance crystallization. The conflict remains largely internal and philosophical; a slightly sharper dramatized sense of urgency or loss around the final loop might intensify the tension further.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether mistrust or honesty will structure the Conservatory’s life—is legible early through the sabotage rumor and the frozen social atmosphere. Pressure escalates as the doodle pattern emerges and Mara catches Eli actively using it, forcing a choice between accusation (and self-exposure) and a riskier honesty. Her decision to reveal the lens and sign her name in the ledger constitutes a real stance that forecloses continued secrecy. However, the external opposition (guards, board, institutional fear) remains mostly abstract and yields quickly, so the price of her choice reads more implied than sharply tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are primarily internal—Elias wants proof that is stricter than bureaucratic forgiveness—and they are clearly established before the night ritual begins. Pressure escalates through the experiment frame: Mera’s meter, the deliberate construction of the lantern constellation, and the climactic confession to the hedges while his biometric “luck score” responds. The cost is emotional exposure and the relinquishing of the fantasy that luck might be swayed by empty gesture rather than aligned work. The conflict is understated but not static; the night forces him to crystallize a stance about truth and ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—keep the station intact versus push a dangerous experiment—appears early and is sharpened by the glimpse of a not-yet-broken rotor that could cause catastrophe. The meaningful tightening is Mara’s choice to leave the lab while the nexus hums and intervene on the roof; this is clearly agentic and linked to the earlier vision. However, the conflict resolves quite smoothly: the repair works on the first attempt, the gliders settle, and Sen yields with little resistance, so the felt price and escalation plateau earlier than they might. Tension exists at concept and scene scale but never reaches a truly fraught or surprising pitch.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how the opera house can still “sing” after ruin—emerges clearly and tightens as she moves from decoding to physically obeying the ghost’s directions to orchestrating others. The keyhole/fermata moment is the clearest pressure point, forcing her into a charged stillness that tests her willingness to trust non-verbal, supernatural guidance. Conflict is mostly situational and internal (fear vs. devotion, tradition vs. new form) rather than adversarial, which suits the piece but keeps the sense of price relatively subtle. A slightly sharper articulation of risk or potential loss in the final implementation would deepen the stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator’s swallowed lie destroyed Eli and how to live with that weight—is clear early and tightens as Mara presses for calibration and multiple narrative “forecasts” of the night. The smudging of the notebook, the alternate sentences, and the DO NOT TRUST THE WHITE warning all deepen the internal conflict between absolute self-blame and more complex causality. The rescue and Eli’s fury add necessary external conflict and relational cost, and the decision to confess in full rather than cling to a single verdict resolves that pressure credibly. Some peak beats (the walk to the station, the argument/forgiveness) are summarized rather than fully dramatized, which slightly mutes on-page escalation at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator will unearth and then publicly carry Mara’s “swallowed truth” or collude in its burial—is signaled early and escalates as the trip shifts from eerie exploration to moral reckoning in the ghost bay. The key tightening comes with the discovery of the tag and note under the badge number: from that point, ignorance is no longer an option, and his choice of what to do with the knowledge carries real cost. Internal and external conflicts are well-braided (personal loyalty vs. ethical obligation; skepticism vs. undeniable haunting). A slightly sharper on-page struggle in the final choice moment would deepen the sense of price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake is the keeper’s stance toward change and ownership—whether to record, rescue, or simply witness—which is clear from the outset. Pressure deepens rather than spikes: entering the refuge’s more radical silence, meeting the other keeper, and being shown that trying to “own” what’s observed would close the doorway all tighten the philosophical stakes. The decision to write “nothing except the way the river kept moving” and to accept the library’s collapse as part of the script marks a real narrowing of options, effectively an earned stasis. Still, conflict is largely contemplative, with no moment where the keeper is truly tempted to violate their vow in a way that would sharply heighten dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will find a way to re-engage with her grief in shared sound/words—is clear and escalates in a quiet but coherent way. Pressure tightens as weeks of failed sessions lead Liora to risk the eclipse outing, and totality’s hush becomes the peak moment where the cost of failure would feel greatest. Liora’s agency in choosing gentleness over spectacle, and then revealing the curl, earns the resolution. The conflict remains mostly internal and low-key, which slightly mutes the sense of high-stakes risk despite the emotional payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.0)
    The conflict is conceptual rather than combative—how to respond to a world whose axis no longer has dreaming minds to anchor it—but it remains coherent and tightens as she uncovers the diaries and the tapestry’s implication. Stakes escalate from mere archival curiosity to an ethical charge when the diaries’ repeated plea confronts her limited power. Her final stance—refusing the impossible repair in favor of meticulous cataloging—is a genuine trade-off, albeit a quiet one. The pressure could feel slightly sharper if her desire to "set it back" were dramatized in tension with her archivist instincts rather than mostly implied.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stakes—whether Lian’s gift will serve tyrants or her own agency, and whether she and the courier evade capture—are signaled and then tightened by the early storm and the arrival of the patrol boat. The key escalation is her realization that her coded cookies reached the wrong hands, forcing her to risk herself by manipulating the light and physically intervening with the courier. The cost is conceptually solid (loss of an income/identity, increased personal danger, burning the archive), though the immediate danger from the patrol is dispatched efficiently enough that the visceral pressure doesn’t fully peak. Still, her final renunciation clearly forecloses a prior path, satisfying conflict demands at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—preventing Mara’s possession and the Anchor’s destabilization—is clear early and escalates as the possession “tightens its last knot” and the basalt ring trembles. Pressure rises through Selo’s successive rhetorical choices and the parasite’s attempts to exploit Mara’s conquest assumption. Mara’s drawing the circle is a clear, agency-driven resolution that forecloses her prior stance toward the unknown. The conflict resolves slightly smoothly—there’s limited sense of near-failure or real damage—but the cost and narrowing of options are still legible.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator can reconcile her ache for the past with living in time—appears early and tightens toward the moment when the mapped memories literally align with the lake’s horizon. Escalation is internal and textural: saving slips, refining the memory-map, and choosing to write a fortune “for the lake” culminate in the risk of letting the horizon mirror her “horizon within.” The cost is subtle but real: she relinquishes the fantasy of outright return in favor of the slower, lonelier work of influencing futures through tiny, anonymous cues. A slightly sharper sense of what she stands to lose if the ritual fails would push the pressure higher.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Lysa will continue to evade emotional gravity or accept a heavier, more committed life—is established and sharpened through the branching timelines that embody her pattern of avoidance. Escalation comes from the tablet multiplying paths and confronting her with younger selves and abandoned versions, culminating in a clear trade-off when she chooses one strand and lets the others “fold[] into the chosen one.” The cost is present but somewhat gently rendered; her acceptance of gravity and asking for help land more as a clean pivot than a wrenching loss. Still, conflict and stakes are coherent and deepen credibly to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—overcoming a parasitic numbness affecting Mara and the town—is established early and escalates as the cavern’s hush reveals itself as an active, consuming force. Mara’s choice to reverse the record and to score it with the broken needle is a clear tightening: she actively risks intensifying the disturbance to unwind it, and the Listener’s reaction marks a credible peak. However, the conflict resolves without much visible cost beyond strain and momentary numbness; no option feels truly dangerous or mutually exclusive. The tension is steady and compelling but never quite reaches a knife-edge trade-off that would push this into the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central stakes—personal safety and autonomy, Mara’s freedom, and the integrity of truth against institutional corruption—are clearly signaled and coherently escalated. There is a meaningful tightening as the narrator chooses to enter the quarantine zone, discovers the deliberate outbreak scheme, and commits to sending out the logs while effecting the rescue. Agency is central to resolution (choosing lateral entry, data theft, misdirecting the watcher), and the ethical calculus (risking themselves and Mara to oppose false reports) is legible. However, the on-page costs during the warehouse/escape sequence remain somewhat muted—there’s little sense of near-failure or sacrifice beyond risk, which keeps the escalation from feeling fully punishing at elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Lio will confront his grief and allow his mother’s preserved air to catalyze the transformation—is clear early and tightens as the moment of moonrise approaches. Escalation comes from stacking pressures: his history of avoidance, the revelation that the vial is essentially his mother’s last breath, and the knowledge that the plants need this scent to “learn” their era. His agency at the peak (choosing to uncork “only a finger’s width,” to breathe, to weep, then to remain as steward) clearly forecloses the old path of numbing and transactional distance. The cost—allowing himself to be unmade by memory and learning his mother quietly paid his debts—is legible but not overstated.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—how to engage with beings who feed on motion without destroying human time—is clearly signaled and tightens into the rope choice in the grotto. The impossible choice is sharpened well: speed their feeding (ethical cost) vs. trap them (self-sacrifice) vs. the devised third path that preserves some danger and some mercy. The moral calculus around “a place that already wanted to be altered” and the slipknot verse gives the climax genuine weight. Pressure remains mostly internal and conceptual, but it escalates coherently and never drops.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara can relieve the hush enough to keep meaningfully listening/playing in this altered world—is established early (council shuttering the hall, her gift turned burden). Pressure coherently tightens when she decides not to accept the shutdown but to seek the knot, then peaks at the cistern when the note “feels resistance, like twine around her wrist,” prompting adaptive tactic (changing pitch, circling the knot). However, stakes remain largely conceptual and aesthetic; there’s minimal sense of personal risk, irreversibility, or cost if she fails or misjudges the unbinding. The conflict is beautifully rendered but gentle—more puzzle and ritual than true crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will sell Orin a comforting lie or help him face his buried guilt before he turns to amber—is clear and tight. Pressure escalates as his half-truth story unfolds and the static “tells” on him, culminating in her decision to let her own shame subsume the usual sweet notes and give him something risky rather than safe. The ethical/moral conflict is sharp: she weighs survival-honed professional detachment against a dangerous authenticity that might destabilize both of them. If anything, the external danger feels slightly underplayed on the page (we’re told the transformation is imminent more than we see a ticking clock), but the internal stakes carry the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether unseen labor can be acknowledged without becoming vanity—is clear but remains mostly conceptual, with very soft on-page pressure. Escalation is modest: the mistaken letter presents a small social risk, then evolves into the plan, then into the chain that returns to Mara. There is little resistance to Mara’s generosity; Eli agrees readily and funding the first ten envelopes carries no visible cost or sacrifice. The result is a graceful, persuasive arc but with limited tension for a prestigious market.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stakes—Sava’s quest for belonging and the community’s need for safe paths over lethal ice—are clearly signaled and intertwined. Pressure does increase (days of fruitless searching, the council’s expectation of practical directions, the surprise of the arbor and kin-map), culminating in Sava’s choice to transform the invitation into a new social structure. However, conflict remains relatively gentle: there is little overt resistance, and the danger of the ice is remembered rather than directly tested on the page. The final cost is more conceptual and emotional than viscerally dramatized, which slightly softens the sense of escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—reach the Echo-Forge and free it without waking the Giant or running out of stolen time—is clear and escalates steadily. Orren’s offer to borrow time introduces a concrete resource with a cost (interest owed) that tightens as she descends and must steal more in tiny, risky increments. The key tightening is the cadence-lock, where she has to choose between resolving the phrase or deliberately refusing closure, aligning theme and conflict. Some consequences (the full danger of time-debt and waking the Giant) are gestured at rather than directly biting, which keeps this just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—how to live with Orren’s ambiguous loss—is signaled early and steadily intensified as the ritual begins to work and the seam opens. The major tightening arrives when she hears his laugh and sees his outline; choosing not to rush through, but instead to build and test a bridge of remembered days, is a credible high-cost decision for this length. The price is clear: she renounces the fantasy of clean retrieval in favor of a harder, unresolved connection. Conflict remains primarily internal and contemplative, so moment-to-moment tension sometimes feels more meditative than sharply pressured, which keeps this just short of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.3)
    The stakes are modest but coherent: whether Lio can ease the child’s fear and, deeper, whether he can achieve a bearable form of being “seen” without exposing himself. Pressure escalates from generalized outage to a specific frightened child, then to his deliberate intervention via the cache and note, culminating in watching the child riskily close yet still choosing not to reveal himself. The tightening is internal and thematic rather than peril-based, but his renunciation of physical visibility carries a felt cost. A slightly clearer on-page moment of fear or temptation to step out could further sharpen the peak conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will cling to controlling, observational distance or accept an unsettling, embodied connection—appears early and deepens as her body changes. Escalation is internal but clear: physical symptoms, heightened plant-sense, and the unnerving knowledge of plants being “afraid or bored.” The critical tightening is her choice to rebuild the trellis “by releasing control,” risking failure of both her research habits and the vines. The price is subtle but real: relinquishing methodological certainty and personal boundaries in exchange for a more vulnerable, mutual relationship with the plants.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stakes—finding meaning and possibly a path back to the sister’s memory—are signaled early and deepen as the map and convergence device are unearthed. Escalation is clear: rumor → physical discovery → supernatural verification (sister’s image) → moral trade (giving Mara a brooch). The decisive exchange narrows options and exacts an emotional cost while resolving the story’s inquiry into what the narrator will sacrifice for direction. External pressure (tide, scarcity) remains more atmospheric than actively constraining the climactic choice.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake shifts cleanly from Sera’s desire for enchanted ordinariness to Lan’s possession and the moral question of how to relate to unseen forces. The escalation beat—the force inhabiting Lan, the cave’s music changing key, and the dual-voiced speech—is strong and clearly raises both emotional and conceptual stakes. Their response through song and confession is a meaningful exercise of agency that crystallizes a stance rather than a mere ritual solution. The resolution does feel a bit easy; we don’t quite see the force resist or exact a clearer price beyond momentary danger.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stakes—whether and how the town can recover its silenced history without tearing itself apart—are clear and escalate through Sorrel’s deepening admissions and Ilven’s trembling attempt to restore the trumpet. Conflict is mostly internal/social and accumulative rather than confrontational: anger, shame, and complicity cool and reconfigure across those spaced meetings, culminating in Ilven’s vulnerable performance. The three-evening structure is a smart tightening device, but many tensions (council power, potential backlash) remain off-stage or summarized, slightly muting visceral pressure. The final choice to let Ilven play and to frame it as an invitation reads earned, with a visible emotional price but relatively contained risk.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will confront her own dishonesty and move toward change—is signaled early through her vow and the punch, then tested by the conductor’s condition of honesty. Escalation is steady: from abstract mapping obsession to a concrete demand for confession, then to a train that forces her to watch avoided truths before confronting the fortress of them. Her agency at the confession and boarding moments clearly forecloses the path of continued denial. The tension stays mostly internal and could use one sharper on-page moment of hesitation to heighten cost.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stakes—whether Mara will risk entangling her own grief with others’ in order to help them—are clear and organically raised: solitary work with the tile becomes riskier as she realizes what it does, then escalates when Leena’s pain floods through. The key tightening is the recognition that “to open the tile was to let other lives spill through you,” which makes her decision to continue and to involve Leena a meaningful, costly commitment rather than a neutral kindness. Pressure remains mostly internal and relational, so the arc is more deepening than sharply reversing, but it does not feel static. A slightly more dramatized moment of hesitation or near-refusal at the Leena beat could heighten the sense of narrow, consequential choice.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Ilias will risk becoming the essence of goodbye to satisfy his question—emerges early and tightens credibly as the storm overpowers safeguards and the corridors demand a will. The key deepening is Maris’s revelation that the amulet forces you to “become the goodbye,” which reframes his initial intellectual curiosity as a dangerous, identity-level wager. His final agency is unmistakable: he refuses stasis and steps into the slit knowing it will likely end his immortality and self as he knows them. If anything, the corridors’ desire for a “leader” is a hair abstract, but the cost of his choice still lands.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.5)
    The stakes—Sami’s asylum and Mara’s moral calculus versus Ivo’s con—are clear and escalate with the arrival of the agents. Mara’s agency drives the decisive turn when she presents the truthful affidavit and blocks Ivo’s passport trick, foreclosing the safer, more lucrative con path. Internal and external conflicts interlock well, especially in the moment she uses the toe tag as a silent threat about mishandled names. The main limitation is that official resistance softens quickly, so the climactic test of her choice feels slightly less arduous than it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how the town’s vanished time can be preserved without lying—is established early and coherently deepened rather than dramatically reversed. Escalation comes from his recognition that the indoor lamp hum yields only “polished and thin” time, compelling the risky nocturnal ascent to the bonsai labyrinth where external textures complicate his tidy reconstructions. The key tightening is conceptual rather than situational: realizing that the garden’s mixed rhythms both expand his invented histories and force him to ground them in touchable textures, culminating in reframing silence as a pause. Because there’s little sense of imminent loss or deadline beyond ongoing erosion, the pressure feels beautifully sustained but not maximally taut.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether he can reclaim or reconfigure identity in a system that has erased him—is clear, and it deepens when he realizes his case is part of deliberate “memory solvent” practices. Escalation is present but quiet: the label discovery tightens into targeted listening and tide-timed searches, culminating in opening 9H and choosing to hide rather than expose the files. Because no concrete antagonist or on-page danger confronts him at the climax, the cost and risk feel more conceptual than viscerally pressured, keeping tension strong but not quite maximal.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Eli can genuinely decode the “universal riddle” rather than just debunk—is signaled early and steadily deepened. Pressure escalates as he moves from light question-asking to using the cello and entering the whisper, culminating in confronting all the conversations he fled. However, the conflict remains almost entirely internal and conceptual; while that’s appropriate for the mode, the on-page sense of risk or potential failure could be sharper. The resolution (accepting the riddle as method and his own participation) is earned but feels gently inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are legible early—Cadenza’s autonomy vs. privatization, and Ira’s job vs. her community—and they coherently tighten with the posting of plans and arrival of private security. Ira’s choice to trigger the reorganization that night, using the chip and tags, is a clear escalation driven by her agency. The confrontation with Vell offers a moral trade-off (“sell a map…or protect a people”), but his agreement comes relatively quickly, with limited visible backlash or sacrifice, which softens the sense of price paid. The tension is real and sustained, yet the resolution leans a bit too clean for the pressure built.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—capturing the last unspoiled dark sky before technology overwrites it—is signaled early and tightened steadily by the advancing night and the progressing chemical clocks. Escalation is quiet but real: each strip narrows options, culminating in “WAIT FOR HUSH,” where Mara and Eli must decide to stand still and witness rather than simply complete a report. The cost is conceptual and emotional rather than dramatic—accepting irreversible loss instead of fighting it—yet it’s clearly felt in Eli’s commitment to keep walking and Mara’s final photograph. The only mild limitation is that no on-page decision significantly reorients their external futures; the pressure crystallizes stance more than it alters circumstance.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—getting the guidance bird working in time for the Meridian to navigate deadly fog—is clear and time-bound by the ship’s imminent departure. Pressure does tighten from quiet examination to test flight to Sera’s arrival and decision to trust, but Lio encounters no serious reversals or near-misses; the repair proceeds smoothly. The primary decision is Sera’s choice to accept his calibration as sufficient, which offers a modest but real trade-off between delay/risk and faith in his method. Overall tension is more contemplative than fraught, which keeps escalation from fully biting.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—who controls the rivers’ origin and what that implies politically—is clear and thematically rich, and the hydrological mystery provides a satisfying intellectual pressure. However, on-page conflict remains mostly internal and anticipatory; the Ministry’s threat is offstage, the environment is described as “eerily peaceful,” and the trek encounters no concrete obstacles or reversals. The key tightening is Riven choosing to act on the condensation inference and leave the outpost, which narrows options but never quite forces a hard trade-off within the scene. Tension lives more in the ominous implications than in escalating tests of resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the town is abandoned or can reassert its aliveness—is clear early and threads through the piece. Pressure escalates as Sava moves from solitary pacing with dogs to orchestrating a whole procession under the gate on the decree day. His agency clearly drives the turns, and there is a visible cost in bodily endurance and communal grief being forced into alignment. That said, the opposition (the governor’s will, the carrier’s duty, economic collapse) never truly bites on the page, so the climax resolves with less friction than the setup implies.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure escalates coherently from failing rebreather and deadened beacon to the discovery that the hush is actively trapping her distress call, forcing a hard trade-off between cutting free to rush for the surface and staying to untangle the knot. Her decision to resist panic twice—first unsnarling the tether, then opening the vial and literally inhaling the perfumed hush—constitutes meaningful agency that narrows options and raises cost. The tightening around dwindling air and the one-shot gamble on the mirror’s network create a clear irreversible path. Stakes are strong and visceral but not quite ruthless; the piece could sharpen the sense of what’s irretrievably given up (or risked for others) at the end to heighten the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—how the boy manages truth and attention around the keepers’ fate and his father’s legacy—is clear and narrows to a choice between intervention and restraint. Pressure deepens as he moves from listening in corridors to entering the forbidden old wing to confronting the lens’s horror, and his decision not to disturb the bodies but to leave the door ajar forecloses easier paths. The cost is mostly conceptual/reputational rather than physically immediate, which slightly mutes visceral tension. Still, the internal-external conflicts (truth vs. spectacle, warning vs. belief) interlock effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.8)
    The stakes—save the valley and repay a metaphysical marital debt at personal cost—are clear early and tighten steadily with each visitation and the orchard’s trembling response. The explanation that each appearance costs the bride a century of rest adds an effective ticking constraint and ethical pressure. Eli’s choice to return the bead and match his heartbeat to it is a true foreclosure with cost, not a cosmetic gesture. The main place left to intensify would be a more explicit moment where not complying remains a live, tempting option before he commits.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stakes—transforming the labyrinth from a site of loss and smuggling to a renewed covenantal place—are clear and meaningful, and Ila’s plan constitutes a genuine attempt to alter them. Pressure escalates from background ruin and broken precedents to risky exploration and communal re-engagement, but most of this is narrated in a calm, summarizing mode rather than through a sharply focused crisis scene. The danger of the maze and social resistance are implied more than dramatized, so the felt cost of each turn remains somewhat abstract. Still, Ila’s sustained, unconventional method and the town’s eventual choice to follow her threads create a credible tightening of options.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central stakes—Liora’s and Sava’s faltering faith and the monastery’s hoped-for revival—are clearly signaled and steadily pressured. The tremor is an effective escalation that interrupts her progress and mirrors her prior life disruptions, forcing her to reconsider her relationship to interruption itself. Conflict with Sava over sealing the tomb adds a concrete external test of her new stance. The overall pressure arc is coherent but gentle; no choice exacts a sharply painful visible loss, so tension feels measured rather than bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator will collude in erasing traces or instead expose what the margins reveal—is clear and escalates once the hidden “DO NOT TRUST THE ARCHIVE” impressions are discovered. Pressure tightens as the child’s chalk hopscotch becomes a coded route and the maintenance hatch reveals systemic abuse of private letters. The narrator’s decision to set a trap rather than walk away is a genuine turn, though the story stops short of dramatizing immediate danger or sacrifice, muting the felt price. Tension is steady and intelligent rather than visceral, which suits the mode but keeps it out of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.6)
    The central stakes—exposing a weapons-smuggling coup plot without being caught—are clear early and remain coherent. Pressure escalates via the technical attempt to align map and beacons, then spikes sharply when the Guard lieutenant arrives, forcing Liora into a risky improvisation with the orrery that could incriminate or exonerate her. Agency is front-and-center: her choice to mis-synchronize the lieutenant’s badge and to send the encoded chart out both narrow options and commit her to a dangerous path. The main cost is conceptual and prospective rather than a concrete loss on the page, which slightly softens the felt jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara can transform a paralyzing, unsaid apology into a spoken one without erasing the intervening years—is clear early and tightens as she sacrifices her written apologies and confronts the spirits’ refusals (“DO NOT CHOOSE YET,” then “NOT BACK, BEFORE”). The key deepening comes when she uses the shard to re-experience the courthouse moment, gaining a more precise sense of the hinge she’s been chasing. Elias’s appearance forces her into a live, relational test rather than a purely internal exercise, and choosing to speak to him forecloses the safety of perpetual rehearsal. The main limitation is that external stakes feel mostly emotional and spiritual, with little sense of what she risks losing now beyond her pride, though the story partially compensates through tonal intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether fear and mistranslation will reignite violence—is clear early and sharpened by the ambiguous word that can mean funeral or meeting. Escalation comes through increasing interpretive pressure as Lani reads the cast and realizes how close both sides are to seeing the vigil as an ambush. Her agency in choosing what to translate first and how to frame it for each man directly changes the outcome, with rifles “already loaded” underscoring the near-miss. The cost is more conceptual than bloody, but the sense of averted disaster is credible and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara can meaningfully reaccess and then carry back her sense of joyful, shared art—is clear, and there is one solid tightening when the fragment’s true origin is revealed and the schoolhouse niche is found. However, the conflict remains largely internal and contemplative; there is little explicit resistance or risk beyond the possibility of emotional disappointment. Her key acts (aligning film and fragment, threading the film, painting with light, then deciding to show the process) are all aligned with the same desire and rarely tested against a strong contrary pull. The escalation is thus more in density and wonder than in pressure or cost, which fits the lyric mode but keeps stakes on the quieter side.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will cling to being “right” or surrender to curiosity—is signaled early and deepened through the wall’s “test” and the taboo of stopping mid-stroke. Escalation is primarily internal but palpable: each nested awakening re-poses Tomas’s question with higher stakes, culminating in “What if the last layer is you?” The pressure remains coherent even without an overt external crisis, and Mara’s final refusal to give a definitive answer is a concrete stance. The cost is quiet but real: she accepts professional and existential uncertainty rather than resolving the puzzle.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—protecting mental autonomy/defiance under a regime that taxes thoughts—is clear early and is tightened by the neighbor’s seizure and then the auditors’ arrival. Escalation is coherent: what begins as a conceptual threat (“taxing not just thoughts but the act of holding them”) crystallizes into a raid on the last semi-private space. Agency appears in the narrator’s agreement to host the club and in leading auditors to the butterfly room, as well as Lio’s orchestration of coded dispersal. The tension is vivid, but we never see a concrete sacrifice or immediate harm in the climax, which slightly mutes the sense of price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes—preventing a return to war and maintaining a fragile peace—are signaled clearly and tied to a concrete task. The main tightening comes when Mara discovers the map on the postcard and chooses to descend alone, and again when she decides to tear and drown her last link to Iren. However, external resistance is minimal: there’s no on-page opposition, misstep, or real sense that the ritual might fail, so tension stays more ceremonial than fraught. The cost is emotional rather than tactical, which works, but the escalation curve is relatively soft for the declared scale.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—restoring the song so the orchids can release names—is signaled early and tightened by the discovery of the cracked chime. The journey through the museum, especially the Hall of Apologies, meaningfully escalates internal pressure and tests resolve. The decisive repair and striking of the chime are clear acts of agency that change the situation. Stakes remain largely spiritual/archival rather than viscerally felt, but they are coherent and scaled appropriately to the mode.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether truth and trust can be restored without the codex becoming a tool of coercion—is signaled early and tightened through the public ritual and its risk of exposing Mara’s lie. The escalation from private fear to collective, magically enforced confession is well-calibrated, with the Sava chord physically stinging each listener and forcing Ilyon’s own admission. Mara’s agency drives turns: she hid the codex, convenes the witnesses, initiates the reading, and then chooses to share power at the end. The tension could be slightly sharper or messier interpersonally, but the conflict and its costs never feel abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.8)
    The central stake—safe mills vs. living wetlands, and whether engineering can hold both—is clear from the outset and tightens through the discovery that a rigid seal will catastrophically fail. Escalation is driven by Mara’s agency: she chooses to investigate the note, interpret it, publicly reframe it as engineering, and then openly align with an anonymous plan that risks political backlash. The moment when she exposes the stress-line flaw and the necessity of a “kind” design is a real foreclosure of the simple, property-first option. Consequences are legible, though the social cost remains implied rather than dramatized beyond the spatting mill owner.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether to trust Oren and the Archives with banned songs, risking the remaining singers—is clear early and tightens through the meteorite reveal and ledger implicating Merek. Pressure escalates via new knowledge rather than spectacle: Oren’s claimed promise, Merek’s history of forgery, and the risk that pigeons could expose clandestine singers. The final choice forecloses Mara’s safer pattern of erasure, with implied institutional danger to others if she’s wrong. External stakes remain mostly implied rather than concretely tested on-page, which slightly mutes the visceral sense of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will risk a charged threshold to follow her father’s path—intensifies from abstract curiosity to an on-page leap. Escalation is present (decoding, discovering the plate, waiting for the corridor, facing the doorframe), but danger and loss remain mostly conceptual rather than palpably risky. Her decision to wait until she understands the distance as “an ethical line” is a good tightening of internal conflict. Still, the pressure could be sharpened with a clearer sense of what she might lose if she jumps or if she doesn’t.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stakes—Jonah’s entrenched solitude vs. the risk of connection that will end at sunrise—are clear and emotionally grounded. Pressure does meaningfully deepen with the choice to open the terrarium, and again when Jonah articulates his fear that sunrise will take Mira away. Still, the conflict remains largely internal and contemplative, with few concrete foreclosed options; we don’t see Jonah forced into a sharp, on-page decision about leaving or staying. The result is a satisfyingly tense quiet story, but without the one hard, irreversible choice that would push escalation into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—preventing the world from becoming “a room without doors” by understanding and repairing vanishing paths—is established early and narrowed through the personal test case of Mira and her brother. Escalation is primarily conceptual: the mystery moves from eerie erosion to the recognition that broken emotional commitments unmake shared routes, culminating in the risky act of confession. However, the on-page pressure is gentle; once the rule is deduced, the solution (speak the apology) arrives and succeeds without much resistance or complication. The conflict is coherent and thematically apt but could sustain a stronger sense of risk or potential failure at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story escalates effectively from low-stakes artistic boredom vs monotony to life-or-death stakes when the child is discovered in the flooding booth. Milo’s agency clearly drives the crucial turn—he diagnoses the problem, chooses the bishop-wedge tactic, and executes under time pressure. The internal stake (his ethos about chance and creativity) and the external stake (saving the boy) are neatly braided, but the ethical or emotional cost to Milo himself is underplayed, keeping this just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will sacrifice the nostalgic shard for freedom or accept deeper exile to make indelible verse—is clear and sharpened by the physical anchoring. The bargain with the keeper is a strong central tightening that forces a real trade-off, and the tattooing sequence makes the cost concrete (blood, permanence, deepened exile). Her final choice to “fledge” away from the city toward a networked exile meaningfully reconfigures her options rather than simply restoring equilibrium. Stakes remain primarily intimate and conceptual, which they handle well but without added layers of external jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the atrium and bayfront become a luxury marina or remain a public, working light—is clear and present early via the posted notice. Pressure escalates through the nocturnal failure to find certainty, then tightens at the on-site inspection where Ilya must pivot from craftsmanship to persuasion. The conflict resolves through his choices (repairing with plain glass, reframing the checklist, using the pond demonstration), but the inspector’s resistance melts somewhat quickly, keeping the moral calculus sharp but the interpersonal struggle relatively gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stakes—Mara’s moral cost of the lie and Jonah’s fear of freezing again—are clear early and converge in their conversation. Pressure deepens when Mara chooses to expose her most compromising act instead of offering generic reassurance, risking her reputation and legal consequence. The ethical calculus around “bargained innocence” is legible, and the final promise to confess and to “stand steady on the next line” shows altered futures with non-trivial cost. Escalation is more moral/introspective than situationally sharp, which slightly flattens edge-of-scene tension.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—resisting the town’s polite collapse by finding a computable form of hope—is clear from early on. Pressure does increase conceptually as Mina realizes she’s part of an ensemble and that her equations might bear on more than balloons, but obstacles are soft: each new attempt yields better results without a true setback, reversal, or painful trade-off. Once she has the updraft prediction, community buy-in comes quickly, and the launch succeeds without friction, so escalation lacks a sharp test of commitment or a visible price. The piece reads as a graceful discovery rather than a conflict that forces hard choices.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake is Liora’s ethical choice: whether to turn the echo chamber into a public artifact or protect its intimate grief, with her professional standing at risk. Pressure escalates through each discovery (family connection, her mother’s voice, the Office’s tourist agenda), tightening her options. Her ultimate decision to recommend closure forecloses an easy, socially sanctioned path and carries implied personal and civic cost. The main limitation is that the external consequences of defying the Office remain mostly implied rather than tested in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stakes—sister’s life vs. the boy’s, under the constraint of the loaned heartbeat—are clear early and tightened effectively by the looming bells. The mirror corridor sequence sharpens conflict into a concrete moral trade-off, with specific, contrasted outcomes that force a non-trivial choice. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation and resolution; the painter offers the mechanism but does not solve the problem. The cost of the decision (accepting the boy’s survival over maximal benefit to the sister) is legible and lingers into the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether these leaders will pay a personal price to make peace concrete—is signaled early and sharpened by the requirement to burn a cherished order/object. Pressure coheres as objections to penalties and the council are forced into specific concessions and vows under the ritual’s gaze. Conflict is both external (between factions) and internal (each leader’s reluctance to sacrifice what empowered them), and the burning scene carries a real emotional cost. Escalation is more a steady tightening than a sharp reversal, but it’s sufficient and credible.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—whether she can salvage or atone for what she destroyed—is clear early and tightens credibly as she approaches the oval and tests the device. The failure of the recording is an effective turn that collapses one hoped-for form of redemption and forces a costlier improvisation (shattering the egg). Stakes remain mostly internal and moral, but the linkage between her global power and this intimate act keeps the pressure substantial. The only slight limitation is that external opposition is minimal, so escalation is quiet rather than harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central stake—freeing the stored vows to break enforced conformity—is established early and escalates coherently as Maris moves from observation to actively subverting the sanctuary. The main tightening comes when she begins untangling the threads and is hit with the voices, especially her sister’s, which forces her to endure emotional pain while continuing the act. However, external resistance is relatively soft: the governor notices late and his attempt to stop her is instantly neutralized by the sanctuary’s acceptance of her breath. The conflict is thus more internal and symbolic than viscerally contested, which slightly reduces perceived risk in the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Ilya will continue to mine others’ pain without consent—is clear early and tightens through his experiments and Mara’s explicit refusal. Escalation is internal but concrete: reversing letters and plot exposes harm, then testing it in a hostile bar audience raises social stakes before Mara’s boundary forces a binding commitment. The cost is visible: he voluntarily limits his artistic freedom and profit structure, and risks a new, slower, more accountable process. Though there’s no sharp external catastrophe, the moral calculus is credible and the pressure coheres under that quieter lens.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Arin can give the last monarchs a usable route and meaningfully honor forgotten technicians—is clear and steadily present. Escalation comes through the broken frame and the discovery of the moth wing and failed “night signal test,” which prompts a tactical change (adding reeds for a steadier cadence). The appearance and successful routing of the monarchs provide a satisfying tightening, but resistance is mild; once he adjusts, success feels assured. The cost is more emotional and philosophical than hard-edged, which keeps tension in a strong but not maximal band.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—can the narrator meaningfully mend their past erasure by preserving forgotten names—is clear and grows as they move from studying the card, to carefully unbraiding and reconfiguring the rope, to casting the sounds. Pressure is mostly internal and craft-based, but the textural escalation is evident: preparation → delicate decoding → high-stakes re-braiding that might fail → transformative illumination and subsequent casting. Agency drives the key turn when they commit to rebraiding the centuries-old rope and later to translating light-sound into bronze; both decisions carry implicit risk and cost. The conflict remains quiet and could show one concrete on-page setback or near-failure to sharpen stakes further into the topmost band.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator can/should become the walker chosen by the paths—comes through early and tightens with the storm deadline and the decaying directive. Pressure escalates as the directive’s rot threatens legibility and the narrator must surrender to dream-transmission to get answers before time/structure run out. The decisive act is accepting the last order and stepping back into the storm-charged forest, letting the bunker’s directive end in them. The main limitation is that stakes remain mostly abstract and interior; we never feel a sharply contoured alternative or concrete loss if they refuse.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant conflict—empirical certainty versus encrypted, unverifiable devotion—is clear and escalates: intellectual curiosity at the tile becomes commitment when he descends, then crystallizes into a costly choice at the mask. There is a meaningful tightening when the “presence” demands his most conserved resource and he must decide whether to sacrifice his stylus. However, tension is largely conceptual and serene; there’s little sense of immediate danger, competing obligation, or potential external consequence if he refuses, which keeps the stakes from feeling fully acute. The result is a strong but relatively quiet pressure curve.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—whether anger remains a knife or becomes releasable—emerges early and tightens as the city’s shift intensifies and Mara’s panic threatens to lock everyone into perpetual war. Lio’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to lie about the box, to open it against the emotional weather, and to confront Mara with empty hands instead of argument or force. The main visible cost is Mara’s surrender of her weapon and posture of threat, which plausibly alters the group’s future. If anything, the magic of the melody resolves the immediate crisis with slightly less friction than the build-up promises.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—can Lio anchor his runaway dream in waking reality—is clear and grows from curiosity into a quiet existential tension. Escalation comes via the failed first use of the sextant and the realization that the dream is actively evading him by “turning every border into a mirror,” forcing him to change tactics rather than simply intensify effort. The cost at the end is bittersweet: he succeeds in creating a window but cannot repair the actual world, so fulfillment and loss coexist. Pressure operates more as a steady tightening than sharp reversals, but it’s coherent and sufficient for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will honor a non-contractual obligation (to the children and her craft) after institutional betrayal—is clear and sharpened when the vulnerable boy in the rafters demands help. The loss of her kit and reliance on the “forgotten bag” provide a concrete constraint that forces adaptation. Pressure escalates modestly but credibly from retrieval of an object to responsibility for a child’s bodily integrity, culminating in a principled recommitment. The conflict is mostly intimate and ethical rather than perilous, which suits the piece but keeps escalation in a quieter register.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will weaponize or suppress forbidden temporal inheritance—emerges cleanly and tightens as anomalies accumulate, the cameo changes, and she realizes she is already enmeshed in her descendants’ design. The main escalation point is the missing blank/appearing grandmother cameo plus the bathroom epiphany, which credibly narrows her options and leads to acceptance rather than resistance. Pressure is primarily conceptual and ethical, which works, but could be marginally sharpened with a more tangible or relational cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—rescuing trapped readers and altering doomed rescue missions—is declared early and followed through with clerk obstruction, maze hostility, and curator opposition. Escalation is present in structure (from doorway → clerk → trapped room → curator → vault), and Lysa’s renegotiations drive each turn. However, resistance often yields quickly to her competence; the conflicts resolve with minimal on-page cost or genuine risk of failure. The sense of time pressure (Orren’s warning about always being “one day too late”) stays more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—recovering Lio (and, by extension, lost names/selves)—is clear from the outset and sharpened by the ship’s demand for “certainty” as payment. Escalation comes through knowledge and tactic shifts: discovering the filaments’ response to the swatch, the mannequin’s revelation about the garden, and Mara’s decision to weave stories into a net. The price of trading certainty is conceptually strong but only lightly dramatized on the page; we’re told the ship feeds on fixed memories more than we feel Mara’s specific losses in the moment. Still, the conflict between rescue and self-erasure lands and drives a meaningful turn.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether the university will continue to hide a morally compromised treaty or allow its record to surface—is clear and escalates from intellectual puzzle to ethical decision. The ritual to open the door functions as the main tightening, leading to the confrontation with the faceless diplomat and the revelation of what was forgotten. However, resistance is mostly conceptual; there’s little real risk that she will fail the ritual or choose complicity, so tension stays relatively cool. The cost is framed in social and institutional terms but isn’t strongly felt on Mara’s personal level within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—protecting both people and cave-harmony by channeling the beings’ hunger—is clear and escalates as Sava moves from diagnosis to direct engagement. The arrival at the Forge and the attempt to conjure a “bloom of hush” form a solid tightening and test of her agency. However, resistance from the beings or risk of failure is underplayed; her strategy works on the first try with little visible pushback. The conflict resolves a bit smoothly for the level of conceptual peril established.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—proving that coincidences still have meaning and that someone is out there—is clearly signaled and threads through every beat. Pressure escalates via concrete turns: discovery of sabotage, acquisition of the hush shard, the star-tracking regimen, and finally the risky recombination of prism and hush. The main agency peak is the deliberate rekindling and coded reply, which narrows the custodian’s path from passive watching to active signaling. The personal cost remains mostly implied (years of isolation, mental strain) rather than sharply tested on the page, keeping this just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—preserve the Archive of collective memory before the storm shatters the solid fog—is clear early and coherently tied to the narrator’s identity risk. Pressure escalates as more memories are absorbed and as the storm physically rises to the terrace, culminating in the risky conjecture of inscribing their own memories to stabilize everything. The trade-off between preserving lineage for all and maintaining a discrete self is implied more than dramatized, but it’s still felt. A touch more concrete sense of what personal loss would look like on the other side of this act could sharpen the perceived cost.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes—preventing despair from tipping into riot and whether the fortress will literally open to the starving—are clear and weighty. Pressure tightens effectively when the mosaic note reframes the commission from mood management to structural change, and again when the show must hold the crowd while the masonry is cleared. However, overt resistance from the council barely manifests on the page; Mirel’s order to open the gate feels almost too frictionless given the earlier fear of the mob, which trims the sense of paid price. The tension during the fireworks sequence is nicely handled, but escalation tops out at “clever plan succeeding” rather than “genuine risk narrowly navigated.”

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Mara can continue her work under impending institutional and ecological change—is signaled early via Iven’s “You cannot keep writing here” and tightens when the council/harbor threat is spelled out. The internal and external conflicts interlock: the pause in the argument becomes the crucible where she must decide between open rebellion, capitulation, or a reframed path. Escalation is subtle but real: activating the cicada to foresee costs, then choosing a compromise that preserves her drive at the price of place and some honesty. The outcome is earned by her agency, though the on-page risk never reaches visceral danger, keeping the intensity at a quiet, high-lit-fic register.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator can confront and recalibrate their fear of enclosure/void—is clear from early on and tightens credibly at the rope-web and scorched vines. Escalation is mostly internal but still concrete, as the narrator must cross open space and deliberately seek the dangerous gilded hush against warnings. The breathing method (“by limiting exposure… three breaths closed, one open”) gives the protagonist active tactics under pressure. The cost is emotionally felt, though external consequences remain low-key, keeping this just shy of top-tier tension.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara can cross without her fear of noise and oncoming wind overwhelming her—is clear and coherently pursued. Pressure does deepen when the storm glass suddenly shifts and the wind approaches, prompting Elias to alter tactics, but the situation never truly threatens to fail; options don’t narrow so much as require gentle recalibration. Internal and external tensions braid nicely (her grief and fear channeled into listening to the cables), yet there’s little sense of real risk or loss if his approach fails beyond discomfort. The resulting tension is finely modulated but comparatively low-intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—reaching the stairway before sunrise and deciding what to do with the unclaimed throne—is clear and consistent. Escalation progresses via discovery (waterfall → orchard → murals → gate → throne), and the main tightening is her confrontation with the disembodied voice demanding lineage. However, external antagonism is minimal; drones, the time limit, and the unknown systems never bite hard enough to feel like real risk, and the internal temptation to take power is handled briskly. As a result, the story feels compelling but not truly pressurized at its climax.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will maintain her self-protective silence or answer Lio/the world’s grief—arrives clearly with the rattling ring and narrowing threshold. Pressure escalates through the threat of the sanctuary’s unmaking and Lio literally suffocating in the in-between, forcing her to pay with vulnerability and self-exposure via her scars. The ritual to save him and mend the seam works thematically but unfolds very smoothly; there’s little resistance or risk of failure once she decides, which softens the climax’s edge. Still, her choice forecloses a prior pattern of renunciation in a way that reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stakes—saving Old Sen’s farm from the bank and Mara’s redemption from exploitative deceit—are clear and increasingly intertwined. Conflict escalates from private shame to confronting literalized slogans to risking her own worst memory and inviting the wider community into vulnerable confession. The ethical calculus (sell another dream vs. tell the truth and share the load) sharpens the peak choice credibly. The external risk feels somewhat softened by how smoothly the diamond machine works, so cost is more emotional than perilous.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Leander will merely abdicate as gesture or confront the dynasty’s origin and transform abdication into restitution—is clear and escalates as he digs deeper into the family’s secrets. The discovery of Nara’s confession and the subsequent public abdication with reparative orders represent a meaningful tightening and cost. Still, the pressure stays mostly intellectual and contemplative; we never feel serious resistance from Leander or the ministers, so the ethical conflict remains a bit too smooth for top-tier tension.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Calven remains a passive, sworn watcher for his order or becomes an agent of possibility—is signaled early and meaningfully tightened as he chooses to mimic forbidden ciphers, unsnap his armor, and finally take the compass. Escalation is accumulative rather than reversals-based: each ritual unsnapping intensifies the blend of bliss and dread and further commits him to a path that will estrange him from his order and prior self. The cost is present but largely conceptual; no on-page antagonistic force or irreversible external consequence bites down in the moment, slightly softening the sense of a no-return threshold. Still, his vow to “let possibility take flesh without puppetry” clearly forecloses prior obedience and crystallizes his stance.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the erasure in Josie’s file can be answered and emotionally survived—is clear and grows as Mara moves from routine work into uncovering a buried story. Escalation is primarily informational and emotional: from a puzzling blank page to evidence of deliberate concealment to the morally fraught war letter and its implications for Josie’s identity. The meeting scene meaningfully tests Mara’s motive: she must decide how much truth to reveal and how to frame it, with the risk of harming Josie or herself. Stakes remain quiet and interior, but they tighten coherently under that register.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes—memory versus erasure, passive acceptance versus resistance—are clear from the outset and tighten once Mara learns she “should have been dead” and never existed in the newest revision. The key escalation is her shift from a failed pamphlet drop to sabotaging the press plates themselves, which credibly raises the risk and impact. The external danger (sirens converging, risk of arrest/death) is present but somewhat lightly dramatized; we don’t feel many hard tactical constraints beyond time pressure. Internal conflict between self-preservation and mission is implied more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—preventing the prophecy from fully taking hold—is established early and sharpened by the concrete consequence of townspeople turning into sleepwalkers. Escalation is handled via a live clock (“as dewdrops form… when the last dewdrop finally detached and fell”) and Lio’s pacing/whispers gradually unsettling the code until the final bead is intercepted. His agency is clear: he chooses a risky, counterintuitive tactic (silence/whisper instead of playing loudly) that costs him his mother’s echo. The conflict is primarily internal and situational rather than combative, but it tightens enough to feel like a real test rather than a foregone ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—preventing Veyroot’s descent by transforming how it remembers—is clearly signaled (“each seed carried a remembered name that could keep the tree aloft”) and escalates through specific turns (DESCEND, the ignored warning, “UNDO THE LATCH,” opening the taboo vault). Lio’s agency drives each tightening: he could retreat after the foreman’s dismissal but instead doubles down on monuments and leaf-reading, then breaks the seal on forbidden history. The price is primarily conceptual and communal (abandoning comforting theft and secrecy, risking taboo-breaking) rather than physically dramatized, which slightly softens the felt peril. Nonetheless, conflict progresses coherently to a resolution earned by Lio’s stance and actions.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—how the town (and the admiral) will navigate uncertainty after catastrophe—is clear and deepens from a simple retrieval mission to a philosophical negotiation about planning and doubt. Escalation is modest but coherent: eerie coincidences prompt investigation, the physical risk rises underground, and then shifts to ethical pressure in choosing whether and how to return the compass rose. Mara’s bargain is an active choice that reconfigures options for both her and the admiral. The main limitation is that the price paid remains more intellectual than felt; no concrete loss or sacrifice sharpens the moral cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—redeeming Orin within the strict limits of Mara’s alchemy—is clear early and tightened as she realizes she cannot resurrect him and must choose a lesser, more honest redemption. Escalation is coherent: personal risk escalates from spending a measure of her name, to sacrificing stolen names, to confronting Ellis and compelling him to surrender his true name and confess. Agency drives the turns; nothing is solved by coincidence. The cost is legible at the end (Mara’s forfeited shortcuts, Ellis’s surrendered identity, and Orin’s death remaining irreversible), though the confrontation with Ellis resolves somewhat smoothly for such a morally fraught moment, keeping this just shy of the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central conflict—Mara trying to draw a mired soul toward release by converting calcified grief into a laugh—tightens credibly as Elowen’s confession escalates from technical error to murderous fantasy. Using the crocodile tooth and frog rhyme to challenge that shame is a satisfying, agency-driven turn. The cost is visible in Elowen’s horror at naming her desire to run and in Mara’s chest burning as she recognizes her own shadows. The resolution leans gentle and redemptive enough that the danger of failure never feels razor-sharp, which keeps the pressure strong but not harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—uncover the forest’s mercy calculus to free others and herself—is clear from early on and coherently maintained. Pressure accumulates via nausea, fear spikes, and the requirement to re-enter torture patterns to read the archive, with one meaningful deepening when she recognizes that the forest opens only to bodies “tuned by cruelty.” However, escalation is mostly internal and textural; there’s no hard on-page reversal or dilemma where a real alternative path is seriously weighed and lost. The ending stance is earned, but the conflict curve feels more like steady descent than sharply tightening screws.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—keeping the seam open long enough to retrieve and carry the overlooked names—is clear and linked to her mother’s legacy. Pressure deepens via the darkening shard and the discovery of rejected paintings, with a meaningful tightening when she must locate and unfasten the hidden hatch. However, opposition and potential failure remain largely abstract; things unfold with little true resistance or painful trade-off beyond urgency. The resolution is earned by her tactics and choices, but the felt cost and risk are relatively gentle for elite-level stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.7)
    The central pressure—uncovering and resolving whatever the elevator/ceiling is hiding so the dead can move on—is clear and does tighten as the ghosts indicate the ceiling patch and the hidden mechanism. His choice to open the cabinet, cut the zip tie, and let the elevator drop an inch is a real turn that alters the situation and options. However, the stakes are mostly metaphysical and interior; there’s little sense of genuine danger, time pressure, or substantial trade-off beyond his standing burden. Tension is steady and textured rather than sharply escalating, which limits the ceiling of this category for a top-tier venue.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central stake—maintaining a fragile, negotiated perfection versus risking rupture to compress eternity and recover Mara—is clear and sharpened by the spiral frost and catalog flicker. Pressure meaningfully tightens when the frost abandons its usual grid and the library physically leans, forcing Lio toward an irreversible choice. His agency drives the turn, and the price (breaking the catalog’s protections, letting books reorder by desire) is legible. The internal conflict around this choice could be staged with slightly more in-the-moment resistance before he commits.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.5)
    The core conflict—how to claim or release a buried civilization’s story—emerges early and escalates well via the storm, the dangerous mirrors, and the map’s reclassification of Palimpsest. Len and Yara’s personal losses entwine with the political dispute, and the map’s discovery forces a genuine trade-off between factional power and honest multiplicity. The final decision to exhibit the map ambiguously is a clear, agency-driven resolution that forecloses simpler paths. Stakes remain largely ideological and emotional; a hint more concrete risk (professional, physical, or social) on the page could sharpen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming the city’s light without breaking the Covenant—is clear early and coherently pursued. There is a solid deepening when the Thief is revealed as hollow and fearful rather than malign, reframing opposition into something to mend. However, escalation is gentle: the Thief yields its chest and motivation quickly, and Ivo’s solution works without setback or sacrifice beyond the pre-established truth-binding risk. The resulting conflict feels meaningful but somewhat low in on-page cost and tension.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—Mara’s drive to confront a realm beyond explanation—remains legible and is tightened by her deliberate choice to enter the caves at night after the factory’s last lights go dark. Pressure escalates texturally as she moves from town to cliffs to narrowing tunnel to lagoon, and each psychometry use deepens understanding, culminating in the factory-planning revelation. However, conflict is largely internal and contemplative, with little external resistance or genuine risk of failure, so the beat-to-beat tension stays quiet. Her final renunciation (leaving the compass, honoring doubt) is meaningful but not sharply opposed by any on-page counterforce.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.8)
    The piece is more about deepening than sharp reversal, but there is a clear tightening: from personal disorientation to bearing responsibility for a communal, time-spanning fix. Stakes—the seawall’s failure and town’s survival—are stated and Mara’s choices (accepting the lantern, committing to carving, planting signs) all move toward addressing them. However, tension remains somewhat abstract and unhurried; we don’t feel a specific clock or near-miss that tests her commitment under pressure. The escalation is coherent and character-driven, just a shade too serene to reach the highest band for conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—Lina’s need to understand the night blooms as a way to reach her mother’s intentions—emerges early and steadily deepens. Pressure escalates modestly but clearly: from childhood curiosity to post-bereavement hunger to the concrete investigative act of climbing to the transept window at the precisely chosen “dawning hush.” The cost is primarily emotional and conceptual (accepting that her mother’s answer is about engineered shelter, not mystical secrecy), and the story earns this quiet scale. One could imagine a slightly sharper moment of on-page dilemma or resistance at the window itself, but the current arc remains coherent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central conflict—retrieve and reveal versus protect the vulnerable—is clearly articulated and escalates from eerie curiosity to an explicit negotiation with Lila’s residue. The parley is a strong tightening beat: the protagonist must commit to specific archival ethics before the diary is released. Internal and external pressures interweave well, though the external danger (from deputies, state, or others) remains largely retrospective, making the stakes feel slightly more conceptual than immediate. A sharper sense of what might be lost or endangered now if the archivist fails or betrays the promise would further intensify the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the town will rebuild through labor instead of retreating to wishes—is clear and present early. Pressure deepens as returning families repeatedly ask Sen to open the bottle, so his internal temptation is tested against communal longing, and he responds by proposing a charter instead of a miracle. The cost is conceptual and social: choosing harder, slower rebuilding over instantaneous relief, foreclosing the path of reopening the old tide of luck. However, escalation stays relatively gentle; there’s no single sharp reversal where refusing the wish visibly risks losing the townspeople, which keeps the tension high but not maximal.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether engaging with the prophecy will doom or save the city—is established and tightened as Erem shifts from passive listener to active interpreter and then public warner. Escalation is internal but real: terror that he has “sworn the city into that failure” compels him to seek a loophole in the emotional patterns. His decision to broadcast the warning, with the risk of being seen as irrational and the fear of self-fulfilling the omen, functions as the key pressure point. The actual material loss is off-page, so the felt cost leans conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—how to bear and repay “borrowed time” without worsening the city’s temporal debt—is clear and coheres from the opening rule to the ending choice. Escalation is primarily conceptual: entering the corridor raises the cost by revealing that the inheritance is a loan, and the city’s misuse of time gives Lio a real, non-trivial burden. His agency at closure (mending routines, labeling planters, sacrificing the rye grain) resolves the conflict through a chosen stance, not coincidence. The pressure is more metaphysical than visceral, so the cost registers as weight and obligation rather than a sharp on-page loss, which keeps this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.3)
    The core stake—how to warn without harming—appears early and tightens as zero hour nears and the dispatcher’s demand escalates institutional risk. The decisive turn is Maris rewiring and then flipping the switch, foreclosing the path of full siren compliance in favor of an ethically riskier, quieter solution. The main weakness is that external consequences (lawsuits, discipline) remain conceptual rather than dramatized, so the price feels more implied than viscerally experienced. Still, the internal and situational pressure build coherently to a meaningful, costly stance.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Lio will remain sealed in solitary grief or risk porous connection—is clear and tight. Escalation is quiet but real: the uncanny meteor convergence compels him into physical risk at the tunnel and then emotional risk as he reopens the dome to others. The price is implicit but credible—relinquishing his protective solitude—and the final shared tracing scene reads as an earned, not easy, stance shift.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator will continue to hoard unspoken words or release them, thereby altering the ghosts’ and her own relation to the valley—is clear early and deepens with Mara’s arrival. Pressure escalates as the ghosts draw nearer to the stained glass box and Mara’s silent request reframes the covenant from storage to release. The decisive act of reading each slip aloud is a credible, costly resolution that forecloses the path of solitary guardianship. The piece remains more interior and textural than oppositional, but within that mode the conflict is tight and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—what it means to live on borrowed time when time itself has lost numbers—is clear, and pressure does build from curiosity → invitation → irrevocable trade. The central tightening is Eli’s choice to place the urn shard on the capsule, which forecloses his counted year and commits him to a new role. However, the conflict is largely one-sided: there’s little on-page resistance, competing goal, or articulated fear at the moment of sacrifice, so the trade reads more as natural fulfillment than painful test. Tension stays mostly conceptual and tonal rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake is ethical/emotional: how Rian responds to breakage and whether “tending” is sufficient or merely sentimental. Pressure escalates modestly but coherently, from small attentions to an active quarrel, to a child’s grief, to an injured animal and the fate of his poem. Each new “discord” asks him to apply his ethic at a slightly higher level of responsibility, with the drake’s care and returning the feather as the peak choice. The stakes remain quiet, though, and the sense of cost, while present, is more conceptual than viscerally sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stakes—what Mara can meaningfully change before death, and whether humans will join the interspecies script—are clear and do tighten as she undertakes physically taxing work and confronts monastic resistance. However, opposition is relatively soft: the monks complain once and quickly become students, and her illness only briefly manifests as an aching chest without escalating into consequential limitations or failures. The key turn is her decision to remodel in defiance of tradition, which successfully reweights options for all species. The ending resolves in a poised, low-drama acceptance rather than a hard ethical or practical trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—genuine understanding vs managed, “artificial” pilgrimage—is clear and deepens as the narrator uncovers the catalytic nature of the signal. Pressure escalates from observation to active intervention (cracking the vial, using the powder) to a small but decisive transgression (stealing the shard, defying the council’s script). However, opposition is mostly structural and conceptual; there is little sense of immediate risk or cost if she fails or disobeys. Tension is strong for a quiet piece but stops short of feeling genuinely fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether a new garden-oath can meaningfully replace a drowned sea-concord—is clear and threads the piece. Pressure escalates as the narrator shifts from observation to ritual action, confronts the chill “pressure of memory,” and must secure assent before planting. However, opposition is mostly atmospheric; success comes without a clear on-page risk of failure beyond implication, keeping the conflict more contemplative than fraught. The story earns a satisfying deepening rather than a sharp narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stakes—Sera’s fate and the exposure of the council’s betrayal—are clear early and tighten when the cylinder reveals the sellout to the warlord and Sera’s risky plan. The move from decoding in private to journeying into the cracks and then broadcasting under threat is a meaningful escalation with real personal and communal risk. However, the journey to the relay and the rescue of Sera feel frictionless; there are no substantive obstacles or intermediate costs testing Lio’s commitment before the final confrontation. The guards’ arrival comes late and is resolved mainly by communal response, so the external conflict skirts the edge of feeling too easy.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—what to do with the narrator’s “blessing/curse” and disorientation—is clear, and it tightens when the double sky reveals that their misfit perception may be a tool. The main turn is the realization that the deck is an instrument and the subsequent choice to leave through the hatch toward the redefined north. However, conflict remains largely internal and contemplative; there’s little felt jeopardy or resistance beyond memory of blame and present loneliness. The result is quietly satisfying but not sharply pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—rescue Serren and redeem a prior failure by embodying courageous wonder—is established early and tightened through each beat. Escalation is clear: low-risk trickery at the gate, higher-stakes cipher play with a potential alarm, then maximal-risk surrender to the storm and entry into unknown skyways. The key reversal (understanding “key in the sky” as a choice, not an object) is driven by his agency and reorients the conflict from cleverness to courage. External antagonism from the Skywrights is relatively soft (one priest and distant shouts), so pressure leans more internal than oppositional, but it holds.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are legible early (truth of the archive vs. loyalist erasure under an unstable interregnum) and escalate meaningfully once with the vellum message, then again when guards approach and the narrator opts to tear and smuggle records under direct threat. The decisive turns—using the walking pattern to open the archive, choosing what to carry, performing panic to misdirect—are all agentive and pay a clear price in imprisonment. Internal and external conflicts braid well: the narrator’s crisis-actor role vs. real-survivor ethics intensifies choices rather than sitting beside them. The only limiter is that physical danger feels somewhat muffled compared to the conceptual stakes of memory and succession.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether to reclaim a truthful, painful path home versus accept curated, gentler lies—is clear and escalates. Pressure tightens first at the locked case (must expose buried talent) and then at the stone’s demand for a “one true memory,” culminating in the midnight shuffling threat. Agency is foregrounded in the choice to offer the grief-laden memory and then to actively name each turn to resist the mountain’s mercy. The conflict is primarily internal and metaphysical rather than physical, but the ticking “nightly substitution” clock keeps it from feeling static.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stakes—freeing Brinewick versus repeating a ruthless, war-like logic—are signaled early and tightened as she advances toward the bell tower. Her navigation choices, especially rejecting seductive shortcuts in favor of preserving lives, show real ethical pressure. The final gate and mirrored self-image crystallize the conflict into a concrete decision (“return” versus “conquer”). Escalation is more a steady deepening than sharp reversal, leaving tension strong but not extreme.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stakes—exposing the murderer versus securing forgiveness without another death—are clearly signaled and interwoven. Pressure escalates through her illicit return, subversive poetry campaign, communal chorus at dawn, and the physical lunge by the guilty man, culminating in the choice to sacrifice her art rather than a life. The canyon’s demand for what one loves most gives the climax a concrete ethical trade-off, not just a symbolic gesture. A slightly sharper on-page sense of Mara’s fear or temptation at the moment of sacrifice could have heightened the tension further.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stakes—physical survival of workshop/self and existential need to extract meaning from failure—are clear and tightly braided. Pressure escalates as the pontoons soften and time is limited by her held breaths, pushing her into deeper, riskier engagement with the statue and her own worst memory. The resolution arises from her agency in embracing “kintsugi intentions” and using past failures as literal repair material, with the emotional price felt on the page. What holds this just below the very top is that once the repair design appears, execution proceeds relatively smoothly; we don’t see a further reversal or complication that tests her new stance.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Lio will cling to aestheticized distance or risk genuine emotional availability—is clear from early on and tightens as the oasis “asks for more than leaving.” Escalation is mostly internal but tangible: the move from merely fulfilling a promise in silence to openly confessing his avoidance and making a new, vulnerable commitment. The price is his surrender of the shell as a private talisman and the protective story he’s told himself about his aloofness. The piece could sustain a slightly sharper moment of resistance or temptation to back out, but the pressure curve still reads.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether tenderness/whisper can actually reach Jonas across the water—is clear early and sharpened by his competing belief in sheer volume. Pressure escalates from theoretical lesson with Sello to a risky, ritualized attempt that might fail, then to Jonas’s unexpected, emotionally charged arrival. The cost is internal and relational rather than life-or-death: the narrator risks stark, distilled honesty; Jonas must confront the harm of his loudness. The conflict remains quiet but not static, and the final choice to tend the light differently reads as an earned alteration of tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—finding safe ways home through a transformed landscape, crystallized in Sera’s search for her son—is clear early and steadily intensifies. Escalation is accumulative: failing hydraulics, untrustworthy constellations, sinkholes, and the censer’s lunar sway progressively limit options, culminating in the risky night journey to the aqueduct. The boy’s reveal as caller resolves the narrative pressure in a way that feels earned rather than coincidental. The conflict is more quiet and fated than combative, so the cost is primarily emotional rather than driven by a sharp on-page dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara can create genuine psychological safety in a world where empathy is weaponized and her own honesty is dangerous—is signaled early and sharpened by each turn. Pressure escalates from private constraint (her tongue), to experimental relief (testing and using the eye), to community-level application (nightly councils), and finally to external enforcement (Ministry patrol). Her climactic choice to mislead the captain and bury the real eye forecloses the path of unmitigated truth with a clear ethical and personal cost. The tension is more moral and psychological than kinetic, but it tightens convincingly under the situational/causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.4)
    For a quiet piece, the stakes—decoding the drowned man’s last gesture and what to do with a life reduced to fragments—are clear and present early through Eamon’s insistence on the “empty grip” as an unread message. Escalation is subtle but real: description of absences → deduction at the piling → discovery of the packet → choice to speak the name and archive the man’s trace. The pressure is largely conceptual and emotional rather than peril-based, but it coheres under a situational/accumulative lens and culminates in a tangible act (entering the man into the logbook) that forecloses anonymity. It falls just short of the highest band because the protagonist’s personal risk or loss remains more implied than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will finally choose a path that is hers, even at the cost of obligation and inherited debt—is legible early and tightens through the journey and the rising water. The main escalation comes with the reveal of Ellis and the binary passages, where internal conflict (connection/debt vs. self-directed choice) is concretized into a single, pressured decision as water seeps in. Her decision to take the wet passage alone is clearly costly (lost family legacy, no return path) and driven by her agency, not coincidence. The piece is quiet rather than twisty, so tension stays emotional more than visceral, but that suits the design.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—save the kingdom from a bleeding sky versus accept a seductive form of power—is clear early via the Star-Priest’s warning and tightens effectively at the ember ring’s offer. The escalation from private dreams to a cosmic bargain inside a literal wound reads as a single strong tightening, with Maelin’s descent constituting a meaningful, agency-driven turn. The moral price of losing the throne is somewhat summarized rather than viscerally dramatized, which blunts the sense of loss. Nevertheless, the internal and external conflicts are well braided and resolve through her choice rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central stake—whether Lio will submit to commodification of his suns or reassert a different value system—is clear and sharpened once Toma reveals the Academy’s intent and his own refusal. Pressure escalates from private philosophy to public act as Lio chooses a protest that risks professional exile and perhaps safety, while also defining his friendship with Toma. The act of routing every sun through the shell and throwing a constellation in the Academy’s face is a clear, agency-driven tightening. What keeps this just shy of the top tier is that the negative consequences remain largely implied and the mines’ needs are gestured to but not dramatized as a counterweight on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether he’s consumed by temporal chaos or can stabilize himself through narrative—is clear from the opening. Pressure escalates via repeated returns to the grave and the self-swaps, each tightening the sense that time will keep leaking unless he changes tactics. The pivotal turn is when he thanks his younger self and the looped graveyard image loses its power; that choice directly reconfigures the conflict. Stakes remain internal and conceptual, but the risk of permanent psychic fragmentation is felt rather than merely asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Iris can mediate Aster’s unspoken fear of blame into recognition rather than accusation—is clear and threads from package to birthing room. Escalation is gentle but present: Iris moves from reading a note to entering a tense post-birth space and subtly staging the father’s view to avert a potential rupture. Resolution is earned by her deliberate framing, but the pressure never quite bites; it feels like things are likely to go well, so the cost of failure is more implied than viscerally felt in the prose. The piece succeeds as a quiet, situational conflict, but that quietness also caps the intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stakes—preventing the platform’s failure and reconfiguring Ila’s relationship to her scars—are clear and braided effectively. Pressure escalates through the time constraint of the held breath, the ink’s tendency to crystallize under tremor, and the literal gust that strains the rune mid-stroke. Ila’s choice to add the forbidden fourth circle and then to inscribe her arm is a decisive act that forecloses continued secrecy about her past. If anything, the physical danger to the platform and valley is gestured rather than viscerally dramatized, keeping this just shy of maximal intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Marin can meaningfully atone before the orchard and June’s legacy are lost—is signaled early and tightened by the ritual’s risk (electric loop, ghostly response, fuse pop). Internal and external conflicts interweave: her professional cruelty and her reliance on “imperfect miracles” to manage supernatural and civic loss. The key turn is her decision to offer a concrete, reputational sacrifice (the column) rather than a purely symbolic apology. Stakes could escalate one notch further—e.g., a more explicit risk to her current status—but they are still clear and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator will face and unify their own and the universe’s illusions or continue to soothe the “ache of ending” with comforting lies—is clear and internally coherent. Escalation occurs via the descent into the mirror chamber, the activation of spiral arbitration, and the progressive naming of illusions and their costs until the narrator steps into the spiral’s center. The resolution is earned by agency: they choose integration over fragmentation, and this forecloses the path of self-protective illusion. However, the price of this choice is more conceptual than viscerally felt; we’re told what is at risk, but we don’t quite see a specific loss or sacrifice dramatized at peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—maintaining the station’s accuracy/promise under hostile conditions versus Ivar’s more philosophical curiosity—is signaled and tightened by the ice blockage and the late sighting. The ice repair is a concrete pressure point where tactics matter, and the inspector’s arrival converts systemic pressure into personal confrontation. Escalation is coherent but relatively gentle; nothing forces a drastic sacrifice beyond a late/missed measurement, so the emotional cost remains mostly conceptual. The final renunciation (leaving one clock wrong) is a meaningful stance crystallization but could resonate more if the threat to his role or to others were sharpened slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Lena will uphold institutional secrecy or side with the auditors and the clinics—is clear and tightened as she shifts from surveilling to engaging. Escalation is driven by her agency: she chooses to run the two-pulse scan, to approach the fence instead of reporting them, and ultimately to transmit the logs. Internal and external conflicts interweave convincingly via the theme of permeability. The felt price of her decision is present but somewhat abstract, slightly muting the sharpness of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether she will follow or transform her father’s relationship to risk—is established early and tightened as she chooses to obey the note, ride the subway, follow arrows into the storm, and finally curate then confront. Conflict is largely internal and conceptual, but each stage (Harborline’s “THE HOUSE ALWAYS LOSES IF YOU LEAVE,” the warning “DO NOT CONFUSE EDGE WITH ESCAPE,” the hospital-line scrawl) incrementally narrows her options toward a stance about gambling versus teaching. The final “best bet was learning to stop” lands as an earned renunciation with visible emotional cost. Escalation is quiet rather than dramatic, but coherent and sufficient for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara stays in safe estrangement or risks genuine connection—is clearly signaled and focused. Pressure escalates when the caller admits she chose a wrong number to avoid a real goodbye, mirroring Mara’s avoidance and narrowing her psychological options. The use of the forbidden dial-out key is a concrete escalation of risk, not just an internal shift. Stakes remain primarily internal and quiet, but they’re sharpened enough that the final call feels necessary rather than optional.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the regenerated covenant will repeat denial or confront culpability—is established early and tightened when the locket forces Mara to reconsider the “first cause.” Escalation is driven by her agency: rewriting the book, presenting the locket and proximate causes to the mayor and priest, then reading the confession aloud in public. The cost is moral and social rather than physical but is tangible: leaders are exposed, an old narrative is destroyed, and communal grief is reopened. One could imagine an even sharper moment of direct resistance or pushback, but the quiet, procedural conflict fits the story’s scale and still narrows options decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—finding a cure for loneliness that doesn’t become another hoarded resource—is clear and sharpened by the reciprocity rule. Escalation is primarily accumulative: the chain of small kindnesses builds toward the station’s “polite anarchy” and the narrator’s shift from consumer to participant. The key tightening is the realization that the rock cools unless kindness is passed on, which forces the narrator into action and then into the costed decision to return it and risk intimacy with Mara. Because external resistance is mild and everything goes right once the chain starts, the conflict stays lower-pressure than it might in a piece aiming for maximal tension, but within this mode, the stakes and costs are legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    The central stake—whether Iris can confront and live with her grief without “drowning”—is legible early and tightens convincingly as she moves deeper into the forest. Pressure escalates at the observatory stone when her brother’s “last panic” floods her, reframing the stillpoint as confrontation rather than escape, and the cost is palpable. Her choice to continue dowsing after that realization, and then to kneel at the pool and accept the painful insight instead of turning away, functions as an earned resolution. The conflict remains primarily internal, with few external impediments, which slightly limits the sense of narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—how Mara responds to the new signal and her past mistake—intensifies once the anomaly tightens and the cadence evokes vines, forcing her into a more personal, higher-cost edit. Escalation is internal but real: she moves from abstract, procedural corrections to confronting her own discourtesy toward the courier and accepting responsibility at a finer granularity. The choice to revise by inserting a kindness rather than undoing consequences is a meaningful narrowing of options with moral cost. Stakes remain modestly scaled (no immediate life-or-death), but for the story’s frame they land with appropriate weight.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central stake—whether the narrator can wrest some proof of existence back from a world that forgets them—is clear and emotionally legible, with the mapping project and later performance as concrete tactics. Pressure escalates meaningfully when the foghorn fails and Aster urges the narrator to sign faster, turning an almost-game into an urgent capture before the moment closes. The decision to offer the notebook to the musician, risking ridicule for a fragile, experimental piece of “music,” is a credible closing choice that tests the narrator’s fear of being unseen. The conflict stays mostly internal and aesthetic, which fits the mode but keeps pressure in a quieter band than it might otherwise reach.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.7)
    The central stake—how Sera will use her “fire” in a world of tracked reading—is signaled early and tightens convincingly as she discovers Miko’s demand to “BRING THE FIRE HERE.” The escalation is primarily internal but still tense: each artifact forces her closer to a reckoning with her own methods, culminating in the drawer labeled with her supposedly destroyed lending card number. The final choice to copy and broadcast rather than burn is both a fulfillment and a renunciation, with a clearly implied personal and political risk. The absence of an on-page antagonist keeps the pressure slightly abstract but does not undercut the core conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—using an empathy experiment to “resurrect” the dead in shared memory—is clear from the outset and intensifies as Sato’s buried grief is exposed. Escalation operates through deepening entanglement: tapping becomes rebellion, memories become visible, and alarms warn of neural overload while they choose to remain. The conflict between institutional protocol and personal need culminates in their shared refusal to abort the experience immediately. The only slight softness is that the physical danger remains somewhat abstract compared to the emotional jeopardy, though the emotional stakes are strong enough to carry the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—prove the whisper system or lose her job and see the maze cleared—is signaled cleanly and then interwoven with very concrete physical stakes (a storm-compromised port and an injured stevedore). Pressure tightens credibly: from experimental challenge to life-or-death coordination during mechanical failure, forcing Mara to expose and operationalize her secret conduit. Her agency drives all major turns, and the price of success includes giving up unilateral control and anonymity over her safety network. The resolution leans slightly toward a clean win, with little lasting friction from authority or visible emotional repercussion, which keeps it just short of maximal sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stakes—whether the girl will face what she’s done and whether the fisher’s body and story will surface—are clear early and steadily tightened. Escalation is accumulative and causal: the star-net reveals more, the mirror descends, the body appears, then the help-signal raises external stakes with the approaching patrol. Agency is shared: he engineers conditions, but she must look, recognize, and then speak to the authorities. The conflict is more moral/emotional than physically perilous, which slightly limits the visceral sense of risk but fits the story’s scale.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—the grove’s fate—is clearly established and consistently pressed, and Eli’s scheme produces a tangible escalation from secret planning to town-wide attention to the mayor’s intervention. His agency drives every meaningful turn, and the external conflict is intelligently braided with his internal ethic of quiet persuasion. However, opposition stays mostly offstage and soft (“unspoken irritation”), and there’s little sense that his plan might meaningfully fail or backfire, which blunts the felt cost. The result is strong, coherent tension but not quite the knife-edge pressure that would push this into the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes—freedom versus control, and a father’s fear of losing his child—are legible early and tighten around the decision to detach the chains. The whale’s call as a trigger for action, and Rusk shifting from obstruction to ally, give the main beat credible escalation and a real price (relinquishing his daughter and his illusion of control). The narrator’s own final renunciation of the docks adds a secondary, internal stake that converges nicely with the island plot. The conflict resolves a bit gently—Rusk’s acceptance comes quickly once his heart unlocks—so the resistance feels slightly under-tested for the level of thematic gravity.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator can find an honest way to live with grief after the mandate—is clear early via the notice at the co-op. Pressure deepens through Orin’s morally fraught confession and his proposed ritual, culminating in the choice to place the bouquet outside and accept a new relation to grief. The first fragment of involuntary laughter at the goat provides a satisfying micro-turn that tests her “emotional void.” The conflict remains primarily internal and cooperative, so while the cost is felt, there’s little active resistance or jeopardy beyond her reluctance.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Lira will accept the sacred separation from her dead brother or risk dissolving that boundary—is clear early and tightened through Soren’s warnings about forgetting “which side of life they belong to.” Pressure escalates as her paraphrases move from legal decree to sacred carvings to her brother’s story, each step risking deeper dissolution (culminating in Soren’s failed physical grasp). The final walk with the shadow is an earned act of agency that forecloses the safer path of “repairs, not crossings.” The conflict remains largely internal and aesthetic rather than viscerally perilous, which keeps the tension elegant but slightly cool.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—acquiring the reed tongue without surrendering her core awakening or colluding in Joren’s self-hollowing—is clear and tightens through successive refusals and escalated offers. The key reversal is Mara’s shift from offering her own awakening to proposing a structural change in how Joren uses awakenings, backed by the courtyard spiral. Cost is real but quiet: Joren’s vow to stop buying others’ clarity and his sharing of a defining star-memory rather than selling it. The main limitation is that Mara’s side of the tension rarely feels genuinely risky for her, so the pressure reads more moral-intellectual than viscerally fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether connection will be smoothed into spectacle or allowed to retain its painful texture—is introduced early and tightened through Mara’s fear of a hollow project and her deception to secure funding. Pressure escalates credibly from a philosophical disagreement to a public, career-risking act of honesty at the press walk. The ethical conflict (comfort vs. truth, metrics vs. lived voices) is well-braided with the experimental work on sound. The only slight limit is that the consequences of exposing the raw archive are implied rather than partially dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stakes—whether Mara can find a survivable, non-destructive way to live with grief and whether the observatory’s light will be aimed toward harm or healing—are clear early via her rock bottom and Sen’s warning. Pressure tightens through the risk of attempting the basil revival for Lysa and the implicit danger of misusing the curtains’ power, culminating in the starbeam test that could have read as verdict or failure. Escalation is quiet but real: success with the basil both relieves immediate pressure and commits her to the more demanding path of guiding many strangers. The moral and emotional cost is felt, though the conflict never quite reaches a knife-edge crisis that might have pushed this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stakes are ethical and conceptual: what to do with the grandmother’s pattern-mapping method in a broken economic order, and whether to treat it as prophecy, profit tool, or communal reconstruction. There is a meaningful tightening when Aurel admits his shameful past use and the grandmother’s last-page note reframes the method’s purpose, leading to their decision to take it into the streets and then to publish in “plain speech.” However, pressure remains low-intensity; there’s little sense that any option is foreclosed with tangible on-page cost beyond implied responsibility. As a result, escalation feels more like deepening curiosity than a genuine test under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—what to do with weaponized nostalgia and forbidden memory—intensifies as she proceeds from opening the vault to witnessing Keth’s council weaponize archives, then finally obtaining a formula that could sever lives from memories. Escalation is driven by her choices: stealing the key, choosing to keep turning the pagoda despite emotional assault, and breaking her own habits to reach the last catalog. The cost is legible in her weeping, her partial deception of the elders, and her commitment to a risky new pedagogy. The conflict stays primarily internal and conceptual, but remains coherent and pressing for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—what to do about the corrupted dreams and the unbound shadow—is legible early via the damaged archives and Mara’s refusal to purge. Pressure deepens when the video comparison reveals the shadow as a consequence of abandoned anchors, leading to the key turn where Mara must decide whether to treat it as threat, wound, or person. Her choice to risk offering her private dusk and stone creates a meaningful ethical trade-off, and the institutional resolution (revived rite) reweights the world. Still, escalation is more intellectual and lyrical than visceral; there’s minimal resistance from the shadow or institution, so tension never feels truly knife-edge.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—how to balance self-respect with compassion in response to fraud—is signaled early and tightened through the Boundaries/Mercy lists and the decision to call Tessa rather than simply cut her off. The phone conversation is the key pressure point, forcing a morally complex choice between punitive severance and enabling lies. The ultimate stance (reporting while offering aid and taking the animals) clearly forecloses simpler paths of either vengeful withdrawal or naïve forgiveness. The escalation is primarily internal and ethical rather than situational, but it remains coherent and substantive.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara can relocate the miracle and thereby reconfigure both the neighborhood’s sickness and her relationship to her own wound—is clear early and tightens steadily. Escalation is primarily through self-imposed physical cost (she opens the seam more with each step, tunnels for “hours” while pain rises) and deepened knowledge (the plants’ guilt and the recognition that the miracle was meant for the street). Her decisive agency at several points (choosing to worsen her injury, tunneling instead of accepting the status quo, ultimately pouring the light into the pavement) earns the resolution. The only thing keeping this shy of the very top band is the absence of a real reversal or obstacle beyond endurance; the path, once known, unfolds without serious complication.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—can Mara locate and responsibly handle “unused love,” both others’ and her own—is clear and grows as the strip’s emotional weight emerges. Escalation is mostly internal and textural: from curiosity, to psychometric inundation with Eli’s thwarted love, to the pressured choice of whether and how to use this “vault” for her own unsent goodbyes. Her decision to project the blank film and speak her torn letters into its light is the crucial tightening, foreclosing her prior pattern of secrecy. The stakes remain intimate and somewhat abstract, with no sharp external reversal, which limits the sense of pressure compared to the very strong thematic and atmospheric work.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the city remains creatively starved or reclaims its stardust—is established early and escalates through Sel’s repeated, colder, more pressured nights of tracing meteors. Sel’s agency clearly drives the major turn (aligning the astrolabe with the spiral to open the vault), and there’s a conceptual cost in defying the elders and unleashing unpredictable human creativity. However, antagonistic pressure remains abstract: the elders’ control never manifests as concrete threat, and Sel never faces a real risk of failure or punishment on the page. The tension is felt, but more as solemn ritual than sharp, narrowing danger.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the archive’s branching possibilities will be collapsed into a single profitable history—is clear and escalates from quiet duty to a direct clash with corporate auditors. The key tightening beats are opening the archive, confronting the specific harm of the missing crate/town, and then facing the auditors’ collapse device. The guard’s agency drives resolution by choosing to be split, reroute the crate, plant ember seeds, and finally sing the wave-function charm to deter the auditors. The auditors’ retreat comes a bit quickly and without much resistance, keeping the pressure high but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator will remain bound to externally verified identity or cross into a wilder, self-authored frontier—is signaled early (“before it rusted shut”) and deepens as each translocation reveals a new fear. Pressure tightens when the forest stops moving them “at random” and starts answering questions, culminating in the choice to seed the gear under the tongue and seek the hinge, then to turn the crank and let go of the old argument. The cost is conceptual but concrete: they exit without knowing where they’ll wake, relinquishing certainty and applause in favor of being guided by unanswered questions. The piece could gain further intensity from one more beat where the narrator nearly refuses or backslides, but for this length the escalation is coherent and sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—losing the dog vs. facing her own fear—is legible from the break onward and escalates through the vigil into the perilous descent and wire-cutting. The key tightening beats (choosing the darkest descent, using the punch to free the dog) are clearly driven by Mara’s agency. Internal and external conflicts braid well, particularly in the choice to walk “beside the fear until it tires” on the return. The pressure could edge higher if there were a more palpable risk of failure or a more difficult trade-off at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—safety from the hunters versus the human need for voice and touch—is established early and sharpened by Edda’s therapy requirements. Pressure escalates from policy-level discomfort to a concrete ethical breach when the narrator whispers ‘C,’ with REMAIN alarms and approaching footsteps clarifying real risk. The moral calculus is credible: he chooses a more dangerous but more humane form of care, then a strategic concealment under the piano. Some external consequences are deferred off-page, but the internal and situational cost are still palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—expose the pretender—is clearly articulated early and leads to a concrete confrontation in the throne hall. There is one solid escalation when Orun is asked to sunder the star, risking the sealed Librarium and the library’s integrity to obtain irrefutable proof. However, the journey itself is relatively frictionless: once he accepts the quest, the library yields each clue in orderly sequence without serious reversals or credible chances of failure. The emotional and ethical calculus (truth vs. preservation, power vs. principle) is present but kept at a cool, nearly foregone register.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding the disappearing routes versus protecting fragile recovery—is clearly signaled and tightened through the beacon schedule discovery and fog excursion. Pressure escalates from abstract puzzle to an on-page ethical choice about whether to disseminate or obscure navigational information. The decision to encode the schedule in taps rather than in official reports is a credible renunciation that forecloses full transparency. The conflict remains largely contemplative; a bit more felt jeopardy (for reef, people, or Mara’s role) in the encounter scene would deepen stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether to risk breaking the lull and reawakening the rebellion—is clear and threads the piece. Escalation is primarily internal and procedural: from idle watching to decoding, to actively tuning the console by the hum, to committing Sael’s code and her own words, to waiting for a reply under a gathering sense of risk. Opposition remains off-stage (the Directorate, jammers, the danger of being discovered), which keeps tension somewhat abstract; the sudden footsteps arrive very late and function more as a final charge than a true complicating turn. The conflict works and pays off, but at this level a bit more on-page resistance or sharper sense of what she stands to lose would deepen it.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the embryo will reinscribe coercive destiny or be reprogrammed toward repair—is legible and escalates as the warning about imprinting and the unsealing ritual approach. The decoding of the kite-script and the decision to let the embryo imprint on a story of chosen tradition constitute a meaningful tightening. However, there is minimal active opposition; most danger is conceptual and anticipatory rather than contested by on-page forces. As a result, the tension is steady and engaging but never quite knife-edge.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Mina can coexist with drone-like sounds and remain at this exposed site—is clear and escalates through two key pressure points (the initial drone panic and later ambiguous buzzing). Her freezing mid-translation and subsequent negotiation with the teen operator externalize the internal conflict. The later choice to proactively seek stillness by the lens before panic “grows teeth” shows adaptation rather than reset. While the conflict remains largely internal and quiet, its progression and price are legible and satisfying for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara can find a way to work with a fragmented reality and reach her sister—is clearly signaled and coherently pressured by the library’s constricting walls and the knotted prisms. Escalation proceeds through concrete beats: the blank tarot cards (loss of old tools), the shimmering crossings on the atlas (new but risky method), and the descent to the bound lens where her actions materially affect outcomes. Her agency in untangling light and choosing to accept a changed sister resolves the conflict in a way that forecloses her earlier strategy of repetition and control. The cost is somewhat intellectualized rather than viscerally painful on the page, which keeps this just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—uncovering and disrupting the engineered time-slowing—is clear early and tightens as Keir chooses to enter the ink and then to confront rather than flee the obelisk. The major escalation comes when he realizes the Council of Hours is using raiders as bait, raising the moral and political stakes beyond mere survival. His choice to destroy the obelisk under risk, and later to rely on drone data instead of vanishing ink, constitutes credible agency with implied long-term cost. The main limitation is that the personal risk and potential consequences of opposing the Council remain conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether to keep dangerous truths frozen or risk scandal to force accountability—is signaled early and tightened through the discovery that the letter is deliberate bait. The decisive escalation is the archivist’s choice to misfile the letter as public scholarship via dormant networks, knowingly courting charges of sabotage. External pressure from the Council and the threat to Mara’s status materialize at the end, bringing the moral and political conflict onstage. The cost is more implied than paid (no immediate punishment or loss), slightly softening the impact of what is otherwise a strong conflict spine.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—whether violence or continuity will govern what happens to Lio and to Maris/Tarek’s bond—is signaled early and tightened meaningfully when the militia trucks arrive and rifles tap the glass. Maris’s key acts (sheathing the rifle, orchestrating the roses’ lesson, making Tarek kneel) deepen pressure and force a stance from Tarek. The external escalation resolves a bit smoothly, as the militia backs away with limited pushback or visible consequence, softening the felt price. Still, the conflict between order-through-force and continuity-through-quiet is credibly tested and resolved through character agency.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—securing the goddess’s echo—is clearly signaled and then reweighted, with escalation at the moment the constellations stumble and harmonics erupt into “each one a path, each one a predator.” Rovan’s choice of the quietest path and his final decision to discard the spike provide meaningful tightening and a real trade-off between personal desire and collective safety. The pressure is more mythic and tonal than visceral, so the danger never quite feels harrowing, but it is coherent and steadily intensifies under the chosen lens. The cost is conceptual and emotional rather than bloody, yet it’s present and credible for this scale.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether and how to reveal Sato’s fraud—is clear early and tightens as Celeste’s logical contradictions accumulate and the darkroom confrontation forces a choice. The turn from “expose the fake planet” to “salvage the institution by redirecting the story and compelling confession” is a meaningful reconfiguration. Internal and external conflicts interweave well, but the negotiation resolves quickly, with limited sense that Celeste is truly risking her professional capital or that Sato might refuse. Escalation works but could sustain a bit more frictive back-and-forth at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Lio can confront and in some sense repair his abandonment—remains clear, and pressure builds from eerie invitation to high emotional risk once the infant cry comes through. His agency is present at key junctures (choosing to go, agreeing to tether, voicing the apology), and the cost is the painful re-experiencing of his sister’s last need. The escalation is mostly internal and accumulative rather than sharply reversed, which suits the piece but keeps the tension relatively controlled rather than harrowing. A hint of real possibility that he might refuse or flee at the last moment would make the tightening even more acute.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central conflict—enforced ignorance vs. chosen, examined forgetting—manifests in the tension between the teacher’s chant and Inez’s quiet subversion. Escalation is clear: the teacher’s tightening jaw, the thickening hush, then the boy’s proverb as a spike of danger that forces immediate action. Inez’s interjection redirects the conflict rather than overthrowing it, producing a subtle but real change in how the ritual is held. The cost is mostly conceptual/social (naming the labor of forgetting, risking attention from authority), which keeps tension thoughtful but slightly soft on visceral risk.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the post-fire order will calcify around vengeance or aberrant mercy—is established early via the Cinders/Keepers naming tension and Samir’s Grasp concept. Pressure tightens meaningfully when Lina sees her cousin in the vision, forcing a concrete choice between killing, forgiving, or accepting Samir’s grueling alternative. The eventual fitting of the Grasp and shared bread dramatize a price: labor, public restraint, and the bitter difficulty of mercy. Escalation is clear but relatively smooth and contemplative; we never feel a genuine risk that Samir’s stance will be violently rejected in-scene, which keeps it a notch below maximal intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—mending the fractured orchard-time and giving Silas his final bow—emerges clearly and tightens once Silas explains the splintered timeline and the need for “echoes.” The escalation is largely internal and textural: the intertwining of eras, the ritual with the coin, and Mara’s culminating choice to finish the trick. Though there’s no hard jeopardy, the pressure of eternal almost-applause versus release carries emotional weight appropriate to the piece’s scale. Still, the sense of risk to Mara herself and her worldly stakes (rent, livelihood) remain more atmospheric than directly pressured in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—what to do with this dangerous, contested new sensitivity—is clear, and pressure escalates from private experiment to life-safety mission to corporate/legal coercion. Agency is strong: Mara chooses to test somatic markers, to enter the hazardous tunnel, and later to refuse the company’s buyout in favor of an open protocol. The cost is present but a bit soft on the page; the recall agents and lawyers feel politely menacing rather than genuinely coercive, so her resistance carries more conceptual than visceral risk. Nonetheless, the story articulates a meaningful trade-off between personal safety/comfort and civic responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stakes—surviving the flood-sealed cave and fulfilling her mapping/archival duty—are clear and escalate once the tide traps her and the fossil begins to act. Pressure deepens with the discovery that the longing is non-human, which reweights her mission and pushes her toward the decision to leave the fossil as a bridge. Still, the physical peril from the tide recedes quickly once the vent is found, so the conflict leans heavily on conceptual stakes rather than a sharp, narrowing choice under duress. The ending’s key trade-off (personal comfort vs. honoring the other presence) is effective but could be made more acute.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—who controls the meaning and use of the prophecy, and thus the workers’ future—is signaled early and tightened as Lysa’s private decoding becomes a collective challenge to authority. Escalation is clear: solitary listening → systematic cataloging → group participation and emergent shared map → direct clash when the foreman tries to seize the jar → open defiance at the cliff. Agency is strongly Lysa’s, but the workers’ collective stand at the climax meaningfully raises the price. The main limitation is that the external conflict with the foreman/owners is mostly compressed into a single late beat, so the risk feels more implied than fully fought through.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Rina can repurpose her “burned” status into meaningful repair—is clear and mounts coherently as she moves from solitary ascent to coded outreach to direct intervention with Elsi. The key tightening is the shift from abstract intention to concrete repair in a confined, pressured space (the tide cave, shattered radio, traumatized courier). Costs and alternatives are implicit rather than sharply dramatized—Rina never seems in real danger of refusing to help or failing—but the emotional risk of re-engaging after past betrayal is legible. A slightly sharper on-page sense of jeopardy or potential failure would raise the stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clear and early: Rowan’s lost wife and Senn’s endangered daughter tied to a single crossing and a live clock. Pressure tightens through the revelation of the original bargain, the condition Rowan imposes, and the narrowing window before the gutters stop ticking. The main turn—Senn’s stripped confession and the river answering—is coherent and anchored in Rowan’s insistence on names and essence, though the external magic absorbs some of the potential cost that might have fallen more squarely on Rowan. Internal and external conflicts are interwoven but could press harder against each other at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether this oasis will remain a temporally fractured refuge or be allowed to move into a single, mortal present—is clear and steadily sharpened, especially once Sera fears being left in the “wrong hour.” Escalation comes through accumulating anomalies and the realization that the oasis has been self-protectively hoarding versions of itself, culminating in the high-pressure choice to center time via the lantern. The conceptual and ethical cost (losing the refuge of stacked timelines versus granting honest change) is strong, though the piece keeps the emotional texture relatively calm and contemplative rather than intensely fraught. As a result, the conflict feels profound but not quite knife-edge tense.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will move from hidden, private caretaking into visible risk to stop a smuggling breach—is established early and tightened when she takes the skiff to Pier Nine. The investigation at the lock is a clear escalation, with the missing gauge tooth and improvised mirror-light turning into a single high-focus test that can fail. Internal fear versus action weaves well with the external stakes, and the truck being stopped before the ferry gives the sequence tangible consequence. Pressure is coherent but relatively gentle; there’s little sense of immediate physical peril, which keeps this strong but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.5)
    Conflict is mostly internal but real: the protagonist’s desire to hide versus the pull of responsibility toward the extinct birds and, by extension, the living world. Pressure escalates when the names of the last moa pairs appear—this concretizes earlier guilt and forces a choice between wallowing in remorse and acting. The decisive move is to speak the unsaid words, accept the instructions, and then deliberately create a flawed, mortal record; that forecloses the path of passive isolation and imaginary restitution. The stakes remain intimate rather than dramatic, but the deepening is clear and the price—accepting limitation and ongoing responsibility—is well articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator will keep hiding or risk rejoining with Arin—is legible early through his profession and internal monologue. Pressure escalates from low-stakes anonymous letters to the hazardous specificity of Arin’s blank scrap and spiral; his choice to confess publicly rather than privately is a credible sharpening of risk. Internal and external conflicts braid effectively: the public-art context forces him to literalize his private failing. The piece stays quiet, with no explicit negative reaction or tangible loss shown, which slightly softens the felt cost despite the strong structural turn.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are signaled early—personal, communal, and potentially planetary—and coherently escalate as institutional and community pressures converge on Mara’s next decode. The decisive tightening comes when she rejects both sanctioned paths (broadcast as-is or surrender control) to send a deceptive shield under everyone’s noses, risking professional and social blowback. The cosmic conflict (tricksters’ manipulation) and human conflict (Votaries vs Quiet vs academia) interlock so that her single act addresses both. The on-page cost is more implied than dramatized in aftermath, but the risk and narrowing of options at the climax are legible.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stakes—survive and navigate a hostile, mutinous space to uncover the “vital key,” later reframed as freeing the mentor and changing the nexus’s terms—are clear and escalate coherently. Pressure tightens through concrete reversals: the wall trying to fold the narrator into “airless bricks,” the Archive’s star-void, the mentor trapped in “compressed corridors,” culminating in the risky decision to turn the mutiny outward by planting the compass. Internal conflict (panic vs resolve) interweaves with external spatial threat, and the organ’s sustained chord at the climax heightens a real sense of brink. The cost is perceptible in the risk of being sealed in and in the irreversible transformation of a once-tyrannical but familiar geometry.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator can extract a buried, institutionally suppressed truth and translate it into communal empathy—is legible from the first paragraph. Pressure deepens as the ribbon’s quick-release knot implies premeditation and links to the troupe, then tightens in the shed when Maren’s tells (twitch, laugh, ribbon on lance) corner her narrative. The protagonist’s agency at the climax (confronting Maren, invoking their own blindness, offering the painting) resolves the conflict in a morally pointed way. Still, Maren’s emotional collapse feels somewhat unresisted, which softens the sense of cost and hard choice at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will remain a deserter in the official record or be restored—is clearly signaled and tightened through concrete escalations: decoding, night climb, confrontation, annex breach, formal correction. Internal and external stakes interweave well, with Mara’s dread and doubt fueling her confrontations. However, resistance never quite bites hard: Sato yields relatively easily, and there’s little sense of institutional or personal risk if Mara is wrong. As a result, escalation feels steady and satisfying but not punishingly sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether to enter the illegal amnesty program and relinquish the old legal self—is clear and culminates in a concrete act (exposing their own face, preparing to mail the plate). Pressure builds via discovery and the moral/psychic risk of becoming “unfindable,” but the internal struggle is underplayed; there’s not much sense of a viable alternative path being weighed on the page. As a result, the escalation feels more like deepening inevitability than a sharp, costly fork.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether he will remain complicit in enclosing loops or re-mark the territory—is clear early and deepens when loops begin to trap ambulances and lawsuits close in. Pressure escalates from inherited habits to algorithmic harm to institutional collapse, forcing a stance on maps as instruments of control. His agency in stripping the data with Mara and then choosing to leave and re-walk his father’s route is a credible, costed resolution. The piece leans more on intellectual/ethical stakes than visceral jeopardy, which slightly softens the felt intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stakes—save the inscriptions and prevent Nera from being crushed by solitary grief—are signaled early and deepen as we move from abstract scholarly failure to a specific, emotionally risky rite. Escalation occurs through knowledge and emotional cost: the dream reveals the temple as a grief vault and demands they perform the rite with Nera’s brother’s journal, rather than merely publishing a translation. Agency is clear in the narrator’s decisions to enter the dream, to share the revelation carefully, and to perform the rite with Nera. The conflict stays mostly internal/relational rather than sharply contested, but the price of witnessing (taking on another’s grief) is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—confront and undo the curse tied to the failed mirror trick and frozen confession—is clear, and pressure escalates from public humiliation to solitary descent, to confronting the coffin, to choosing how to dismantle the curse. Thalen’s agency drives each turn, notably in the choice to unbend the mirror mentally and to feed his own seed into the curse’s machinery. However, the central crisis (the warring seeds and mirror cage) is resolved almost frictionlessly once he hits on the correct tactic, with little sense that it might fail or exact a sharper personal price. External and internal stakes braid well, but an extra beat of resistance or potential loss would deepen the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—finding her mother within the collapsing boundary between future and present—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure escalates cleanly when the cracked seal causes overlapping dreams to “tear at one another like dogs,” forcing Lysa to either flee or pay a bodily price; her decision to deepen her wound is a clear tightening with visible cost. Internal and external stakes (personal reunion vs. failing covenant) interweave well in that moment. What keeps this just short of higher bands is the relative lack of complication or reversal once she decides to bleed; success follows almost immediately with minimal friction or lingering uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—saving Jory’s soul without damning someone else—is clear early and tightens steadily through Madam Vey’s demand for new collateral. The cruel alternative of stealing a stranger’s destiny sharpens the moral calculus before the deeper reversal: discovering Jory’s restored future has been partially re-sold. Mira’s ultimate decision to sacrifice her ability to forget pain, binding Jory’s fate to her own, forecloses easier paths with explicit cost. Internal and external conflict braid well, with no deus ex or soft resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether he can find a meaningful, non-applause-based purpose after public humiliation—is clear and deepens as the scrap shifts from a safe factual puzzle to a conduit for grief, his and Marla’s. Escalation is primarily internal but still legible: facts-as-armor → intrusive memory of the echoing show → investigative immersion → vulnerable proposal to Marla. The final stance (purpose as what you do after applause, in service of others’ memories) is an earned resolution. External stakes remain modest, which keeps tension from reaching the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Nerin will pursue haunted ambition or settle for witnessing with integrity—is signaled early through his guilt and the failed abbot’s precedent. Pressure tightens as the seed responds, the vector of light appears, and for “a heartbeat” he almost chooses to cling, making the renunciation feel earned rather than automatic. Internal and external conflicts (scientific curiosity vs. ethical grief; observatory’s dark history vs. present experiment) interweave convincingly. Escalation remains mostly internal and contemplative rather than sharply reversible, which slightly softens the sense of acute risk despite the implied madness price.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—how to live meaningfully in a world without tomorrow where identity/memory are unstable—is clear early and steadily pressured by the contradictions the creel reveals. Escalation happens via conceptual deepening rather than overt confrontation: catching lost names exposes the insufficiency of mere preservation, prompting the furnace/bookmark innovation and eventually the naming scene. The cost is subtle but legible: the narrator acknowledges irretrievable personal past in exchange for a chosen, communal role. The only limitation is that pressure stays contemplative; there’s no sharp moment where an alternative path is nearly taken and visibly foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stakes—whether the bunker remains a private fortress or becomes a shared, more honest refuge—are clear and escalate from private guilt to communal confrontation. The key tightening is Mara’s choice to use the pearl publicly and to file a noncompliant report while leaving the bunker unsealed, foreclosing pure safety-compliance in favor of relational risk. However, resistance is relatively low: the neighbors’ shift into confession comes quickly and smoothly, muting a sense of hard-earned cost. The conflict feels morally rich but could benefit from one concrete pushback or consequence on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator will face and act on their past negligence—is clear early and tightens as they move from abstract self-punishment into concrete re-engagement with the dam. The key escalation is the discovery that the graffiti’s grid number points precisely to the skipped intake gate, forcing a choice between continued concealment and open correction. Agency drives the resolution: walking out to the gate, documenting it, and sending it to the council with their name are irreversible steps with both professional and psychic cost. The stakes remain intimate rather than explosive, but are felt and coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether he will recover and dare to voice his unspoken words before the second letter’s judgment—is legible and escalates as he decodes from abstract directions to the painfully specific command about his unsent apology. Pressure tightens when the cipher turns personal and when he chooses to stay “three nights” measuring delays, then commits by mailing the apology before seeing the verdict. Internal and external conflicts interweave well: the magical puzzle-solving directly exposes his avoidance. Still, the story soft-pedals any explicit consequence if he failed (no articulated loss beyond continued silence), so the danger feels more elegiac than truly cornering.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—whether the empire secures a mythic, consecrating performance—is signaled early and steadily tightened as plant warnings raise the ethical cost and the envoy’s arrival collapses her time to decide. Liora’s use of the vent shaft and enlistment of the children as cover is a strong agentive escalation that narrows options and makes the trade-off (career and Sorell’s safety vs. freeing the violin) concrete. Internal and external conflicts are well braided: her dream of unpermitted propagation is forced into action precisely by the empire’s demand for ownership. The only thing holding this just below top-tier is that we never see a direct on-page consequence land after the act—pressure peaks at the decision and operation rather than at a visible fallout beat.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara can do something humane with the last spark of the dead, particularly Orin—is clear and coherent. Pressure escalates modestly: the static clarifies, Orin’s brightness is located, the sigh of light leaves him, and Mara must decide what to do with the now-charged chip. Her choice to give the spark to the sky instead of keeping it is an ethical commitment that forecloses a path, but the text does not strongly dramatize competing impulses or practical risk, so the sense of sacrifice is quiet. As a result, tension feels contemplative more than truly tightening, which suits the piece but caps intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—how to live after forgiveness, where contentment comes from—is clear, and pressure tightens as her unanswered question drives her higher into literal and metaphorical liminality. The grotto encounter escalates tension via the unsettling emptiness-as-furrow realization and the mother-figure’s silent appearance, forcing a choice about how to relate to past harm and future work. Her decision to treat rebirth as duty and to share that duty with her brother is an earned internal resolution with a visible future cost in labor and emotional vulnerability. The piece remains mostly interior and contemplative, so escalation is more deepening than conflictual, limiting peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will continue selling comforting certainty or embrace doubt even if it complicates her role—is clear early through her description of being “a conscience for hire.” Pressure tightens when the chimes warn “do not trust your certainty,” the shard shows her eyeless reflection, and the cloak alters her perception of past clients; these beats cumulatively force her toward a costlier stance. The decisive act is choosing to wear the cloak and then refusing to hand Sile the permission he craves, accepting potential professional and emotional fallout. The conflict is largely internal and quiet, with no strong external repercussion dramatized on the page, which slightly softens the sense of price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—Lior’s need to transmit his technique before he ages backward out of language—is clear, but the on-page pressure is relatively gentle. The main tightening comes when they enter the grotto and the rule is finally revealed; the looming loss of Lior’s adult self adds poignancy. What’s missing at an elite level is a sharper sense of risk or friction in the teaching itself; the narrator rarely faces a real possibility of failure or refusal. The piece succeeds as an initiation but stops short of a truly testing crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—achieving stillness-based navigation—is clear, and the tension between waiting and more active pursuit gives the piece a quiet pressure. Escalation occurs when the birds finally arrive and the pulse brushes his note, forcing him to choose endurance over chase. However, the stakes remain mostly spiritual/intellectual, with minimal sense of what’s lost or threatened if he fails beyond personal aspiration. As a result, the conflict feels nuanced but relatively low-intensity, limiting upper-band scores.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.2)
    The core stake—whether genuine, unmeasured sacredness can survive in an automated, extractive system—is strongly established and tightened by the automaton’s appearance. The key escalation is Davin’s choice to unstrap his harness and step off the stair, accepting real physical risk to preserve his value system. Internal and external conflicts interweave nicely: his artistic insecurity collides with the machine’s calm efficiency in that moment. The pressure is still relatively quiet and the automaton’s opposition is mild and easily bypassed, which keeps this from feeling fully maximized in terms of on-page tension.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether and how he can authentically “discover the color of sound” and change his relationship to honesty—is clear early and meaningfully tightened by the descent into the wreck and the encounter with the luminous vows. The key turn is his choice to speak the vow and accept its constraints (“to hear without wanting, to see without grasping”), which reconfigures his goal and forecloses the comfort of using truth as a shield. Secondary pressures like time/air and the physical eeriness of the wreck are present but underplayed, so the sense of danger never quite peaks. Tension operates more as spiritual pressure than imminent threat, which is effective but a bit gentle for top-band stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—whether and how to use the station’s last viable chance to reach “purpose” beyond a collapsing universe—is clear early and tightened effectively through resource and ideological pressures. The engineers’ demand for certainty, mechanical strain of a split dish, and thin power reserves concretize the costs of Mara’s decisions. Escalation is driven by her agency at each turn, culminating in the irreversible fuel burn and transmission that resolve the core dilemma through commitment rather than external rescue. Stakes remain more conceptual than visceral, but they’re convincingly anchored in material constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.5)
    The stakes are primarily internal—whether he can metabolize the “echo of sacrifice” or be hollowed out by it—and they’re clearly articulated through his need to name fears. Pressure deepens with each cylinder: the man who pays the sea, the laughing cook, the small sob in the last groove, each testing his capacity to carry these deaths. His agency is quiet but real: choosing to transform each voice into an object on the map and finally deciding to hide the last crystal under blank ocean, then to walk away bearing “distant intimacies,” forecloses a path of numb collection. The conflict remains mostly contemplative; a slightly sharper on-page moment of near-failure or resistance to this ritual could heighten the sense of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—can he coax the universe back toward balance with this repaired bell—is clear early and threads through. Escalation is modest but present: precision timing around the drip, the steward’s ridicule testing his brittle faith, and then the high-cost try/fail/partial-success of ringing the bell once. The price is mostly internal and conceptual (risk of confirming his own inadequacy or the universe’s indifference), and the resolution smartly refuses a big miracle in favor of a “promise rather than a gift.” The pressure could be tightened a bit further—one more concrete cost or threatened loss would push this into higher territory.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will continue to expunge Bellford’s truth or re-open it for the living—is clear and does tighten as more of the town resurfaces and her father’s complicity emerges. The meaningful turn arrives when she reframes the resurfacing as “not a haunting but an audit” and acts on that by documenting rather than erasing, culminating in speaking at the town meeting. However, external resistance and concrete consequences remain mostly implied rather than dramatized on the page, so pressure feels more contemplative than acute. The internal/external conflicts do interweave effectively, but without a sharp on-page test beyond her own resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stakes—professional success before the council and an internal reconciliation of logic with wonder—are signaled early and pay off. Pressure escalates when her hands shake at the thought of the council’s eyes and when the missing ratio eludes calculation, forcing her to risk the unorthodox starling method. The decisive tightening is discovering and trusting that ratio, which narrows her options from safe orthodoxy to a personally risky synthesis. Still, the scene unfolds with relative calm; no clear alternative path or threatened loss is dramatized in-the-moment, which keeps the tension a tier below its thematic potential.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are crisply articulated early: the integrity of the flyers’ trust and the safe arrival of medicine; the narrator’s misreading could fracture both. Pressure escalates coherently from unease at the off-pattern call sign to the risky coordinate revision, then to the visual of two parachutes and the embodied choice at the branch netting (let the clerk fall vs bind him for judgment). The moral calculus—preserving the web versus enacting personal punishment—sharpens the peak choice and makes the cost of her endurance legible. There’s room for a slightly stronger sense of immediate jeopardy (physical or social) to fully maximize tension, but the existing escalation is tight and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.3)
    The central stakes—who counts as the “real” person and what happens to the clone body and jar-brain—are clearly established, and the demand for a trial on the dojo edge provides a solid external pressure that echoes the internal battle with numbness. Escalation comes from moving from argument to embodied test, and from mere survival of ego-death to redefining personhood as co-guardianship. Yet the conflict resolution leans toward harmony, with limited on-page resistance once the protagonist initiates the push-pull technique; the cost is more internal and conceptual than sharply dramatized in the factions’ behavior. The pressure is coherent and meaningful but could benefit from a more tangible sacrifice or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will let OrthoGen’s logic of control/commercialization colonize her haven—is clearly signaled early via the backstory of their attempted buyout. Escalation is clean: anonymous seed and implied surveillance → deliberate investigation → building a pedagogical trap → on-page confrontation where she stages a demonstration of her principles. The price (turning down potential money, attention, and prestige) is conceptually strong but a bit abstracted; the OrthoGen woman’s relatively quick emotional capitulation softens the sense of hard-won conflict. The ethical calculus around consent/stewardship is compelling, though the external pressure could bite harder.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—cracking the family’s suffocating grief by restoring laughter—is clearly signaled and felt. Escalation comes from Bram intensifying the ritual (more blowers, harder conducting, deeper physical engagement with the grime) as the tunnel manifests increasingly painful “haunting” images. The price is his willingness to dredge up unspoken conflicts and endure their embodiment in order to free a single child’s laugh. The conflict remains mostly internal and atmospheric rather than oppositional, but for this length and mode it still reads as a meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether to use the pendant to cut open a seam homeward versus learning to live with uncertainty—is established early and tightened effectively at the moment the pendant brightens and nearly forces a passage. The main escalation is the guardian’s lunge and the narrator’s counter-choice to wait “just for one breath,” which crystallizes the conflict between tool-like certainty and relational curiosity. The cost, while conceptual, is clear: both characters renounce a longed-for escape/home in favor of a riskier interior stance. The only limitation is that external jeopardy remains low-key; the pressure is almost entirely philosophical/emotional, which it handles well but quietly.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—Mara interrupting a stifling destiny—is signaled early and tightened as she chooses to reshape the crozier instead of merely destroying it, thereby raising both spiritual and political risks. Pressure escalates through the forging sequence and culminates in the act of severing the charter seals, which forecloses her old obedient path. Jun’s involvement adds a secondary stake (his ledger and status), giving the decision relational weight. The conflict is more meditative than combative, with little overt opposition, which slightly mutes visceral tension even as the ethical and symbolic stakes land.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stakes—whether the dying broadcast city becomes scrap or is repurposed into a listening post—are clear and tightened by the discovery of a new pulse beneath silence. Escalation comes via Mara’s decision to act on that blueprint, physically dismantling the tallest mast and laboring through the night, which forecloses the option of simple archival observation. The cost is conceptual (relinquishing command-and-broadcast power) and practical (hard, lonely work; risking the city’s structure), and agency drives the final turn. The tension remains quiet and meditative rather than sharply agonistic, which limits visceral pressure even as thematic stakes deepen.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—preventing people from vanishing into a temporal seam and, deeper, preventing lonely disappearance—is clear early and tightens as anomalies mount. Escalation is steady: eerie vanishings → self-echo over radio with mismatched soundscape → realization the ferry is sliding rather than sinking → direct confrontation in the grotto → high-stakes pattern-matching over the radio to stitch time. Lina’s choice to risk a solo run to the cave and then to commit to a code that could fail shows credible agency; the “price” is her acceptance of an ongoing, liminal role rather than a clean fix. The piece could edge even higher with a more sharply dramatized moment where a tangible loss or trade-off bites harder on the page, but what’s here is still strong.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—can the narrator grasp and control “connection” without succumbing to delirium—is signaled early and tightens as the installation grows more intricate and memory more unstable. The crucial escalation comes when the proof-lines fail to guide him out, forcing the radical choice to yank down the mirror and accept eruption. Internal and external pressures interweave well, though the danger to others and to his professional standing remains somewhat muted, which keeps the stakes more metaphysical than visceral. Even so, the narrowing of options under the maze and fever logic is clear and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake (can Mara turn alien sky-maps into a human navigation method before the next contact, against a backdrop of communal grief and secrecy?) is legible and escalates from classroom theory to real-world surface test. Pressure is mostly situational and ethical rather than antagonistic; opposition from the council and guards is implied but never manifests as a hard obstacle. The ascent and successful position-fix are a meaningful tightening, but they come without reversal or explicit sacrifice, so the price remains largely conceptual. The ending’s shift into responsibility carries weight, yet the path there feels low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—preventing Eli from obeying the suicidal dead voice, and more broadly disrupting the spread of weaponized grief—is clear and escalates naturally from eerie call to immediate life-or-death pressure. The key tightening comes when the hearing aid flares with four pulses and Mara realizes the caller is her own mother’s grief looping through others, linking Eli’s crisis directly to her past. Mara’s tactic choice (sitting beside him, talking to the chain instead of wrestling the phone away) arises from her philosophy and entails emotional risk. The resolution is earned, with the cost embedded in her willingness to reopen and narrate her trauma to alter the pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are legible early (finding what happened to Ken and facing her claustrophobia) and tighten through the stone throat and especially the coil-assisted squeeze through rubble. Internal and external pressures interweave: her terror escalates right as the environment becomes least forgiving, and the second phase transition to fix the joint shows commitment under strain. The practical consequence of failure for the coast is sketched rather than fully felt, which slightly mutes the external tension. Still, the escalation feels coherent and the final repair is clearly earned by her decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stakes—Mara’s legal/ontological status and her relationship to failure and mortality—are clear early and deepen coherently as she works with Lyle. Escalation is accumulative: drawing increasingly complex ink patterns, hearing his fragmented memory, and the drives quieting as the defragmenting completes. Her final agency is quiet but decisive: accepting the ledger rewrite, keeping his record of mistakes, and consciously stopping her heartbeat count. The piece lands more as a profound reconfiguration than as a sharp pressure spike, so tension stays relatively low-intensity even as the thematic cost is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Vey will survive in any meaningful form—emerges early and is sharpened when the diamond’s “hunger” threatens to erase the language faster than death. Pressure escalates through Toma’s decline, the revelation of the curse, and especially the night without swifts, which removes Ilen’s established method and forces him to improvise with his own body as a tuning fork. The cost is more conceptual and vocational than viscerally personal on the page, but it’s legible: he risks himself and accepts a compromised form of survival for the language. A slightly more acute sense of immediate danger in the climax would push the stakes even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Jonas remains human or becomes a doorway for the Pulling Choir—is clear early and tightens convincingly once he confesses he’s metamorphosing. Escalation is well handled: small gravitational pranks in the garden escalate to shadows peeling, hiccuping gravity, and a live negotiation with the Choir. Agency is shared but present: Mara commits to intervention (planting the arrowhead) and Jonas chooses to offer up his bitterness instead of himself. The emotional and moral cost of that choice could be underlined a bit more on the page to sharpen the sense of sacrifice at the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.6)
    The central stake—can Lio disrupt a rigid, mechanized order to liberate real beauty—is established early and tightened as he confronts statues, the chained tree, and finally physical conflict. Escalation is clear: from rumor to trespass, from subtle signaling to overt disruption, culminating in the tree literally tearing free and dragging statues down. Lio’s agency drives each turn; nothing is solved by coincidence. The visible price is more conceptual/social than personal injury, so the danger feels a shade less punishing than it could at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are clearly signaled as both personal (Nela’s fate, Ivo’s need to honor broken promises) and political (border provocation, treason). Pressure escalates from routine constrained duty to taking on foster care, to discovering systemic theft, to a rooftop confrontation where he risks antagonizing smugglers, to a rule-bending drone mission over a militarized zone. The key reversals—using the storm, bargaining with smugglers, and committing to a second crossing—are driven by Ivo’s agency and values. Some costs (state retaliation, danger from soldiers) stay implied rather than dramatized on the page, which slightly softens the felt risk.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake is Rowan’s internal, craft-and-silence relationship, with an external corollary in reviving the wounded carousel horse and, by extension, the dead circus train. Pressure escalates via the wrong-turn choice, the thirst/oasis beat, and the discovery of the damaged horse that “explains” his draw here. The closure is satisfying but relatively gentle: the price of his choices is more conceptual (embracing a risky, liminal space) than sharply dramatized, so tension never quite tightens to a vise. A more palpable sense of danger or potential failure around the repair or song would deepen stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—Mara’s search for where stories “live” and what to do with that knowledge—is clear, and pressure does deepen once she finds and tests the pocket, then chooses to involve patrons. Escalation is more conceptual than adversarial, with a meaningful cadence shift when the scarf “pulls her thoughts backward and forward” and she reconceives stories as relations. The subsequent choice to guide people toward the pocket, altering her stance on solitude, is an earned soft resolution. Still, the conflict never faces sharp resistance or a painful trade-off; everything unfolds smoothly, which keeps tension from fully cresting.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Mina will trap or release the runaway dream—is clear and sharpened by the silhouette’s reappearance and the risky attempt to “vitalize” the cipher. Pressure escalates through the discovery of the figure on film, the throbbing palette, and the extended overnight vigil with the library kept open past the tide bell. Her final choice to photograph the absence instead of clinging to the returned figure is an earned renunciation with a visible emotional price. The conflict remains primarily interior and aesthetic, so the sense of narrowing options is subtler than it might be in a more overtly pressured scene.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.5)
    The central conflict—fear versus the desire to articulate a long-suppressed idea—is coherent and escalates as the narrator submits to increasingly intimate, uncanny steps of the ritual. Key tightening beats include the forced confrontation with the childhood memory, the seasick spinning of stars, and the demand to name the first star aloud. Resolution is clearly driven by her agency in speaking Altair and articulating the new constellations, not by coincidence. The only softness is that the cost of speaking (beyond implied future vulnerability) stays more conceptual than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—regaining a stolen part of self—is signaled early and escalates as she moves from investigation (diving, touching branches) to direct confrontation (interpreting the broken constellations, engaging the ring). Her final act of breaking habit and ingesting the mushroom is a clear, high-stakes choice that risks further loss or entanglement in the Court to regain her past. The conflict is primarily internal and lyrical, so tension is more conceptual than visceral, but it tightens coherently under that lens.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—reversing Mara’s exile—is signaled early and remains coherent, with a meaningful tightening as Lio explains that failure makes the exile permanent and blamed on her. Conflict interweaves external injustice (tribunal, city’s conditional mercy) and internal struggle (Mara’s pride, fear, and trembling hand), and the key turn is her choice to confront the reflection where she looks afraid, followed by her careful annotations that stabilize the door. The cost is mostly conceptual/emotional (bearing the pressure of being judged “fit” by a hostile system) rather than on-page loss, and the process succeeds without serious setback, which slightly softens escalation. Still, the progression from defiance to vulnerable participation provides a credible deepening of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—saving Nela by preserving and re-routing the “color of wonder”—is clear early and deepens at the confession beat. The major tightening comes when the narrator must name their fear and then later use that fear creatively in the other orchard, turning internal conflict into literal fruit. External opposition is relatively gentle; the bruised patches are pruned without serious setback, so tension remains more emotional than perilous. The cost is felt but not extreme, which keeps this strong but short of the most gripping conflict execution.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—grounding restless spirits versus honoring a fearful family vow—is clear early and escalates steadily as each knot releases more sound and pressure. The reveal that the storm-spirit is her ancestor meaningfully tightens conflict and forces a trade-off rather than a simple heroic act. The choice to break the vow and merge the spirit into a mask is a decisive, agentive solution that resolves both the hush and the unrest. The on-page price is more conceptual and relational than materially dramatized, so the felt cost is strong but not maximally searing.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—how to respond to the chapel’s “whisper” and the erased lives it shelters—is clear and deepens meaningfully once the box of maps is revealed. Escalation is mostly informational and ethical rather than oppositional; the archivist’s late desire to seal the chapel again is resolved quickly with little friction. Lena’s central “choice” is more about stance and framing than a hard sacrifice. Conflict is thoughtful but relatively gentle, limiting tension even as the thematic stakes are high.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.3)
    The central stake—whether the narrator will keep hunting for control/explanation or accept the physics of letting go—is clearly signaled and deepens as she uncovers Vaughn’s notebook and Earhart’s recorded stance. Pressure escalates more texturally than through overt jeopardy, but the progressive revelations about what “last transmission” really entails raise the internal cost of continuing her fixation. The decisive act of letting the reel unwind into the water forecloses a path and reads as an earned renunciation. It’s a quiet, inward conflict; a slightly sharper on-page sense of risk or sacrifice could heighten stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stakes—capturing and routing the ghost’s needs before thunder erases the moment, and Lio’s choice about whether he will serve as a silent carrier—are clearly signaled and interwoven. Pressure escalates via the storm clock and the ghost’s mounting urgency, culminating in Lio’s decision to accept a role that costs him the possibility of overt performance. The conflict remains relatively interior and gentle; there’s no sharp reversal, but there is a meaningful deepening when Lio realizes the ghost doesn’t want resurrection. That subtle shift reweights everything but keeps the piece in a quieter tension band.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant external stake—preventing the sabotage and saving the crew—is legible and escalates as she moves from mere curiosity to decoding a conspiracy and acting under time pressure. Internal conflict (ambition vs. deference, fear vs. curiosity) is braided through the same beats, culminating in her deliberate, risky choice to halt the elevator at the eighth floor. The clatter of approaching conspirators gives the emergency-brake action a satisfying, concrete test. The ethical calculus is relatively straightforward (no real temptation to side with the conspirators), which keeps this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.6)
    The central stake—survival vs. being swallowed by the forming Fury storm, intertwined with Mara’s need to vindicate Juno’s faith in patterns—emerges early and escalates coherently. The pressure tightens from passive drift with dead radios to Mara choosing a counterintuitive, risky tactic that could as easily waste their last tool as save them. Internal and external stakes are neatly braided: her memorializing method and belief in remembered turbulence directly inform her life-or-death choice. The only thing keeping this shy of the very top band is that there’s little sense of mutually exclusive alternatives; once she thinks of the telescope gambit, the narrative doesn’t linger on serious competing options or their costs.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—save and mirror the guild’s sky-knowledge before demolition—arrives early and is tightened by the looming presence of the crew and the time-limited access to the safe. Conflict is largely situational and internal, but we do get a real pressure turn when she must decode the coin quickly and later negotiate for “five more minutes,” with time as a non-negotiable constraint. The cost of her choice to preserve the book and finish the painting is the irreversible loss of the living library itself, which the ending honors. Still, the external opposition (foreman, city) remains somewhat soft and offstage, so escalation never quite bites as hard as it could.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Lio’s desire to escape dull maintenance and chart a real discovery, intertwined with his isolation—is clear and does escalate from boredom to a risky course change into an unmapped, ominously labeled glare. His agency drives every tightening step, from engaging the light to aligning spirals with the flock and effectively committing the ship. Yet the conflict lacks sharp resistance: Captain Yara is absent, the danger of the glare remains abstract, and no meaningful option is visibly foreclosed beyond “staying on the dull drift,” which dampens pressure at an otherwise strong climax.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—learning repair without violating the library’s rules, rooted in her desire to help her father—is clear and sharpened by the note and second scrap. Escalation comes through deepening rather than reversals: the warning about returning what’s taken, then the stricter dictum “Return by making, not by taking,” which forces a new tactic. The core choice to fabricate rather than steal is earned and meaningfully forecloses the path of easy appropriation. Stakes stay mostly internal and contemplative, so the felt risk could be heightened slightly with more pressure or consequence around potential failure or transgression.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stakes—finding a way off-world to the nebula of respite and deciding whether to trust a ghost’s guidance—are clear and interwoven. There is a real tightening when doubts about Serren’s motives give way to the grave/logs revelation, transforming the risk calculus of committing to the relay project. The labor and coordination needed to rebuild the relay, plus the existential gamble of stepping through the projected “window,” register as costs, though external danger is largely historical rather than immediate. The escalation is more ethical/communal than peril-driven, but it supports the ending convincingly.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—whether the world meets midnight with annihilation or mercy—is signaled early and steadily tightened by the forecast of the “final ripple” and the shimmering pane. Escalation is clear: once the clock demands “payment,” options narrow to her sacrifice, and that price is visibly paid in heartbeat and breath. Internal and external conflicts interweave (duty to numbers vs desire to comfort the dying), though that moral calculus stays mostly in imagery rather than explicit dilemma. The resolution stems from her agency at the clock rather than coincidence, with the world’s softened end as direct consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are legible and layered: an external rescue under time pressure and an internal ethical cost as each rescue “tightens the curse.” Pressure escalates coherently via the ticking frost deadline, deeper penetration into the maze, and the child physically trapped under a damaged bird. The protagonist’s agency—choosing to help, deploying the nut, improvising a waystone, then deciding to complete the system—drives every major turn. The price is more conceptual/enduring than immediately harrowing, which fits the piece’s mode but keeps tension from feeling fully knife-edge.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—what kind of responsibility Mara will claim for the deaths—is clear early and tightened by her decision to change the adhesive and give up patent rights. Internal and external conflicts interweave: her private atonement drive shapes public legal choices, and the corporation’s balking underscores risk. Escalation is quieter than combative but real, moving from contemplation at the ravine to the public hearing to the literal test of walking the new bridge. The cost is credible but not heavily dramatized on the page, keeping this just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—regaining an origin and moving from blankness into a story of one’s own—is clear, and the parole test provides a concrete externalization of that internal conflict. Pressure escalates from a quiet lull to the high-stakes incision and the shock of seeing oneself on the page; the main tightening is the realization that this might be the narrator’s own beginning. However, the path to success feels relatively smooth: there’s little risk of failure or real on-page struggle with the task itself, so the cost/readiness of the final choice to leave reads more contemplative than hard-won. The conflict works but never quite bites.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Safi will take on and metabolize the fortress’s stored remorse—is clear from early on and tightens as he moves from tasting rain to directly touching the jars. Conflict escalates not through reversals but through deepening commitment: descending alone, unwrapping his hands, then choosing to remain in physical contact as soldiers weep. The price (carrying a blended bitterness in his own body) is plainly on the page and informs the ending’s quiet, earned stasis. The external “next battle” stake is more gestured at than dramatized, so pressure remains primarily interior and communal rather than military.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stakes—saving Elevator Nine and bridging social silos—are clearly signaled and unified, and they do tighten once Nine’s demolition and structural failures are voiced. Mara’s agency drives the turns (choosing to answer Nine, ring the warning bell as call-to-work, framing the elevator’s future), but practical and social resistance are light; farmers arrive quickly, accept her multilingual overture with minimal friction, and the mayor’s prior dismissal evaporates when he appears. The overnight repair, guided almost benignly by the elevator’s own instructions, feels more like a poetic inevitability than a hard-earned victory, so the visible price of her choice remains low. Tension exists conceptually and aesthetically, but it never truly bites.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Nira is losing herself or can re-order entangled memories without annihilating them—comes through and tightens around the mirror experiment. Pressure escalates when she risks engaging a “foreign corridor” and actively reshapes the helix to stabilize the moon’s reflection, accepting possible psychic cost. The cost is mostly conceptual/emotional (revisiting erased childhood and accepting others’ burdens) rather than dramatized as immediate danger, which keeps the tension strong but relatively quiet. Still, the decision to become archivist and descend into the canyon reads as a clear, committed stance under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—retrieving forgotten combinations before others and surviving a mind-altering grotto—comes through early and coheres. Pressure does deepen (moving from entrance to spiral to calcite door to collapsing archive as the hour ends), and the gravity clock provides organic tightening. However, the path unfolds with relatively few true obstacles or reversals; Ilya never genuinely falters in a way that forces a costly trade-off or adaptation. The final escape tremor provides a spike but doesn’t fully cash in on the danger the premise suggests.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—can she coax any meaningful “music”/response from a mute world—is clear and carried throughout, but the pressure never bites very hard in conventional conflict terms. Escalation shows as increasing complexity and reach: from reading one crack to installing multiple tuned wires and then extending the device’s social purpose. The key tightening is her realization that the cracks are “records of pressure endured” and that she can translate that into an empathetic sequence, which justifies her plan to confront communal avoidance. Still, moments of risk or potential failure (a wire breaking, the monument resisting, her own doubt) are kept very low-key, keeping this just shy of top-tier tension.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the nexus will be reclaimed for war or renounced at real strategic cost—is clear early and tightens as Sable uncovers the Collegium’s past abuse and must persuade the council. His agency drives the key steps (choosing to listen, deriving the message, and insisting on a non-bargaining stance), and the renunciation decision clearly forecloses a path. However, on-page resistance is somewhat underdeveloped: the “narrow” vote and potential mockery by enemies are told rather than dramatized as live pushback. A bit more dramatized friction in the council scene would heighten the felt price and pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stakes—preventing a potential fireworks disaster and repairing the moral/emotional breach with Mara—are clear and braided. Pressure escalates when the diary finally opens and the clock to the celebration becomes urgent, and again when the watchman suspects Lio of theft. Lio’s agency drives resolution: he chooses to act quietly but decisively, using his resonator and then Mara’s words to alter the town’s stance. The external danger remains slightly abstract (no close call or visible near-miss), softening the visceral edge of the stakes even as the ethical and emotional costs are well-articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central stake—whether Jun can obtain the relic seed without harming the village’s safety—appears early and stays coherent, and the main tightening comes when she agrees to witness the bloom and endure its stench without stealing. The vigil scene escalates pressure nicely by making the conflict bodily and immediate (the reek, her knees buckling) and tying it to her value of “serenity within motion.” However, opposition is principled rather than dangerous, so the risk of social or moral failure feels real but not biting; the village seems inclined to trust her fairly quickly. The final condition (planting in the mudflats, ongoing reporting) does give the resolution a real, if gentle, price.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering the origin of the arrow tip’s power to potentially heal orchards and people—is clear and threaded from start to finish. Escalation is more accumulative than oppositional: the main tightening comes from entering the silent ring and realizing the scale and history of the metal seeds, not from external danger or failure. Lysa’s final choice to sacrifice her unique arrow tip for the collective archive is a genuine trade-off, but the on-page cost is quiet and largely conceptual; she faces little risk of bodily harm or catastrophic loss. A touch more resistance or jeopardy in reaching or leaving the hollow would sharpen the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—expose and interrupt the operation that silenced the town and hid the cargo plane—is clear early and tightens steadily as the spiral leads to Dock Twelve and the silent cylinder. The major escalation arrives with the realization that the entire yard is a tuned wind machine and the explicit time pressure of the approaching crew, forcing the protagonist into rapid, specific actions (breaking seals, ruining symmetry) rather than further analysis. Agency drives the resolution; the convergence is broken because he changes the boundaries rather than confronting some central device. The felt cost is more situational and conceptual (risk, urgency, the prior suffocation of the town) than personally wrenching, which keeps this just below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central stakes—whether wonder and sound will be rationed or defended—are clearly signaled and embodied in the hush imprisoning Maera. Escalation is strong when silence becomes literally suffocating and Lio must act, tying internal and external conflict. The resolution via Lio’s performance before the Council is thematically apt but a bit frictionless; the political resistance collapses quickly with limited on-page cost beyond a sense of fragility. Still, the final charged poise (fragile decree, ongoing vigilance) preserves tension beyond the apparent win.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Liora can confront her failure and re-engage the flute without losing herself or her world—is clear and present from early on. There is one solid tightening when she opens the echo corridor and risks not coming back to “her own life,” and another when she hears how the pilgrim’s own driftwood logic failed. However, once she chooses to play, opposition is largely conceptual rather than experiential; the boundary doesn’t seriously resist her. The emotional cost lands, but a touch more concrete peril or resistance in the crossing would heighten escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—Kestrel’s psychic coherence and ethical use of transposed empathy—is signaled early and deepens as she experiments and accumulates disorientation. There is clear escalation: from small-scale client work to destabilizing Council auditors to the darkest interval when she risks losing herself entirely. Her final choice to run the halo fragment alone and offload the borrowed selves forecloses a path and carries a cost in identity and stored emotion. The piece is more conceptually pressurized than viscerally tense, so the conflict reads as high-stakes but quiet rather than sharply agonized.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—what it means to “deliver” this relic in Nera’s absence—is established early and sharpened when Mara refuses simple possession by placing the pendant on the cairn. The meaningful tightening comes when the pendant stitches disparate encounters and shows Nera’s past choice, forcing Rook to accept a delivery that disperses control and glory. Pressure is mostly internal and intellectual rather than acutely risky, which keeps tension on the quieter side. Still, the renunciation carries a clear cost in identity and role, enough to register as a genuine escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—how the narrator will relate to her sister’s death and to the town’s simplifying narrative—is clear early and steadily tightened. Pressure escalates from a desire for answers to participating in a risky, uncanny ritual, to confronting a concrete emotional “voice” in the mirror, and finally to deciding what version of events to give her parents. The cost of her resolution (carrying a “truthful lie,” relinquishing hatred of the car while accepting what it contains) is legible and rooted in previous beats. The conflict is more internal and atmospheric than adversarial, but still sharp enough for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—reaching Jun at the cost of herself—is announced early and tightened by the three-year stalemate with the loom. The discovery and arrangement of the puzzle edges is a clear escalation, making action possible while hinting that the cost will be real; the subsequent loss of laughter and then voice gives the conflict concrete prices. The main limitation is that the internal debate around continuing once the cloth begins to steal from her is mostly summarized rather than dramatized beat by beat, which slightly softens felt pressure. Still, the renunciation of speech at dawn reads like a tested commitment, not a convenient flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—preserving the arches/orchards at the cost of Lio’s own memory and self—is clear and steadily tightened as each barter strips away more of him. Escalation is driven by his decisions to keep paying the silk despite increasing loss, culminating in a meaningful turn when he refuses to surrender what remains and instead buries the silk. Internal and external conflicts are well braided: his desire to help the orchards collides with the erosion of his identity. The only missing layer is a more explicit moment where the option to stop feels dangerously attractive, sharpening the trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—facing the cost of a protective lie about Jalen—emerges early and tightens via discoveries (beacon), confrontation (bound Jalen), and the final choice to amend the record. Internal and external conflicts reinforce each other: guilt, fear of institutional punishment, and the metaphysical danger of “cut anchor” worlds. The emotional and moral price is clear, even if the practical risks of correcting the log are only implied. The resolution leans slightly easy in procedural terms, but thematically the pressure remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—preventing disaster in the sea lanes and protecting Maris and unnamed sailors—is clear early and tightens as the night stretches on without the beacon. Escalation is primarily accumulative: from eerie failure through improvised cairn signaling to the hands-on, risky repair of the lamp. The cost (bleeding fingers, exhaustion, emotional strain) is present but understated, fitting the piece’s quiet mode. If anything, the physical difficulty of restoring the light resolves a bit smoothly, but not enough to undercut the felt pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—protecting the coast while managing the danger of accidental prophecy—is clear and tightened by the line “Tomorrow the water will rise to the door,” which forces her into inventive, higher-risk action. Escalation is driven by her choices: using the wick in a new way, tearing up the last newspapers, and effectively spending her own voice to save others. We feel a cost (raw throat, sacrificed archives, increased responsibility), but the danger on the water remains a bit abstract—no near-miss or partial failure tests her tactics in detail. The storm resolves slightly smoothly for the scale of the threat, keeping this just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Maru will accept being a locus for others’ stories rather than hoarding safety or spectacle—is clear and tightened by the repeated tests along the sun trail. Escalation is more ethical/emotional than peril-based, with the key deepening being the revelation that each dot marks someone Sairi helped, reframing “legend” as service. The jar of “Caution” offers a real choice about how to use dangerous beauty, but Maru’s acceptance comes fairly smoothly, without a hard on-page moment of resistance or loss beyond implication. The pressure is coherent and satisfying, yet one sharper test of cost in the final act could elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator will remain a neutral maintainer of quantified sorrow or risk reconfiguring the system to honor witness—emerges steadily and tightens once the sapling is found. The major escalation is their choice to “deconstruct the maze itself, not smash it,” which narrows options and commits them to a covert, value-laden act rather than passive observation. Pressure is more conceptual and ethical than physically perilous, but the realization that the labyrinth was designed to keep people from the trees is a genuine deepening that forces a stance. The visible price (abandoning institutional neutrality, quietly sabotaging the apparatus) is present but understated, which mutes some potential bite.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—the realm’s survival via rekindled dawn—is strong and clearly signaled, and Lysa’s personal stake (ongoing memory erosion) interweaves with it. There is a solid tightening as the cloth grows and the night “fights back,” and the infants’ swaddling introduces a mid-story complication that shifts tactics and brings personal cost into focus. However, antagonistic pressure remains mostly abstract (night as generalized threat, chemists as petitioners not challengers), so escalation reads more as steady fulfillment of a ritual than a sequence of hard, narrowing choices. The climax at the mica window is beautiful but arrives with relatively little resistance beyond the implied metaphysical struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stakes—Lysa’s fear of being seen as a traitor and Marin’s need to reconcile with error and belonging—are clear and intertwined. There is a meaningful tightening when the Archivist arrives, forcing the question of punishment versus mercy. However, tension remains gentle; the Archivist’s decision feels almost preordained once the halves of the invitation are shown, and we don’t feel much risk of true exclusion or rupture. The escalation is present but not especially sharp or costly for a piece aiming at top-tier literary intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.5)
    The central stakes—whether Mina will remain a passive witness/complicit actor in erasure or accept morally costly, if small-scale, resistance—are clear and coherently developed. The key tightening occurs when she reveals her role in the bakery’s disappearance and Sada responds not with absolution but with a concrete, ethically fraught task (guerrilla planting under surveillance). External pressure (patrols, erasures, footsteps at the gate) is mostly atmospheric, so the conflict remains primarily internal and could benefit from one more sharply dramatized consequence or near-miss. Still, her choice to act in the face of prior harm paid for with her own complaint gives the resolution credible weight.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.3)
    The central stake—whether this vow (and by extension others) will survive the world’s “unremembering”—is established early and tightened as the slide cools and its script remains incomplete. The meaningful turn arrives when Ilian recognizes that measurement alone won’t stabilize the vow and chooses to contribute his own promise, which reconfigures the nature of his duty. Tension is primarily conceptual/emotional rather than kinetic, but it does escalate in density as frequencies, personal memory (his sister), and the bride’s vanished presence interweave. A single sharper moment of risk or failure in the measuring process could have heightened pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake (preventing the betrayal that will destroy her father’s routes and community) is clear from the outset and escalates through concrete setbacks. The “false starts” are real pressure beats that cost her time, tools, and safety, narrowing options until the loud, rule-breaking gambit with the cups becomes necessary. The external clash (pirates vs. sheriff/Strake) fuses neatly with the internal conflict between keeping silent and risking the market’s safety. Costs—blood spilled, a shattered truce, Mara stuck under the pier till dawn—are felt, not just asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether and how the narrator aligns themself with the weather carriers and their political/spiritual function—is clear from early on. Pressure escalates via increasing strangeness and risk: leaving the city, Bureau designation of carriers as security risks, the circle’s suspicion, and the offer that their presence will alter the forests’ vote. The main turn is the decision to step into the convergence before dawn, foreclosing the safer path of remaining an observer; that’s earned but a bit too gently contested on the page. External stakes (Bureau consequences, danger of raids) remain mostly implied rather than actively squeezing the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara answers or refuses the inherited calling—is clearly signaled and does tighten as she moves from tunnel to fissure to ruined lock to notebook. Her decision to “rectify what can be rectified” by making an opening art-piece, and later to use the pigments to awaken the stage, provides genuine agency-driven turns. However, opposition largely remains atmospheric (sorrow, ruin) and technical (a broken lock) rather than truly threatening, so the sense of risk or sacrifice is muted. The escalation is thus more contemplative than pressured, effective but not bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—how to handle lost conversations and withheld truths amid real material scarcity—tightens meaningfully when Mara discovers Lio’s unsent, half-truthful communications and the hidden cistern. Internal and external stakes braid well: her desire for water and her desire for her brother are tested against the temptation to anger or accusation versus vulnerable honesty. The turn where her plain, fully truthful note unlocks the final map layer is a genuine deepening that makes her prior commitment to candor consequential. The main limitation is that the cost remains largely prospective rather than sharply felt in-scene; we sense risk and moral pressure more than we see a concrete sacrifice or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether wonder and truthful irregularity will survive bureaucratic standardization—is clear from the Auditor’s ledger stone onward. Pressure escalates when Lysa responds not by argument but by intensifying the sculpture, provoking physical and social consequences (bells tremble, crowd’s doubts align, Auditor is burned, ledger dissolves). Agency is firmly with Lysa, and her choice forecloses a path (perfect, surprise-less bells) and redefines the existing order. The conflict remains largely symbolic and non-lethal, so while thematically weighty, the on-page sense of risk to Lysa herself is relatively low, which slightly mutes tension.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.7)
    The stakes—roses and dome survival vs. the danger of unleashing fire under glass and violating caretaker instincts—are clearly articulated and escalate coherently. The meaningful tightening beats are strong: realization of overheating risk, blocked hatch necessitating a controlled burn, then walking beside the flame line managing sparks until the vent triggers. Internal and external conflicts braid well, with resolving the inner static dependent on executing a dangerous physical plan. It stops just short of peak-band because there’s essentially one continuous arc without an additional, sharper reversal or sacrifice beyond the central burn decision.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stakes—unlocking the mailbox and whether this community can bear and transform stored apologies—are clear and do escalate from curiosity to collective vulnerability. The key tightening comes when Mara and Lio discover and use the hidden lock, shifting from rumor-gathering to active revelation. However, Mara’s path involves little genuine dilemma; she always chooses to listen and open, and the outside-world pressures (evictions, developer) never force a concrete trade-off or irreversible loss on the page. The emotional price is present but relatively gentle, making the conflict feel moving yet low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—liberating detainees without giving the council exploitable confession-data—is established early and coherently escalated through the guardian’s surveillance, the risk of alarm broadcasts, and the physical threat of water and stasis pods. There is a meaningful tightening when she must answer the guardian’s access key via dance and later reroute alarms into sensors, and the final run through the flooded lab sustains pressure. Still, Lyra’s plan largely works as conceived; there’s no sharp reversal or near-failure that forces a costly adaptation, making the climax feel impressive rather than perilous. The cost is more conceptual (ongoing enmity with the council and guardian) than concretely dramatized in-episode.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—recovering stolen grief/memory versus accepting painless oblivion—is established early and escalates through concrete actions (opening the sealed drain, stealing jars, confronting the whale/parasite). Lysa’s choices drive the turns, and the shift from private discovery to public act (returning grief on the beach) is a meaningful tightening that changes options for everyone. The ethical and emotional price of reintroducing sorrow is conceptually strong but under-experienced on the page; the ritual goes smoothly and fairly quickly, with limited on-scene resistance or visible downside beyond one line about “lived-in sorrow.” Strong, but a shade more dramatized friction or loss would deepen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—how to handle a dangerous prophecy that is also a crucial warning—is signaled early and sharpened when the buried weapon and cracking wells are revealed. The meaningful tightening occurs when erasure is exposed as morally disastrous, forcing a trade-off between public safety and political catastrophe. Liora’s agency drives the turn: she invents the “filter” solution and commits to speaking plainly later. External pressure (patrols, factions) remains mostly off-stage, so the immediate sense of danger never fully peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—saving the Dovetail from demolition—is clear from early on, and the pressure coherently narrows options toward the inspector’s walk-through. The key escalation is the discovery of the hidden documents and the choice to deploy a “single shared lie” by planting them, which nicely entwines internal ethics with external risk. However, conflict with the inspector and landlord remains largely off-page or frictionless; the walk-through itself feels almost too easy, with minimal resistance or complication. As a result, the price paid is more conceptual and emotional than viscerally felt, limiting the sense of sharp escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will surrender, keep, or transform the dangerous memory of her brother—is established early and tightens when Sol deems the shell “must be archived.” The key deepening comes with the revealed content of the memory, which reweights the choice from bureaucratic compliance vs. resistance into honoring his sacrifice vs. clinging. However, external pressure is relatively soft (Sol is accommodating, the institution doesn’t press hard), so escalation leans mostly internal and could use one more concrete constraint or risk. The final choice has clear cost but the path to the compromise feels slightly unopposed.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—what story gets inscribed as truth about treason, her father, and herself—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when the hidden papers reveal Senn’s originating betrayal. The major turn arises from Liora’s agency in using the key on the altar rather than on herself, which forces a new dilemma: participate in controlled scapegoating or risk systemic exposure. Her choice to write a new statement in water and head toward public tribunal clearly forecloses safer paths and carries implied personal risk. Internal and external conflicts (guilt vs complicity, survival vs truth) are well braided without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—preventing Senn’s stolen echo from being weaponized and, by extension, stopping the exploitation of others—is legible early and coherently maintained. Pressure escalates via the messenger’s warning, the increasingly ominous shell disclosures, and the reveal that Mael holds the twin shell and claims Senn’s complicity. Lira’s agency drives the key turn: she refuses Mael’s frame and uses a counter-song to disrupt the Choir’s system rather than submit or bargain, which reconfigures options for everyone in the chamber. The main weakness is that resistance feels too easily overcome; Mael’s attempt to complete the shells and the Choir’s collapse pass quickly, muting the sense of hard-won cost or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake (protecting/returning “something pure” versus Fen’s predation on grief) is legible early and escalates as Mara moves from suspicion to proof to public exposure. Her ethical constraint against hearsay creates a meaningful tightening: she must risk making many villagers complicit via shared dreams to catch Fen. However, confrontation and consequence arrive relatively smoothly once she has the pattern, with little direct resistance from Fen on the page, so the conflict never quite peaks into a truly costly or fraught decision.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether quiet, “invisible” vigilance and labor matter—is signaled early and tightened when sliced market nets introduce an external threat. Escalation is modest but effective: from teaching and philosophical musing to an applied test where trade is actively endangered and a smuggler must be caught. Ren’s agency in placing guards based on the pattern of cuts constitutes a genuine narrowing of options and an earned resolution. The primary cost is conceptual and social (remaining largely uncredited, renouncing the desire for loud proof of worth), which lands but keeps the pressure in a quiet register.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—uncovering and disseminating the truth of the Liquidation and Salma’s husband—is signaled early and coherently escalates through discovery of the Stillpoint and the ledger. The meaningful tightening comes when Ministry agents arrive and the protagonist’s prior choice to mail copies is revealed, reframing the conflict as system vs. system rather than individual vs. Ministry. However, most pressure turns are relatively smooth and unopposed; we rarely see plans genuinely threatened in the moment, and risk stays largely conceptual. The emotional or moral cost of her choices could be sharpened to push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—how hope and allegiance in the valleys are shaped, and whether Eli’s rationalist project can coexist with Mara’s prophetic pull—is clear and does tighten when she confronts him about “stealing” her words. Their choice to merge methods and broadcast the puppet-giants is a meaningful turn that alters the social landscape below. However, conflict is relatively low-friction: their opposition never bites hard on the page, there’s little sense of what either truly risks by joining forces, and the experiment’s success comes without a visible setback or trade-off, which blunts escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—turning private and communal grief into shared, honest music—is legible from the outset and deepens through the attempt to free the music box and then to stage the dawn ritual. The key tightening comes when the melody reveals a different, lonelier truth than expected and the widow’s confession personalizes the loss, forcing Sato to choose between coin-taking and soliciting stories. Costs are emotional and reputational rather than material, but we do feel a path foreclosed as he gives the jar away and redefines his “payment.” The only limitation is that nothing pushes him into a corner where refusal would have a comparably sharp on-page backlash.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—keeping the relic (and therefore the drowned souls) safe—is signaled early and tightened through the thieves’ physical lunge and the ticking clock of sunset/darkness. Lio’s choice to use sonic absolution instead of physical confrontation is a genuine strategic adaptation, weaving internal and external stakes together. The cost is mostly emotional and metaphysical rather than materially punishing, which suits the piece but keeps tension on the subtler side. Escalation is clean but not searing, landing in a quiet, morally complex resolution rather than a hard break.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stakes—whether a patient, nonviolent strategy can unyoke the region from imperial control—are clear and well-braided with Irena’s internal arc. Pressure escalates from abstract rumors of revolution to a stark technological obstacle (the viaduct) and then to a coordinated operation with real material stakes (grain for villages). The key tightening comes when she recognizes that attacking the bridge impulsively would fail and opts for a long, moon-timed approach, fusing inner and outer conflict. The final operation, while conceptually strong, lacks a moment of acute jeopardy or visible near-failure that might have sharpened cost.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will collude with Kellan or expose the preventable death—is established early and tightened when she links cut brake lines to falsified “resolved” complaints. The main escalation comes at Kellan’s call instructing her to declare worker error, forcing a concrete ethical choice that narrows her options. The external danger remains mostly implied (threat to career, potential retaliation) rather than viscerally on the page, but it’s sufficient for this scope. Ending on her completed report and insistence that “the next one would not reverberate into silence” shows a reweighted, higher-cost stance.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether repentance can become credible action rather than parole theater—is clear from Elias’s first visit. Pressure meaningfully tightens when Lena refuses to collude in performance and proposes a plan that risks Elias’s professional safety and demands real work from Darren. The arrival of Mrs. Halden tests that plan under maximum moral scrutiny: she withholds forgiveness but acknowledges the sound of action, foreclosing an easy, feel-good resolution. The only limit is that institutional consequences remain implicit rather than concretely tested, keeping stakes high but not harrowingly so.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will accept and enact this strange, evolving technology of yearning despite its opacity—is coherent and escalates from secret study to literal flight to altering the dead coast’s machinery. Internal and external stakes interweave, but pressure is relatively gentle: her crossing of the acid sea and landing at the coast unfold almost entirely without resistance or reversals. The most meaningful tightening is conceptual rather than peril-based: realizing the algorithm’s true purpose and acting without promise of payoff. This keeps the piece resonant but somewhat low-intensity in terms of concrete jeopardy or painful trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stakes—exposing Lattice’s engineered silence versus preserving her position/safety—are legible early and deepen as she moves from curiosity to rule-breaking to whistleblowing. Escalation comes through her agency (using the forbidden admin account, entering the Chute, choosing how to leak the truth) and culminates in a morally ambivalent tactic (lying to Legal while signaling the families). The cost is more conceptual than visceral on the page; we intuit risk and betrayal, but they’re not directly dramatized in confrontation. Still, for this length, the pressure tightens coherently and avoids soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central conflict—what to do with the shard and how to balance prediction vs. care—is well-defined, and Mara’s eventual plan genuinely reframes the opposition between fisherman and glaciologist. The use of mirrors to surface unspoken fears provides a satisfying deepening of pressure rather than a simple binary choice. That said, escalation is relatively smooth: there’s little sense of imminent loss if Mara fails, and no serious near-miss or sacrifice before resolution. The final arrangement serves as a clever compromise more than a hard-won trade-off with a sharply felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—the narrator’s relationship to endings (seeking, listening, controlling vs. accepting)—is present from the first paragraph and tightened by Signe’s arrival and request for an escort. External pressure escalates effectively with the midnight storm and the skiff in danger, forcing concrete action with modest physical risk. The internal conflict resolves into an earned stance shift when Signe asks her to “stop chasing loud finales,” and the narrator accepts a quieter, less controlling posture. Stakes remain intimate rather than dramatic, but the emotional cost is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether to erase or honor the painful relationship via the letter—is clear and present early. Conflict escalates through their parallel confessions and culminates in Mara’s question about letting the relationship die, which the narrator meets with restrained attention rather than prescriptive advice. The decision to read the letter aloud and then preserve it marks a genuine narrowing of options (they foreclose the burning/denial path), but the progression is very smooth, with little resistance or reversal on the page. As a result, tension feels more contemplative than pressurized, effective but not gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether the prophet’s presence will destabilize or help preserve the sages’ echo—is clearly signaled via the parapet’s twitching and elders’ fear. Pressure coheres and tightens through Iri’s decision to offer a bargain and lead him onto the risky line, escalating from ambient anxiety to an on-page test of restraint. The internal–external conflicts (trust vs duty; teaching silence to someone whose power is speech) intertwine effectively but remain fairly serene in affect, which slightly softens the felt jeopardy. The resolution is convincingly earned, though the sense of what might have been lost could be sharpened one more notch.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure here is primarily situational and emotional rather than conflictual: the town’s unresolved grief and the anniversary create a low, steady tension. The escalation is a density increase—one person’s photo becomes many, individual stories become a crowd, then the storm tests their commitment and they collectively hold the sheets in the rain. The stakes (whether grief remains isolated vs. shared) are clear but rarely feel in jeopardy, as there’s no substantive resistance to Mara’s project beyond initial quietness. As a result, the ending is moving but not sharply hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the hush and growth will be condemned as dangerous or embraced as transformative, with the missing apprentices as moral leverage—is clear and sharpened by the Council’s demand for testimony. Pressure escalates through each sequence: first a curious anomaly, then eerie laughter and disappearances, then the secretly tended compost of definitions that reframes the threat. The final turn is the narrator’s decision to risk siding with the hush and the apprentices by mapping the hidden door for the Council, potentially forfeiting safety or status to prevent a violent crackdown on language. The conflict skews conceptual/ethical rather than visceral, which keeps the tension quiet but still coherent and mounting.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—Mira’s attempt to capture time/aging before her mother’s voice is lost—is signaled early and tightened through the journey to find the time-hearing microphone and the realization of Orrin’s fragile memory. The key deepening comes when Orrin momentarily channels her own future rasp, and when she chooses to add her mother’s name and his breath to the archive, reweighting her initial project. Pressure remains more emotional and atmospheric than acute; the conflict never quite forces a painful, on-page tradeoff beyond the quietly implied costs, which keeps it just below the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stakes (capturing the micrometeor swarm and salvaging the rail station’s viability) are established early and sharpen as the quake escalates and launch windows close. Pressure tightens coherently: the runaway clock hand ruins opportunities, the quake worsens, a floor crack appears, and the risk of permanent misalignment looms right as she’s mid-hack. Mara’s agency is central—choosing a slower, analog leaf method under a live clock and committing to launch the pod once the fix takes; luck doesn’t bail her out. The price is mostly situational and emotional rather than explicitly sacrificial, which moderates the intensity just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—achieving a last, honest reunion before Elias dies—is signaled early and carried through. Pressure tightens via medical confirmation of decline, the uncertainty of Jonah’s response, and the fragile, wobbling playback that could fail to hold. Escalation is quiet but real, with Mara’s outreach and Jonah’s decision to come serving as meaningful turning points and the final listening session foreclosing any future reconciliation. There is minimal overt resistance once Jonah decides to come, but the tension in their initial stare and the fragility of the record keep the scene from going slack.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—understanding and correcting what happens to shadows at noon, with the implicit question of the mentor’s disappearance—exists from the outset and tightens as Liora moves from surface observatory to hidden underbelly to reservoir. Each step arises from her agency (closing loops, choosing not to force doors, joining her shadow), and the revelation that noon is stored and must be released is a clear deepening of the initial problem. However, the conflict remains largely puzzle-like; there’s little overt opposition or tangible risk, and no real sense that failure will exact an immediate personal or moral price beyond continued mystery. The escalation is thus more intellectual than visceral, effective but somewhat cool at this “prestige” standard.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—Rowan’s responsibility to Lina/the changeling versus his need for rational safety—is clear early and deepens as he uncovers evidence of Lina’s secret apprenticeship and the deliberate “shell” body. Each discovery raises the cost of inaction, culminating in the hedge door where he must risk himself and his worldview. The conflict is primarily ethical and conceptual rather than physically perilous, which fits the mode but keeps the felt cost a little softer than it might be. Nonetheless, escalation is coherent and his final commitment is distinctly more fraught than his starting position.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Lio can share light again without fire and without being frozen by guilt—is signaled early and deepens as memories resurface during polishing. Escalation is primarily internal and textural rather than confrontational: the work of smoothing the glass forces him to revisit the accident and test his vow. The eventual decision to hang the pearl publicly and to invite others into the grotto constitutes a real commitment, but the piece skirts truly fraught resistance or reversal that might sharpen the cost. Still, for this quiet mode, there is a clear tightening of pressure and an earned, if gentle, resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.5)
    The core stake—whether she can meaningfully atone by creating an unerasable archive and enlisting Jun—is clear and engaged, and the meeting with Jun is the primary escalation. Her decision to hand over the pendant is a real sacrifice that forecloses her last private refuge, a solid on-page cost. However, external jeopardy (corporate retaliation, legal risk) stays off-stage and never tightens in real time, keeping the conflict largely interior and limiting peak tension. Sharpening Jun’s resistance or introducing a more concrete threat in the scene could raise the pressure band.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.3)
    The central stake—artistic integrity versus contractual and reader expectations—is legible early and escalates through the river’s pull, the realization that contract/reader expectations form part of the current, and the physicalized climb to the source book. Mara’s choice to go upstream and then to open the wet book “against its will” is clearly a refusal of the easy path. The cost is framed as risking silence and noncompliance rather than dramatized consequence, which keeps the conflict somewhat abstract but still effective at this length. Internal and external pressures braid coherently without redundant loops.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether the sacred harvest practice can be restored so the trees “know when to give”—is clear and present from early on. Pressure escalates when Marn’s solo contraption elicits no response, forcing a shift to involving the ashamed keepers, with the requirement of “a single honest breath” functioning as a subtle but meaningful demand. The ritual succeeds without significant resistance once they commit, so the conflict arc feels gentle rather than harrowing, with cost residing mostly in the keepers’ vulnerability and Marn relinquishing his tool. It’s a satisfying but relatively low-friction escalation rather than a sharply narrowing crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether sacred, stabilizing starlight will be released, hoarded, or preserved as a map of stillness—is present and resolved, but the escalation is intentionally quiet. Pressure accrues texturally rather than through sharp reversals: Eira’s ritual, the ignition of the plate, and the act of sealing all deepen the commitment to stillness, then the cartographer’s arrival gently stresses that choice. The risk of “panic” or theft by surveyors is named, yet never manifests as immediate on-page opposition, which keeps tension more conceptual than visceral. The final choice to bind the light and share only its intervals with another person is meaningful but under relatively soft external pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Ivo can stabilize the echo-swallowing cavern by repairing/reimagining the timer—is clear and escalates modestly via the nightly tremors and the seasonal deadline. His agency drives the turns: studying reflections, testing a temporary gear, then committing to the marble-based escapement. However, there is little sense of real jeopardy beyond conceptual loss; no option is painfully foreclosed or visibly paid for, and success arrives on the first major attempt at a final solution. Tension is steady and textured, but not sharply tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.3)
    The main stake—whether the weaver can remove and carry others’ burdens without becoming fixed like the weights—is coherent and escalates when the grotto traps them. The spatial imprisonment and deepening hush raise pressure convincingly, and the need to accept calcification of the thread (and thus a permanent carrier-structure) provides a real cost to escape. The final choice to re-enter this work under a new stance (orientation as recurring act) reads as an earned stance crystallization. There is room for a sharper moment of immediate risk or sacrifice in the escape beat, but the quieter, conceptual cost fits the piece’s lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.5)
    The primary conflict—how to live with and use grief rather than be hollowed by it—is clear from early on and tightened by the kettle’s ticking window: “While the kettle boils…you can do one honest thing.” Pressure escalates as each new channel forces Miriam to revisit a sharper, risk-inflected memory (Jory’s technique, his death, the empty cage) and to translate it into a rule that might prevent future harm. The price of this work—re-experiencing the accident and recognizing love as both duty and release—lands with weight, even though the stakes are purely internal. The quiet resolution is earned as endurance/renunciation rather than a soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will remain trapped in trying to undo a single catastrophic night or accept a smaller, ongoing role in maintaining the park—is clearly established and tightened through the ghost negotiation. Pressure escalates as she chooses to approach the lagoon at the precise hour, confronts a ghost that speaks in borrowed voices, and pays with the images that have been her private proofs of continuity; each step narrows her options and raises the emotional price. The external consequence (fixing the bolt, allowing the lagoon to move again) is modest but sufficient at this length, with internal stakes carrying most of the weight. The only slight limitation is that secondary stakes (the park’s survival, the stories’ fate) remain more atmospheric than acutely felt jeopardy within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the terminal will be treated as a dead structure for demolition or a living system that can be reanimated—is clear and Lina’s agency drives the key turns. Escalation exists in the technical challenge (priming pumps, waking lights, then the antenna) and in her deepening understanding of the building’s intentions. However, opposition is mostly ambient (cold, abandonment, implied demolition orders) rather than actively pressing back, so tension is more contemplative than urgent. Costs and foreclosed options are present but subtle, keeping the conflict strong but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—how he lives with his abandoned dream of bell music—is present early and tightens through the confrontation with the injured bear and the quartz’s mute vibration. Pressure escalates credibly: quiet copying → rule-breaking excursion → unexpected quasi-music in stone → ethical risk with the bear → existential shift about silence and vocation. Conflict is mostly internal but is externalized through the bear’s injury and the monastery’s nonviolence, which force concrete choices. The resolution (renouncing bells, embracing a new, silent “score”) feels like an earned, costly stance rather than a soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether to expose engineered myth-making at the cost of communal comfort and entrenched power—is well signaled and coherently pursued. Escalation occurs through deepening understanding rather than big reversals: the note reframes the silence, the sundial/tide-chart work nails timing, and the mayor’s mapping of belief raises the ethical cost of inaction. However, the external conflict around the broadcast itself is under-pressured; she infiltrates and airs the message with minimal on-page obstacle or risk, which slightly blunts tension at the climax. The cost is mostly conceptual and social (backlash, dismantling faith) rather than situationally acute.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving the rope/knot language against replacement by wire and tags—is clear and escalates from rumor of secret weavers to an institutional threat with a hard deadline. Lio’s agency drives the main turn: he chooses to demonstrate the code via the clerk’s own family name, which elegantly personalizes the abstract stakes. However, resistance from the clerk and council feels relatively soft; persuasion comes quickly and without a truly testing counter-move, so the sense of price and risk at the climax is somewhat muted. The compromise (rope kept for critical uses, knowledge made open) is satisfying but not hard-won enough for a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the queen can receive a form of her son’s “death” she can live with—is clear early and tightens when she finally appears and demands, “write her son dead without killing him.” Pressure escalates through the projection itself and the emotionally risky act of reading the obituary aloud while she leans on him, forcing him to balance honesty with mercy. The narrator’s micro-choices (how to frame the son’s departure, when to project his own presence) constitute quiet but genuine agency with visible emotional cost. The conflict remains mostly internal and relational, so it never becomes searingly tense, but for this scale it deepens convincingly.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Lorian will disrupt perfect mechanical symmetry to reintroduce living, unpredictable beauty—is signaled early and coherently escalated through his descent, retrieval of the improbable egg, and activation of the flawed patterning song. The key tightening comes when the cylinder turns, the palace lights falter, and the gears disagree, forcing a real risk rather than a purely aesthetic experiment. The automata’s alarmed arrival provides external pressure, but they never fully test or oppose him; the primary conflict stays internal and thematic more than contested in action. His final decision to keep the Cradle unguarded is earned, though the price feels more implied than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.8)
    External stakes (lives in immediate danger) and internal stakes (repeating or transforming her father’s legacy) are tightly braided from early on. Pressure escalates cleanly: mislabelled brush fire → discovery of accelerant and shack → boy trapped → disobeying radio orders → improvised graft under life-threatening conditions. The later investigator/coin reveal deepens the moral conflict—she could respond with defensiveness or fear, but instead chooses a costly stance of active compassion. The only limitation is that the copycat arsonist remains abstract, so the external antagonist pressure is conceptual rather than personally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.6)
    The external conflict (solve the mechanical/mystical puzzle to unstick the box) escalates steadily via the breadcrumb hunt, the secret door, the misbehaving latch, and the need to shift tactics from force to patient listening. Internal stakes—freeing painful memories versus accepting her mother’s protective erasure—are present but under-articulated in the climactic moment, making her final decision feel right yet almost inevitable rather than hard-won. The “sidereal patience” beat, where she stops pushing and listens until the box yields, is an excellent, character-driven turn. More dramatized friction at the moment she learns her mother’s role would sharpen the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—finding a way to share non-destructive light without re-inscribing generational harm—is clearly signaled and tightened via the transit and the automaton’s warning about serenity’s price. The key turn is Lior’s choice not to carry the new radiance straight back to the furnaces but to the outskirts, accepting slower, more fragile change in lieu of a grand fix. Conflict is primarily internal and situational rather than confrontational; no on-page antagonist presses him except inherited patterns and the Garden’s design. The cost is conceptual and social rather than dramatized in immediate loss, but it’s sufficiently legible for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—Jonas’s attempt to understand collective grief—is clearly signaled and pursued, and there is a meaningful deepening when the spirit reveals the “three pauses” and insists, “This is where grief joins.” However, pressure remains very gentle: the spectral visitation comes as benevolent aid, not a threat or test, and Jonas’s choices almost always align smoothly with his desire. There’s no real narrowing of options or real risk of failure once the mentor appears; escalation is more informational than conflictual. This keeps the piece beautiful but somewhat placid, which matters at a venue where sharper on-page cost is usually expected.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—restoring honest time to prevent further deaths and address engineered injustice—is clear from early on and steadily tightened as Mara uncovers Torren’s sabotage and the council’s complicity. Escalation comes through knowledge and action: stilling the pendulum, discovering the lead, recalibrating the tide marker, and then publicly revealing the evidence to the widow. The cost is felt in her acceptance that no technical fix can absolve her, only incremental service under the gaze of the bereaved. The conflict is largely internal and ethical rather than confrontational, so the tension remains quiet but coherent rather than explosive.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—uncovering Tomas’s intentions so Alvera and the “uncharted echoes” can settle—is clear and develops as new information emerges. The main tightening is the discovery of the coded message, which reframes Tomas from casual player to protector and prompts the dig. However, antagonistic pressure is almost entirely offstage (the inspector, past dangers), and there is little sense of present risk or difficult trade-off, so escalation feels more like deepening curiosity than mounting danger.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.2)
    The primary conflict—whether forecasting constrains or liberates communal agency—is sharply articulated in Jora’s exchanges with the Warden and in her struggle to compress a complex model into a one-page, non-dogmatic charter. Pressure escalates as she gathers data, confronts the risk of over-determining people’s choices, and finally commits to conditional, testable prescriptions instead of oracular decrees. The cost is mostly conceptual and ethical rather than dramatized as an acute crisis, which keeps tension somewhat cerebral. Still, her decision clearly forecloses the tempting path of comforting certainty in favor of a more demanding, iterative freedom.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether meaning and narrative can return in a city policed by Censors and numbed listeners—is established early and escalates via the luminous contraband scores and the inspection edict. Mara’s proactive choice to risk a central-square concert with embedded pirate lyrics is a credible tightening that resolves the central question. However, external opposition is relatively soft: the Censors arrive late and are swiftly neutralized by shimmering dust without any near-failure or painful trade-off on the page. The emotional and conceptual stakes land, but the tactical struggle feels a little too unopposed for maximum bite.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stakes—protecting the disappeared and their families while giving the dead a kind of testimony—are clear early and are tested when inspectors arrive and demand names. Pressure escalates credibly: curfew, illicit portraits, authority entering, then the inspector physically reaching toward the charcoal face. Lira’s agency shows in how she curates information and presents the work as an abstract study, but the key external turn (the inspector backing off) is driven by the rocking chair’s groan and his recognition, not a decisive move from her. The internal conflict—her need to keep working despite danger—resolves in a believable but relatively quiet endurance rather than a sharp, costly trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—whose story of survival will guide the rebuilt city’s future—is clear early and threads through Orin’s physical and ideological battles. Escalation is modest but coherent: internal agonizing → grueling excavation with named layers → confrontation with the archivist where he must choose between validation/food and integrity of method. His final decision to walk away and build his own rig forecloses a path with a visible cost and clarifies his hierarchy of values. The conflict remains largely conceptual rather than viscerally dangerous in the final beat, which slightly limits impact at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—saving the arts wing—is clearly established and coherently linked to Mara’s internal stake of resisting exclusion. Pressure escalates from chaotic, contentious rehearsals to the fundraiser’s high-stakes performance, with Mara’s choice to frame the program as a roll call of “vanishing species” and to rely on silence instead of pleading. However, antagonistic force is largely offstage, and the council’s reversal feels a bit frictionless, with little sense that the choir might genuinely fail to move them. The emotional and moral stakes land, but the external conflict could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will weaponize or redeem the knowledge fruit under the Ministry’s shadow—is clear and escalates via the botanist’s warnings, the growth of the tree, and the impending alignment. Her pruning and choice to invite even Ministry clerks mark meaningful tightening and deepen the ethical conflict. The danger of minds breaking or state retaliation is mostly implied, so the price feels conceptual more than viscerally dramatized. Still, the quiet, accumulative pressure suits the piece’s “gentle rebellion” mode and lands solidly.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.6)
    The central stakes—whether the truth about the bee failure will be buried or used to rebuild—are established and tightened effectively once Sela admits the council’s plans. Conflict escalates from curiosity about the box to a moral decision at the tower console, and the riddle’s demand for truth gives Maro a specific, pressured task. The resolution is driven by Maro’s agency in choosing full revelation over comfort or complicity. A slightly sharper on-page sense of immediate risk (e.g., concrete consequences for Sela/Maro) would heighten the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how attention can make spaces truly “alive”—is clear and tightened by Mara’s experiments and the storm that tests her theory at social scale. Escalation is mostly conceptual and textural rather than confrontational: she moves from solitary cataloger to quasi-ritual leader during the blackout, then chooses to relinquish the shard. That choice entails a real trade-off (personal power vs. distributed belonging), but external opposition is minimal and events mostly accommodate her goals. As a result, pressure feels finely wrought but a shade gentler than elite-level conflict could sustain.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—what truth about Nerina’s drowning will stand, and what Ilyan will choose to carry back—is signaled early and deepens with each revelation about the mines and the surface courts. Escalation is primarily epistemic and ethical rather than physical, but each “first revelation,” “second,” “third,” and “fourth” clearly narrows his moral options and raises the cost of remaining in error. Agency is present in his decision to follow, to place the ampoule, and ultimately to accept and transmit a more damaging, nuanced account. The pressure is strong for this length, though the danger is more conceptual than visceral, which keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether the protagonist can re-engage and possibly “fix” the missed opportunity versus accepting its irretrievability—is set early and coherently tightened. Escalation comes through increasingly committed tactics: climbing, mathematical argument, invoking the machine, then risking the self-annihilating act of giving up expectation. The final refusal to imagine a better landing forecloses a powerful option and thus reads as a real price. The conflict remains mostly internal and philosophical, which slightly mutes visceral tension compared to the intellectual pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central stake—whether kindness can be proven to persist—is clearly signaled and tightened by Ro’s pained half-recognition and the experiment to paint an “alphabet of remembered kindnesses.” Pressure escalates in a quiet, accumulative way as the writing spreads and the first strangers respond with offerings, giving the abstract goal visible risk and reward. The cost is primarily emotional vulnerability and effort rather than a concrete loss or risk of harm, which suits the mode but keeps tension gentle. A sharper moment of potential failure (e.g., a night when no one responds, or Ro almost leaves unconvinced) would deepen the sense of jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether art and refugees can coexist in the museum under Council threat—is signaled early and tightened effectively by the eviction notice and the danger of the hidden cache being sold off. Escalation is driven by Maris’s choices: leading people to the ice door, using bread and heat to thaw it, publicly rehanging the art to transform an eviction shelter into an opera house, and then confronting the guards with history and hospitality. The use of the community’s last honey emphasizes a material cost, and the risk of discovery adds tension to the thaw sequence. The guard captain’s hesitation reads slightly swift but not unearned, given the sensory and symbolic charge of the hall.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—changing his sister’s death vs. accepting fate’s cost—is seeded early and tightened well by the lighthouse’s rules and the low-tide window. Escalation is clear: his technical problem-solving builds to a moral/ontological dilemma when the submerged memory rewinds and he must choose whether to intervene. His ultimate refusal is an agency-driven resolution that forecloses a path with obvious emotional price. If anything, the external pressure (tide, danger) recedes slightly at the peak in favor of interior stakes, which works but leaves a touch of unused tension on the table.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake (neutralizing a curse that kills anyone who photographs her) is sharp and present from early on, and it coherently drives every step. Pressure escalates from disturbed return, to confronting glowing strips of her own face, to entering the last active booth and letting the clasp bite her during the flash. The protagonist’s agency is central; she chooses a risky, paradoxical solution rather than stumbling into a fix. The resolution is perhaps slightly clean—fear “slides off” quickly—but the visible risk and bodily price at the booth keep the conflict from feeling weightless.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—saving the drifting orchard from destruction and finding safe water—is clear early and escalates meaningfully with the squall and the oncoming freighter. Leeward’s choice to double down on sound rather than conventional seamanship drives the main turn, and the spar’s near-disaster becoming a tool is a strong reversal that deepens his philosophy under stress. The freighter’s course change and the storm’s “hearing itself mirrored” flirt with convenient personification, slightly softening the sense of hard cost. Even so, pressure remains coherent and grows, and the resolution is credibly earned by their sonic tactics and endurance rather than luck alone.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—penetrating the city’s apparent closure to understand/reach the watchers/expedition—is laid in early and escalates through increasingly deep intrusions (surface fracture → hidden stair → journal → gate’s secret identity). Each tightening is motivated by Lira’s choices rather than coincidence, and the final act of opening and stepping through the gate is a clear, active resolution. However, the danger and potential loss remain abstract; there’s little concrete pushback from the world or community, so pressure feels like a well-paced puzzle rather than a crucible. Strong, but not maximally sharp in terms of visible cost or competing harms.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.9)
    The central conflict—truth that may reignite conflict vs. a lie that sustains unjust peace—is clear and thematically sharp. Pressure escalates through the on-page reading of the letter and Mara’s tactical reframing, culminating in her concrete offer of an exhibit that both exposes and contextualizes the coercive truce. However, there’s limited sense of genuine risk that Hadrin will refuse; after his initial justification, the negotiation proceeds fairly smoothly, softening the perceived cost. Adding one more beat where his resistance threatens to derail the bargain would heighten the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—Lira’s attempt to reclaim and re-inscribe a forbidden space of memory against institutional control—is established early and tightened once Beran arrives to confiscate both the inkwell and her autonomy. Escalation is clear: covert entry → physical struggle with beam and debris → discovery of artifacts → direct confrontation and disarming of Beran → escape under the barrier of the raised drawbridge. Her agency drives every major turn, and the method of resistance (hidden notes) is meaningfully tested by opposition. The price paid is more conceptual than visceral—open conflict with the Council and a re-commitment to a path that cannot bring her mother back—which slightly softens perceived on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering and proving the forgery vs. personal and political danger—is signaled clearly and tightened as she discovers the stamp and the council names. The key deepening is the catalog’s shift from finding missing books to decoding a deliberate cover-up, culminating in her choice to conceal the stamp and limit what she takes. Tension is primarily intellectual and atmospheric; there is little on-page pushback or clock pressure from environment or antagonists. As a result, the escalation feels meaningful but relatively quiet rather than truly squeezing her options.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—recovering Jalen’s shadow and reconfiguring Mira’s grief—is clear early and tightens through concrete demands (mastering gem polishing, reaching the basilica, accepting the Archive Spire’s price). Pressure escalates from passive mourning to active risk as she agrees to “leave part of herself in the light” and literally splits into flame and paper to complete the ritual. Internal and external conflicts are well-braided, especially in the folding of grief into cranes as both magical technique and emotional calculus. The path to success feels slightly smooth—no serious setback or near-loss of the shadow on the page—so tension peaks more as solemn ordeal than truly knife-edge decision.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether he can seize the slack in probabilistic systems to inject mercy before the breakers reset—is clear and escalates under a real-time countdown. The overload, discovery of the potential pool, and the geode-triggered glimpse of the unbombed wedding each mark a deepening turn that narrows his emotional and tactical options. The choice to route the pool into the guidance net is both external and morally charged, intertwining his trauma with the ethical stakes of automation. The only ceiling comes from how smoothly it all works for him under intense pressure; a small on-page setback or doubt in the final steps would sharpen the sense of price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the missing matrices to tune the frequency of belonging—is clear and coherently pursued. Escalation is present but quiet: the move from surface exploration to hidden passage to assembling the word and activating the tuner is a meaningful tightening of knowledge and possibility. However, obstacles are minimal and success comes without real resistance or trade-off beyond prior off-page effort, keeping tension more conceptual than felt. The resolution feels earned but relatively low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will maintain a comforting lie or expose a painful truth—is flagged early and tightens steadily as the connection to Jonah’s mother and her father emerges. Escalation hinges on her realization that the withheld truth is communal and personally implicating, not abstract, which credibly forces her hand at the terrace. Jonah’s choice to keep the capsule closed provides a concrete reversal from the expected use of the false-memory service. The costs (loss of absolution for Mara, loss of fantasy-mother for Jonah) are clear, though the external jeopardy is necessarily quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—maintaining a fragile truce while preserving some shred of humanity—is clearly established and sharpened by the hostage threat and the moon-phase method. Pressure deepens meaningfully when Lena encounters the wire-bound wrists: this tests both sides’ claims to procedure and decency, and her intervention forces moral exposure from Sarin and Vek. The escalation is quiet but effective, shifting from abstract rules to a specific boy and mother, with apologies that cost each commander pride. It stops short of a harsher irreversible consequence, but for this length the narrowing of emotional options is convincing.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Theo will remain paralyzed by guilt or risk public, actionable confession—is clear early and escalates as movement repeatedly triggers his “backlash” of regret. The choice to head inland, to keep going despite the squall and internal excuses, and to write in the logbook are all agency-driven turns that foreclose his prior mode of hiding. Internal and external pressures interweave effectively, with the squall and distance to the pier mirroring his psychological resistance. The escalation is steady rather than surprising, keeping it strong but not explosive.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether he will remain an affectless tool or re-commit to costly empathy—is clear early and tightens through concrete decisions. Escalation is well-graded: saving the thief is a lower-stakes test that prepares the ground for the final choice between a safe new identity and public confession. Agency clearly drives the turns; coincidence (the traveler’s intervention) complicates but does not resolve. The primary limitation is that consequences remain mostly implied rather than partially enacted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will pay the price to restore her bond with Sable—is legible early and escalates as the ritual proves effective and the condition of a transformative crossing is voiced. The key tightening is the revelation that she cannot cross “unchanged,” forcing a trade-off between bodily self and silence. Her agreement and subsequent metamorphosis manifest that cost clearly, and internal and external conflicts braid well. Additional friction (a concrete temptation to retreat) could intensify escalation, but what’s here is strong and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—reconciling with the hours she wished away after birth—is clear early and escalates from eerie mystery to a moral/emotional confrontation at the tree. The key tightening is her realization that her own pouch is “fat as a plum,” forcing her to face the consequences of her whispered “Take it, take it” bargains. Her agency in choosing to relive the hours slowly, rather than fleeing with the pouch, is a credible, costly resolution. The conflict is primarily internal but remains sharply felt, though there’s room for one more embodied beat of resistance under the tree to heighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stakes—humanity’s continuation and Mara’s moral self-reckoning—are clear from early on and steadily deepen as she moves from sorting photos to sewing the quilt to performing the final naming of her flaws. Escalation is primarily internal/ritual rather than adversarial, but each step removes an option (e.g., renouncing violence, accepting her role in others’ pain, risking that the door might reject her). The pressure tightens most at the admission that the door may require self-forgiveness and in the hatch scene where she stakes everything on honesty, without force. A slight cap comes from the absence of a concrete external obstacle or real chance of failure in the final beat, leaving conflict powerful but quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stakes—Amina’s quest to grasp transformation’s “texture” and the emergent survival stake once the volcano stirs—are clear and interwoven. The key tightening is the decision to take the detour into the cave, which turns her abstract inquiry into concrete peril, followed by the tremor and ash that force an urgent escape; her choice to trust the hush over fear (rope) is another solid pressure point. However, the piece lets the hush and the bugs smooth away much of the threat so swiftly that the sense of irreversible price is muted. The later gathering of villagers hints at ongoing cost and commitment but remains more suggestive than confronting a hard trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—seizing functional control of the fort’s locks and systems without detection—is well signaled, and there is a clear tightening when the sundial shadow hits the third scratch and when Orven arrives to inspect the Archive Door. The protagonist’s agency drives each escalation, and the choice to act during the blackout forecloses safer inaction. However, the operation unfolds almost too smoothly: Orven’s suspicion doesn’t produce a genuine reversal or close call, and no concrete loss or sacrifice is felt on the page. As a result, tension is strong but not maximally sharp for the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Eren remains trapped in guilt/avoidance or accepts forgiveness and responsibility—emerges early and tightens through Marel’s request and the prediction of the “narrow hour” when the sea will open. External stakes (world navigation after friction’s disappearance) are braided in without overwhelming the personal conflict. The sea-opening ritual is a clear escalation point with both physical and emotional risk, and the final choice to stay and teach forecloses the path of flight the curse keeps offering him. The only slight softness is that immediate risk of failure or death in the ritual feels implied more than viscerally pressed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—how the narrator will respond to censorship and the father’s betrayal—tightens convincingly as the ritual deepens and the note is revealed. The father’s confession is a clear escalation that reweights the vigil and forces a new stance, not just a mood shift. Agency is internal but decisive: the choice to adopt Lysa’s method and recast poems as timed scars forecloses the more obvious path of louder defiance. Conflict is primarily interior and could bear one more concrete external friction point, but it still reads as consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—who controls and interprets the hidden route, and whether it serves citizens or exploitation—is clear and intensifies when Veller demands the card and Lysander escalates to a duel. The fencing match is a good physicalization of the ideological conflict and allows a meaningful tightening as Lysander risks bodily and political harm. Consequences land (Veller’s arrest, the civic reorientation), though the personal price to Lysander feels relatively light and under-explored. The ethical dimension of asking that Veller walk the route adds a welcome, if brief, moral complication.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake is the survival and spread of a fragile, subversive literacy/hope network under conditions of surveillance and civic fracture, which is signaled early and steadily deepened. Escalation comes through external pressure (riots, lockdown, abandonment of the official library) and internal wavering (Len’s shifting personalities, especially in June) that threaten to erase what’s been built. Len’s choice to rebuild the municipal branch and to re-engage with the prison via the tin constitutes real agency; the two-way contraband of books and seedlings marks an earned, if quiet, victory. The danger remains more atmospheric than viscerally dramatized—no single acute crisis scene—so the stakes feel profound but somewhat diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Lio will retreat into a timeless refuge or confront endings—is clear and is tested once the heartwood room reveals its looping offer. Escalation is primarily internal but supported by external phenomena: the compasses’ increasing flicker and the map-like film reel steadily tighten pressure toward a choice. His agency at the climax (playing the goodbye chord, then going off-script with the encore) resolves the conflict rather than coincidence. The only small limiter is that the cloud-tide reversal and broader danger remain mostly atmospheric rather than sharply constraining tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—saving the island’s cultural memory before the monsoon erases more of it—is clear, and the pressure coheres from the Council’s fear through to the storm’s arrival. Tavo’s agency escalates things via his methodological choice (empirical setup plus dream-interpretation) and his decisive planting ritual, with a visible personal cost in relinquishing certainty. However, external resistance and potential failure are lightly sketched; once he commits to the dream method, the process unfolds with relatively little on-page doubt about success. The resulting escalation feels more like a deepening of meaning than a tightening of jeopardy, which works but slightly mutes tension.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator will continue to let unprocessed resentment define the father’s absence—is signaled early and tightened effectively at the ship when the compass turns inward. Pressure escalates from abstract quest (“find the color of unspoken apologies”) to a concrete test: will they follow the lace pattern’s pauses and cuts or revert to shouting into emptiness. The cost (softening anger into something more complex and self-implicating) is legible but remains largely internal, with no external consequence or hard counterforce resisting the change. For a top-tier venue, a slightly sharper sense of what might be lost by changing (or by refusing to) would elevate the stakes.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are primarily internal and quiet; while the rot introduces a physical clock, the tension relies heavily on Mara's psychological adjustment. The escalation is consistent with the accumulative lens, though external pressure remains mild.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.7)
    The conflict is clear, but the resolution lacks resistance; the antagonist immediately "went pale" and was arrested without a struggle. The victory feels unearned because the central feat (the glass trap) is physically impossible and the opposition folds instantly.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.0)
    Conflict is minimal; the "flat pulses" of the music present an aesthetic nuisance rather than an urgent threat or high-stakes crisis. Orren faces no antagonist, time limit, or risk of failure, resulting in a progression that feels like a seamless demonstration of competence rather than a struggle against odds. The lack of escalation keeps the narrative tension flat.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are clear and thematic (oblivion vs. memory), escalated by the visceral physical threat of the deep ("sea presses on my helmet"). The pressure remains coherent under a Hybrid lens, culminating in a choice that trades physical safety for metaphysical resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.0)
    The external pressure from the officer provides necessary urgency, and the decoy tactic utilizing intergenerational skills is a satisfying, character-driven pivot. The climax's impact is slightly softened because the antagonist's reaction to the decoys occurs off-page, but the cost—the risk of exposure—is palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict is minimal; the antagonist is an internal "knot" that offers little resistance once the guide appears. The escalation is procedural (breathe, see, release) rather than dramatic, and the "cost" paid—emptying lungs of pride—is metaphorical and brief, lacking a visceral sense of sacrifice or difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure escalates coherently from the bridge's initial malfunction to the vertigo-inducing anomaly of the grown maze. The stakes shift smoothly from a professional task to a metaphysical rescue, with the protagonist accepting the physical danger of the "paper" reality to force a resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.0)
    Obstacles are overcome with convenient competence—instant decoding and a perfectly fitting arrow-wedge—rather than costly trade-offs. The protagonist succeeds completely without a visible loss or significant sacrifice to her goal.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.6)
    The stakes are deeply personal and escalate effectively through the testing of the device. The conflict transitions smoothly from a technical challenge to a moral confrontation, with the "click" of the cut line serving as a precise, devastating turning point. The cost is felt in the bruising memory that Mara must now carry and design around.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes are high and the pressure is coherent, but the tension dips when the "you" character delivers a chunk of expositional dialogue explaining the rules of the door ("destiny's door listened only to those..."). This turns a moment of high dramatic uncertainty into a guided instruction, slightly undercutting Lio's agency in discovering the solution.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.9)
    The conflict is primarily internal, pitting the trauma of past silence against the need for present expression. While the external pressure is atmospheric rather than antagonistic, the emotional stakes are high and the cost—confronting the "verdict"—is palpable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the stakes of identity and survival are established, the climax lacks genuine resistance; the antagonist passively allows Mara to broadcast her confession without physical intervention. The victory is achieved through a sudden "reveal" rather than an escalating struggle, deflating the tension built in the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are existential yet grounded in a specific task, creating clear tension between the failing old world (stars/sight) and the necessary new method (silence). The climax—Lyr ruining the map to save the navigator—is a high-stakes turning point that feels earned and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes escalate cleanly with the appearance of the "hairline crack," converting a philosophical quest into a tangible resource crisis with visible cost. The resolution is a distinct "Earned Stasis" where the protagonist accepts limitation to gain meaning, perfectly sized for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.8)
    Tension builds effectively through the surveillance and the decoding of the tickets, establishing clear stakes regarding trust and sabotage. The climax offers a meaningful risk (Mara exposing the plan), but the lack of consequences or pushback from the board dampens the felt cost of that choice in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.8)
    The stakes are beautifully calibrated: a quiet battle between bureaucratic data and organic truth. The tension escalates through the ritual, culminating in the vulnerability of Elias confessing his fraud aloud. While the external opposition is soft (Mera is curious rather than antagonistic), the internal pressure and the risk of exposure provide sufficient weight.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are clearly established early—Sen's ambition versus station safety—and escalate sharply with the vision of the broken rotor. The potential panic of the gliders provides a visceral ticking clock that forces the protagonist to act. The resolution feels earned through competence rather than luck.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.7)
    The pressure is coherent and atmospheric, escalating through the deepening mystery of the maps and the physical navigation of the ruined space. However, the opposing force ("the fear that kept everyone away") is stated rather than deeply felt or personified, making the stakes intellectual and artistic rather than visceral or urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    The stakes are clear and high—professional integrity and the trust of a partner. The escalation from internal guilt to the interaction with Mara, culminating in the confession to Eli, provides a legible external cost (vulnerability, admitting dangerous incompetence).

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes escalate clearly from a verbal confession to a supernatural confrontation, utilizing the radio signals as an effective tension ratchet. The cost is palpable and clearly defined at closure: the protagonist assumes the "heft" of the truth, foreclosing the possibility of ignorance or easy forgiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.1)
    The conflict is primarily philosophical (preservation vs. acceptance) rather than urgent, which fits the meditative mode but limits tension. The stakes are low on the physical plane; the protagonist faces no immediate threat of failure, making the journey feel safe. The final choice to "write nothing" is a conceptual resolution, but the cost paid to reach it feels light.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake (Mara’s silence) is clear, but the conflict lacks interpersonal grit; Liora meets little resistance, and the breakthrough occurs with relative ease during the eclipse. The "cost" is minimal—Liora shares a memory, but there is no moment where she risks failure or confronts a deeper limitation. The resolution feels inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.0)
    The stakes are conceptual but clear—the loss of direction versus the preservation of truth. The conflict escalates quietly through the discovery of the diaries' plea ("Set the axis back") and resolves with Lysa's decision to accept the shift, a choice that carries the cost of leaving the old world behind.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes escalate naturally from the abstract threat of "spycraft" to the immediate physical danger of the patrol boat. The climax requires Lian to make a tangible sacrifice (burning the method) and a tactical choice (redirecting the light), earning the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.9)
    The rhetorical escalation (anaphora to chiasmus to irony) creates a coherent pressure cooker, but the stakes feel more intellectual than physical. The "cost" of the engagement is low; Mara recovers "wholly present" and the rift is soothed without a lasting scar or sacrifice, limiting the emotional weight of the victory.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.1)
    Internal pressure is coherent, escalating through the density of the ritual and the approaching dawn. While external opposition is minimal, the protagonist's agency in drawing the map and conducting the silence creates sufficient narrative momentum under the lyric lens.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are clearly defined and escalate from a professional repair job to an existential entrapment. The pressure is coherent under the Causal lens, forcing the protagonist to confront her "versions" or be lost. The resolution requires a trade-off—sacrificing the safety of detachment for the "weight" of existence—satisfying the requirement for felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes are clearly defined (emotional death of the town), and the pressure escalates coherently from the broken needle to the entity's reveal. However, the protagonist achieves victory primarily through competence without paying a significant on-page price; she risks little personal loss to defeat the Listener. The conflict resolves somewhat easily once the correct technical procedure is applied, lacking a "dark night of the soul" or a trade-off that would heighten the emotional payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are clear and high (outbreak, political persecution), and the escalation follows a logical path of increased risk. The protagonist uses their specific skill set to resolve the conflict, which is excellent. The ease of the escape ("until the quarantine sirens faded") slightly lowers the tension at the very end, but the thematic resolution compensates.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.7)
    The emotional stakes escalate well as Lio moves from avoidance to confrontation of his grief. However, the external stake of the debt is resolved by the convenient note in the ledger, which acts as a soft reset for the "shame" aspect of the conflict, reducing the pressure at the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.8)
    The "impossible choice" is dramatized effectively, and the "third game" solution creates a new, stable tension (temptation vs. restraint) rather than a simplified happy ending. The protagonist's shift from drifter to vigilant guardian provides a felt cost, though the "third option" resolution navigates the dilemma with somewhat high competency.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.2)
    The central conflict (Mara vs. the Hush) is distinct, but the antagonist offers little resistance; the "twine" of silence loosens the moment she plays, bypassing the need for a difficult trade-off or escalation. The victory feels inevitable rather than hard-won, which lowers the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.9)
    The pressure is coherent and high, driven by the "live clock" of the amber transformation. The escalation from Orin's numbness to the revelation of his guilt is handled efficiently, with the stakes rising from physical survival to moral redemption.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.0)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no significant opposition, as Eli agrees immediately and the financial cost is negligible for a successful broker. The story lacks a moment of difficult trade-off or risk, resulting in a pleasant but low-stakes progression.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the stakes (safety, belonging) are established, the middle section lacks acute, rising pressure; the search is a cooperative montage rather than a crucible of escalating obstacles. The resolution comes more from discovery than a hard choice forced by opposition, though the final act of dedication provides necessary agency. The threat of winter and the memory of the fallen child add background tension but do not sharply squeeze the scene beats.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes are clearly established and escalate physically; abstract desires translate into concrete hazards (heat, Giant’s waking). The mechanics of "borrowing time" create immediate, on-page tension during the descent, forcing a trade-off between safety and success.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.5)
    The stakes are clear and personal, centered on the resolution of ambiguous loss. The escalation works well, moving from the ritual setup to the high-pressure moment of the opening seam. The cost—accepting connection without retrieval—is felt and coherent, resolving the central tension without a false "happy ending."

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=4.6)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no active opposition, and the environment presents opportunities rather than true obstacles. The resolution is achieved without a visible or felt cost—Lio gives up a found object he has no attachment to, resolving the tension without personal sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes are clearly internalized, with the physical cost of the transformation (thickened nails, root-palms) serving as a permanent, felt price for her new understanding. However, because the struggle to rebuild the trellis is narrated in summary rather than unpacked into a high-pressure scene, the escalation feels smoother and less fraught than it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stakes are established early (connection to the sister) and heightened by the singular opportunity to use the convergence machine. The climax presents a clear, costly choice—trading the brooch—which forecloses the possibility of a full reunion for the protagonist. The cost is felt and visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes are raised effectively with the possession, but the climax de-escalates tension by revealing the antagonist merely wants attention, removing the threat of violence. The cost of resolution—Lan's "confession"—is summarized rather than felt; the reader is told he confesses failures, but the weight of those failures is not dramatized in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stakes are clear on a communal level, but the protagonist faces minimal active opposition; obstacles (Sorrel's memory, the boy's cynicism) are overcome quickly with therapeutic insight. The escalation feels low-friction, lacking a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes are legible and the pressure escalates coherently through the environment and the punch's reaction. The resolution feels slightly swift; the cost is paid via the confession, but the internal struggle dissolves somewhat neatly upon admission.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.8)
    The stake of emotional endurance is clearly signaled and escalated by the shifting, demanding patterns of the tile that force collaboration. The cost is legible in the physical toll of transcription and the "knot" of shared grief Mara accepts, though the conflict remains quiet and internal.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from intellectual curiosity to an existential gamble as the shields fail. The cost is palpable and permanent—the loss of self and immortality—delivering a high-pressure resolution that feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.2)
    Stakes are immediate and high, balancing Sami’s physical safety against Mara’s relational rupture with her father. The escalation is handled efficiently within the single scene, culminating in a choice that forecloses the path of complicity with visible emotional cost. The conflict is resolved through active agency rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.9)
    The conflict is primarily internal and philosophical, which fits the quiet tone but lowers immediate pressure. The escalation is a deepening of perception rather than a narrowing of tactical options, effective under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake (memory vs. erasure) is clear, and the discovery of the label effectively raises the pressure from existential to tangible. While the investigation phase is brief—a single conversation provides the necessary link—the final action of hiding the files represents a meaningful trade-off, accepting the burden of memory to defy the system.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.6)
    The conflict is primarily internal but externalized through low-resistance magical objects; the compass and cello yield their secrets immediately upon use. There is no significant obstacle or antagonist to force a hard trade-off; the "skeptic professor" and "mother" are memories easily rewritten. The stakes remain abstract ("universal riddle") and the resolution comes without a palpable price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=3.5)
    While the stakes (cultural erasure vs. privatization) are clear, the conflict is resolved through an "explain-everything" ending where the antagonist abandons his goal because of a sudden thematic realization. This lack of active, prolonged resistance in the climax robs the victory of weight, as the opposition folds without extracting a visible price from the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.0)
    The conflict between preservation and inevitable progress is palpable and operates clearly under the Accumulative lens. The chemical countdown adds immediate, scene-level pressure to the thematic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.3)
    External pressure is functional (the ticking clock of the ship launch), but the narrative lacks deep conflict or a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt. Lio faces a technical puzzle rather than an antagonistic force or moral trade-off, making the escalation linear and the victory inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are established early (Ministry pressure, hazard pay) and escalate through the discovery of the convergence, which transforms a "rounding error" into a dangerous secret. While the antagonist (the Ministry) is distant, the internal tension and the threat of future consequences provide sufficient pressure. The quiet bravery of the ending lands with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.1)
    The stakes are clearly established (abandonment of the district), but the escalation is linear and low-resistance; the town's restoration proceeds without setbacks or significant opposition. The antagonist is an abstract decree, and its defeat feels inevitable rather than hard-won through sacrifice or tactical ingenuity.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.8)
    High stakes are sustained by the failing air gauge and the suffocating pressure of the hush, creating a clear "adapt or die" scenario. The escalation is coherent and forceful, though the internal pivot relies on a repeated beat ("overrode instinct") which slightly flattens the escalation of the psychological cost.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.6)
    The stakes are clear and personal: the struggle to reclaim a narrative against the weight of a family curse. The escalation into the lantern room provides a horrific realization that raises the cost of the protagonist's silence. The conflict resolves not through confrontation, but through a meaningful, active endurance (waiting for the bodies to be found).

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes are clearly defined and escalate through the interaction with the bride, moving from a haunting to a demand for completion. The pressure builds coherently to the final sacrifice of the bead and pulse, ensuring the resolution feels earned rather than convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are clearly established, but the conflict is described in summary rather than tested in a dramatized peak beat. The confrontation with the smuggler and the physical dangers of the maze are narrated from a distance, reducing the felt impact of the obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict is present but muffled by the summary mode; obstacles like the tremor and Sava's opposition are resolved quickly in narration rather than through difficult, real-time tactical choices. The stakes are high conceptually but lack immediate, scene-level tension.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from a professional commission to a high-stakes confrontation with a surveillance system. The protagonist’s agency drives the resolution (setting the trap), and the cost is felt in the courier's fear and the risk of exposure, providing a satisfying tightening of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are high and clearly defined, escalating appropriately with the arrival of the guard. However, the ease with which the protagonist neutralizes the antagonist via the orrery reduces the felt struggle and tension at the story's peak.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clearly established as relational and internal, deepening significantly when the spirits reject the "easy fiction" of the first letter. The cost is felt in the "blood rose" and the three days of waiting, ensuring the final release of tension feels paid for rather than gifted.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes are established early and are high (preventing an ambush), but the pressure evaporates instantly at the climax. The antagonist forces offer no resistance to Lani's explanation, which removes the necessary cost or trade-off usually required for a resolution of this magnitude.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are present but lack urgent pressure; the obstacles (aligning the film, finding the spot) are resolved smoothly by the dream logic without forcing the protagonist to make trade-offs or face failure. The conflict is low-friction, reading more as a ritual than a struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are primarily internal and conceptual, escalating effectively as the wall's resistance forces Mara to abandon her standard tools for a riskier, intuitive approach. While the external pressure is subtle, the conceptual cost of losing "certainty" is made felt and legible by the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are clearly defined by the neighbor's arrest and the surveillance state. While the antagonists are thwarted somewhat easily by environmental factors, the protagonist's active choice to lead them away creates a valid moment of agency and sacrifice at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure escalates coherently as the lilies blacken, forcing a trade-off between personal memory (the postcard) and collective survival. The cost is felt, though the external antagonism remains somewhat abstract until the end.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—the potential loss of names—is clear and established early. The conflict serves the plot well, though the obstacle (the journey through the museum) functions more as atmospheric pressure than a tactical crucible that forces a hard trade-off. The protagonist overcomes the "poisonous" air with routine rather than a costly sacrifice, keeping the stakes moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes are established early and the tension of the ritual creates a solid pressure cooker. The "sting" of the discord provides a felt cost to the resolution, and Ilyon’s counter-confession adds necessary complexity. However, the magical resolution softens the interpersonal conflict, resolving the "snarl" somewhat conveniently.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are clearly defined (mills vs. wetlands) and escalated by the public pressure of the council. The resolution is earned through Mara's technical translation of the coded message, though the speed at which the factions accept the compromise feels slightly idealized ("single hush"). The "pulse gate" solution grounds the compromise in credible engineering.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are immediate and high, escalating from the arrival of the stranger to the midnight confession. The tension is palpable in the "plumb bob" waiting sequence, and the resolution requires a tangible trade-off: abandoning her safety protocols to trust again.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes are personal and clear, and the seven-minute window creates a functional ticking clock for the climax. However, the conflict is low-pressure; the "storms" are backstory, and the obstacles are overcome with smooth competence rather than struggle. The protagonist succeeds by waiting and intuiting, which keeps the narrative tension mild.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.5)
    The conflict is quiet but legible: the tension between preserving the past (the sealed jar) and risking the present. The opening of the terrarium serves as a decisive turning point with a felt emotional cost—the loss of Jonah's safe stasis for a vulnerable connection.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.6)
    Stakes are declared as existential ("a room without doors") but felt as low-pressure; the solution to a world-breaking problem is a simple spoken apology with no visible trade-off or loss. The conflict lacks a true antagonist or resisting force; the environment yields its secrets too willingly, and the emotional repair feels unearned because the cost of the broken promise is not dramatized in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from a performance challenge to a life-or-death crisis, with the rising tide providing a ticking clock. The resolution relies on high competence (the shoe tap) rather than a costly trade-off, which lowers the tension slightly, but the pressure sequence is coherent and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are effectively raised by the Keeper's bargain (freedom vs. painful memory). The physical cost (tattooing with brine and dust) and the conceptual cost (binding herself to the city's grief) are legible on the page, driving the escalation to a satisfying peak.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.8)
    Tension evaporates rather than escalates; the inspector offers no meaningful resistance to Ilya's lesson. The protagonist pays no price for the outcome, resulting in a low-stakes interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are high for Mara (career/freedom), but the conflict with Jonah dissolves too easily, lowering the sense of struggle. The resolution of the secondary tension feels convenient rather than earned by on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.3)
    The stakes are high (survival), and the "polite collapse" provides a unique, if passive, antagonistic pressure. The escalation is primarily intellectual—solving the proof—rather than interpersonal, which works for this character but softens the immediate tension. The "gust" serves as a satisfying, earned turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate clearly from mapping to ethical guardianship, pressurized effectively by the hovering drones. The conflict remains largely retrospective (reading/decoding) for the first half, lacking immediate opposition until the restoration team's intent becomes the antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.3)
    The stakes are high, but the central dilemma is de-risked by the mirror's revelation that keeping the heartbeat leads to failure anyway. This alignment of moral duty and tactical success removes the potential for a more agonizing, high-cost choice.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.7)
    The conflict is well-managed, using the ritual to "corner" the antagonists into agreement rather than relying on unearned changes of heart. The cost is legible—surrendering the symbols of their power and grief—though the antagonists' compliance feels slightly smooth given their initial hostility.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—connection to the extinct past—is clearly signaled and pressured by the self-inflicted guilt of the drought. The ending forecloses the possibility of redemption through technology, forcing a costlier, irrevocable release.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake (freedom vs. control) is clear, but the antagonist acts as a passive obstacle rather than an active threat, reducing tension. The protagonist wins without facing a significant trade-off or paying a felt price, making the victory feel inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.4)
    The central stake—ethical storytelling versus artistic autonomy—is clear, and the "reverse story" mechanism is a clever dramatization of the conflict. The contract on the napkin represents a tangible cost (loss of control). However, the opposition is weak; the audience’s reaction is summarized ("laughter turned to a quiet"), and Mara’s acceptance feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.1)
    The stakes are clearly established as the survival of a fragile route against the forces of entropy and denial. While the antagonist is abstract (nature/static), the tension of the butterflies wavering creates a genuine pressure point, and the cost is visibly paid in Arin's labor and emotional endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.6)
    The conflict is Man vs. Material/Task, handled with elegance but lacking escalation; the stakes remain static (success vs. failure) without a tightening that forces a new trade-off or sacrifice. The protagonist succeeds through steady competence, resulting in a low-tension middle despite the high emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are clear and escalation is present, driven by the storm's approach and the failing terminal. The final choice involves a physical sacrifice (biting the thumb) and a surrender of control, fulfilling the requirement for a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from intellectual curiosity to a high-stakes spiritual wager requiring a tangible sacrifice. The pressure is coherent, driven by the protagonist's own decoding of the mystery, leading to a binary choice that forecloses his previous reliance on pure measurement. The cost is felt and visible on the page, satisfying the demands of the drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are clear and escalate naturally as the city's shifting turns the sanctuary walls to glass, heightening the panic. The conflict resolves through Lio's agency and the specific tool, though the ease with which the music box pacifies the crowd lowers the felt cost slightly. The thematic trade-off—safety for vulnerability—is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation is present and coherent: the sky resists the initial attempt ("star... slid sideways"), forcing a change in method. While the pressure on the page is clear, the stakes feel lower on the "felt cost" scale—failure would arguably result in a return to the status quo rather than a devastating loss. The urgency of the "returning frost" provides just enough momentum to drive the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are clear—professional ban versus personal integrity—and the boy’s challenge ("adults broke them first") effectively escalates the pressure. The resolution is earned through the physical act of mending, though the opposition remains somewhat static after the initial confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation is distinct, moving from professional cataloging duties to existential entrapment. The "trap" provides a decisive deepening of the stakes, converting the initial mystery into a permanent, felt cost of nonlinear duty.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict lacks genuine pressure; antagonists (the Clerk, the Curator) surrender immediately to verbal arguments without exacting a visible price. By rejecting Orren's offer of sacrifice and substituting it with "understanding," the story avoids the necessary cost that would earn the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes are high (rescuing a twin), but the escalation is dampened by the ease of the solution; the "cost" of trading certainty is stated conceptually but not felt in the action. The climax feels like a montage—"fog outside thinned with each sentence"—rather than a high-pressure confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.2)
    There is a distinct lack of immediate pressure; the gears click "politely" and the rope twitches helpfully, removing physical stakes. The conflict is abstract (truth vs. erasure) and lacks an on-page antagonist or obstacle that forces Mara to make a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.3)
    The external stakes are clear and urgent, escalating appropriately as the panic feeds the energy beings. The pivot from combat/avoidance to sanctuary offers a satisfying thematic deepening. A more palpable personal cost to Sava—beyond the exertion of the ritual—would have sharpened the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.6)
    Conflict is largely procedural (aligning the device) rather than adversarial or internal. The "shard of hush" acts as a magical key that solves the central mechanical problem without forcing the protagonist to make a difficult trade-off or sacrifice, resulting in low dramatic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.4)
    Escalation is well-paced, with the storm's physical threat paralleling the Archive's potential collapse. While the stakes of "oblivion" are slightly abstract, the pressure on the protagonist to act is undeniable and forces a distinct change in tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the stakes of starvation are high, the antagonist force (the Council) remains passive and offers no active resistance during the climax. Their sudden pivot from "starving proudly" to opening the gates is unearned by the fireworks display alone, lacking a felt cost or tactical trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.9)
    The stakes are effectively braided: the immediate relational conflict with Iven mirrors the looming existential threat of the harbor. The "foreseeing" beat escalates pressure by confirming the harbor's inevitability, forcing a pivot from resistance to adaptation, though the off-stage Council relies slightly on Iven as a proxy.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from the physical disorientation of the inversion to the specific, higher danger of the "scorched vines." The protagonist’s choice to pursue the "gilded hush" despite the risk of sealing the heart demonstrates clear agency and felt cost. The tension between the safety of the bunker and the terror of the sky is palpable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes are clearly established—psychological comfort versus the terror of the storm and grief. The escalation is handled well through the storm glass's reaction and the environmental noise, forcing Elias to deploy his method. The resolution feels earned by his specific intervention, reweighting the "silence" from a void to a tool of comfort.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.6)
    Conflict is the weakest element; the external pressures (time, physical barriers) yield immediately to the protagonist's first attempt, and the central temptation (the throne) is dismissed without hesitation. Without an antagonist or a difficult choice that carries visible cost, the stakes remain theoretical rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes are clear—suffocation versus breath—and the pressure of the "fading threshold" drives the scene. However, the resolution feels somewhat assured due to Mara's mastery of the ritual; the conflict lacks a moment of doubt or high-risk failure before success.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.6)
    The external stakes (Sen's debt) are clear, but the antagonist forces (the bank, the temptation of the slogans) are overcome with relative ease. Mara’s "soft laugh" in the face of her past demons undermines the tension, making her victory feel inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are established early and are inextricably linked to the protagonist's identity; the forfeiture of the throne is a massive, legible price. The tension of the acoustic experiment—risking the silence or failure—provides a solid escalation beat before the resolution. The conflict resolves decisively with the presentation of evidence, fulfilling the dynasty-ender arc with permanent consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.8)
    The conflict is primarily internal and unfolds with relatively low friction; the environment cooperates rather than resists. While the personal stakes are clear, the lack of significant external opposition or a moment of doubt before the climax limits the sense of earned difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clearly defined: the pain of erasure versus the comfort of memory. The escalation from a blank page to the hidden bundle tightens the pressure effectively. The conflict is internal and thematic but grounded in physical evidence, leading to a felt cost (shared vulnerability) at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.6)
    The stakes are clearly established and high: total erasure versus historical truth. While the emotional escalation is strong, the physical escalation is dampened by the ease of the truck entry; the antagonist forces (the Ministry) feel distant until the sirens at the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are high and clearly escalated by the leaking prophecy turning neighbors into sleepwalkers. The resolution does not rely on luck but on a difficult trade-off, ensuring the conflict is resolved through agency with a lingering price.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.4)
    While the stakes (the tree falling) are high, the obstacles are surmountable with minimal friction; the foreman is a token antagonist, and the protagonist succeeds through labor without facing a painful trade-off or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are established early, but the conflict resolves too smoothly through a sudden cooperative agreement. The antagonist's immediate confession and willingness to collaborate lower the cost of the final victory, making the resolution feel more convenient than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.8)
    The internal escalation of cost—first spending her own name, then the stolen ones—creates excellent pressure. The external climax is slightly softened by how quickly the thief submits, but the magical stakes remain high and well-earned.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clear and escalate from a general pursuit to a specific, harrowing confession of moral failure. The turning point—using a nursery rhyme to counter a confession of letting a patient die—is a bold risk that pays off within the established fable logic. The emotional pressure remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are clear and high; the search for the "mathematics of mercy" creates excellent accumulation of pressure. The climax forces a tangible physiological cost (reading the equation through pain), though the external antagonism of the tribunal remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.9)
    Conflict is present (erasure vs. memory) but lacks visceral pressure; the darkening shard implies a timeline, yet the protagonist faces no active opposition or difficult choice. The resolution comes through procedural competence rather than a struggle that demands a price.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.9)
    The conflict is atmospheric and investigative rather than high-stakes confrontation, fitting the "Situational" lens well. Pressure accumulates effectively through the quiet interaction with the dead, though the "cost" is more symbolic (the burden of the object) than visceral, keeping the tension effectively low-key but palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are clearly established: the stability of reality versus the desire to capture a moment. The escalation from the spiral frost to the flickering lights builds coherent pressure, forcing Lio's hand. The cost—chaos in the library—is visible and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are clear and personal, with the storm providing necessary physical pressure to the intellectual debate. The resolution forces a meaningful trade-off for both factions, though the opposition remains off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are established early (city's light/rhythm), but the escalation flattens at the climax. The Midnight Thief, initially presented as a formidable obstacle, capitulates to a single bargain without testing Ivo's resolve or extracting a visible price, reducing the narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.5)
    The stakes remain largely conceptual. While the "warning" from old workers implies danger, the actual journey faces minimal resistance beyond "cold thighs" and a "reluctant" needle. The cost paid (pouring a jar of rain) is symbolic rather than a forced trade-off of resources or safety, leaving the escalation feeling somewhat gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.5)
    Pressure evaporates the moment the lantern is lit; the "conflict" is resolved through immediate, frictionless cooperation between past and present. The escalation leads to an expansion of options (magic help) rather than a narrowing, and the stakes are resolved by a "fix-everything" ending that bypasses struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=3.8)
    Escalation is negligible; Lina faces no active opposition and pays no visible cost, simply waiting for the right lighting conditions to succeed. The stakes remain abstract curiosity, and the resolution feels gifted by the postcards rather than won through agency or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.0)
    The stakes (truth vs. safety/silence) are clearly stated, but the central conflict is resolved through a summarized conversation rather than an on-page struggle. The lack of real-time dialogue and hesitation during the "parley" flattens the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.9)
    The stakes (civilization vs. easy magic) are high and clear, but the opposition is overcome too easily through summary. The conflict with the woman and the town council lacks visceral, on-page heat; their capitulation is reported rather than fought for, reducing the felt cost of the revival.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.0)
    High stakes are established (hundreds of lives), but the pressure is released through summary, lacking a visceral on-page confrontation or obstacle during the critical moment of broadcasting. The cost is described as "soft unease," which feels conceptually apt but dramatically light.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.9)
    The stakes are clear but cerebral; the conflict is man-versus-concept (entropy/debt) rather than a visceral external threat. The cost is legible—the sacrifice of the oldest rye grain and the acceptance of perpetual labor—but the pressure remains quiet. Escalation is steady, moving from the physical puzzle of the seeds to the metaphysical burden of the corridor.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clearly established between the Office's fear of lawsuits and the protagonist's desire for effective warning. The pressure escalates naturally with the approach of zero hour, forcing a binary choice that Maris resolves with significant professional risk.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.5)
    The internal stakes of processing grief are clear, and the shift from isolation to communal mourning provides a legible cost (the loss of protective solitude). However, the external escalation is weak, relying on the convenient meteor anomaly rather than active investigation or pressure to force the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.6)
    The conflict between preserving the "weight of unspoken words" and the need for release provides a strong emotional stake. The escalation is quiet but effective, moving from general haunting to the specific, high-pressure confrontation with Mara.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.0)
    The stakes are clear and the cost (the urn) is paid on the page, satisfying the requirement for a felt price. However, the external opposition is minimal; the progression is somewhat smooth, lacking a moment of acute doubt or resistance before the trade.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=3.5)
    Authentic tension is absent; obstacles (the quarrel, the broken kite) function as straw men that yield instantly to the protagonist's touch. There is no meaningful tightening of stakes or felt cost, as Rian’s success is never in doubt and requires no sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.0)
    The stakes of legacy and survival are high, but the conflict is dampened by the summary mode; the monks' opposition is reported ("The monks complained") rather than shown in a tense interaction. The "brazen calm" tone, while requested, acts as a damper on the conflict, smoothing over potential friction points too easily.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are intellectual but visceral, escalated by the physical effect of the unfiltered signal ("teeth ache"). The conflict between the Council's script and the protagonist's curiosity forces a clear divergence in tactics. The cost is a conceptual loss—the destruction of the nostalgic myth of homecoming—paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.1)
    The stakes (peace vs. war, life vs. poison) are clear and high, but the on-page conflict is relatively low-voltage; the protagonist’s expertise solves the "pressure of memory" without a moment of genuine doubt or failure. While the "air tightens," the resolution comes smoothly through competence rather than a painful trade-off. A sharper snag or a heavier price paid for the "assent" would elevate the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stakes are clearly established, but the physical confrontation evaporates into a poetic resolution. The immediate danger of the guards is neutralized by a "hush" rather than a paid cost or tactical action, lowering the earned impact.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are clear and personal, escalating from a ritual sketch to a life-altering navigational breakthrough. The pressure is largely internal and environmental; while effective, the absence of active external opposition limits the dynamism slightly compared to the atmospheric strength.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict is mild; the protagonist overcomes the sentries and the Skywright with smooth efficiency, never facing a moment where the plan fractures. The lack of failure or desperate improvisation keeps the tension low, making the heist feel more like a puzzle than a struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.0)
    Pressure escalates coherently from the passive observation of rumors to the physical urgency of the "unbind" deadline. The climax forces a clear trade-off—safety for the preservation of truth—demonstrating high-stakes agency under the Causal drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are well-defined: the loss of self versus the pain of remembering. The cost of the "seed" memory is felt on the page ("pain tried to shut my throat"). The tension escalates appropriately with the approach of midnight, though the protagonist's specialized talent mitigates the danger somewhat too easily.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.3)
    The conflict is internal (guilt/regret) projected onto an external obstacle (the maze and spell), creating a cohesive pressure cooker. The "winnowing" of temptation versus necessity adds a layer of agency to the maze sequence. The stakes—saving the town versus the tutor's ego—are clearly defined and resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clear and the climax is high-pressure. However, the middle section relies on summarized iteration ("she began impromptu poetry sessions") rather than a dramatized scene, which slightly softens the escalation curve before the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are clearly established (sinking/death), and the thinning air in the Lung adds visceral pressure. However, the resolution follows a fairly linear path of success once the ritual is performed, lacking a moment where the protagonist must pay a new, unforeseen price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—emotional safety versus connection—is successfully tested. The pressure remains largely internal, but the act of speaking aloud and leaving the shell creates a visible moment of cost and choice that forecloses his former isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (reaching Jonas/proving the method) is clear, but the escalation is internal and atmospheric rather than interpersonal. The conflict is resolved relatively easily through the success of the ritual, lacking a moment of severe doubt or a higher visible cost beyond emotional vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.5)
    The stakes of "reverse migration" and the "geography of loss" are compelling and established early. Escalation works well through the lunar phases and the increasing clarity of the midnight calls. However, the physical cost of the journey is elided; the transition from the station to the aqueduct happens in a single sentence ("so we set out... At the aqueduct we find"), bypassing the potential tension and danger of the trek itself.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from the personal discomfort of the protagonist to the specific threat of Lio's relic, culminating in the external danger of the Ministry patrol. The climax is a precise test of the story's central mechanic—using the eye to occlude truth under interrogation—resulting in a tangible victory with a lingering moral cost (the burden of hiddenness).

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are intimate but heavily weighted by the theme of lost history and the dignity of the dead. The escalation from the puzzle of the empty hand to the discovery of the letter provides a satisfying deepening, though the pressure remains quiet and internal.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.4)
    The physical stakes (rising water) and emotional stakes (inheritance vs. autonomy) converge effectively at the climax. The dilemma offered by Ellis forces a tangible trade-off (legacy vs. freedom), though the "unfinished debts" aspect is introduced somewhat late in the dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are established early and escalate cleanly from a personal dream to a kingdom-level threat. The climax forces a binary choice—power or safety—that Maelin answers with a high-cost physical action. The tension between the temptation of the "velvet voice" and the necessity of the sacrifice is palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are clearly established: the integrity of Lio's work versus the Academy's commercial exploitation. The escalation from a quiet meeting to a visible political act is swift but earned through Toma’s warning. The cost is tangible—Lio sacrifices his inventory and safety to make a statement—ensuring the conflict feels substantial rather than abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are existential and immediate—sanity versus a scheduled ending—and escalate clearly through the failed first dream attempt. The pressure tightens when the protagonist realizes the grave is a "puncture" rather than a prediction, forcing a change in tactics. The resolution is earned through the protagonist's deliberate choice to confront the past rather than just observe it.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are established early, but the external conflict lacks sufficient friction; the father's anger dissipates instantly upon hearing Iris's sentence, resolving the tension with a "magic words" beat rather than a struggle with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.0)
    Pressure is coherent and escalates viscerally, visualized through the whitening facets of the ink and the encroaching storm. The stakes are dual-layered—survival and redemption—and both are addressed through a single, unified action. The cost is felt in the tension of the "held breath" and the risky deviation from standard protocol.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are clear and escalate cleanly from the "rattle" of debt to the surging current and blown fuse. The cost is visible in the broken bottle and the acceptance of the physical loss (the trees), fulfilling the "imperfect miracle" promise with earned limitations.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stakes are high (reality vs. illusion), and the pressure escalates coherently as the protagonist descends. However, the conflict remains abstract; the "narrowing" of arguments is described conceptually, softening the visceral impact of the arbitration.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.5)
    While the man-against-machine conflict is tight and escalating, the social conflict deflates prematurely. The inspector's arrival raises the stakes, but his immediate capitulation removes the pressure without forcing Ivar to make a difficult trade-off or pay a relational price.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are clear (security vs. public health), and the internal tension of "letting go" is well-seeded. However, the external conflict dissolves quickly when the strangers reveal their identity and produce the tags; the lack of resistance or verification from Lena lowers the tension at the decisive moment.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.2)
    The stakes—understanding the father's addiction before losing him—are palpable and escalate well through the subway messages. The message "Teach them odds, then teach them cost" delivers a strong thematic deepening. The resolution is quiet but weighty, paying off the emotional cost of the journey.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are beautifully internalized; the pressure of the caller’s "first goodbye" effectively raises the cost of Mara’s continued silence. The escalation from professional detachment to personal risk is handled with precision. The climax—making the outgoing call—feels like a high-stakes action because the emotional groundwork was laid so thoroughly.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes are clearly established: the town’s survival versus its comfort. The escalation is driven by Mara's agency, though the opposition (Mayor and Priest) yields somewhat quickly to her reading; however, the sea’s "cold" arrival provides the necessary countervailing pressure to ensure the victory feels earned rather than gifted.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.2)
    Emotional stakes are clear and escalate well as the narrator is forced to trade isolation for engagement. While the external pressure is relatively low-intensity, the personal cost of participation—giving up resources and emotional safety—is felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes of navigating grief are pressurized by the physical pain of the ring biting her skin, creating a felt cost. However, the antagonistic force (the panic in the stone) is resolved relatively quickly by "listening through her bones," which reads as a soft de-escalation of the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are effectively braided: the cosmic scale of the anomaly presses against the intimate scale of a personal regret. The escalation is sharp—the anomaly's tightening forces an immediate response—though the "threat" remains largely atmospheric until the specific signal arrives.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (being remembered) is high, but the on-page pressure is low; the protagonist meets little external resistance, and the "test" (capturing the silence, the musician playing) proceeds without complication or failure. The conflict remains largely internal and abstract, lacking a sharp moment where the protagonist must sacrifice something concrete to succeed.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are clearly defined and escalate from personal redemption to a societal act of rebellion, with the internal conflict between burning and preserving adding depth. The cost of the final choice—the loss of anonymity and safety—is felt, though the antagonist remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.0)
    The stakes are clearly established (resurrection vs. empathy, mental safety vs. closure). The climax relies on the "institute alarms/neural overload" trope to force the break, which is functional but less character-driven than the emotional confrontation preceding it. The protagonist's choice to endure the pain for the vision is a strong moment of agency.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes escalate naturally from professional pride and job security to immediate physical danger during the stevedore's entrapment. The pressure is coherent under the Causal lens, as the failure of radios forces the reliance on Mara's whisper system. The cost—Mara giving up the exclusivity of her secret conduit—is a felt price paid for the successful rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are immediate and high (a hidden murder, a grieving son), and the tension escalates effectively through the manipulation of light and darkness. The "watchman lantern" blinking back provides a satisfying, concrete release of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is a distinct lack of antagonistic pressure; the mayor and council capitulate immediately upon seeing the displays, removing any sense of struggle or risk. The protagonist’s plan executes without a hitch, and the "cost" of this rebellion is negligible. Without a moment where the plan falters or Eli must sacrifice something of value, the stakes remain theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.3)
    The stakes regarding the daughter and the island are high and legible. The tension of the standoff dissolves too easily when the artifact instantly resolves Rusk's opposition, deflating the conflict without sufficient on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.8)
    The "confession" beat effectively deepens the stakes, turning the transaction into a moral choice for the protagonist. The cost is felt in the decision to accept help from a complicit source and the physical release of Lena's bouquet.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation is clear: Lira moves from rewriting a sign to reframing an architect's warning to altering the physical stone structure. The opposition (Soren) serves as a necessary foil to articulate the stakes, though his resistance is somewhat mild (warning, then one physical attempt). The final cost—Lira losing her physical form to join the shadow—is high and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are clear and personal; Joren's reluctance is rooted in a dramatized addiction to "sour" awakenings. The resolution requires a meaningful sacrifice of his coping mechanism, ensuring the happy ending is paid for with character growth.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are established, but the resolution suffers from symmetric satisfaction; the risky choice to play the "raw archive" works instantly and perfectly on the officials, dissolving the conflict without the "rougher" struggle promised by the premise. The cost of Mara's confession is stated but not dramatized in the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.2)
    Escalation is mild; the ritual succeeds immediately without complication or external resistance, making the outcome feel inevitable rather than earned against odds. The conflict is resolved through a smooth procession of events, lacking a moment where the protagonist is forced to make a difficult trade-off under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.7)
    The stakes are clear (reconstruction vs. loss), but the narrative pressure is relatively low; the protagonist encounters little resistance during the investigation. The conflict is primarily intellectual and thematic rather than visceral, which limits escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are clearly established (safety vs. truth) and escalate appropriately through the visions in the light corridors. The pressure is both external (Elders' laws) and internal (seduction of nostalgia), culminating in a choice that carries emotional weight. The cost is visible in the protagonist's weeping and the subsequent burden of secrecy.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are well-defined: the integrity of the archives versus the loss of human weight. The escalation works well as the shadows evolve from "glitch" to "hungry," forcing Mara's intervention, though the antagonist remains somewhat abstract until the end.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.6)
    The stakes are clear (integrity, animal welfare), and the cost of the resolution is felt in the public admission and the compassion extended to the scammer. The antagonist's confession comes slightly too easily upon first contact, which lowers the external pressure, but the internal escalation remains high.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes are clear and the physical cost of reopening the wound serves as a strong escalation, though the lack of external opposition flattens the mid-scene tension.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are intimate but clearly defined; the pressure of the "unused love" is palpable and accumulates effectively. The escalation works through the sensory intensification of the vision and the physical act of threading the film, though the conflict remains largely internal and atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.5)
    While the stakes—the return of creativity to a starved city—are high, the on-page conflict is minimal and largely passive. The antagonist forces (elders/guards) provide no active resistance, leaving the protagonist to contend only with time and cold, which are overcome with endurance rather than tactical adaptation. The absence of a moment where Sel is forced to make a difficult trade-off leaves the escalation feeling flat.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are high and clearly defined (preservation of history vs. profitable collapse). Escalation works well through the protagonist's transformation. The external opposition (auditors) lacks tactical bite, folding quickly to a thematic appeal, which slightly softens the final pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are internal but externalized effectively through the landscape; the deepening understanding of the forest's logic raises pressure. The final cost—surrendering the "argument I had lived by" along with the physical gear—is a legible Conceptual Repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.5)
    The conflict between Mara's panic and the guides' deliberate slowness creates a strong, distinct pressure engine. The stakes are clearly felt, and the escalation through the vigil scene successfully deepens the emotional cost before the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are clearly established and escalate logically from professional duty to existential risk. The "C" moment serves as a powerful singular tightening that forces the protagonist to abandon their safety, with the cost legible in the triggering of the alarm.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.5)
    While the cost of victory (the library's collapse) is high, the protagonist faces minimal tactical resistance, overcoming the magical and political obstacles with procedural ease.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clear and escalate effectively from curiosity to a moral choice about preservation versus transparency. The climax is quieter—a handover of information rather than a high-friction confrontation—but the internal cost of the final decision to "hide the schedule" is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are established early via the "lull" and escalated through the decision to break radio silence despite the risk. While the antagonist is abstract until the final footsteps, the internal pressure to find meaning drives the narrative momentum effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.0)
    Tension is low; the protagonists face little resistance during the decoding or the ritual itself, and the stakes remain theoretical until the end. While the warning about imprinting adds a constraint, the execution lacks high pressure or potential failure on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes are visceral and clearly defined—Mina's stability against the intrusion of past trauma. The escalation from the frozen panic to the constructive action of building windbreaks demonstrates agency under pressure, with the cost legible in her exhaustion and the buried photo.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.0)
    The external stakes (being crushed) and internal stakes (artistic integrity/sister’s memory) converge well at the climax. The cost is legible: Mara must abandon her "sureness" and desire for perfection to survive and capture the truth, achieving a resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.9)
    The stakes are conceptually high (systemic exploitation), but the immediate physical pressure is low because the opposition is slowed/frozen, allowing the protagonist to act with relative impunity. The victory feels somewhat inexpensive as there is no significant on-page cost or sacrifice beyond using up a supply of ink.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure escalates well through the leak and the Council's arrival. The resolution—a political pivot by the antagonist—is clever but mitigates the personal cost for the protagonist, leaving the ending feeling conceptually sound but emotionally inexpensive.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.9)
    Pressure escalates well with the arrival of the father and the militia trucks, but the release valve is too loose. The external threat dissolves without a commensurate on-page cost or tactical maneuver, relying on the antagonists simply deciding to leave, which deflates the accumulated tension.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes are clear and escalate effectively when the constellation stumbles, turning the environment hostile. While Rovan's competence mitigates the physical threat quickly, the shift to a moral/conceptual choice creates a satisfying high-stakes resolution regarding the garden's future.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clearly delineated between the "beautiful, dangerous" headline and the messy truth. The escalation is logical, moving from tremor to math to physical proof. The resolution—a bargain that sacrifices the "miracle" story to save the work—demonstrates clear agency and cost, though the antagonist's capitulation is slightly swift.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    Internal pressure is externalized effectively through the "boiling pot" of silence and the crying needle buzz. The climax forces a direct trade-off between his protective silence and the painful truth, resolving with palpable emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.9)
    The stakes are established well with the "unlearning," but the escalation is undercut by the ease of the resolution. The teacher's instant transition from fear to relief upon hearing the echo feels unearned, resolving the tension without forcing the protagonist to pay a visible price or take a harder risk.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.0)
    The stakes are high—the soul of the community and the life of the boy—and the conflict between vengeance and aberrant mercy is resolved through a unique, tangible mechanism. The resolution earns its emotional weight by acknowledging the difficulty of the choice (the "sound like winter" of the cuffs).

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are clear but low-intensity; the conflict is cooperative, lacking a sharp moment of risk or opposition until the final coin flip. The shift from "despair" to "direction" provides a felt internal change, though the external pressure is gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.0)
    The stakes are clear (mental autonomy vs. corporate erasure), and the discovery of the generator proves the value of the "glitch." However, the antagonist pressure (recall agents) is resolved relatively easily with "coffee" and a "hug," which softens the external threat. The escalation relies more on the wonder of discovery than increasing peril, though the final refusal adds necessary weight.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes escalate from physical survival (tide) to existential contact; the "longing that did not feel like hers" effectively raises the emotional price. The resolution requires a meaningful trade-off—safety and heritage for connection—satisfying the requirement for visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.5)
    The conflict with the foreman is resolved through immediate group consensus ("closed ranks") without a visible or felt cost paid by the protagonist in the moment. The stakes are declared but the antagonist's threat is neutralized too easily to generate the necessary pressure for a high-scoring climax.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.5)
    The conflict is resolved with relatively low resistance; the enemy patrols are managed off-screen by Tomas, and the broken radio is fixed instantly with the prop. The stakes are stated ("saved three villages") rather than felt through on-page struggle or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes are clearly defined and escalate naturally as the environmental timer (gutters) runs down. The conflict between Senn's desire for secrecy and Rowan's demand for truth is sharp. The resolution feels earned through Rowan's agency, though the magical return of Mara is a swift reward; the cost is paid primarily by Senn (his office/pride), which fits the fable logic.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure escalates coherently through the visual distortion of the environment and Sera's dual state (thirsty/quenched). The resolution involves a tangible trade-off—ending the preservation to restore alignment—which gives weight to Galen's choice, avoiding a costless magic fix.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.0)
    The external stakes (smugglers) remain abstract and distant, resolved instantly by a radio call without on-page confrontation or adaptation. The protagonist faces no narrowing of options or significant trade-offs; the plan works on the first try, resulting in a flat escalation curve despite the suggested danger.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are primarily internal and well-escalated, though the external pressure from the "city below" remains abstract. The turning point relies on the artifact's magical response, which slightly lowers the sense of adversarial pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.3)
    Escalation is primarily internal, and the external pressure remains low until Arin's convenient arrival forces the issue. The stakes are resolved with immediate acceptance and a hand-hold, bypassing the potential tension and risk of the confession. The climax rests on a fortuitous meeting rather than a forced trade-off or difficult dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clearly braided, linking the personal (job security), the social (town riots), and the cosmic (invasion). The physical escalation—the manager pounding on the door—adds effective immediate pressure to the intellectual task. The resolution works, though the antagonistic pressure feels somewhat standard for the genre.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.8)
    Escalation is present (the folding wall, the breathing lock), but the obstacles yield too easily to magical tools and shifted mindsets. The cost is primarily somatic (shaking hands, tight lungs) rather than a deeper sacrifice or difficult trade-off, making the victory feel slightly inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.3)
    Conflict is introduced but not sustained; the climax lacks a struggle, as the antagonist folds without exerting pressure on the protagonist. There is no felt cost to the victory; the artist solves the puzzle and extracts the truth with a single gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.5)
    The conflict is linear and lacks genuine opposition; Dr. Sato watches but does not impede, and he capitulates immediately upon seeing the nail. There is no escalation of stakes—Mara is never at risk of failing, losing her career, or facing physical danger. The narrative lacks a tightening of pressure, resulting in a low-tension procedural rather than a dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.8)
    External opposition is virtually absent; the protagonist faces no antagonist or significant physical obstacle in reaching the camera. The internal stakes, while stated as high (erasing warrants), do not manifest as pressure on the page, making the resolution feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are high conceptually (lawsuits, failure), but low scenically; the conflict with the rival crew is recounted as an anecdote rather than a felt struggle. There is no moment where the protagonist's agency is tested against active resistance in real-time.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.5)
    The conflict is intellectual (decoding) and emotional (grief), but the protagonist encounters little genuine opposition; the "numbers refused to settle" until a dream simply fixes them. The resolution comes without a significant cost or sacrifice on the page, as the ritual works immediately and the "air cooled" to signal success. The stakes are stated but not felt through rigorous testing of the characters' commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.8)
    The external conflict is clear and the stakes (the curse, the frozen man) are well-defined, escalating appropriately as Thalen descends into the vortex. However, the personal stakes for Thalen remain somewhat low; he acts as a professional restorer of balance rather than someone risking a personal loss. The &quot;years of ice&quot; cost mentioned in the conclusion belongs to the twin, leaving the protagonist’s own sacrifice slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are high and clearly communicated; the escalation from rumor to physical sacrifice creates a coherent pressure cooker. The climax requires a distinct, painful choice from Lysa, ensuring the resolution feels earned rather than accidental.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure is coherent and escalates through the broker's counter-offer, which forces Mira to define her moral boundaries. The shift from a simple repair job to a permanent binding against "harvesting" deepens the stakes, and the cost paid is significant and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are clearly internalized, pitting professional safety against emotional honesty. The escalation leads to a distinct choice—abandoning the safe "facts" for a riskier, memory-based interpretation—that feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.9)
    The conflict between the desire to hold on (grief/ambition) and the danger of doing so (madness) is well-staged. While the "snap" of the field aids the decision, Nerin's active choice to let the light pass and plant the seed ensures agency and clearly articulates the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.5)
    The stakes—the potential souring of wonder into repetition and the loss of self—are clear and escalate through the protagonist’s active innovation (building the furnace). While the external pressure is gentle (atmospheric rather than antagonistic), the internal pressure to maintain meaning in a "long today" drives the plot effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.9)
    The central conflict is resolved with a tangible cost—the widower’s exposure and Mara’s falsified report. However, the resolution relies heavily on the pearl’s magical ability to "loosen tongues," which externalizes the emotional labor of the neighbors' reconciliation rather than forcing difficult dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clear and the pressure of the "off meds" state is felt effectively. While the final cost (public confession) is a strong closure move, the escalation leading to it is weakened by the reliance on the graffiti coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are clear and personal, escalating naturally as the cipher unfolds and demands greater honesty. The cost is emotional vulnerability, paid on the page when the dreamer transcribes the apology, though the resolution feels slightly swift due to the summary conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are clearly defined: the certification of a state myth versus the preservation of the natural world. The pressure escalates effectively from the general discomfort of the heat to the specific threat of the envoy and the vision of the "cannonwood." The climax feels earned, with the protagonist using her specific skills to outmaneuver the antagonist under direct pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.8)
    The stakes are internal and philosophical—preservation versus release—and are tightly braided with the action of the rite. While the external opposition is low, the pressure of the "threshold" and the precision required provides sufficient tension to carry the short form.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.0)
    Internal conflict is strong, with the struggle against "emptiness" driving the action. While the external pressure is low, the cost is palpably paid through the offering of the hairpin and the renunciation of passive contentment.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are clear and escalate well: professional safety vs. dangerous truth. The primary weakness is the resolution of the conflict with Sile, which is narrated in summary ("Then she told him...") rather than dramatized in direct dialogue, slightly distancing the reader from the final emotional friction.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—the loss of language and the need to pass on the craft—provides a clear ticking clock that heightens the lesson's intimacy. While the conflict is collaborative, the pressure of the magnetism and the weight of the "secret" create sufficient tension to earn the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—mastering a new skill—is clear but driven solely by ambition, lacking external pressure or an antagonist. The absence of a "live clock" or significant consequence for failure keeps the tension low; the protagonist navigates the challenge with patience rather than desperate ingenuity.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.5)
    The central conflict between automation and human intent is clear and escalates well with the arrival of the idea-engine. While the resolution—the automaton being "confused" by the light—leans slightly on a trope, it is earned by Davin's prior refusal to engage with the machine on its terms (unstrapping the harness).

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative lacks meaningful resistance or escalation; the protagonist wants, goes, and finds without facing active opposition or difficult trade-offs. The physical danger ("air ran low") is mentioned only in passing at the end, rendering the stakes theoretical rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.9)
    The "edgewise coin" acts as a brilliant escalation, transforming a binary choice into a desperate, risky third option that raises the physical stakes. The tension between the prophecy's fatal prediction and the necessary action maintains coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are internal but externalized effectively through the shrinking monsters on the map. The pressure escalates from general souls to the specific memory of the lover, and the resolution provides a felt release of tension without over-simplifying the grief.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake (righting the cosmic imbalance) is tested effectively by the steward's skepticism and the precise requirements of the spell. The pressure tightens during the repair sequence (waiting for the thirteenth drip), creating effective sentence-level tension. The resolution feels earned by Evin's persistence against the silence.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.6)
    The stakes (truth vs. legacy) are clearly established and escalate logically through the discovery of artifacts. However, because the confrontation is with a memory/past record rather than an active present-tense antagonist, and the resolution is summarized, the narrative lacks a moment of high-pressure, uncertain struggle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes are established through the council's demand, and pressure escalates briefly when Liora's hands shake. However, the resolution comes relatively easily through observation rather than a high-stakes decision that forces a sacrifice, limiting the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.6)
    Escalation is driven entirely by protagonist agency, moving from subtle signal analysis to a high-stakes physical confrontation. While the resolution is arguably "clean" (the mission succeeds without acute loss), the moral renunciation of vengeance in favor of stability provides sufficient cost to ground the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clear regarding the custody battle, and the pressure on the protagonist to choose is palpable. The external opposition, however, dissolves relatively easily against the protagonist's final technique, lacking a moment of severe, forced trade-off or high external cost.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.2)
    The stakes (innovation vs. corporate control) are legible, but the escalation is conveyed through summary rather than dramatized confrontation. The "trap" is explained as a fait accompli rather than a live tactical maneuver the reader witnesses unfolding. The climax lacks visceral pressure because the antagonist's reaction and the protagonist's risk are narrated from a safe temporal distance.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are intimate yet high, driven by the suffocating silence of the home. The escalation occurs through the intensity of the ritual ("conducts harder," "daring the tunnel"), effectively translating internal grief into external physical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    Conflict escalates cleanly from internal longing to external threat (the guardian lunging). The protagonist's choice to "wait" is an active, difficult restraint that forecloses the path home, paying a clear cost in the loss of the pendant's light.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.4)
    Conflict is low-voltage; the "stifling destiny" is an abstract backdrop rather than an active threat in the scene. Jun's opposition is nominal and dissolves after a single exchange, meaning the stakes are declared but never vigorously tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are established early (the city is to be scrapped) and escalated through the pressure of the perigee and the discovery of the signal. While the opposition is largely environmental and entropic rather than antagonistic, the physical cost ("sore hands") and the irreversible choice to dismantle the tower provide sufficient weight to the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are clear (vanishing commuters) and pressure escalates logically to the grotto sequence. While the resolution is earned through Lina's skill, the "fear in her throat" is told rather than shown in the mechanics of the solution, which proceeds relatively smoothly. The cost is conceptual—acceptance of the "now"—rather than a visceral price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.8)
    The internal stakes (memories slipping "like wet paper") create an effective ticking clock that parallels the external expansion of the maze. The cost of the resolution—a forced, naked transparency between strangers—is a legible and unsettling price for connection.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake (isolation vs. expansion) is clear, but the opposition is atmospheric rather than active. The "guards watched in silence" suggests tension that never manifests into a true obstacle, and the physical ascent—while descriptively vivid—lacks the visceral pressure or risk that would heighten the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=9.1)
    The stakes are high and immediate (a suicide intervention), escalated by the twist that the antagonist is the protagonist's own mother. The pressure is coherent, and the resolution requires active agency—revising the message—rather than luck.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure escalates coherently from the initial tidal constraints to the high-risk usage of the coil in the flooded passage. While the external stakes regarding the town's link feel slightly distant, the immediate physical danger and the personal stakes regarding Ken provide sufficient drive.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.8)
    The stakes are high (existential and legal), and the tension escalates effectively through the sensory ritual of the ink and the climbing heartbeat count. While the resolution relies on the ghost's ability to rewrite the database, Mara's active participation in the "ink alphabet" and her emotional surrender provide the necessary cost to earn the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are high and clearly defined (the irreversible death of a language). The escalation from simple translation to the high-pressure climax of Toma's death works well. The resolution is slightly dampened by the external rescue (the birds), but Ilen's physical sacrifice (scraping bone with his own fingers) adds necessary weight.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—saving Jonas’s humanity—is pressured effectively by the physical manifestations of the "Pulling Choir." The resolution requires a dual cost: Mara breaking her cover (professional cost) and Jonas transforming his trauma into humor (emotional cost). The escalation is coherent, though the mechanics of the "gravity hiccup" tread close to whimsy in a tense moment.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.8)
    The conflict between Lio’s organic rhythm and the city’s mechanical stasis is well-escalated. The confrontation with the statues and the subsequent liberation of the tree provides a solid climax. The resolution feels slightly swift—the statues’ conversion to "new guards" is convenient—but fits the fable's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are well-defined and escalate naturally from a request for fostering to a confrontation with smugglers. The cost of the resolution is visible and felt—the loss of the unique "thunderstorm in a bottle" represents a permanent expenditure of resources. The conflict resolution relies on a quick negotiation after the storm, which works well for this fable-like scope.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes are largely thematic and internal, lacking urgent pressure until the final repair sequence. While the choice to take the "wrong turn" provides a beat of agency, the cost of this risk is abstract and not deeply felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes are primarily intellectual and atmospheric; while the tension of discovery is maintained, the external pressure is low and the protagonist faces few active threats or difficult trade-offs. The escalation is steady and linear, fitting the quiet tone, but lacks the sharp foreclosure of options or high-cost risks typically required for the highest bands in conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.6)
    Escalation is coherent, shifting from professional routine to desperate magic to a final choice. The cost is felt in the "luminous absence," creating a meaningful trade-off between a false past and an empty but open future.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are clear and personal; the fear is treated as a tangible antagonist ("careful jailer"). The tension escalates steadily through the descent and the locksmith’s interrogation. While the resolution relies on a magical object (the comma tool), it is triggered by the protagonist's courageous admission. The cost is felt in the surrender of the "old laughter," satisfying the requirement for consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are clear and personal, with the internal pressure of the "habit" providing a solid spine for the conflict. The external antagonism of the Court remains abstract, lowering the immediate tension, but the escalation toward the decision to eat the mushroom is coherent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes are immediate and high (identity vs. exile), and the pressure escalates clearly through the trembling hand and the writhe of the shadow. The "struggle" beat is slightly compressed, but the emotional turning point is sharp and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the stakes (sister's health) are high, the antagonistic pressure is low; the magic ritual succeeds on the first try with minimal complication. The climax—drawing the fear-fruit—feels more like a creative breakthrough than a desperate struggle against opposition. The lack of a felt price or meaningful trade-off weakens the narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    Pressure accumulates effectively with each knot unraveled, raising the stakes as the environment reacts. The resolution with the ancestor is thematically poignant, though the immediate forgiveness slightly softens the felt cost of breaking the vow.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes remain largely conceptual; while the intellectual puzzle is engaging, the protagonist faces no active opposition or visceral risk. The escalation is linear investigation without a moment where failure feels possible or the price of success becomes painful.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.6)
    The stakes of sleeplessness and grief are established early, creating a clear internal pressure. While the resolution is earned through the protagonist's choice to let go, the climax relies heavily on external wisdom (Vaughn’s note and Earhart’s voice) to force the epiphany, rather than the protagonist arriving there solely through their own struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are clearly defined and escalate naturally with the approaching storm. The conflict is internal (Lio's reluctance) and external (the ghost's panic/time limit), braiding together to force a meaningful decision. The cost is subtle but felt—an Earned Stasis where Lio reaffirms his path of anonymity and service over fame.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.4)
    The stakes are clear and escalate appropriately as the code is deciphered. While the tension is well-maintained by the elevator's climb, the antagonist (the conspirators) remains abstract, making the conflict feel slightly removed from the immediate scene.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.5)
    The stakes are visceral and escalate cleanly from drifting to the dead radio to the "Fury" of the supercell. The pressure forces a clear, risky decision (dropping the telescope), creating a tight narrative arc with visible on-page cost (the risk of the instrument and the emotional weight of the method).

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    The pressure of the impending demolition provides a functional ticking clock, escalating the stakes of the painting. However, the antagonist interaction—the foreman simply nodding and leaving—resolves the external tension with a slightly convenient "respect for art" trope rather than a harder trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=4.9)
    Conflict is minimal; the antagonist is merely "dull drift," and the stakes are abstract (discovery vs. boredom). The protagonist faces no significant opposition or trade-off, resulting in low tension and a resolution that feels given rather than fought for.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.8)
    The conflict escalates clearly from the physical challenge of entry to the moral challenge of the gear, pivoting on the "take vs. make" decision. The choice to fabricate the part rather than steal it is a meaningful assertion of agency that validates the "rhythm of repair" stake.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict is largely external (labor, entropy) and low-stakes interpersonal friction; the "questions" about the ghost are resolved easily by evidence without forcing a painful trade-off. The cooperation feels inevitable rather than hard-won, and the lack of active opposition or deep internal flaws makes the victory feel smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.9)
    The stakes are effectively established as global doomsday versus personal survival, escalating cleanly as the clock's gears demand payment. The cost is lethal and paid on the page, satisfying the requirement for a felt price, though the external pressure feels somewhat predestined rather than dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ticking clock of the "night frost" creates effective situational pressure that forces the protagonist's hand. The stakes are clear (the child's life), and the expenditure of the "last nut" represents a tangible resource cost. While the rescue itself proceeds somewhat smoothly due to the protagonist's high competence, the thematic deepening at the end—choosing to engage further with the trap—elevates the conflict beyond the immediate scene.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is stated but not dramatized; external opposition ("The corporation balked") is introduced and resolved in summary without on-page struggle or risk. The protagonist faces no active resistance that forces a difficult choice in the present moment; the solution (foam insight) is applied without complication or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are clear and personal; the task escalates from a job to an existential confrontation with the protagonist's own absence. The cost is the abandonment of the "clean slate" identity, which is felt in the final beat, though external pressure is low (a "lull").

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are clearly established (mental collapse vs. survival) and escalate through Safi's physical exposure to the "contagion." The cost is palpable in the "itching" and "raw" sensation, though the resolution with the weeping soldier resolves the immediate tension somewhat rapidly.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.0)
    Stakes are declared (demolition) but never tested; opposition is dismissed in a single sentence ("Some laughed, some softened"). The solution comes too easily—a bell rings, farmers obey, the machine talks—resulting in zero felt cost for the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes are high and intimate (sanity/identity), and the pressure escalates when the mirror reveals the chaotic imagery. Yet, the resolution comes swiftly via Nira’s technical skill, mitigating the sense of risk; the "fear" mentioned is more stated than dramatized through difficult trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are clearly established (loss of memory vs. discovery), and the gravity timer provides external pressure. However, the protagonist's journey is relatively smooth; his expertise provides an answer for every obstacle without forcing a trade-off or significant sacrifice. The "cost" of the journey is mentioned (bone pulses, rearranged memories) but feels more ambient than immediate, lowering the tension of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.0)
    The struggle against the environmental "Great Muffle" is effectively dramatized through the physical resistance of the wire and stone. The escalation—tuning the tension until it "quivers"—provides a satisfying, quiet climax of agency that reclaims meaning from silence.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes are high and existential ("leave all maps wrong"), but the conflict lacks a tangible on-page antagonist. The "proud men" of the council are abstract figures defeated in summary, making the resolution feel too easy given the weight of the "betrayed covenant." Without a dramatized clash of wills, the victory relies more on the protagonist's insight than on overcoming active resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.0)
    While the stakes (public safety) are high, the obstacles are overcome with low-cost competence (magical "hearing" of unstable chemicals) and minimal friction. The conflict with the watchman evaporates upon the reading of the diary, lacking the tension of a genuine dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.5)
    The stakes are clear and the escalation during the bloom scene is visceral. The conflict shifts effectively from external (wardens) to internal/environmental (endurance of the stench), though the initial rejection by the wardens feels slightly standard.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake of orchard survival is clear, and the atmospheric pressure of the inversion provides a functional backdrop. While the final sacrifice of the arrow offers a legible cost, the narrative lacks immediate antagonistic pressure or substantial obstacles during the flight itself.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are established early (the silence, the missing crew) and escalate naturally from investigation to active sabotage. The physical cost (cut fingers) and the situational pressure of the returning crew provide tangible urgency to the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.2)
    Escalation works well in the cavern as the silence turns predatory, but the external stakes (rationing laws) evaporate in the final beat without a struggle. The antagonist force (the Council) offers no agency or pushback, deflating the accumulated narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.6)
    The stakes are personal and clearly defined, centering on Liora's need to process her failure. While the escalation works—she risks the forbidden magic—the climax lacks high-pressure resistance; the pilgrim offers the solution and the moral without extracting a significant additional price from Liora beyond her admission of fear.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are clearly defined, but the escalation suffers from a summarized middle beat where the Council auditors are defeated in a sentence. The pressure is intellectual and atmospheric rather than viscerally dramatized in that key conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.3)
    The conflict is primarily internal and thematic; the external stakes (mistakes, jitters) do not manifest as acute obstacles in the scene. The resolution is gentle and cooperative, lacking a moment of high-cost friction or difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes are clearly established early (the need for truth vs. rumors) and escalate effectively through the sensory intensity of the ritual. The tension tightens as the frost map forms, forcing the narrator to confront the painful reality of the sister's sorrow. The resolution forecloses the path of bitterness, replacing it with a difficult, loving acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.2)
    The stakes are clear and the cost—permanent silence—is legible and paid on the page. While the escalation is summarized rather than dramatized in real-time scenes, the trade-off between the message and the spinner's voice creates a coherent pressure that resolves meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes are clear and the cost (trading memory for skill) is visceral and permanent. The pressure coheres well, though the summary nature of the middle act softens the blow of the individual failures; the final refusal of the magician is a strong, earned escalation of agency.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.2)
    While the emotional stakes are declared, the multiverse mechanic allows the protagonist to bypass the consequences of the original timeline rather than confronting them. This lowers the felt cost of the resolution, as the "weight" is lifted by simply finding a more convenient reality.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.2)
    High stakes are established early with the threat to freighters, but the tension sags because the protagonist’s response (stacking stones) feels disproportionate and mechanically ineffective against the established threat. The climax—fixing the light—arrives as a delayed procedural step rather than a driven peak, diluting the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are clear (survival of the town), and the protagonist exercises distinct agency by turning a destructive accident into a constructive warning. The climax, while clever, resolves somewhat smoothly through the shadow-puppet mechanism; the "struggle" is intellectual/artistic rather than a visceral test of limits. The final beat successfully reweights the stakes by highlighting the danger of the protagonist's addiction to the "rising joy."

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake is internal and thematic, which works for this length, but the external obstacles are low-resistance (following a map without active opposition). While the cost is paid in the surrender of the dye and the ego, the "scavenger hunt" middle section lacks acute pressure or the risk of failure until the final decision.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.4)
    The conflict between the bureaucratization of grief and the natural need for witnessing is compelling. However, the opposition remains abstract; the clerks and the town are off-screen fears rather than active obstacles. The lack of direct pushback makes the protagonist’s subversion feel relatively low-risk, dampening the tension of the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.2)
    The central conflict creates initial pressure, but the stakes deflate when the protagonist's primary sacrifice is negated by the realm returning her lost memories. While the external threat (endless night) escalates, the personal cost is mitigated by this magical convenience, reducing the tension of the final choice. The opposition of the "night fighting back" is resolved relatively easily through the act of weaving.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.5)
    The narrative lacks genuine pressure or cost; the potential antagonist (the Archivist) capitulates immediately to a sentimental gesture without extracting a price or forcing a difficult trade-off. The conflict is resolved through explanation rather than struggle, resulting in low stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.9)
    The conflict tightens effectively when the bread—a static relic of grief—is transformed into an active offering, raising the stakes from observation to participation. The pressure is coherent, moving from the internal pain of erasure to the external risk of the "patrols."

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are clearly defined: the permanent loss of a human soul/promise against the entropy of the world. The escalation is handled well through the degrading signal of the slide, forcing Ilian to abandon passive observation for active participation. The emotional cost—the loss of his safe distance from the archives—is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are high and clearly established early on. The escalation through the failed attempts effectively raises tension, though the mechanical enumeration of those attempts flattens the pressure slightly. The climax forces a distinct trade-off: violating the market's truce to save her father.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.5)
    The tension between the Bureau's defined reality and the "security risks" provides a strong backdrop for the internal conflict. Escalation is steady, moving from private nostalgia to a public, risky confrontation at the bluff. The stakes are clear, though the external threat remains atmospheric rather than immediate, keeping this just below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.2)
    The internal stakes (creativity turning to ash) are stated clearly, but the external obstacle (the broken lock) is bypassed with a somewhat convenient, low-cost solution. The climax resolves the tension smoothly, lacking a sharp moment of sacrifice or difficult trade-off that would heighten the emotional payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are legible and high, blending the personal need for connection with the physical need for water. The climax forces a clear choice—abandoning the safety of lies for the risk of truth—which validates the central conflict with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.0)
    While there is a clear conflict between standardization and expression, the escalation is minimal; the Auditor arrives, places a stone, and is almost instantly defeated by the sculpture's defense mechanism. The cost—the eventual melting of the iceberg fragment—is meaningful, but the immediate struggle lacks sufficient back-and-forth tension or tactical maneuvering to register as high-stakes pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.2)
    Stakes are clearly established and escalated through the malfunctioning farm systems, forcing a desperate, character-specific choice. The convergence of internal static and external fire creates a coherent pressure that tightens until the release of the vent.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes of community healing versus silence are clear, and the intrusion of the outside world (drones, developer truck) provides functional pressure. The climax—reading the letters—delivers an emotional release, though the protagonist faces little personal risk or trade-off during the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are clearly established (rescue vs. drowning/capture), and the pressure escalates via the spider-web timer and the waking Guardian. However, the resolution feels slightly convenient—the Guardian is fooled too easily by the dance—and the cost (leaving the journal) is intellectual rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are intimately personal yet scale to the community, with a clear choice between painless oblivion and painful truth. The cost of the resolution—the return of "lived-in sorrow"—is legible and meaningful.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are clearly braided: the macro political threat (firestorm) versus the immediate humanitarian threat (poisoned wells). The escalation is handled well within the short scope, forcing Liora into a binary choice that she cleverly subverts. The cost is felt in the loss of her anonymity and the consumption of her single charm, grounding the magical solution in resource management.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes are clearly established (saving the building), and the pressure is coherent. Yet, the antagonist (the inspector) provides little active resistance on the page; he is easily duped in a summary paragraph, reducing the felt difficulty of the victory. The "agreed upon lies" concept introduces a fascinating constraint, but the execution of the final deception feels too convenient and low-risk to reach higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.3)
    The central conflict (keeping the memory vs. archiving it) is set up well but resolves with too little friction. The antagonist, Archivist Sol, offers a convenient compromise immediately, removing the pressure of a hard choice or sacrifice from Mira's arc.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.4)
    The concept of "calibrated treason" creates high intellectual pressure, raising the stakes from personal survival to historical truth. Liora’s choice to name herself as a forger and witness carries a visible, felt cost—she sacrifices her anonymity and safety to correct the record. The escalation from passive endurance to active rewriting is handled with distinct, earned beats.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.2)
    Conflict is resolved too easily through competence; Lira identifies the lie instantly and defeats the antagonist with a single counter-phrase, lacking a "dark night of the soul" or a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt. The antagonist collapses immediately upon confrontation, lowering the stakes of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=4.0)
    Conflict is summarized rather than felt; the antagonist is exposed and arrested without offering any on-page resistance. The lack of active pushback makes the resolution feel convenient and low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.0)
    The external conflict is resolved in summary ("caught a smugglers' runner") rather than through a high-pressure scene. The stakes of the trade threat are declared but not felt, and the protagonist's victory comes with minimal on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.5)
    The external stakes are well-defined, but the summary-heavy delivery of the resolution dampens the tension. The cost of the protagonist's actions (imminent arrest) is stated rather than felt in a high-pressure scene.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.2)
    Pressure evaporates the moment the characters meet; there is no sustained opposition or meaningful trade-off in the decision to collaborate. The resolution of the valley's conflict is treated as a magical inevitability rather than a hard-won outcome of the protagonist's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.8)
    Pressure is low throughout; Sato faces no significant failure, refusal, or external antagonist. The conflict resolves too smoothly—the youths and elders connect immediately upon hearing the music—lacking the grit or trade-offs of a high-stakes narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.4)
    The escalation is clear—bribe, threat, lunge—but the resolution is somewhat unilateral; the antagonists fold instantly upon the deployment of the tuning fork. While thematically resonant, the lack of a more prolonged struggle or a sharper tactical trade-off for Lio keeps the tension from reaching the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is strictly theoretical; while stakes (treason, revolution) are stated, they are never tested in a scene. The potential tension of the sabotage is dismissed in a single sentence of summary, and the climax lacks an antagonist force on the page, resulting in a resolution without palpable difficulty or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—truth versus professional survival—is signaled early and escalates effectively when Kellan intervenes. The pressure is coherent, forcing Mara to abandon safety for exposure. While Kellan is a somewhat standard voice-in-the-ear antagonist, the physical threat of the "staged scene" adds visceral cost to her decision.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from a bureaucratic parole question to a direct moral confrontation with a victim. The pivot from "parole theater" to the tangible labor of repair provides a meaningful deepening of the conflict, with the cost of labor visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—discovery—is clear, but the protagonist faces minimal opposition; the acid sea is a passive hazard she easily overcomes, and the algorithm removes the risk of navigation. The lack of a moment where Mara must sacrifice something significant or face potential failure limits the escalation and dramatic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are clearly established: corporate erasure versus the truth of human survival. The conflict escalates naturally from a technical glitch to a conspiracy involving Mara's own mother. The risk to Mara is palpable in her interactions with management, though the antagonist (Legal/Lattice) remains a looming, off-screen pressure rather than a direct confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the stakes of starvation and crushing ice are stated, the conflict deflates when Mara presents her solution and both men immediately obey without resistance. The resolution is achieved by fiat rather than escalation, missing the opportunity for a climax driven by hard choices or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation is functional (the storm), but the resolution of the immediate crisis relies on the contrived durability/sharpness of the bone tip rather than a costly human choice. The physical impossibility of the solution lowers the stakes by removing the difficulty of the obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes are clear and internal, focused on Mara's emotional processing. The conflict is low-friction; the "gently persuasive" resolution comes through polite agreement and shared theory rather than dramatized struggle, resulting in a somewhat static exchange of wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are both conceptual (wisdom vs. command) and physical (the twitching wall), creating a coherent pressure that escalates when Iri offers the bargain. The conflict is resolved through agency and mutual risk-taking. The tightening of tension during the ritual is palpable and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.6)
    Obstacles are nominal; Mr. Gant's opposition crumbles instantly, and the anniversary storm resolves with laughter rather than struggle. The lack of genuine resistance or difficult trade-offs makes the collective healing feel inevitable and sentimental rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clear—blame and punishment versus understanding—and the narrative deepens meaningfully as the protagonist moves from decoding to protecting. The choice to offer a "map" instead of a confession carries a felt social risk in the face of the Council.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stakes are personal and poignant, and the &quot;ticking clock&quot; of the fog and Orrin&#039;s fading memory provides sufficient pressure for an atmospheric piece. However, the conflict remains largely internal and environmental; the obstacle is navigated with relative ease through the driftwood method, lacking a sharp, desperate moment where failure seems imminent before the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are clearly defined by the closing launch window and the unique "swarm of the decade" opportunity, creating urgency. The external pressure of the quake escalates tangibly ("crack ran along the floor seam"), forcing Mara to improvise, though the internal conflict remains largely supportive rather than an active obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes are high (a dying wish), but the opposition is weak; Jonah’s six-year grudge evaporates almost instantly upon Mara's intervention. The "long silence" on the phone is a tell rather than a dramatized struggle, making the reunion feel inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.4)
    The stakes are high (restoring reality) and the pressure is sustained through the eerie mystery of the sliding shadows and the sealed door. While the protagonist faces little direct opposition or risk of failure until the final moment, the intellectual escalation is coherent. The final cost—risking her own shadow connection—lands firmly as a necessary sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.5)
    The central conflict—skepticism versus evidence of the impossible—escalates clearly and resolves through active agency. The climax (treating the changeling) is a distinct high-pressure beat that forces Rowan to abandon his safe worldview for a dangerous truth.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.9)
    While the stakes of redemption are clear, the on-page pressure is low; Lio encounters no significant obstacle, failure, or time constraint during the polishing process. The conflict remains largely internal and retrospective, lacking a moment of acute tightening where the outcome is genuinely in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake of restitution is tightly escalated, converging on a meeting with high personal risk. The cost is unmistakable and irreversible—giving up the "one protected thing" to secure the archive's future.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.9)
    The physicalized "current" of convention creates a strong, legible conflict that escalates as Mara wades upstream. While the thematic stakes are high, the physical danger (wind with teeth) feels secondary, serving as metaphor rather than immediate visceral threat.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.1)
    There is one meaningful tightening when the mechanical harp fails to elicit a response, forcing a change in tactics. However, the stakes remain relatively low; the keepers' "shame" is resolved quickly with a single breath, and the threat of a failed harvest lacks visceral immediacy. The conflict is gentle, lacking the sharp pressure or difficult trade-offs of higher-tier drama.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.5)
    Conflict is primarily man-against-entropy, lacking urgent external opposition; the "roaming surveyors" are a mentioned threat that never materializes to force a choice. The tension relies entirely on the success of the ritual, which, while atmospheric, lacks the sharp pressure of a tightening dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central conflict—preserving wonder against the "swallowing" of the cavern—is clear, but the stakes remain largely atmospheric rather than urgent. The pressure escalates slightly with the "deep tremor," but the resolution relies on competence rather than a hard trade-off or meaningful risk, resulting in a low-tension climax.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are clearly escalated by the "thickening hush" threatening to erase the weaver's agency. While the escape mechanism is clever, the moment of "boundary-lessly trapped" feels slightly brief; the struggle is resolved intellectually rather than through a prolonged endurance of the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.8)
    Internal pressure escalates coherently as the carving progresses and the kettle nears boiling. The stakes—transforming traumatic memory into a usable lesson before the water turns to air—are felt, and the emotional cost of revisiting the accident is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clearly defined: Mara’s peace of mind versus her guilt. The escalation during the negotiation—where the ghost tests Mara’s resolve and demands a painful payment—creates genuine pressure. The "flinch" beat adds necessary vulnerability, preventing the protagonist from feeling too competent, though the ghost's resistance could have been slightly more prolonged to maximize tension.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.3)
    The conflict is relatively low-stakes; the supervisor's radio instructions provide token opposition that Lina ignores without consequence or hesitation. The physical challenges (cold, ladders) are present but are overcome with a "calm" competence that dampens tension.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.8)
    Internal pressure regarding the "abandoned dream" is strong and resolves meaningfully. The external pressure (the bear) is somewhat low-stakes as the animal is immediately docile ("glacial hush had trained it"), reducing the tension of the physical encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.4)
    Tension collapses at the climax. Mara bypasses the antagonists (guards and locks) effortlessly using "training instincts," which removes all active resistance and risk. The conflict is resolved through competence assertion rather than dramatized struggle or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the stakes of erasing memory are high, the conflict resolves through a sudden, low-cost agreement; the antagonist folds instantly without applying genuine pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.8)
    The stakes are high and precise—the paradoxical demand to "write him dead without killing him" creates immediate pressure. While the external opposition is minimal, the internal and procedural tension of the ritual ("breath stutter") provides sufficient escalation and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from personal sleeplessness to a systemic disruption that frightens the machines and destabilizes the palace structure. The pressure is coherent, moving from the intellectual puzzle of the Vats to the physical tension of the Cradle. The cost is legible in the "bitterness" of the theft and the structural instability introduced to the world.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes escalate artificially through the medically implausible procedure rather than earned tactical choices. The conflict resolves via a passive symbolic gesture regarding a copycat who was not part of the narrative drive until the epilogue.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes are established early, but the obstacles yield quickly to Mara's specific skills without forcing difficult trade-offs or significant tactical shifts until the final moment. The "sidereal patience" solution, while thematic, bypasses mechanical resistance, lowering the immediate tension of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes are clearly established early (breaking the loop vs. repeating errors) and escalate naturally through the transit and the encounter with the automaton. The warning from the caretaker introduces a critical deepening of the conflict, forcing Lior to re-evaluate his victory and pay a price (continued exile/obscurity) to protect the future.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=2.9)
    There is a near-total absence of conflict or stakes; the "distant thunder" is explicitly "without fear," and the spectral mentor provides solutions without exacting a price. The resolution is achieved through a helpful supernatural shortcut and a compliant family ritual, lacking any earned cost or obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clearly defined and felt, balancing the lives of the town against the protagonist's conscience. The tension escalates naturally from the private discovery of the weight to the public recalibration and personal confession. The cost is rendered viscerally ("hot coal from her own throat"), ensuring the conflict matters.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.8)
    The stakes are primarily retrospective (understanding the husband's death) rather than active pressure in the scene. The "inspector listens" threat is introduced late and resolved instantly by the discovery, lacking a sense of escalating risk or hard trade-offs for the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.1)
    The conflict is clearly defined, but the opposition (the Warden) capitulates too easily upon seeing the "margins," lacking a robust test of Jora's conviction. The stakes are high in theory (starvation) but the on-page struggle feels low-resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=4.8)
    The conflict is resolved by a magical solution (glowing dust defeating Censors) rather than protagonist agency or sacrifice, rendering the antagonists ineffective paper tigers. The stakes are declared high (censorship, hunger) but the resolution requires no painful trade-off or cost from Mara, resulting in a low-tension payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are high and palpable, driven by the immediate physical threat of the curfew and the deeper emotional duty to the dead. The escalation is effective, tightening the screws as the drawing completes and the inspectors arrive. The resolution earns its release, though the "somber marvel" of the antagonist feels slightly rapid given the brevity of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are clearly articulated: the survival of navigational truth versus convenient erasure. The escalation moves well from the physical toll of digging to the ideological confrontation with Mara. The cost is felt in the rejection of the "meal ticket," foreclosing the path of easy reintegration.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the stakes are established, the escalation is mostly summarized during the rehearsal montage rather than dramatized. The climax lacks genuine opposition; the council’s immediate capitulation deflates the accumulated tension without a struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.4)
    While the conceptual stakes are high (the city's memory), the immediate dramatic pressure is low; the Ministry exists as a background condition rather than an active antagonist forcing difficult trade-offs in the moment. Mira faces no significant obstacles or near-failures; the potential danger of "delirium" is resolved smoothly by her competence without generating suspense.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—restoring the city’s power—is clear, but the antagonist’s immediate capitulation removes the necessary pressure for a high-stakes climax. Because Sela does not fight to protect her secret or her safety, the resolution feels given rather than seized. The cost of the repair is stated as a future social penalty but is not viscerally felt on the page during the pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are relatively low and abstract; the primary tension is atmospheric rather than urgent or interpersonal. While the storm provides a climax, Mara’s actions generally face little resistance or risk, resulting in a gentle narrative that lacks the sharp "tightening" or high cost required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes escalate masterfully from a historical correction to a personal indictment of the protagonist's own court. The realization of complicity acts as a devastating, well-earned reversal that deepens the conflict beyond the initial premise.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.4)
    Stakes are clearly established as an intellectual battle against emotional loss, escalating effectively as the notebook fills with contradictions. The cost of the resolution is palpable; the protagonist must sacrifice the comfort of hope to stop the machine, a trade-off that is felt on the page. The external conflict with the machine perfectly mirrors the internal struggle with regret. The tightening of pressure leads inevitably to the rupture of the assumption.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.5)
    The conflict is primarily environmental and internal; the arrival of the antagonist figure (Ro) dissolves into collaboration almost instantly, bypassing potential dramatic friction. The story lacks a visible on-page cost for the characters' success, as the "price" of kindness is relegated to backstory rather than extracted from the present action.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are clearly established (eviction, cultural erasure), and the pressure rises with the arrival of the guards. However, the external conflict dissolves too easily when the Captain accepts the bread; the lack of a hard tactical choice or sacrifice lowers the earned tension.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are high and clearly defined, with the rising tide providing a tangible ticking clock. The resolution is an Earned Stasis where the protagonist accepts the cost (his sister remains dead) to break the cycle, providing a legible and felt price for the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.3)
    The stakes are clearly established (life or death/cursed existence), and the pressure escalates efficiently to the flash-booth climax. While the physical cost (the clasp biting skin) is present, the conflict is resolved relatively smoothly, lacking a moment where the plan teeters on failure.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.5)
    Escalation is coherent and pressure-filled, shifting from the passive peril of drifting to the active threat of the freighter and the immediate violence of the spar. The protagonist actively engages with the escalating stakes, converting the deadliest obstacle (the spar) into the solution. The resolution feels earned through this specific ingenuity rather than luck.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are clearly established (stagnation vs. knowledge) and escalate appropriately with the discovery of the journal and the true nature of the gate. The opposition is largely passive (rust, stone, silence), which keeps the tension atmospheric rather than visceral until the final realization of the "mouth."

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.9)
    The stakes are high conceptually (civic peace vs. truth), but the conflict is dampened by the choice to report the debate rather than dramatize it. The pressure remains intellectual; we are told Mara is angry, but the summary delivery prevents the reader from feeling the visceral heat of the confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure escalates cleanly from the risk of detection to immediate physical danger. The antagonist’s arrival forces a clear stance crystallization, validating the stakes of the inkwell and the mission.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are clearly established (historical truth vs. corrupt authority) and escalate appropriately as evidence is uncovered. The pressure remains largely situational and intellectual; while the threat of the council is cited, the on-page cost is primarily the "quiet weight" of knowledge rather than an immediate visceral trade-off or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are established, but the protagonist meets obstacles with immediate competence and acceptance, lacking a moment of doubt or desperate improvisation. The "price" is paid without a visible struggle or hesitation, lowering the tension of the final trade.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.6)
    The stakes are immediately clear and astronomically high, balanced effectively against the personal cost of the protagonist's past. The conflict escalates cleanly through the technical procedure, turning a scientific experiment into a desperate act of warfare. The cooling breakers create a natural, urgent pacing that tightens the narrative focus.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.3)
    The central conflict is intriguing but lacks high pressure; the obstacles (finding the gap, fitting the chips) yield to competence without extracting a visible cost or forcing a difficult trade-off. The protagonist moves through the puzzle smoothly, resulting in a low-stakes sense of inevitability rather than earned tension.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes are intimate yet profound, escalating from a business transaction to a confrontation with suppressed trauma. The pressure tightens organically as Jonah asks if the false memory will hurt, forcing Mara to weigh the cost of her "polished" lie against the raw truth.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clearly established and escalate naturally through the discovery of the wire restraints, which threatens the fragile truce. The tension is palpable, and the resolution requires a meaningful trade-off (Lena's token) rather than a convenient accident. While the antagonist's capitulation ("jaw worked like he was swallowing a stone") is slightly rapid, the emotional logic holds under the established pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are internal and clear, escalated by the external pressure of the squall and the social pressure of Lita’s faith. The cost of the final action—confronting the record of his failure—is felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.3)
    The stakes are clearly defined and escalate appropriately, moving from a desire for blankness to a life-or-death choice regarding the thief, and finally to a moral reckoning. The pressure is coherent, and the cost of the final decision is significant and logically derived from the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.6)
    The stakes are existential and clearly communicated: the bridge requires the sacrifice of her human form. The pressure escalates coherently through the ritual, though the internal conflict resolves somewhat easily given the magnitude of the price.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are clearly defined and escalate from a missing memory to a spiritual crisis. The pressure is coherent, and the resolution requires a significant sacrifice of comfort, ensuring the "repentance" is earned rather than given.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.9)
    The external stakes are clear, but the central conflict—Mara’s guilt over the mutiny—is resolved too easily for the weight it carries. The antagonist force (the lock/guilt) yields immediately to her confession, lacking a moment of doubt or struggle that would heighten the emotional payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.2)
    While there is a cost in the renunciation of the lightning bug collection, the struggle to pay it is absent; Amina uncorks them before the threat escalates, making the sacrifice feel accidental rather than forced. The potential danger of the volcano is buffered by the protagonist's mystical foresight, lowering the felt tension.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the stakes (revolution) are high, the on-page pressure is dampened by the protagonist's overwhelming competence and the blackout's convenience. The antagonist, Orven, functions more as a prop than a threat, and the resolution comes without a moment of doubt or significant sacrifice, limiting the dramatic impact.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are clearly established through Eren's isolation and the physical danger of the bluff. While the pressure escalates with Marel's arrival, the resolution relies on a miraculous event (the sea opening/ghost message) that solves the conflict without requiring a sufficient sacrifice of Eren's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.5)
    The central conflict (resentment toward the father/censors) is resolved via an external explanation (the note) rather than a high-stakes choice or confrontation. The protagonist accepts the new information instantly, dissolving the anger without the resistance or cost required for higher emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.5)
    The conflict is well-defined, with clear stakes regarding the city's history and future safety. However, Lysander dominates the confrontation so thoroughly that the pressure feels low; he never seems backed into a corner, making the victory feel inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=3.9)
    Conflict is abstract ("beauty from anarchy") and summarized rather than enacted. While the stakes (riots, imprisonment) are high, they are narrated from a distance; we are told Len "nearly burned the pamphlets," but we do not see the moment of hesitation or the pressure that forces a decision. The lack of dramatized obstacles flattens the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clear and escalate naturally from a personal quirk to a station-wide anomaly. The pressure of the flickering compasses pointing at Lio forces the climax effectively, though the cost of the final choice is primarily emotional rather than tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    The looming monsoon provides effective external pressure, creating a ticking clock that heightens the stakes of the fading memories. The climax successfully braids the internal struggle (the need for proof) with the external threat, resulting in a satisfying tightening of the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.6)
    The conflict is internalized but effectively externalized through the compass and the bonsai. The escalation is steady, driven by the lace instructions which force the narrator to confront the ship. The "cost" is the admission of culpability, which is felt on the page.

== Grader: Kimi K2-0905 ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: restore breathable order to the greenhouse and, by proxy, to Mara’s inner order. Escalation is textural: each dust sheet thickens the spiral, tightening stakes until the leak is located and patched. The tightening is visible, not declared; the price is the week of labor and the conceded telescope loss. No coincidence; pressure is coherent under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes—expose the charcoal ring or remain silent—tighten when she learns the schoolhouse delivery bears the councilman’s name. The on-page reversal is the choice to trap the evidence in glass rather than march back with the strip, a tactic that raises public risk and personal visibility; cost is legible in the final image of deputies hauling ledgers away.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can silence be translated into shared music?—is signaled in paragraph one and deepened when the thermal system warps songs into flat pulses. One meaningful tightening: the missing fork must be reunited or the communal choir collapses; Orren’s decision to hand the brass fork to the child crystallizes the trade-off. Cost is visible—the fork leaves his possession again, now with purpose, and the child’s heat pattern sharpens under public gaze. Pressure stays coherent under Causal lens; no coincidence resolves the flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—give the drifting dead a permanent address—is signaled in paragraph 1 and escalates through each accretive beat: taps accelerate, beams falter, his ears bleed, options narrow to “brace it with my hands.” The final long tone is not luck but the cumulative price of his stubborn endurance; the library’s acceptance is earned, not gifted. One meaningful tightening occurs when the card catalog lists Marek himself as the last volume, forcing him to pay with personal permanence. Cost is visible (blood in helmet, suit seams whispering) and alters tactics—he sacrifices breathing air to revitalize the machine.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—keep people fed without exposing donors—tightens when the officer threatens midnight inspection; Amira’s decoy-route decision visibly raises collective risk. Pressure is causal, single-cycle, sufficient for 700-word scope; cost is the now-public bell-ring that forecloses secrecy.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.8)
    One dominant stake—where unused love is stored—tightens through the single breathing-deepening beat that forecloses hoarding; the price (loss of the ember-knot) is visible on-page, satisfying the Accumulative/Textural escalation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“can I free the woman without destroying the bridge?”—is signaled early and tightens when the photographs begin to move, forcing the choice to let them disintegrate. The price is legible: Lio’s voice flips from old to young to absent, and the designer exits with only an empty image. Escalation is single-cycle but sufficient for 700 words; a second intermediate complication would have lifted it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“plant resilience”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when engine growl makes every second a choice between saving seed or self. The piano-bench cipher and chain-barricade are visible prices that foreclose retreat. Militia arrival is coincidence that complicates, not resolves, keeping causality intact under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“catch the sound of trust breaking”—tightens when the prototype forces Rell’s confession; one decisive intensification suffices. Cost is visible (Rell’s yellow sheen drains, Mara forfeits private vengeance for communal justice), though the off-page magistrate slightly dilutes the immediate price.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake— will Lio preserve his art-hoard or release the girl— is signaled early and tightens once: the moonbeam outline reveals the drawn door in her hand, forcing an either-or. Agency drives escalation: he must physically destroy his artifact to avert her disappearance. Cost is legible— loss of a unique print and of the “only luminous minute” ethos— though external pressure (what happens if she boards?) stays abstract. Sufficient for 600-word scale.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—can inquiry be made safe—signalled early; pressure escalates through each glass panel that makes eavesdropping harder but self-exposure certain. Mid-story micro-turn: she stops narrating, accepting silence as cost—this deepens rather than reverses, sufficient for 600-word accumulative arc. Price is legible: former colleagues’ absence and her solitary vigil. Could reach 8.8+ if a live antagonist or material setback had forced a final trade-off; as is, tension is atmospheric rather than acute.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—ownership of identity versus studio erasure—signaled in paragraph 1 and escalates through each decryption beat. Pressure tightens when decrypted names foreclose the option of private escape; public exposure becomes the only path. Cost is legible: she trades lifelong anonymity for justice. No coincidence resolves; crew turn is earned by on-page playback. Could use one earlier glimpse that the crew are within earshot to sharpen the final pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—will the narrator possess a usable map once the stars disappear—tightens through accretion: each flake lost from the booklet raises the cost of failure. The midpoint deepening (the map is of “distances between terrors,” not lights) reweights the goal without external antagonism. Agency is exercised by retelling in omissions, a renunciation that forecloses the old cartographic logic. One more beat of bodily risk (a slip on the salt-slick battlement) would have pushed the pressure into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“where do thoughts come from?”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens through each loop’s incremental cost. The fifteenth-loop crack delivers the decisive pressure shift: continued curiosity will destroy the instrument and strand the robot in recursion. Agency is legible: J-17 chooses amalgamation over further theft of time, paying with the violin’s integrity. Cost is on-stage and felt under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—institutional trust vs. personal safety—tightens once the split-circle route points to Mara’s own window, forcing a public choice. Escalation is causal: each doodle copy narrows her options until silence becomes complicity. Visible price: she sacrifices anonymity by signing the ledger. No coincidence; the final revelation is triggered by her own lens-return gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can a garden forgive its gardener?—tightens when the old fraud is quantifiably punished. The one-night maze ritual forces a public confession that forecloses further denial; pulse and breath become the battleground. Cost is visible: aching back, trembling hands, the marble left behind. Escalation is steady under the causal lens; no off-stage rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—station integrity versus scientific breakthrough—tightens when Mara foresees the rotor shearing the aviary. One meaningful escalation: she climbs to the roof while the nexus is still live, trading Sen’s data desire for her own custodial agency. Price is the unquantifiable sideways memory she now carries.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—restore the house’s voice—tightens through each water-stain revelation; the missing beats in the score foreclose a normal concert, forcing Lena into ruin-crawlspaces. Cost is visible: she forfeits safety, soaks the program, and accepts a score that can only exist in gaps. One escalation only, but it is decisive and on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—exact weight of the swallowed lie—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the smudge makes the false reading physically disappear. The narrator’s agency drives every turn: lie → conceal → smudge → confess. Cost is visible in the trembling finger at the petal and the stiff-shouldered forgiveness front. One minor slack: rescue coincidence could have complicated rather than eased the pressure, but the story keeps focus on the internal price.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“find the weight of swallowed truth”—tightens when the ghost shift materializes and the badge reveals Mara’s murder. Protagonist agency drives every escalation: turning the wheel, interrogating the dead man, reversing the valve. Cost is visible: he exits ready to destroy Mara’s cover. No safety resets.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—“witness without judgment”—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: the swan leads to a place that demands judgment, but the keeper’s refusal costs nothing we haven’t already been told he won’t pay. No new option is foreclosed; silence repairs him without visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can shared sound reopen Mara’s voice—tightens once: darkness drops, Liora risks showing the curl, and the option set narrows to hum or retreat. Pressure is textural-accumulative: sensory eclipse cues intensify rather than external antagonist moves. Visible price is Liora’s emotional nakedness; Mara pays with first fragile sound. Missing a mid-story obstacle beat keeps it from 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve witness of the axis-shift—tightens when each diary entry forecloses denial; the final pinning is the irrevocable trade-off. Pressure is textural: curled black edges, cedar-panic smell, dragon shadows crawling toward the hearth escalate density. No coincidence; escalation is driven by Lysa’s probing agency. Cost is legible: she abandons restoration for memorialization.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—control of information flow—tightens when patrol boat follows the very beam she once used for smuggling. One meaningful turn: she swings the light inland, sacrificing her own channel to save the courier. Cost is immediate: loss of her fortune archive and exposure to patrol. Escalation is causal, not coincidental; no off-stage rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—prevent full possession—signaled in paragraph 3. Escalation is causal: each rhetorical loop narrows the parasite’s options until the memory surfaces and forecloses conquest. Visible price: Mara shivers, the ring trembles, the rift exhales cold. One meaningful tightening suffices; no coincidence resolves. Could edge 9.0 if the cost left a persistent physical mark.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“return is a rhythm, not a road”—tightens once: the protagonist trades nostalgic clawing for generative listening. The horizon’s slide and memory-map alignment force the stance crystallization; cost is the forever-loss of the childhood dawn as possession. Escalation is quiet but legible under Accumulative lens; no reversals are needed.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—escape the self-made labyrinth—signals early. Escalation under causal lens: each fear-widened branch narrows her exit until the final breath-held moment forces the stay-or-drift choice. Cost is visible: she rises “heavier than before,” foreclosing the old weightless avoidance. One tightening beat suffices; no external antagonist needed. Drone strand adds texture but no extra pressure, capping at 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaim feeling from the parasite—tightens when the Listener appears and Mara realizes the filament is feeding on unattended sorrow. Agency is continuous: she chooses reversal, then chooses to scar the groove, each act narrowing options and raising physical cost (heat in ribs, dust on palm). The final beat forecloses the path of passive silence; the cavern now returns echo, and Mara’s classroom future is re-opened yet remains fragile—felt price without tidy victory.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—integrity of data vs. state falsification—tightens when the narrator’s name appears on an illegal list; every lateral move (wall hops, river slither) raises exposure. The chlorine-disinfectant scene forces a visceral trade-off: inhale evidence or flee; he stays, copies logs, pays with delayed sirens. Cost is on-page and persistent.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will Lio uncork grief or stay safe—tightens when moonrise and trembling husks force the choice; the single breath release narrows options and visibly pays the price of his broker identity. Pressure is coherent under causal lens; no coincidence resolves. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“map them and lose collective hours, or stay surface-skimming”—is signaled in the first third and sharpened by each grotto layer tasted. The slip-knot third option narrows choices to a single recitable verse, tightening pressure without multiplicity of reversals. Cost is visceral: the poet forfeits omniscient discovery to keep choices “human-sized,” a renunciation felt in the final roadside vigil. Agency drives every beat; coincidence never intervenes.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can beauty survive in an unfinished world?—is signaled in paragraph four and tested by the knot of silence. Escalation is textural: each released strand adds one real sound, tightening the pattern until the greenhouse “fills with ordinary noise.” The price is audible and irreversible; options narrow from muffled grief to exposed incompleteness. No coincidence; the unbinding is entirely Mara’s agency under acoustic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—deliver an emotion that lets Orin die human—is signaled early and sharpened by the grotto’s lethal amber. One meaningful tightening: Mira’s shift from selling absolution to surrendering her own shame forecloses her professional detour. Cost is legible: she keeps the resin-slick coins anyway, permanently staining her self-exemption. Agency remains hers; coincidence merely complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—make invisible labor audible—announced early; escalation occurs once when Mara commits commission money, narrowing her option to stop. Pressure stays coherent under causal lens: each thank-you obligates the next, costs accumulate (brokerage funds, anonymity surrendered). No reversal, but single tightening sufficient. Cost legible: open-ended financial drain and loss of control over the chain.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—belonging—tightens when the council’s need for safe paths forces them to accept her offer, then deepens as the arbor reveals the artist is also fen-born, making her claim plausible but risky. One meaningful escalation: she shifts from helper to claimant, publicly dedicating the arbor as maker, narrowing her options to acceptance or exile. Cost is legible—she stakes her reed-craft and outsider capital in full view of the council.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—recover Orren—signaled in first 150 words; pressure tightens when the thirteen-drop sequence forecloses retreat. Protagonist agency drives escalation: she decodes, speaks lullaby, builds bridge, accepts non-return. Cost legible in “buried optimism” and repaired tile—permanent constraint accepted. No external antagonist needed; internal math vs. grief sufficient for 600-word frame.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—visibility without exposure—tightens once: the cabinet spill offers a tool that can either betray or transmit presence. The tape fragment is the single deepening that turns the abstract wish into a sensory conduit; cost is the irrevocable auditory imprint of the child’s sob now stored inside him. No escalation curve beyond this, but the length warrants only one meaningful tightening; the beat lands clean.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve analytical distance vs. allow vegetal intimacy—tightens when each leaf-touch thickens her nails and dilates plant-breath perception. Mid-story scrubbing and list-making are visible tactics that fail, forcing the final release-of-control reversal. Cost is on-page: altered hands, bitter tongue, forfeited objectivity. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes after the trellis falls; a second external complication could have sharpened the 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—recover lost sister memory vs. need for new artistic direction—is signaled early and tightens when the compass offers vision at the price of the remaining brooch. The single escalation beat (exchange) forecloses retrieval of sister relic, paying visible cost. Pressure is coherent under causal lens; no fake intensifiers. Could use one earlier obstacle or tactical loss to push into 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“ordinary days to shimmer”—faces tangible test when possession threatens Lan’s life; escalation tightens once the force speaks. Agency shifts from Lan (failed prediction) to Sera (song as counter-pressure), foreclosing the option to treat magic as spectacle. Price paid: Lan’s clairvoyant authority is publicly hollowed.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can the town face its navigated absences—tightens when Mara risks communal anger by staging delayed hearings; each interval forecloses the easy comfort of a swift ceremonial trumpet blast. Escalation is Accumulative: blank ledger pages and torn notebook gaps accumulate pressure until the final note reconfigures silence itself as communal resource. Cost is visible in slammed shutters and Ilven’s shaking hand.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—voice the unspoken or remain erased—signals early via the flask-shaped silence. One meaningful tightening: the admission narrows options to “no returns.” Pressure escalates causally under Causal lens; each crack, seam, and punch click raises the cost of continued silence. Price is visible in the punched card and the irrevocable door of letters.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can shared writing create a bearable chamber for grief—tightens when the square first shifts under Mara’s hand, then again when Leena’s chord enters the symphony. Each transcription forecloses the option of private closure; the blank center is the visible price. Pressure escalates under accumulative density: pages multiply, whales synchronize, air thickens. No reversal, but the deepening is sufficient for 600-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—“what happens after goodbye”—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens when the only path becomes self-goodbye with immortality forfeit. One meaningful escalation: corridors mutate from spatial nuisance to dimensional rebellion demanding a sovereign sacrifice. Cost is visible: “his immortality peeling away like a coat in rain.” No reversal, but single deepening suffices for 700-word scope. Pressure coherent under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—truth vs con—tightens once: Mara’s decision to substitute real for forged affidavit collapses Ivo’s leverage and forecloses retreat. Cost is legible: father’s grin “collapses,” Sami’s fate is re-routed, Mara forfeits her complicity. Pressure is coherent under causal lens; no coincidence resolves. A second tightening beat (agents’ softened questions) is off-camera; had it been on-page, 9.0 was within reach.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserving time’s texture against erasure—is signaled early. Escalation occurs when indoor hum proves “thin,” forcing the trek to the bonsai labyrinth; there, leaf-rustle deepens the pattern and refracts riskier histories. The tightening narrows options: accept mute streets or carry named sensations. Cost is felt in solitary descent, though pressure plateaus rather than spikes.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—erased identity versus reclaimed memory—is signaled in the opening clause. Escalation is textural: each collected fragment tightens the narrator’s dependence on stolen voices until the discovery of 9H forces the decisive choice to scatter rather than possess the names. The price—permanent self-effacement in exchange for keeping the names alive in air—is legible in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—decode the riddle or admit defeat—tightens when each retold memory steadies the glass needle, foreclosing the option to keep fleeing those conversations. Escalation is textural: density of voices in the hum increases until silence becomes the new medium; the cost is the needle’s disappearance, leaving him navigator-less. No external antagonist needed; the pressure is the growing weight of his own unfinished stories. One beat shy of 9: we wanted a tangible forfeiture (time, bodily energy) earlier in the chain.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—living city vs. fixed grid—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the security launch arrives. The graffiti campaign is the reversible that narrows options: each tag increases exposure risk while loosening the physical grid. Cost is visible: Ira’s fatigue, the blocks adrift at dawn, Vell’s signed moratorium under threat of chaos. No coincidence resolves; the final standoff is earned by accumulated micro-sabotage.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“last untouched dark sky”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens with each sand-fall and shutter click. One meaningful deepening: the third chemical command “WAIT FOR HUSH” forces shared stillness that forecloses further resistance; options narrow to recording the surrender. Cost is legible: the sky is already lost, the negative is only evidence. Agency stays with Mara’s choices to prime, shoot, and pocket; coincidence is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—Meridian’s safe departure—tightens when the drone fails; Lio’s micro-choices (prism angle, solder count) progressively foreclose failure. One meaningful tightening suffices: the moment the bird’s chirp steadies, Sera’s option set narrows to “follow the sound.” Cost is legible in the harbor horn and the literal chain lift. No second reversal, so holds at 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—cartographic truth vs. state control—lands early and tightens once: the condensation droplet collapses three rivers to one origin, foreclosing the “rounding error” lie. Pressure accumulates through environmental markers (dead radio, lake silence) rather than causal reversals; the protagonist’s agency is attention and tracing, not confrontation, but the cost is legible—he now carries knowledge that will be weaponized. One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“will the town be heard as alive?”—is signaled early and tested once: the decree carrier’s arrival. Escalation is accumulative: each new walker thickens the resonance rather than raising causal threat. The tightening is the final mass step; price is the unspoken obligation to keep walking. No visible personal loss beyond sore feet keeps it from 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—retrieve ephemeral memory before air runs out—tightens once when unsnarling the tether costs precious seconds and again when inhaling the hush spends final breath; both trade-offs narrow options and are legible on-page. Agency drives escalation; coincidence complicates (wire snagged by kelp) but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“chase hush to finish the story”—tightens once: the boy chooses to relinquish the words to the lattice/sea rather than claim them publicly, narrowing his future to permanent disbelief. Pressure is textural, accumulating through corridor-sound density and the lens’s polite aversion to the bodies. Cost is legible: he trades personal vindication for an anonymous burial of truth. One meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—redeem the valley or let it freeze—tightens when each ghost visit costs the bride a century of rest, forcing Eli to act. The resonator build is the visible escalation; it forecloses retreat. Agency is high: he chooses to sing his heartbeat into the stone. Cost is legible, though the “orchard wakes” beat feels slightly abrupt.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—restore safe passage without repeating old disappearances—is signaled by “lovers vanish in the channels.” Escalation is accumulative: each dawn’s new thread extends the stitched lifeline, narrowing the option of total avoidance. The decisive tightening occurs when Ila nets a rockfall gap, forcing the town to confront rather than bypass the maze. Cost is visible—nightly exposure to dream-guided risk and the public relinquishing of secrecy—though individual physical stakes remain collective rather than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—restore her own capacity to keep moving—tightens when the empty bier mirrors her interrupted past, forcing the choice to remain. Pressure escalates through physical collapses and the scandal risk that Sava voices; each narrows options. Cost is visible: she forfeits onward exile, accepts perpetual detour. One meaningful turn suffices; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—protect the courier’s anonymity from archive theft—tightens when ghost-notes reveal interception. The protagonist’s agency (chalk trap, alias creation) escalates under causal pressure; the tightening is single but meaningful. Cost is conceptual rather than personal, capping entry to the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will the unheard stories reach the river printers?—tightens exactly once: when the beacon tones click into her stitched lies, the option to remain a passive listener dies. Agency is continuous: she intercepts, encodes, risks oil waste charges, and finally mis-synchronizes the orrery to protect the evidence. Cost is on-page: eternal flame cupped in her hand, she trades anonymity for complicity; the Guard’s laughter now carries lethal potential.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—will she voice the apology—tightens when spirits command DO NOT CHOOSE YET, forcing her to rehearse instead of flee. The shard’s edge smooths only after three nights of practiced vulnerability, a visible price that forecloses permanent retreat. Escalation is causal: each night’s letter-writing deepens risk of exposure until Elias’s arrival makes silence impossible. Cost is on-page: blood, shredded paper, the shard’s lost jaggedness.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prevent reprisal bloodbath—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightened when the funeral/meeting false friend is decoded. One meaningful escalation: the discovery of the ambiguous phrase narrows options to either radio intervention or impending ambush; no second reversal needed. Protagonist agency drives every turn—rub coral, decrypt, call captain, call rebels—each action visibly raises personal exposure. Cost is legible: she relinquishes the talisman and accepts responsibility for any miscalculation.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—recover lost joy—tightens when matching scratches force Mara to repaint the children’s silhouettes onto stones, trading passive nostalgia for active creation. One meaningful deepening suffices: the film’s ruined emulsion becomes the very filter that lets ghosts dance. Cost is legible—she exposes her process publicly, relinquishing sole authorship.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—exchange certainty for curiosity—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened when she halts the forbidden mid-stroke; that single choice forecloses the “right” restoration and locks her into recursive uncertainty. Pressure escalates through each echo-loop; the cost is cumulative disorientation and the perpetual deferral of completion. No external antagonist is needed; the wall’s resistance is her own perfectionism reflected back. Coincidence is absent; every fold is triggered by her sonic agency.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—protecting un-taxable thought—is signaled in line 1 and tightens when the Bureau starts taxing “holding” thoughts. The meaningful escalation is the shift from private refuge (greenhouse) to public garden network: one tightening move that narrows options because publicity now carries exposure. Cost is legible: the narrator forfeits exclusive control of the greenhouse and accepts possible audit raid—paid on-page when the lenses fog and the club scatters.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single tightening beat: the blackening lilies force Mara to risk the postcard, narrowing options from “keep memory” to “feed roots.” Cost is legible—the card is gone forever—but external war-pressure stays off-stage, so escalation is more lyrical intensification than causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—restore forgotten names—signals in paragraph one and tightens when half the orchids stay dark because the chime is cracked. The single meaningful turn is the bamboo replacement: it forecloses the option of perpetual partial silence and exacts the emotional price of re-entering the museum’s toxic air. Escalation is textural-density, not causal reversal: each scrap of melody increases the ache until the final whole chord releases the accumulated mute names. Cost is visible in the caretaker’s steadied breathing and the “foxglove regret” that only softens after the song completes.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restoration of trust after silence—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened when the ink darkens under each spoken pledge, making every subsequent word irreversible. The single meaningful turn occurs at chord-resolution: the codex does not erase names but the gaps between promises, forcing a collective recommitment with visible shame cost. Pressure escalates through because/therefore linkage; no coincidence rescues them. The price—permanent vulnerability and shared custody of a binding artifact—lands on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—town safety vs. wetland survival—tightens when the encoded settings force a public gamble: reveal hidden science or let both sides lose. The mid-scene reversal (Mara decodes, stakes jump from “prank” to “career-ending leak”) is propelled by her choice, not luck. Cost is legible: Rolen’s reputation and Mara’s future contracts hang on the signed chain.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—“trust again or lose last songs”—tightens when meteorite match forces her to test loyalty. One decisive turn: she copies and releases, forfeiting deniability. Cost is legible in Merek’s tremor and her own “bloom and wither.” Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will she cross the threshold to find her father?—tightens when the seven-minute corridor forms; the price of a mis-measured leap is implicit death. Escalation is a single deepening rather than multiple reversals, sufficient for this length, though the wind shift that dissolves the corridor is partly situational luck.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“one night to see what rhythms still live”—tightens when the clamp twist risks flooding the last breathable pocket. Sunrise clock and shared lantern escalate under Accumulative lens; the green loops re-weight loneliness vs. connection with visible price. One additional tightening beat mid-ascent would have pushed higher.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—will erased paths return?—is signaled in paragraph 3 and escalates because each clue (seeds, glass, pool) narrows the solution to a single act: spoken apology. Cost is legible: Mira’s public confession, the spiral scar on the shard. No coincidence resolves; bird seeds complicate, then deliver the last push.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“serenade monotony until the night watch smiles”—tightens when the smile is conditional on saving a child; the rescue beat narrows options from art to life. Escalation is single but sufficient: tide schedule + jammed door create ticking water that compounds with every failed key. Price is tangible: bishop nearly lost, performer exposed, routine permanently altered. Agency remains Milo’s; coincidence (boy already inside) complicates, does not solve.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will the poem survive censorship?—is signaled in the opening paragraph and sharpened by the garden’s bargain: keep the speck and stay anchored, or surrender and forget. Escalation is one sustained tightening: each prick of the needle narrows her future options until the tattooed arm makes return impossible. The cost is visible blood-ink and the permanent exile she chooses. Under causal lens, every beat is because/therefore; no coincidence resolves anything.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—save the atrium from erasure—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the inspector admits the notice is marina-driven. The pond demonstration forces stance crystallization: interference pattern becomes moral argument, foreclosing the “efficient calm” option with on-page conceptual cost. No coincidence rescues; escalation is a single deepening that reweights meaning. Meets 9+ quick test for agency-driven pressure with visible price.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
    <comment>Theme emerges through refracted light vs. plain transparency: value of ordinary labor and overlap over monetized stillness. Subtext lives in gesture—inspector’s wet boots, the torn sheet—never sermon. Final image of the horizon held steady in common glass offers a resonant, non-literal answer, satisfying the 9+ quick test. No late thematic echo or moralizing paragraph intrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: can she keep translating pain without self-annihilation? Pressure tightens once: the bargain she once used to save Eli now blocks her own sleep and Jonah’s growth. Her decision to confess narrows future options—she will face investigation, Eli will learn shame—visible cost legible on page. No coincidence; escalation is internal but irreversible, sufficient for 600-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“puzzle out new equations for hope before despair turns habitual”—tightens with each sideways-unit reading; failure in one timeline is offset by another, but the price is sleepless vigil and the risk of saving none. Third cluster launch after divergence-term revision is the decisive narrowing: she trades certainty for ensemble agency. Pressure stays causal under Hybrid lens; no coincidence resolves. Final uplift is earned, not gifted.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—whether to broadcast or protect the archived voices—emerges at the diary discovery and tightens when drones hover for a tourist report. One meaningful deepening: the council’s past refusal to open the chamber mirrors today’s commercial pressure, forcing her complicity. Cost is legible: she trades truth for guardianship, accepting personal risk. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes after the chord unlocks the door; a second external threat beat would have pushed this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—sister’s noon death—tightens through visible clock (bells) and the pulse-loan expiry. One meaningful deepening: mirror reveals survival costs a stranger’s life; protagonist’s surrender narrows options to a single irrevocable act with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—can ritual compel two war criminals to foreclose future atrocities—signaled in paragraph 5. Pressure tightens when each commander must produce an irreversible token; refusal would publicly collapse the truce. Sera’s agency is the design and enforcement of the ritual; no coincidence resolves. Cost is visible: the burned items and her acceptance of endless labor narrow her own options.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—can she buy back her own guilt—tightens once: the recording wafer is already cracked, foreclosing absolution and forcing renunciation. Escalation is causal under the Causal lens: each act narrows her options from dam → drought → cracked map → cracked wafer → shattered shell. The visible price is the egg itself, carried since paragraph four and destroyed on page; its loss is irreversible. Pressure stays coherent; no coincidence resolves anything—failure is engineered by prior transit damage.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—liberate the city’s voice—tightens with every unraveled thread; the sister’s pledge provides visceral fuel. Escalation is linear and irreversible: each memory-voice loosed raises personal cost until the governor’s grip audibly hollows. No fallback or deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.9)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can a human steady a vanishing migration?—tightens once when the gust snaps a frame and forces Arin to swap static signal for living metronome. Cost is visible: he sacrifices permanence, voices the forgotten names, and accepts erasure at sunset. No reversal, but the cadence shift from broken 1952 beacon to uninterrupted reed clack narrows options to transient stewardship only.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“will the forgotten names be heard again?”—is signaled early and tightens when the rope’s fragility under cold makes failure tangible. The protagonist’s gentleness versus speed conflict escalates with each strand picked; one wrong creak could erase a name. The final tuck forecloses anonymity: the bells ring, the names become public sound, and the caster’s private guilt is irreversibly socialized. Cost is visible in the sweat-and-wax labor and the aurora’s fading, which confirms the price of permanence.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—“will the path choose me?”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when the bunker demands a second seal the protagonist no longer possesses; the only escalation is to pay with blood, foreclosing safe exit. Pressure is textural: each flake of moldy directive narrows agency until the forest’s selection overrides human command. The cost is visceral and legible—thumb bitten, blood smeared, hatch lets go—under Accumulative lens. No reversal, but the single deepening is decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserve empirical integrity vs. answer encrypted devotion—tightens when every verified sum drags him toward faith. The Mars-Lion deadline supplies a single meaningful intensification; options narrow to snapping the stylus or retreating. Cost is legible on-page: the destroyed instrument and the new constellations etched on his palms. Situational lens: external sky-clock forces the stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will resentment release before the next revision erases identity?—tightens once, when the broken pin reseats itself and the half-melody becomes whole, foreclosing the option of armed vigilance without a spoken compromise. Pressure escalates by accretion: each refugee’s involuntary hand-tap adds density until Mara’s clenched fist opens; no coincidence resolves anything. The visible price is the militia’s relinquished knife, a forfeiture that alters the power topology on the spot.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—trap the runaway dream—signals in paragraph 1 and tightens when the sky itself begins to dream away, forcing Lio to shift from capture to invitation. One meaningful deepening: the sextant fails, so he flips the mirror face-up and re-uses breathing to fuse real & reflected stars, foreclosing the option to force direction. Cost is legible: he pays with bodily stillness and the permanent internalization of the dream’s warmth. Escalation is accumulative rather than causal-reversal, but sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—can she still “mend” without license—tightens when the boy’s loose eye demands illegal craft. The meaningful turn: she trades legal identity for immediate function, price paid on-page by surrendering the last relic of her trade (cracked lens + thread). Pressure stays causal under the inferred lens; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—control of memory lineage—signals early. Middle tightening: logbook pages reorder, tags pre-date her writing, forcing her to confront pre-destination. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: she loses authorship of her own past. Agency is largely reactive; the final acceptance is intellectual rather than a visible tactic-altering choice, keeping the escalation just shy of top band.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“rescue before loss becomes law”—tightens when Lysa realizes silence *is* the wall; inserting blank pages is the single decisive escalation that forecloses failure. Cost is legible: the curator’s dust-cloak thins, implying vulnerability, and Lysa relinquishes sole authorship of correction. No reversal overload; one meaningful turn suffices for 700-word span. Pressure stays causal under the rescue clock, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—recover Lio—surfaces early and tightens as each spoken story thins the fog, a visible price. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mara realizes the garden is “a plot to keep telling,” forcing her to relinquish fixed memory; this narrows her option from search to perpetual narration. Pressure stays internal and lyrical rather than adversarial, sufficient for this length but never spikes to jeopardy that threatens bodily harm or irreversible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restore erased history—signaled in paragraph one. Escalation: seal → door → faceless diplomat → revealed treaty → public filing; each beat narrows Mara’s options and raises institutional risk. Cost is legible: the university must confront its stolen river valley. Agency is archival, not physical, but still forces irreversible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve the caves’ song—signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is singular but sufficient: each feeding swell tightens the corridor chorus until the Forge redirection becomes the only remaining option. Agency sits in the conjuring beat; she risks the stone and her own pulse, foreclosing isolation for perpetual stewardship. Cost is legible: she gains quiet but inherits guardianship, a trade visible in the closing “updated living map.”

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—“is anyone out there to answer?”—tightens when each alignment glimpse shows tomorrow’s smear, turning abstract hope into a now-or-never lens adjustment; the cold tug of the hush shard enforces a single viable angle, forcing a trade-off between solitary safety and the gamble of revelation, with the answering flash crystallizing the cost: perpetual custodianship doubled, not ended.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—Archive collapse versus personal erasure—is signaled early and tightens with each retrieved shard. The decisive deepening occurs when the narrator realizes the fog will shatter without a living spine; the choice to inscribe self narrows options to irreversible merger. Cost is legible on-page: “I realized nostalgia could be a compass, pointing… inward.” One hairline slip: storm-rise feels slightly accelerated rather than progressively escalated.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—will despair be allowed to starve the camps—surfaces in paragraph two and tightens when the council’s pride is the only barrier. The meaningful turn comes when playful green flowers force the council to lean forward, converting ridicule into actionable attention; options narrow from “divert riot” to “clear gate now.” Cost is legible: fortress authority is publicly undercut and the rag talisman is relinquished. Pressure escalates under causal lens; coincidence merely complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve living shore vs. surrender records—tightens when council demand is revealed mid-scene. One meaningful deepening: Mara’s hidden copies foreclose easy compliance and raise personal risk. Agency visible: she activates cicada, chooses tangent question, decides to stay silent. Cost legible: relational trust deferred, future labor doubled.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will she inhale outside a box—tightens through measured exposure to unbounded air. Agency drives every escalation: she chooses three-breath intervals, decides to cup the gilded hush, then releases it at home. Cost is visible: lungs that once “scraped” now fill, but only after she accepts rope-hanging vulnerability. One meaningful deepening suffices; no external coincidence required.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can silence be taught to comfort?—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when Elias slows the car to keep cables from “singing,” trading speed for psychological safety. One meaningful reversal: the storm-glass warning forces him to cede momentum, narrowing options to either creak (frighten Mara) or delay (risk wind). Cost is visible: longer exposure to gusts, colder ride, yet the choice forecloses Mara’s panic. Agency remains with operator; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“find the stairway before sunrise”—is signaled early and tightened by the literal clock; the sunrise deadline forces the final descent and exit. Ascension reinterpreted as descent is a meaningful reversal that narrows options. Cost is visible: she forfeits personal rule to keep the archive intact. No secondary pressure from antagonist, but short-form default allows single-track escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“keep the threshold sealed or drown in outside grief”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when Lio’s choking shadow appears. One meaningful deepening: Mara must reopen her own severed lines to pay the toll, foreclosing her clean exile. Cost is visible: reopened scars, kneeling imprint in ash, and the final soft door-closed acceptance that the next ring will come. Escalation is accumulative but unmistakably driven by her agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—save the farm from bank foreclosure—tightens when repayment must be in diamonds, not cash. Escalation is accumulative: each confession adds molecular weight until the drum’s internal pressure crystallizes regret; the first single diamond proves the alchemy, then the communal chain scales the solution. Agency remains with Mara at every beat: she mounts the bolt, volunteers her memory, and invites the load-sharing that collapses the quantum promise into solid assets. Visible price is the public exposure of her past, felt as “walls tighten with the concept of pressure.”

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prove betrayal to justify abdication—signaled in paragraph 2. Single meaningful tightening: Nara’s recorded confession forecloses any remaining option to rule. Cost is treasury surrender; pressure coherent under causal lens. No reversal, but deepening sufficient for 600-word scope. Agency resides in decision to expose, not in coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—possibility itself—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when each armor clasp forecloses the old oath. The unsnapping sequence is the visible price: every loosened knot shrinks retreat until the compass seed exacts a final allegiance shift. Escalation is causal under the Accumulative lens: density of cipher echoes, chemical smells, and mirrored actions reweights cost until the greenhouse reassembles into his rewritten life-scenes.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“trace unknown histories to keep the next heart from breaking”—is signaled early and tightens when the dust rectangle forecloses the option of believing the file complete. The midpoint reversal (finding Eli’s letter) escalates pressure under causal lens: Mara must decide how much truth to offer Josie. Cost is visible: Mara’s reopened grief, Josie’s tremor, and the button left exposed. No coincidence resolves; the missing page complicates, not solves.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“refuse erasure”—is signaled in paragraph one and escalates from pamphlet smuggling to stealing the actual printing plates, a meaningful jump in risk. The midpoint switchboard reveal that “she should have been dead” tightens pressure under causal lens; options narrow to either vanish or overwrite the Ministry’s plates. Cost is visceral: sirens closing, courier’s raw wrists, pages drifting into uncertain hands. One beat more of physical jeopardy inside the truck could have pushed this into the 9+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—silence the prophecy before it colonizes townspeople—tightens via micro-choices: each withheld note increases psychic load. No external antagonist, but internal pressure escalates as dewdrops accelerate, forcing the final blank exhalation. Cost is conceptual; a more visceral forfeiture would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—will the arbor fall?—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when the leaf writes DESCEND. Escalation follows Accumulative/Textural logic: each monument adds ballast, each prodded leaf adds textual pressure, until the vault door “sighs open,” foreclosing the elders’ secrecy. Cost is visible in Lio’s moonstone-dusted skin and the public exposure of ancestral theft. One minor slack: the foreman’s refusal is a single beat that does not complicate later tactics; the real opposition is the sealed vault itself.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: replace certainty with navigable doubt. Pressure tightens when Mara must decide: return the compass rose or repurpose it into a clock of probabilities. The choice forecloses the admiral’s rage-path and costs Mara her own habitual reliance on fixed midnight. Escalation is singular but sufficient for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—redeem Orin’s name—tightens when the coin’s blank demands payment and Mara’s childhood loosens. One meaningful escalation: she realizes resurrection is impossible, downsizes goal to “smaller redemption,” and pays with stolen names. Price is legible on-page: tongue “honest and raw,” vial heavy with Ellis’s name. Agency drives every turn; coincidence complicates, never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—free Elowen by finding the laugh hidden inside her shame—tightens once: the confession of wanting to flee tightens the noose, then the frog rhyme ruptures it. Escalation is causal under the Causal lens; each bent note because/therefore drags more forbidden memory into light. Price is legible: the invisible bundle evaporates, costing Elowen the last relic of the child and Mara the comfort of her own unprocessed grief. No coincidence resolves; the gorge only echoes what is offered.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—discover mercy’s formula to free future prisoners—tightens once: realizing he must vocalize the equation to the trees, a narrowing that forecloses silent theft. Escalation is textural: each flare of proprioceptive memory increases density until the final pollen surge reweights the stake from personal escape to collective absolution. Agency is intact; every coordinate is walked by his own tremor-coded knees. Cost is visible in the searing pollen that brands the strap and skin, payment for unlocking the archive.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—keep the seam open long enough to rescue erased names—tightens when the fragment darkens and the hatch threatens to seal. One meaningful deepening: fitting the lens halves collapses the two cities into simultaneous perception, foreclosing anonymity forever. Price is paid in irreversible exposure of the rejected histories.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“discover what ceilings hide”—tightens when dust forensics reveal the hidden lift and the ghosts’ payroll secret. Agency is investigative: each observation narrows options toward the spring barrel extraction. Cost is atmospheric rather than visceral: he seals the portal and carries the time-weight forward. A slightly higher gear would require an explicit forfeiture (tool, safety, or social credit) on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—stop infinite revision to recover Mara—signals early and tightens once: the spiral frost forces the rupture choice that forecloses all future bargaining. Escalation is causal under the Causal lens; no reversals needed. Cost is legible: the library’s reordering by desire and the frozen sky-mirror show the price of eternal stasis. Agency resides in Lio’s decisive pull of the lever.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—who controls historical narrative—tightens when joint custodanship becomes the only way to prevent weaponization of the map. Escalation follows because/therefore logic: shard vision → shared risk → public blurred projection. Visible cost: both cede total victory. Minor slack: off-page “warring salons” stated more than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“reclaim the light”—is signaled early and tightens when the Thief opens its empty cradle, forcing Ivo to trade truth for repair. One meaningful deepening suffices. Cost is conceptual (truth-binding, potential rust) rather than visceral, keeping it just below the 8.5 band where a tangible price would be visible on Ivo’s body or tools.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reach the place “where explanations fail”—is signaled early and tightens with each psychometric revelation. The second hinge-snap inside the tunnel forces the choice: keep chasing certainty or accept the lagoon’s hush. Cost is visible: she sacrifices the compass and a jar of petrichor, tangible losses that foreclose further mapping. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes after the second vision; a final external obstacle (cold, depth) could have sharpened the 8.8+ edge.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—prevent sea-wall failure—surfaces early and tightens through each sculpture planted; townspeople’s trust is the live currency. Escalation is accumulative: each new driftwood sign narrows the path toward cooperative action. Agency stays with Mara; no coincidence resolves the wall risk. Cost is legible in her dawn exhaustion and the silent acceptance of endless repair work ahead.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“why flowers bloom at night”—tightens when each layer of glass reveals a mechanistic yet tender answer, foreclosing magical thinking. Pressure escalates through accumulating sensory evidence: moonlit stock, rising warm air, mother’s confession etched in stone. No external antagonist is needed; the conflict is epistemic and emotional. The cost is the loss of mystique replaced by engineered gentleness, a bittersweet narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—recover diary without re-victimizing community—tightens when Lila’s voice demands parley, foreclosing grab-and-go option. One meaningful deepening: realization that “truth in tension” requires redaction consent. Cost is legible (retrocognitive captivity, childhood accent usurped), though escalation is more accretive than sharply reversed. Coincidence (zeppelin captain agrees) complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restore meaning without miracles—tightens when each returning family asks for the bottle to be opened and Sen refuses, narrowing options to labor-based revival. The meaningful escalation is the charter proposal that forecloses the wish path for the next generation; cost is the permanent loss of effortless luck. Pressure stays coherent under causal lens; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will the accidental prophecy claim lives—surfaces the moment the heartbeat is heard. Pressure tightens once: hearing the lullaby → realizing it forecasts grid failure → deciding to break secrecy. The broadcast empties elevators, turning prophecy into preventive record; the cost is Erem’s exposure as rogue scribe. One meaningful escalation suffices; coincidence (the lullaby’s date match) complicates rather than resolves, satisfying situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—repay stolen time or lose the city to chaos—is signaled in the grandmother’s rule and tightens when the spiral corridor demands immediate collateral. The single decisive intensification occurs as Lio pours the oldest rye grain into the cap: entropy reversal forecloses the option of further borrowing. Cost is visible on-page: the corridor’s velvet nap “pulled at his sleeves,” a literal drag against future choices.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—protect valley without numbing them—tightens when zero-hour data forces a live choice: deafening siren vs. calibrated vane. The glue-cure clock externalizes the pressure; missing it risks both structural failure and bureaucratic censure. One meaningful escalation: microclimate needles bend, she flips switch, foreclosing the old protocol forever.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: can Lio remain porous without being shattered? Pressure escalates as meteor tracks converge on the station, tightening the choice to keep tracing alone or invite others. The green low-flare meteor is the single deepening that reweights options. Cost is visible in the soft laughter—acceptance of ongoing loss. No antagonist needed; grief and sky supply coherent pressure under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve or relinquish the weight of unspoken words—is signaled in paragraph three and tightens through each slip read aloud; every ghost-step backward is a visible price that narrows the narrator’s option to keep hoarding. One meaningful escalation: opening the box in moonlight transforms static collection into irreversible speech. No reversals beyond that, but the accumulative pattern suffices for 800-word scope. Cost is legible in the hush after Mara’s slip and the sudden feel of “tended again,” a charged poise that forecloses retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“what does a second feel like”—tightens when the capsule demands the urn as fare, foreclosing Eli’s countdown. The swap is the single decisive turn that escalates cost from borrowed year to perpetual duty. Pressure stays causal: because he trades grief, he loses measurable pulse. Cost is visible in the sudden stillness of his bloodstream.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“prove incompleteness is courage, not failure”—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tested three times: torn net, torn kite, torn bird. Each tear escalates by requiring Rian to surrender control (letting brothers pull, letting child stitch, letting feather go). Cost accumulates: he forfeits souvenir, time, and finally the emblem itself. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes, acceptable under Accumulative lens; still, one sharper external jeopardy moment could have pushed it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—species respect versus human interruption—tightens when Mara’s terminal clock forces physical remodel under pain. One meaningful deepening: discovery of seed-pod hollow reframes temple from sacred relic to nursery, narrowing options to redistribution. Cost legible in aching chest on ladder; no coincidence resolves conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—control over the meaning of homecoming—tightens when the signal translates into footprint crystals, foreclosing the council’s scripted narrative. Narrator’s agency drives escalation: pocketing the unfiltered receiver, scraping crystals, cracking the vial, cutting the shard—each act narrows options. Cost is visible: she forfeits institutional protection and carries contraband that will chemically betray her. Under Accumulative/Textural lens the deepening is sufficient; a second reversal would overstuff 775 words.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can a new covenant replace war—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens through each sensory accretion. The single meaningful deepening occurs when the gull’s Latin command narrows options to one trench; thereafter the protagonist’s agency is to pour, mix, and invite. Cost is visible (knee-deep wade, chill assent) but the pressure curve is gentle; no second reversal or trade-off escalates risk. Sufficient for length, but lacks the visceral price spike that would push 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stake—expose council betrayal—tightens once: cylinder reveal → broadcast → guards rush. One meaningful escalation suffices; options narrow as Sera’s life and Lio’s loyalty are risked on-air. Cost is felt in the advancing boots and Morrow’s bark, not merely declared.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—find true north or remain lost in temporal stigma—is signaled early and sharpened by each sensory mismatch. The midpoint tightening occurs when the same star in both panes reveals measurable drift, converting passive curse into active instrument; this reweights tactics and forecloses reliance on station arrows. Cost is legible: the narrator accepts permanent exile by opening the hatch. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens—density of star-lines, breath-echo, rust-cough—without causal reversals, sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“steal the truth and leave without breaking a single promise”—tightens into “steal tomorrow” once the sky-route map appears. Escalation is causal: each swapped piece raises risk of detection, leading to the alarm-cord moment that forces the protagonist to choose chivalry over stealth. Price is immediate: flask spent, guard downed, body airborne; future cost is the uncharted airway whose rules they must now learn or die. One meaningful tightening suffices; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—save “small gestures” from erasure—tightens when loyalists plan rewrite. Mid-scene deepening: messenger’s vellum forces trade-off between personal safety and archival truth, visible price set at imprisonment. Escalation accumulates via density: each ripped bundle increases jeopardy while narrowing options to single satchel. Final broad-sheet fallout shows stakes reverberated beyond cell, fulfilling archival insistence with city-scale consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—recover the true shape of home—tightens when the price is named: one unvarnished memory. The nightly-reality shuffle supplies escalating pressure; each named corridor pins the world, foreclosing the softer history the mountain offers. Cost is legible in the throat-blocking pain of the final seeding; no reversal beyond this is needed at 700 words.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restart time without repeating imperial cruelty—tightens when each shortcut-temptation in the maze equates to the prince’s “winning line.” The meaningful turn comes at the mirrored gate: sacrificing personal redemption (hero recognition) to preserve townsfolk’s unbroken lives. Cost is on-page: she forfeits acclaim and accepts perpetual self-exile. Pressure escalates via accretive sensory compression—“woven hush tightened… thoughts seemed wrapped in cloth”—until the draw word releases both time and her lungs.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“will the truth escape alive”—tightens when each poetic fragment forecloses silence further; the killer’s lunge is the final external escalation. Agency is continuous: doodle bribe, stanza dispersal, prism placement, ink sacrifice each narrow options under causal logic. Cost accrues visibly: first social risk (banishment), then physical (loss of color), last existential (loss of art). One slight softening: the killer’s capture relies on crowd momentum more than Mara’s final act, keeping the score just below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“conjure meaning before the sea takes us”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when pontoons soften. Mid-story dive provides the single decisive deepening: failure to match marks means drowning, success yields resin formula. Protagonist agency drives every turn: she brews, narrates, matches, forgives; no coincidence rescues her. Cost is legible: brother’s death re-lived, pride alloyed into golden scars, charm surrendered as counterweight. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens via pattern intensification rather than external reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—will he keep or bury the promise?—is signaled in paragraph 2. Pressure escalates through narrowing space (forking tunnels) and rising interior urgency (“time has begun to leak”). The wrong-turn that reveals the oasis forces the public vow, narrowing future social distance; cost is the shell’s future erosion and the emotional exposure he can’t retract. One meaningful tightening suffices; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“prove whispers travel farther than shouts”—tightens once through ritual escalation: each cork-whisper and scent-loading raises the wager until the off-beat blink confirms the tactic. Protagonist agency drives every turn; no coincidence resolves. Cost is legible: Jonas’s shame and the forfeiture of foghorn certainty. A hairline gap: the stakes could sharpen even earlier if the narrative showed Jonas explicitly threatening to leave over the volume dispute.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can the navigator still guide anyone without hydraulics—tightens when each midnight call shrinks the safe corridor. Escalation is causal: censer weight → map revision → sinkhole warnings → final trek under full-moon drag. One visible price: the old compass identity is surrendered when the boy claims the radio. Pressure plateaus, however, during the lantern exposition; a second tightening would have pushed higher.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—protecting the orchard’s psychological safety—tightens when the patrol arrives. One meaningful escalation: the eye shifts from curiosity to shield, narrowing Mara’s options to deceit-by-silence or exposure. Cost is visible: she sacrifices the relic and her own future ease. No coincidence resolves the threat; the planted casing is a deliberate tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will the stranger’s erased name be restored?—tightens once: from mute absence to spoken memory. The investigation itself is the escalation under a Situational lens; each gap observed (no gulls, no sand, wrong rope) narrows the search field and raises the ethical cost of speaking a name that isn’t theirs. Agency is clerical yet decisive: the clerk could have refused; instead he voices the name and thereby accepts complicity in Eamon’s archive of absences. Price is legible: the final beam exposes Eamon’s unshareable solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—own her “doorway of decisions” or accept Ellis’s pre-set form—tightens once: water rising v. dry inheritance. Escalation is causal and legible; the creek’s climb forces the either/or at the exact moment the chip slots home. Price is the lost press and any absolution of paternal debt.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—stop the bleeding sky or rule by stolen starlight—signaled in paragraph 1 and narrowed to an explicit either/or inside the grotto. One decisive reversal: the voice’s offer crystallizes the cost, forcing her climb-down into the seam. Pressure escalates under causal lens; no coincidence resolves. The forfeiture of the crown-prop is a visible price that alters the political horizon.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—keep suns free—tightens once: licensing threat becomes real when Toma refuses to sign. Escalation is single but sufficient: each sun passed through the shell increases visible risk until the constellation locks the choice. Cost is the forfeiture of Lio’s barter-economy gratitude model, now impossible.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—seize authorship before chronological collapse—tightens when dream-flight lets him outrun the graveyard; the price is accepting perpetual self-division. One meaningful deepening: gratitude to his past self breaks the envy loop and forecloses the option of erasure. Cost is legible: he must keep writing indefinitely, a life-sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: can Iris still “heal” without scent? Pressure tightens when she confronts Aster’s fear of professional blame. One meaningful turn: father’s question converts potential accusation into gratitude, foreclosing Iris’s self-doubt with visible social cost (Aster’s reputation saved). Agency remains hers throughout; coincidence absent.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—transform scars into readable stories—faces one decisive tightening: add the fourth circle or lose the platform. Agency is inscription under held breath; failure means glittering fracture and literal fall. Cost is immediate—ink tries to crystalize under pulse, but brother-rune warms it, trading brittleness for permanent dark line. Escalation is causal: childhood superstition revisited becomes the stabilizing act; no coincidence resolves the storm.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—deliver overdue apology before orchard erased—signaled in paragraph 1; time tightens with distant chainsaws. One meaningful tightening: fuse pop / bottle crack forecloses second chance, cost legible in lost scent and dark stacks. Agency sits with Marin: she rigs loop, speaks apology, accepts imperfect miracle. No coincidence resolves; forgiveness granted yet trees still fall—escalation ends in irrevocable trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake—“unravel cosmic illusions to save what remains”—is declared early but never narrows to a concrete on-page test. Pressure is lyrical density, not tightening options; no reversible cost (tool, relationship, bodily risk) is risked or lost. The spiral arbitration deepens atmosphere yet does not force a tactical trade-off. Escalation is cadence, not stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—personal truth of measurement versus national accuracy—tightens when Ivar widens the gap he’s paid to close. The 47-second drift and deliberate winding-off force a trade-off that forecloses perfect calibration; cost is legible in the station’s compromised log and the inspector’s complicit silence.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—protect farm vs. protect sick kids—tightens when auditors reveal spore bleed; Lena’s decision to leak logs forecloses her job security with visible cost. One meaningful escalation beat suffices at this length. Pressure coherent under causal lens; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—whether she will inherit or break the gambling lens—tightens when each seat scrawl forces her to test the contradiction in real time. The midpoint envelope (“DO NOT CONFUSE EDGE WITH ESCAPE”) narrows options: she must create a teaching moment that exposes the cost instead of chasing the edge. Escalation is causal, not additive; every station she traverses raises the emotional ante by showing how seductive the odds language is. Cost is legible: she spends night, stamina, and filial loyalty to build the exhibit that renounces the bet.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can Mara keep estrangement painless?—is signaled in paragraph 1 and escalates as each caller proves the loop is tightening around her. The woman at the door externalizes Mara’s own threshold moment, forcing a visible trade-off: use the outlawed dial-out key and forfeit her neutral perch. Cost is legible: the disc’s final note is no longer closure but an opening, and the tunnel’s breathing turns from refuge to witness. Slight reserve: escalation is single-thread; secondary stakes (job security, contractor reprisal) stay off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—whether the town will admit its complicity in Jun’s death and the seawall failure—is signaled on page 1 and escalates through each public beat: private discovery → archival revision → civic confrontation → collective oath. The meaningful tightening occurs when Mara hands the locket photo to the mayor and priest; their rehearsed lines collapse under live evidence, foreclosing the option of sanitized renewal. Cost is visible: the council signs with shaking hands, the tide soaks shoes, Jun’s mother sacrifices the last physical relic. One micro-turn suffices at this length, and it delivers both moral and social price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—loneliness vs. reciprocal connection—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens through each micro-exchange: every gift narrows the narrator’s isolation while raising the social debt recorded only in collective memory. One meaningful deepening: the realization that Mara is “first patient,” not courier, reframes prior jokes as masked need and forces the narrator’s final yes. Cost is visible on-page: the rock cools only after the narrator accepts company, foreclosing solitary retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—turn grief into navigable terrain—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is textural: each language absorbed tightens the internal map until the brother-stone adds panic, raising the cost of continuation. The pool silence is the single decisive intensification that forecloses escape and forces acceptance. Agency remains hers throughout; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can history be kind without erasure?—tightens when the anomaly’s new cadence forces Mara to loosen certainty to save the courier relationship. One meaningful deepening: the chirp’s vine-rustle compresses past error into present pressure, narrowing options to either unbend the nib or repeat the mistake. Cost is legible: the nib’s permanent bend and the blank signature line foreclose perfect authorship. Agency is contingent editing, not brute decree—consistent with lens.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“will forgetting keep the last word?”—tightens through each mapped pause; the rare foghorn failure supplies a one-time cavity the protagonists must seize before mechanics erase it. Agency is cumulative, not reversal-based: each signed angle stores silence, narrowing future options until only sharing remains. Cost is visible: the camera, last relic of father and self, is relinquished. No coincidence resolves; the accordionist’s cooperation is solicited, not granted by luck.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—keep promise vs. keep self hidden—tightens with each artwork that drags her toward public exposure. The tar-slashed self-portrait is the key pressure spike: it fuses her face to Miko’s, making anonymity impossible. Cost is legible: she trades the erasure she once performed with fire for the irreversible broadcast that will resurrect her hunted name. One meaningful tightening is sufficient; no reversal is needed because the escalation is causal and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can the narrator smuggle his brother back via harmony—tightens when empathy with Sato threatens to dilute the dream into mere compassion. Mid-scene reversal: drumming hijacks the protocol, forcing both adults to witness the children together; option to flee is foreclosed by alarms, cost is shared neural burn and lifelong guardianship of an unsanctioned memory.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“prove whispers > shouts or lose the maze and her job”—is declared before midpoint and repeatedly pressure-tested. The crane brake introduces an unplanned tightening that forces Mara to spend her hidden asset, turning a demo into life-or-death. Escalation is causal, not cumulative, but the final cost (secret exposed, power diffused) is legible and irreversible. One meaningful turn suffices at this length; the story meets the bar.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—guilt versus exposure—signals early via “half-spoken secret.” Escalation is single, meaningful: the guardian’s shutter-net forces the girl from silence to speech by making the corpse visible. Agency is hers; she lowers the mirror, chooses confession when the star-lantern leaves no moral wiggle room. Cost is legible—her blood, the fixed star in her eye—meeting the 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—save the grove—signaled in paragraph one. Pressure tightens through the synchronized display gambit: each magnet click narrows options; failure means dawn exposure. The final green canopy flip forces council curiosity into a public delay, a visible price paid in sleepless students and Eli’s cradled tin. Escalation is accumulative, not reversal-heavy, fitting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—freedom versus belonging—tightens when Rusk’s reopened memory forces him to help release the island, thereby foreclosing the protagonist’s dock identity. The whale call deepens pressure rather than rescuing ex machina; it is set up by the daughter’s childhood whale-song. Cost is visible: the apron abandoned, the father’s “go” cracked with loss. Sufficient for 8.8; to breach 9 we’d need one earlier micro-complication that costs the protagonist physical or social credit on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—permission to feel grief without mandated joy—tightens when Orin’s confession of past complicity raises the price of trust; the goat’s kick supplies the single visible reversal that converts narration from farce to fragile laughter, narrowing options to endure rather than solve. Cost is legible in the bouquet’s relinquishment.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—cross the sacred boundary to speak with the dead—is signaled in paragraph two and escalates through each paraphrase that loosens the quartz until the final step forecloses retreat. Pressure tightens once: Soren’s warning + dissolving cloth + mist silhouette force the stance crystallization. Cost is legible on-page: Soren’s hand passes through cloth, the decree’s words slide irreversibly, and Lira’s own form dissolves. No coincidence; agency drives every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—secure the reed tongue without hollowing oneself—tightens when Joren rejects money and demands awakenings; Mara’s escalating plant offers and final shared-star trade foreclose the option of continued consumption. Pressure grows through each coded pot shift; cost is legible when Joren feels the spiral awaken “something not for sale.”

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can unfiltered civic pain be aired without breaking the project—is signaled early and tightened when Mara admits doctored reports. The refracted archive is the one beat that forecloses retreat; councilors must respond live, price paid in credibility. Pressure grows by accretion of voices, not twist—perfect for the chosen lens. Cost is legible: the bell-ringer sacrifices funding security to keep the sound raw.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“keep the light from spilling into harm”—is signaled early and tightens through each origami drop: every new visitor narrows Mara’s option to retreat. The single meaningful intensification occurs when the curtains are pulled into a corridor and the starbeam actually sprouts the basil; the price is the public exposure of her private grief-craft. Pressure stays causal under the Accumulative lens; no reversal is needed, only the accrual of desperate climbers.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—can inherited pattern-mapping replace profit-seeking prophecy?—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: Aurel admits past misuse, forcing the narrator to decide whether to shoulder the practice. The midnight walk is the visible cost (time, exposure, social risk of being seen measuring ruins). Escalation is single-cycle but sufficient for 700-word scope; cost is felt in the final promise.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will she weaponize or defuse nostalgia?—tightens when the council scene reveals the trap she is about to spring on her own people. Each irregular rotation is a micro-choice that forecloses the safety of pattern, visible price paid in disorientation ("angles of light that changed steadily yet unpredictably"). The final spiral curriculum is earned renunciation, not convenient escape.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve the shape of hope without erasing grief—tightens when Mara realizes the shadow is shed regret learning to move. One meaningful deepening: the abandoned anchoring rite is rediscovered via silent footage, forcing her to offer her private childhood dusk. Cost is visible the instant she relinquishes the stone and her true name; that forfeiture forecloses her earlier nostalgia buffer. Pressure accumulates rather than reverses, fitting the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—integrity versus compassion—tightens when Mara realizes reporting will shame her yet save the animals. One meaningful turn: the phone call converts Tessa from abstract villain to mirror image, foreclosing pure retaliation. Price is on-page: public confession, sleepless night, permanent record. Escalation driven by protagonist agency under causal lens; coincidence only complicates (van lease left the number).

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“move her story from rupture to meaning”—is signaled early and tested by each deliberate tug on stitches. Escalation is Accumulative: pain intensifies, tunnel lengthens, hourglass grains dwindle, tightening the cost of continuation. Final pour narrows options: wound stays open but readable, neighborhood exhales. Persistent constraint (leaking blood, light lost from body) shapes tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“where unused love is stored”—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens through each archival object: ticket stubs, blank leader, torn letters. One meaningful deepening: blank frames convert from absence to container, narrowing Mara’s options to speak aloud into light or forever carry the loop. Cost is legible: the instant she vocalizes her letters, the private earworm dies, a loss foreshadowed by “hoping the tearing would teach the words to sing.” Accumulative escalation holds; no causal reversals are needed because the pattern break (projecting nothing) reweights meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—freeing creativity—tightens when Sel translates the elders’ sour hush and chooses to trace rather than fight. One meaningful deepening: third-night tremors escalate cold cost, foreclosing surrender. Agency is legible under Accumulative lens; pressure mounts via density of meteor lines, not external antagonist. Price is visible in shaking hands and elders’ cracked fear.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—keep possibility alive versus corporate collapse—signaled in first third. Escalation follows Accumulative pattern: each seeded spark increases density until auditors arrive, forcing a stance crystallization. Protagonist’s dispersal is the visible price. No coincidence resolves; the wave-function charm merely repels, leaving threat latent—sufficient tightening for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—will he remain dependent on external verification?—tightens through each wind-test; the option to keep that armor is foreclosed when the crank turns and the belief unspools. Pressure escalates by Accumulative density: each new grove adds a chord, each gear-drop a visible price. No external antagonist needed; internal contradiction supplies sufficient heat.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—retrieve the dog, confront her own fear—signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation is textural: each star punch lightens the fare and deepens her obligation to act; the vigil delays action to let fear ripen. The wire entanglement is coincidence that complicates, not resolves. Cost is visible—frayed paper, bleeding time, trembling hands—but the guides’ magic cushion prevents the full 8.8+ price.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—voice versus survival—tightens when the protagonist learns silence serves surveillance, not safety. The whispered “C” is the decisive escalation that forecloses pure compliance and invites external consequence. Cost is legible: pager vibration, approaching footsteps, shared risk under the piano.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prove the usurper’s forgery—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when the pellet’s ink supply becomes finite; each copied line reduces future options. The meaningful turn occurs when Orun chooses to sacrifice the pellet—and the library’s temporal sanctuary—to complete the ledger copy, trading secrecy for actionable evidence. Cost is visible: “the ink pellet dwindling to nothing.” Slight reserve: the court’s immediate acceptance feels abrupt, keeping the score just sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—access to Pelican Spur—tightens when the beacons’ timed blink forces a single weekly window; the canal reveal forecloses the old straight path. Escalation is one meaningful tightening: the schedule changes knowledge, not firepower. Agency sits with Mara’s decision to encode rather than expose the route. Cost is conceptual—she trades transparency for stewardship—visible in the taped atlas and adopted secrecy.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“break the lull or surrender meaning”—is signaled by the silent bay and Sael’s notebook. Escalation is one deepening: hum → coordinates → transmission; the tightening narrows options from passive listening to active beacon. Cost is visible: exposure on the stones, possible Directorate triangulation. Under Accumulative lens the pattern intensifies rather than reverses, sufficient for 600-word scope; one meaningful tightening meets the bar.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will the embryo re-implant destiny?—tightens when the kite script warns of first-will imprint. Nara’s agency escalates via decoding, staging the unsealing, and speaking intent, each step raising the cost of failure. Salamander’s choice to tend gardens is the irreversible narrowing. Felt price: Nara trades prophetic power for humble ecology.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake: can Mina remain on the sensory battlefield that replays her trauma? The tightening is the drone reprise; she walks toward the pavilion instead of away, narrowing future options. Cost is the surrendered photograph and the public vow to keep returning. Pressure is coherent under situational lens; one decimal off because Harlow’s stakes never intersect hers.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.5)
    Fragmented reality is the dominant stake; each untangled knot visibly narrows Mara’s options and raises the cost of fixing a world that won’t stay still. One meaningful tightening—accepting imperfection in the portrait—forecloses the path of repetition and lands with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—why time slows—signaled in paragraph two and tightened when Keir confronts the obelisk. The single meaningful escalation is the ink-portal choice that forecloses both retreat and documentary proof; the price (loss of ink, exposure of Council) is on-page. No coincidence resolves; the drone’s mapping is set up early. Pressure stays coherent under causal lens; one tightening is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—silence vs forced truth—tightens when the letter names a Council lover and stolen thaw schedules; stakes become visceral once the archivist imagines their own cryo drawer. One meaningful escalation: mis-file tagged “public scholarship” narrows options irreversibly; no take-back possible. Cost is visible on-page: Council arrives, Censor speaks the archivist’s full name as sentence. Coincidence complicates (letter warmth) but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“will the dome’s continuity survive armed retrieval?”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when Maris sheathes the rifle, foreclosing violent defense. One meaningful escalation: roses refuse to bloom for armed hands, forcing Tarek’s public renunciation; militia departure is consequence, not luck. Cost is the lost bounty and Tarek’s professional identity, paid on-page. Pressure stays causal; no reversal after the kneel, so just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—catch the goddess’s echo—tightens through each refusal to march straight; the quietest harmonic becomes the only viable path, foreclosing louder options. Agency is exercised in the final spike-sacrifice, paying a visible tool-cost. Pressure escalates by density: constellations snag, harmonics overlap, silence thickens into static figure. No reversal, but the single deepening is sufficient for 600-word scope and lands with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—truth versus collateral damage—tightens when contradictions corner Sato. Celeste’s agency forces the quiet bargain; the felt price is the forfeited exposé and her own entanglement, a narrowing of options that satisfies causal escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“will he silence the cry he once ignored?”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when he chooses to tether the translator to his own skin, risking fresh pain. Escalation is causal: each letter raises the cost of refusal, the amber flash forces action, and the translated sentence “I am cold” makes the abstract guilt visceral. No external antagonist is needed; the pressure is internal and acoustic. The price paid is the permanent comet-tail scar and the cooled amber, both on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can shared memory survive state erasure—signaled in paragraph 1. Single tightening: proverb crack → hush translation → mandala map forecloses blank innocence; teacher’s jaw relax shows cost paid. Agency is attention and rearrangement, not violence; coincidence only complicates. Price legible: mandala’s deliberate spoilage and the lilac unease that lingers after.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: can mercy survive vengeance? Pressure tightens once: Lina’s recognition of her cousin collapses binary revenge/forgive into Samir’s third path. The Grasp’s design literalizes the stake—steel that both restrains and feeds—forcing the boy’s first public act of restitution. Cost is visible: cousin’s wrists locked, Lina’s chew “tasted like ash,” Samir’s future visions unchanged. Agency stays with Samir; coincidence is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—“possibility from the brink of despair” keyed to rent—tightens when Mara realizes the fracture itself is the antagonist holding Silas hostage; her choice to finish his trick forecloses the loophole of endless replays and costs her the nostalgic orchard as a private refuge. One meaningful deepening suffices; the price is legible in the merged applause that evicts the ghost and locks her into sole stewardship.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can empathy convert body-tingle “noise” into civic utility?—tightens when recall agents threaten erasure, forcing Mara to publish the protocol. The somatic square-walk is the visible reversal that forecloses pure skepticism; tunnel rescue pays the price in risk and burned cables. Pressure escalates under causal lens: each recalled user session adds data, narrowing Mara’s options toward public exposure. Cost is legible—loss of anonymity, legal exposure—but the company’s countermove stays off-page, muting the final pinch.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—map the unknown without colonizing it—tightens when the tide blocks retreat and the fossil demands agency. One meaningful deepening: the warmth she reads is not human emotion but alien comfort markers, flipping her cartographic ethic. Escalation is textural: each heat-flare adds density until relinquishment is the only unmapped act left. Cost is the fossil itself, surrendered to certify the new covenant.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—who owns the prophecy and the amber—tightens through each shared memory added to the jar. Escalation is textural: density of voices increases until the foreman tries to seize the jar, crystallizing the power shift. No coincidence; the blackened button’s late emergence is a pattern-break that forces final stance. Cost is visible: owners lose monopoly, workers risk jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—can the broken chain be repaired—tightens when Elsi’s silence threatens the relay. The salt-burn moment is the visible price that enables the radio fix, narrowing options: endure pain or fail the villages. Escalation is single-cycle but sufficient for 700 words; coincidence complicates patrol timing but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—return Mara or lose another child—tightens each time the needle scrapes another layer of ink; every revelation narrows Senn’s options and raises Rowan’s moral price. The single reversal occurs when Rowan flips the bargain: drive granted only if the original debt is spoken raw, forcing Senn to trade social skin for daughter’s life. Escalation is causal under the ticking gutter; pressure peaks when the last drip ceases and the fog figure materializes. Cost is on-page: Senn’s public guilt is carved into indelible three-word confession; Rowan’s anger cools into portable grief, foreclosing further revenge.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“why some places resist change”—is signaled in line 1 and tightens when the lantern’s thrum warns of shadow-splits. The meaningful deepening occurs at the chimney shimmer: Galen realizes the oasis stores timelines like stacked bowls, foreclosing the option to break it and forcing the gentler alignment. Cost is legible in the crumbling combs and clearing spring. Pressure escalates under the Accumulative/Textural lens; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—protect the unguarded vertical world she’s grown—escalates when smugglers weaponize the same darkness she once softened. One decisive tightening: false bitting pattern forces her to repurpose garden trick into civic defense; price is the rose’s finality and her new sentinel duty.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—translate isolation into independence—tightens when the circle’s hum reveals the narrator’s complicity in extinction. The mid-story reversal (names of last pairs appearing) escalates guilt into actionable restitution; the option of perfect recall is foreclosed by the tide-warped pages. Cost is visible and persistent: the narrator surrenders immortal accuracy for fallible coexistence. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can the narrator keep hiding behind others’ words—is signaled early and tightens as each anonymous confession increases the pressure to surrender his own. The single deepening beat is Arin’s blank spiral: it collapses the ghostwriter’s proxy safety and forces public self-exposure. Cost is visible: the private letter becomes the centerpiece everyone will read. Agency remains with the protagonist; coincidence complicates (storm) but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—who controls the signal—tightens when the beacon shifts with human quarrels, forcing Mara’s counter-map. One meaningful deepening: the false map causes the sky to “hesitate,” proving tricksters are opportunistic, not omnipotent. Price is legible: Mara loses unilateral control and must trust the town. Escalation is causal under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—recover the lost key or remain complicit in spatial tyranny—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when corridors vote to fold the protagonist into an airless closet. The decisive turn narrows options: plant the compass and risk permanent lung-seal, or retreat; the chosen path forecloses the nexus’s mutiny and costs the mentor’s corporeal form. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under causal lens—each organ interval raises floor-shift stakes—culminating in the single trembling chord that snaps the prison ribs. Price is visible in the transparent dust the mentor becomes.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—awakening town empathy by naming the lost—surfaces in paragraph two and tightens when procedural silence is threatened. Mid-story pivot: sketch of the masked figure forces Maren’s twitch, turning abstract guilt into imminent exposure. Final offer of a public mural forecloses anonymity for both Maren and town, exacting social cost. Pressure escalates once, cleanly, under Causal lens; no reversal or deepening beyond the single turn, capping short-form excellence at 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restore Elias’s name—faces escalating institutional resistance: Sato’s initial evasion, the locked annex, and the unfiled reversal clause. The midpoint tightening occurs when Mara overlays quatrains onto the antique chart, foreclosing the possibility that Elias was merely cowardly; the copper nail later forces a public confrontation that risks her professional credibility. Cost is legible: she jeopardizes her position at the Hydrographic Archive by submitting a formal correction that contradicts official record. Agency remains hers throughout; coincidence exposes the journals but every subsequent turn is driven by her decoding choices.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—legal erasure vs. remembered self—surfaces early and tightens when the fiddler must choose to pixelate their own face. One meaningful deepening: realizing the program is “illegal and tender” raises personal risk. Agency drives every turn; no coincidence resolves. Cost is conceptual but legible: the old name is forfeited to the server.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—break the algorithmic loop—tightens when real ambulances circle, raising cost from abstract bug to bodily risk. One meaningful deepening occurs as the narrator realizes the bills record his father’s returns, forcing the choice to re-train the data and later to walk the straight markers. Pressure stays coherent under causal lens; no coincidence resolves it.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—decode before wind erases—tightens when Nera’s grief becomes the secondary pressure that demands the chronicler risk her dream-body inside the temple. One meaningful escalation: the dream reveals the vault’s true purpose, foreclosing any scholarly “victory” and replacing it with lifelong witness; the cooled sanctuary air is the visceral price paid on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is legible by line 3: retrieve the frozen confession to loosen the curse. Pressure tightens once: descent path opens only if Thalen risks feeding his own seed to the sprouting teeth, trading future hazard for immediate access. The reversal of drawn circles is the single decisive turn that forecloses retreat—mirror must straighten or drown. Cost is on-page: twin’s apology floods his mind, and the lake’s returned losses pile around his ankles as irrevocable burden.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—recover mother before leaking futures devour the present—is signaled early and tightened once: the cracked seal lets dreams tear each other “like dogs,” forcing Lysa to pay with blood. Cost is legible on-page; escalation is linear but sufficient for 725 words.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—Jory’s soul vs. Mira’s future joy—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens when the knot is shown to be slipping. The midpoint reversal (someone else is secretly selling Jory’s restored destiny) escalates under causal lens, forcing Mira to invent a costlier lock. Price is visible on-page: the silver thread burrows into her wrist, daily pain becomes immutable. One tightening suffices at this length and it forecloses the option of ever forgetting.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can he trade being right for being useful—tightens when the cloth’s possible link to the dead singer emerges. The single reversal: from cataloguing for self-protection to curating for Marla’s grief. Pressure escalates because each fact he records now threatens to expose his own hollowed purpose. The cost is visible: relinquishing expert distance to admit the cloth might be the brother’s “first thing that felt like him.”

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will he measure or keep her?—tightens when the seed pulses in sync with his breath, forcing the choice to record or to hold. The tightening is single but sufficient: coil alignment → vector caught → he lets the light pass. Cost is legible: the warmth slips beyond instruments, foreclosing resurrection. Pressure stays causal under the inferred lens; no artificial reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure escalates through the librarian’s invented ritual—smelting bookmarks, lowering the creel—each act narrowing options under the moon’s rule; the cost is legible yet stays moderate because the city never pushes back hard enough to threaten the ritual itself.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—seal or open the bunker—tightens when confession becomes the price of light. One meaningful deepening: pearl’s shift from private relic to communal beacon narrows options to “leave open.” Escalation is accumulative/textural: each spoken regret intensifies radiance, reweighting social cost. Protagonist agency drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preventing another dam failure—surfaces early and escalates when graffiti redirects attention to the intake gate. The micro-turn in the bathroom (“START WHERE YOU LIED”) forces a narrowing of options: confess or remain complicit. The protagonist’s agency drives the climax; luck merely reveals, never resolves. Cost is legible in the public exposure of the emailed photo, though a sharper bodily risk or forfeiture could have pushed 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—recover swallowed sentences—signaled in paragraph two. One meaningful tightening: cipher decodes into his own name, collapsing accuser and accused. Price is the irrevocable mailing of the apology; the second letter’s blankness confirms the option foreclosed. Escalation is accumulative/textural—delay pulses intensify density until silence is broken.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—living propagation vs. imperial consecration—tightens when figs show burned roots, turning abstract orchards into visceral loss. One meaningful reversal: coffee stain first shows coronation gap, second shows Sorell alone, forcing her to accept collateral damage. Price legible: she forfeits institutional safety and implicates Sorell. Could edge higher if envoy’s threat carried an on-page consequence beyond implied soldiers.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—capture the last spark before oblivion—tightens when the corridor vision reveals the point of brightness trembling in Orin’s chest; one infusion mis-step could extinguish it. Escalation is Accumulative: each counted crackle and memory-tuck increases density until the sigh of light releases the spark into the stone, then sky. Visible price: the chip, once merely stolen relic, becomes irreversibly emptied, its new heartbeat gone. Agency is renunciation; by gifting the light she forecloses the possibility of keeping a private after-glow.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“where is contentment?”—tightens when the pool reframes emptiness as furrow; the scalloping action is the one visible beat that narrows options from introspection to cultivation. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens; brother’s late entry complicates but does not resolve, preserving cost.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether Mara will deliver or absorb doubt—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens once: when the cloak’s fabric “slides over her hands like cool smoke” she forfeits the paid outcome. Pressure is coherent under Causal lens; no coincidence resolves anything. The price (she keeps the burden) is visible and alters her trajectory off-page. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length; no escalation loops.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—learn to vanish before the mentor’s regression erases language—tightens once: the narrator must internalize the pattern or lose the technique forever. Agency is present: each stone throw is a practiced test under increasing magnetic distortion. Cost is visible: mentor’s final disappearance and the narrator’s solitary emergence carry the price of guardianship. No coincidence; escalation is driven by mentor’s accelerating youth and narrator’s dawning comprehension.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—learn to travel by tone alone—is signaled in paragraph two and tested when the flock-split forces a mid-hum tuning choice. The tightening beat: refusing to chase grief-echoes narrows options to stillness, risking permanent failure. Cost is legible: the birds depart, taking the live script with them; Oren keeps only an internal sequence of intervals. Under Accumulative lens the pressure is a density of returning overtones that eventually foreclose physical motion as a viable path.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“find the sacred in the simple”—tightens when the automaton arrives to harvest the keystone, forcing a choice between theft and renunciation. Escalation is textural: each ascent beat strips another layer of tech (harness, then mist walking, then empty hands), reweighting cost. The final forfeiture forecloses quantified proof, paying the price on-page. No reversal, but the deepening pattern satisfies the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“see sound’s color”—is signaled in paragraph two and escalates through two causal tightenings: (1) tag unlocks registry, (2) vow card unlocks perception. Each narrows options: once the vow is spoken, the old “hiding behind truth” tactic is foreclosed. Cost is visible: the last lanterns fade to “sparks” while the narrator’s air runs low, linking sensory gift to mortal limitation. Pressure is coherent under accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can purpose survive a contracting universe?—is signaled in line 1 and tightened when the prophecy forces a binary (core/rim) then removes it via the edgewise coin. Agency sits with Mara at every turn: she casts, reads, distills, and chooses the split that costs the last fuel. The price is legible on-page—fuel gone, station trembling, blank coin—and forecloses retreat. Escalation is causal under the time-loop lens; no coincidence resolves anything.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“will he survive carrying unnamed fears?”—tightens when each naming forecloses the option to keep the lover’s memory sealed. The pressure escalates by accretion: every new crystal adds weight to his scythe-side silhouette until the final blank ocean space forces the last sob into the map. No coincidence; the lifeboat recordings arrive by river of departure, a causal given of his occupation. Cost is visible: the lover’s unspoken name remains iron in his mouth while the strangers’ names are freed.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—restore cosmic balance via unanswered bell—tightens when public mockery threatens his already brittle conviction. Escalation is accumulative: each counted drip shortens future options; the steward’s laugh applies external pressure that peaks at the single ring. No coincidence resolves; the answering bell complicates rather than delivers fish. Cost is social humiliation plus lingering uncertainty, visible on page.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—truth versus erasure—surfaces with the first silent chime and escalates as each photograph shrinks Mara’s room to maneuver. The reversal occurs when she chooses to photograph the boot print instead of bulldozing it, paying the social cost of exposing her father’s crime. Pressure stays coherent; no coincidence rescues her from the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—prove transmutation without losing her authentic wonder—tightens when the starlings offer the missing ratio, forcing a public-guild vs. private-self trade-off. Escalation is single yet meaningful: the crystal’s dissolution flash raises the cost of failure, and the orchard air “rang softly,” signaling irreversible change. Agency is hers: she chooses to stir by intuition while logic “checked the measure.” Cost is legible—she risks guild censure—but slightly abstract because the council stays off-page, capping entry to 8.4.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single dominant stake—keep the medicine chain trusted—tightens when the false Courier Nine’s pause forces a public revision that risks the entire drop; the protagonist’s agency narrows options and a visible price (exposing the fraud under scrutiny) is paid on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—who owns continuity—tightens when the jarred brain’s legal claim threatens to overwrite the living fighter. Escalation is causal: because the narrator refuses dominance, he must vivify opposites, narrowing options to co-guardianship. The shared-breath trial forecloses sole identity, price visible in his emptied chest. Custodians and Council remain off-stage pressures, slightly muting visceral opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—keep the sanctuary un-corporatized—tightens when the seed’s bloom threatens publicity. The midpoint reversal: she weaponizes the germination room into a test that exposes OrthoGen’s intent, narrowing her options to resist or capitulate. Cost is legible: she accepts slower growth and future risk to protect the space. One clear escalation beat meets the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“restore lost laughter”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the first off-key harmonic fails, forcing Bram to kneel and macerate, trading dignity for possibility. The laugh that ricochets “toward daylight” visibly forecloses the tunnel option, paying a clear price (public exposure of grief ritual). Escalation is single-arc but sufficient for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—escape versus dwelling in uncertainty—tightens once: when the pendant tries to widen the rib-doorway and the duo chooses to “wait at the edge,” foreclosing guaranteed passage. The cost is visible: the pendant dies, the guardian remains unnamed, the narrator wakes still exiled. One meaningful deepening suffices for 700 words.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—interrupt destiny before it seals—is signaled in paragraph 4 and escalates through each controlled fracture; the charter’s wax hiss is the audible cost. One meaningful tightening suffices: the crozier’s re-shape forces Jun’s ledger (and thus the quota system) to be literally cut away. Agency remains with Mara; coincidence is absent; the price (loss of furnace, bishop’s authority, and legal seals) is on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“salvage a pattern before the city is scrapped”—tightens when the silence becomes articulate and demands the mast’s sacrifice. Agency is continuous: each dial turn and bolt loosened narrows options toward the final irreversible act. Cost is visible: physical labor, surrendered mast, discarded notebook page. One tightening suffices; no reversal is needed.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preventing solitary disappearance—surfaces early and tightens when Lina realizes the ferry is “sliding” between timelines. One decisive escalation: she abandons going home, steers alone toward the feared grotto, and risks becoming the next frozen commuter. Cost is visible—she trades her own year of life/experience to older-Lina and accepts perpetual maintenance of the seam.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can the texture of wordless connection be built—tightens via pattern accumulation: each counted angle narrows future options until the only structural release is eruption. The mirror’s refusal of faces is the single decisive intensification that forces the architect to relinquish control, paying with the collapse of his mnemonic anchor. Pressure stays coherent under the Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the maze. The cost is visible: the lattice becomes communal property, the architect’s private grief dissolved into shared hush.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—learn star-navigation before the next alien signal—is signaled early. Pressure tightens when council grants only one tide window; failure risks civic safety. The ascent itself is the decisive test, but the actual cost (grief-wonder braid) is more lyrical than visceral, so the tightening lands at high-mid band rather than 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prevent the dead from harvesting a living child—signalled in paragraph two and tightened when Mara realizes the caller is her own mother. One meaningful escalation: the sign’s second word revealed, shifting from command to plea, foreclosing Mara’s option to stay neutral. Cost is on-page: she shoulders the next call forever. Agency is renunciation/transfer rather than victory, fitting the elegiac mode.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restore the unremembered brother’s voice—tightens as tide clock shrinks options. One meaningful escalation: phase-transition gamble forecloses retreat; failure = entombment + coast-wide silence. Cost is legible in trembling body and irreversible solitude after log release. Pressure coheres under causal lens; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: regain legal existence without erasing the fact of failure. Pressure escalates when ink patterns become the only channel to rewrite the ledger; failure to draw correctly keeps her ghost. Visible price: she must publicize Lyle’s mistakes to fix hers—ethical trade-off legible on page. One micro-turn: stopping heartbeat count relinquishes obsessive control, foreclosing old coping tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—keep Vey from silence—tightens when consonants soften season by season and the diamond threatens to swallow instead of store. One meaningful deepening: when swifts fail the night Toma dies, unpatterned echoes risk flattening every word; Ilen’s spiral-aligned breathing re-imposes cadence, foreclosing the option of endless sameness. Cost is legible: his own veins vibrate, diamond goes still, canyon keeps a voice no living mouth now owns. No reversal, but sufficient escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—keep Jonas human—signals early and tightens when Mara plants the arrowhead, foreclosing the Choir’s doorway option. Escalation is causal: each confession increases gravitational play until the final trade-off. Price is visible (shadow peels, gravity hiccups, Jonas sweats). Could use one earlier tangible loss (e.g., a plant dies) to push into 9+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“can beauty re-enter the mechanical city?”—is signaled in paragraph one and tested by the orchard’s PROPERTY tags. The single meaningful tightening occurs when Lio shifts from evasion (heartbeat trick) to irreversible sabotage (knuckle-playing the trunk), narrowing his option set from stealth to open revolt. Cost is visible: the statues seize him, the tree drags its prison-scars into the city, and Lio’s violin remains unplayed—he has traded song for insurgent horticulture.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—deliver what was promised, including a child—tightens when the only route is law-breaking drone flight. Escalation is one-way: refusal to report smugglers → storm disable → coerced bargain → border crossing. The tightening forecloses neutrality; price is potential treason charge and empty storm bottle. Coincidence (drone schedule matching mail drop) complicates rather than rescues, satisfying lens.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: can Rowan wrest a voice from silence? Pressure escalates via sensory densification—each bell brightens, the hush thickens, the shard hums—until the act of repair forces the sung note. No external antagonist is needed; the misting hush is the opposing medium. The oasis wrong-turn tightens options: drink or retreat; drinking enables the release, so agency drives escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—finding where stories “keep living”—is signaled early and tightens when the scarf’s tug makes the search material. The single meaningful deepening occurs at the hand-into-gap beat, narrowing options from cataloguing to caretaking. Cost is present but abstract (loneliness reframed, not forfeited), so pressure peaks just shy of visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—recover the runaway dream—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the silhouette is scraped into the palette; the final refusal to hold it forecloses any future capture. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length: the silhouette’s step-forward forces the choice between memory and future. Cost is visible (she keeps the empty photograph), meeting the 8.8+ band guardrail.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—liberate the unspeakable idea—signals early and tightens through each disorienting turn; the pool’s blink forces a single star-choice that forecloses anonymity. Escalation is accumulative: each spiral adds vertigo and star-density until the comma-tool clicks; cost is the surrendered laughter and the exposed map. No external antagonist needed; fear itself supplies coherent pressure. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length and lens.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—recover stolen self—signals early and tightens once: the spiral of broken stars points to the ring, forcing the choice to taste. Escalation is textural/density-driven: each artifact (notebook, constellations, mushroom) reweights the cost of the blank pages. Agency is clear—she plucks and tastes—foreclosing the safe scholar’s path. Price is felt on-page: the crisp nostalgia that restores memory also commits her to annual tending.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“will the city let her back in?”—tightens when the shadow-door’s hinge demands unshaking annotation; failure means permanent exile. One meaningful escalation: her first steady pen stroke narrows options from defiance to self-authorship, price visible in the brass tag dropping.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—restore Nela’s color—surfaces by 200 words and tightens when the narrator must surrender the only jar of bluebell essence, a felt price. Escalation is single-curve: each pruning capture increases luminosity until the bruised patch (personal fear) demands the protagonist’s own pigment; this deepens rather than reverses. No antagonist is needed; pressure is ontological—wonder leaking from the world. The final orchard dawn confirms the trade-off succeeded, foreclosing return to monochrome ignorance.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—free the storm or the dead stay adrift—tightens with each syllable regained; the final knot forces the restorer to pay with his true name, a felt price that forecloses ancestral silence. Escalation is linear but sufficient: every loosened knot = +1 unit of sound = +1 unit of personal exposure. No off-stage rescue; the risk is tested on the slab in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—give erased parishioners witness—surfaces when Lena reads the crossed-out names. One meaningful tightening: the shadow’s reach toward the alcove forces her to decide whether to remove the maps. Cost is visible: she risks the archivist’s seal order and carries damp evidence uphill. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding release—is signaled early and tightens through each artifact found. However, escalation is largely accumulative pattern rather than a narrowing of options; no irreversible sacrifice is risked after the reel is discovered. The final letting-go is conceptual, not a forced choice between live alternatives. Pressure is atmospheric, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—give the ghost a quiet conduit before thunder erases it—tightens when Lio realizes routing, not resurrection, is required, foreclosing his usual silence. Agency visible: he strikes plate to spark-read his own marks, then signs the wall, paying the cost of perpetual quietude. Pressure coherent under causal lens; coincidence (lightning) complicates, does not resolve. One beat, one meaningful turn, sufficient for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: will Lysa remain a passive courier or seize agency? Pressure escalates floor-by-floor as decryption reveals first personal grief, then imminent sabotage. The decisive tightening occurs at floor eight: she must stop the lift and strand herself, trading comfort for authorship of the outcome. Cost is on-page: extra stair climb, social risk, and the quiet forfeiture of the offered promotion.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—prove emptiness remembers or die—signals early and tightens when Fury’s anvil sparkles. The telescope gamble is a single decisive escalation that forecloses passive drift; the line literally narrows their sky-path. Cost is visible: the brass tube—last link to Juno—is risked to the storm-dark void. No redundant reversals; one meaningful turn suffices under 800 words.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—save the book and mirror the sky—tightens when time shrinks from “hush” to “first hammer struck.” One meaningful turn: she chooses to seal the book back inside, trading preservation-by-possession for preservation-by-art. Cost is the irrevocable loss of the physical archive. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes during the foreman beat, keeping this just outside the 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—chart the unknown—surfaces in paragraph two and tightens when each hopscotch square forecloses alternative headings; the blank glare zone becomes an unavoidable, narrowing target. Agency is continuous: Lio’s charcoal lines, phrasebook translations, and helm shout incrementally re-weight options until the engines thump awake. Cost is conceptual but legible: he trades the safety of “dull drift” for an unmapped door that may kill the crew. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversal is needed under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“learn the rhythm of repair”—is signaled early and tested when the note forbids theft. Pressure tightens once: the prophecy forces her from passive reading to active making, foreclosing the grab-and-run option. Cost is visible (her own picks left behind) and alters later tactics. A second reversal or external antagonist would overstuff 700 words; the single deepening is sufficient, but the felt price could be sharper on the page to reach the 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—escape to the nebula—tightens when the relay well demands cooperative labor, turning passive refugees into active builders. A visible price is paid: days of thorn-scratched labor and the bell’s relocation, shown on-page. Escalation is linear rather than multi-turn, but the single deepening (ghost’s grave reveals past sacrifice) meaningfully reweights the effort required.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—deliver a lullaby to cushion apocalypse—tightens when the pane shimmers and the gears demand payment; her heartbeat forfeit is the visible price. One meaningful escalation: nudging the minute hand back then forward builds a new rhythm that births the silence-window; no reversals needed at this length. Agency remains hers; coincidence only complicates (radio forecast) but does not resolve. Cost is legible on-page, satisfying 8.8+ bar.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—save the child before frost mirrors the maze—tightens via the 47-minute countdown and each clattering bird pass. The caretaker’s agency is indirect yet pivotal: shadow-pressure assemblies, not muscle, shift the patrol pattern. Escalation peaks when the first frost threads the corners even as the song leads out; the price is the curse’s deeper bite, implied but undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—translate separation into connection—tightens when the open-license decision forecloses corporate secrecy and personal anonymity. The foam-insight beat is the single meaningful escalation that narrows options: she must either hide or share the force-dissipating chemistry. Cost is legible: loss of patent income and public exposure. No reversal overload; one decisive turn suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—win a self-beginning—tightens when counting silence becomes the only path to parole; refusal to miscount forecloses retreat. Escalation is accumulative: each measured gap narrows future options until the cut risks permanent blankness. Cost is visible in the trembling fragments and the page that now speaks the vendor into existence.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—can Safi transmute collective remorse without being destroyed—tightens when he removes the linen: one irrevocable escalation under Accumulative lens. Pressure grows via density of tasted memories rather than external reversals; the final shared weep proves the tactic worked. No coincidence; the pavilion’s thaw is storm-revealed, not luck-served. Visible price: Safi’s body becomes living filter, a cost that will recur nightly in every ladle of broth.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—save Elevator Nine—tightens once: the demolition clock is sunrise, announced at word ~400, giving a hard external deadline. Internal/external stakes braid only loosely; Mara’s personal risk is never made visceral (no fear of mayor’s reprisal, no bodily danger on the roof). Languages-as-bridge tactic escalates social pressure but the cost is borne by the town, not the protagonist. Still, the single tightening is meaningful and lands under the inferred causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will she excise or archive the foreign memories—tightens when the hospital corridor memory reveals her mother’s complicity. One meaningful deepening: the moment she shifts from sever to sort, foreclosing the option of pure self-erasure. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative/Textural lens; each solder point adds density rather than new causal reversals. Cost is visible—she accepts lifelong custodianship and quaking fear—though the price could be sharper if a personal memory were momentarily lost on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—recover lost combinations before smugglers/kings—is signaled early and tightened when the chamber begins to collapse; speaking the codes aloud forecloses secrecy. Price is legible: he gains the patterns but loses the hidden archive. One meaningful escalation beat satisfies length.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“create music in a silent world”—tightens via each wire pluck that costs her carved alder block and bodily stillness. One meaningful deepening suffices: the widest crack becomes the opening note, narrowing options to physical empathy; price is visible in surrendered insulator and perpetual silence she accepts.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“prevent false-night by decoding covenant”—is signaled early; pawn-forward test that breaks the dust-crescent provides the single meaningful tightening, proving restraint is required. Council vote costs the city strategic leverage; price is legible. Escalation is quiet but causal under the Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—prevent a misfire into the crowd—is signaled by the diary’s apology and escalates with each crate he tests under time pressure; the tightening is singular but sufficient. Agency is continuous: tuning, reading aloud, swapping shells—each action forecloses delay and risks arrest. Cost is legible: personal exposure to suspicion and the irreversible expenditure of his own safe stock.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—win the seed—narrows to “earn it without taking it,” tightened by the bloom’s unbearable stench that she must endure to decode the rot-compass. Agency is continuous: she maps, climbs, watches, breathes, accepts. Cost is visceral: knees buckle, paper records the reek, she descends with obligation rather than prize.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—find the secret of resilience—tightens when the arrow’s warmth tugs her into the hollow; option to keep the talisman is foreclosed by pressing it into the communal tree. Escalation is causal: each beat (test seedlings, follow water, enter ring) narrows possibility. Visible price: she relinquishes the healing shard, accepting shared stewardship. No coincidence resolves; gravity inversion is scheduled, not random.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—break the silence before it spreads—tightens when the investigator realizes the town is collateral; the sprint to vandalize the spiral is a clear irreversible act that forecloses retreat, though escalation is single-arc rather than layered.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—wonder versus rationed silence—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when silence becomes a prison that swallows Maera’s breath. One meaningful escalation: the hush clenches, Lio must risk Guild censure to play the forbidden scale. Cost is visible—the sheet’s darkening, the city’s brittle charter—and the choice to keep ringing at the end forecloses quietude as imposed control. Agency is accumulative rather than causal-reversal, fitting the lyric design.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can she atone for the lost pilgrim—signaled in paragraph 1; pressure tightens when the corridor opens and she must choose between commanding or listening. One meaningful deepening: she shifts from seeking forgiveness to seeking understanding, foreclosing the old guardianship rule-set. Cost is visible: the pilgrim ages in the frozen world, proving time was stolen, and she exits carrying the hush as permanent burden. Agency drives every beat; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can Kestrel recover her own self from the borrowed chorus—tightens when each swap costs coherence, culminating in the blank broadside that forecloses further transfers. Escalation is accumulative: density of borrowed selves rises until the final rotation empties her. Cost is legible in the “ledger of ratios” and the cooling press. One hairline slip: auditors’ anger drain is off-stage, slightly muting visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“coax wonder from routine”—is signaled in paragraph two and tested when Mara’s certainty threatens to flatten the ridge tales into primer lists. The pendant’s refusal is the single meaningful tightening that forecloses the commercial path; cost is the lost commission and the open-ended accountability of the chalk question. Pressure escalates accumulatively: each vibration episode lengthens a moment but also increases Rook’s cognitive load of memory vs. myth, culminating in the cairn surrender. No coincidence resolves; the sympathetic mechanics are established early and remain consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will he cling to anger or release it—tightens when the hush crackles after he names the feeling, foreclosing the option to keep hating the car. Pressure is textural: each frost breath adds emotional load rather than external danger, fitting the Accumulative lens. No visible resource loss, but the price is the permanent omission he must now practice on his parents. One decisive intensification satisfies the length; could use a second beat of friction to reach 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—voice vs. message—tightens when silence demands payment. One meaningful deepening: the loom drinks laughter, leaving only steady hands. Cost is visible, but escalation is single-note; no secondary reversal complicates the path after the border locks.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—save orchards before arches collapse—escalates through each memory-payment, narrowing Lio’s toolkit as he forgets songs, faces, his mother’s name. Protagonist agency drives every turn: he chooses the trade, chooses the forge, chooses to bury the silk; coincidence merely enables the magician’s arrival without solving the problem.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—lifting the lie’s weight—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the beacon taps out Jalen’s call sign. One meaningful reversal: the hatch sealed → open via shard-refraction, forcing confrontation. Cost is visible: brother bound in wire, narrator’s cyclic passport revoked once the truth is logged. Pressure stays coherent under causal lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—unmarked guardianship of unseen mariners—is signaled early and tightens when the radio mast fails; stone code becomes the only remaining agency. One meaningful deepening: Noah shifts from passive observer to active link in the anonymous chain, foreclosing personal recognition. Cost is visible—blood, anonymity, lifelong silence—under the causal lens. Coincidence (trawler horn response) complicates but does not resolve, keeping escalation coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—can the coast still be warned after print dies—is signaled in line 1 and tightened when the narrator’s own joke turns lethal. Escalation is one smooth ramp: laughter births prophecy → prophecy births flood → flood forces shadow-play. Agency stays with the keeper; no coincidences resolve. Cost is the mayor’s warning and the narrator’s vow to “choose words,” foreclosing carefree laughter.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“will he cling to control or release stories?”—tightens when each sun-dot forces him to witness Sairi’s generosity. The penultimate beat (dye sparks illuminating vanished people) forecloses retreat; the vow is the only remaining option. Cost is visible: the images fade, leaving him committed to an unmeasured path.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will he settle for quantified sorrow or seek living witness—tightens when the sextant begins measuring his own nights. One meaningful escalation: the maze shifts at the pin-drop, forcing him to decide whether to preserve or release the dream-flakes. Cost is legible: each tick subtracts grief from his chest, foreclosing the safety of anonymous maintenance.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—teach the realm morning again—tightens when night “tightens like a collar” in direct response to each new dawn-thread; the escalation is textural but legible. One meaningful deepening suffices: the infants’ swaddling converts abstract dawn into mortal vulnerability, forcing Lysa to pay with her own returning memories. Cost is visible on-page: “she suddenly remembered her mother’s voice,” paid in the same sentence a child is wrapped. Agency remains hers throughout; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—whether mistakes must be hidden or can be inhabited—tightens once: Lysa’s botched delivery escalates from potential expulsion to sanctioned apprenticeship, narrowing Marin’s options from passive concealment to active mentorship. The cost is legible: he trades his anonymity for guardianship of her secret, a social forfeiture stated in the final note. Under Accumulative lens the pressure deepens rather than reverses, sufficient for 800-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve ordinary sacredness before erasure—is signaled early and tightened once: from passive noticing to active planting that risks patrol reprisal. The confession beat deepens cost, turning private guilt into public vulnerability. No coincidence resolves; the sprout emerges from prior seed choice. Price is visible: exposure in a now-dark courtyard with footsteps outside.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prevent one more promise from vanishing—is signaled in paragraph four and escalates through each frequency peak. The slide’s warming and the script’s emergence constitute one decisive intensification that forces Ilian to donate personal sincerity. No coincidence resolves; the cost is the irreversible expenditure of his own luminous vow. Pressure stays coherent under the Accumulative lens, though a second external obstacle would have pushed this into the 9s.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—father’s life vs. silence truce—signaled in paragraph one. Pressure tightens through each wax failure: options narrow from barrel to piling to skiff chain; each retry risks exposure. Final tin-cup clatter is protagonist-activated, foreclosing negotiation path with visible blood cost. One meaningful tightening suffices; no off-stage rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—will I surrender inherited doubt to share a sky?—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once as ring-pull strengthens and Bureau risk is voiced; convergence is the single deepening that forecloses neutrality. Cost is felt in sensory shift and glow co-opted, but escalation is more atmospheric than tactical; no new obstacle or trade-off complicates the middle, keeping it short of 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—answer the calling or let creativity turn to ash—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when the dial spins freely, removing the option to walk away. The reversal is micro but decisive: ruined lock forces her to sacrifice her last canvas, turning rectification from metaphor into material loss. Cost is visible—wet paint on chain, last surface gone—and persists as the mural becomes a door she cannot close again. Pressure accumulates under causal lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“where do lost conversations go?”—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when Mara learns the conduit composts lies into breathable air; her truthful note suddenly threatens the city’s literal atmosphere. One meaningful escalation: writing on plain paper clears the floating tubes, foreclosing her former gilded livelihood. Price is felt immediately: Sable stays upright, but the guild’s air supply could collapse if she re-opens the cistern. The stakes stay personal yet ripple outward, satisfying 8-band pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve chromatic wonder against gray standardization—tightens when the Auditor demands mute bells be replaced; Lysa escalates by accelerating the wheel, forcing collective audition. No reversal: she keeps initiative, so escalation is intensification rather than option-narrowing. Cost is off-loaded onto Auditor’s ledger and the fragment, not Lysa’s body or future, keeping pressure one-sided. Sufficient for lyric mode but not razor-sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single dominant stake—save the roses or lose them—tightens when the only path is fire. Escalation is one disciplined line of flame; each shovel-prune micro-choice raises the cost of failure. No reversals needed; the burn forecloses retreat. Price is legible in scorched mulch and the android’s rewritten lullaby.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can listening forestall displacement?—is signaled early and tightened when letters are read aloud, freezing the developer outside. Agency is attention, not combat; it still forecloses the “sell and leave” path. One meaningful escalation suffices. Cost is legible: private grief aired in public, external threat paused not vanished.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—liberate Oren without triggering broadcast—is signaled by line 4 and tightened when the guardian cuts lights. Lyra’s dance-cipher is an active tactic that forecloses speech; cost is visible when she abandons her journal. No coincidence resolves; the spider’s drop is a cue she planted. One micro-turn suffices at this length, but a second beat of external pressure would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—recover deleted memories—signaled in paragraph two. Escalation is causal: each jar opened narrows the council’s bargain, raises risk of discovery, and increases personal exposure. The midnight drain breach is the visible price that forecloses neutrality. Joy and skill are named as next targets, but the on-page cost is already legible in the father’s blank stare and Lysa’s rope-tied descent, satisfying the 8.8+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—prevent weaponized prophecy—tightens when Liora discovers the wells are already cracking, forcing a filter-not-erase tactic. Pressure escalates under causal lens: each mapping of silence physically encircles the threat, narrowing options toward one irreversible act. The final cost is conceptual—she alone must speak plainly to a city that may not listen—but the on-page price (loss of anonymity, psychic burden) is only lightly felt in the moment, keeping the beat just outside the 8.8 tier.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—save the building—signaled in paragraph two. One meaningful tightening: discovery of the cavity shifts the tactic from pleading to forgery. Cost is legible: complicity in document fraud, loss of Ilyas. Escalation is linear but sufficient for 700-word scope; no reversal is required. Coincidence (meteor flare) only illuminates, never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—keep brother’s voice vs. city safety—tightens when the shell’s illegal status forces the archive-or-lose dilemma. One meaningful turn: agreeing to seal the pattern in exchange for future access, price = immediate loss of whisper. Escalation is causal, not coincidental; no off-stage rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—whether to complete or break the state’s narrative—tightens once: ledger proves every forgery was priced, forcing Liora to choose between personal absolution and systemic exposure. The reversal is not external coincidence but her discovery of the basin seam; agency remains hers. Cost is immediate: she forfeits protection and walks into judgment. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length; no drift into secondary stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—recover Senn’s unmaimed voice—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened when Mael claims he bargained willingly, forcing Lira to risk losing him again to free him. The single escalation—snapping the luminous threads—carries visible price: the Nexus Choir’s power web collapses and Lira’s own voice is diminished. No reversal is needed; the deepening of knowledge that Senn’s echo carries pain, not pride, is sufficient causal tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—“salvage purity” versus Fen’s dream-theft—tightens when Mara realizes the globe’s water was boiled to thin ghosts, forcing her to risk public accusation. One meaningful escalation: the shared-dream trap that exposes Fen; no reversal, but options narrow and a visible price (child’s silence) is paid. Agency remains hers throughout; coincidence only complicates. Cost is legible, though a sharper personal stake for Mara at the end would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“hidden effort must be honored”—tightens when Ren recognizes that watchfulness also frays like twine. One meaningful deepening: moon-path tracking turns abstract appreciation into tactical advantage, foreclosing the smugglers’ route. Cost is visible: Ren’s public bow despite fishermen’s indifference signals social risk. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—expose the Authority’s lie—tightens when the beacon diamond proves the Stillpoint exists. Escalation is one long slope rather than a mid-course reversal, but the orchard ledger forecloses the “maybe it’s all superstition” option with visible cost: once he crosses the dust-free line, he can’t unknow the relocation scam. Enough pressure and price to reach high-band, though a second, harder choice inside the orchard would have pushed it to 9.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—control of communal meaning—tightens when Eli must choose between hoarding Mara’s voice or releasing it to the valleys. The reversal is one clean turn: confession → collaboration → shared sky-story, foreclosing solo authorship. Cost is legible: his private dawn becomes public, irreversible. Pressure escalates under causal lens; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can salvaged noise re-open village speech?—tightens when the music box demands ever-scarcer sounds, forcing Sato to barter his private ritual for public stories. One meaningful escalation: releasing the church-bell hiss publicly at dawn, trading anonymity for accountability. Cost is visible: the once-private poet now stands exposed between generations, pockets ringing with traceable coins.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—keep relic on island—tightens when sunset clock means crypt opens to anyone with key after dark. One meaningful reversal: would-be robbers become witnesses under sonic pressure; option of violence is foreclosed without blood. Cost is legible: trader’s confession drains into the sustained fork-tone, leaving him “empty-handed” yet quieter.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—smuggle grain under empire’s magnetic choke—tightens once: the third-moon window is the only safe moment, foreclosing all earlier impulses. Agency is patient endurance, not battle; cost is the sleepless nights spent charting shadows and the rebels’ deferred violence. No coincidence resolves; the empire’s bridge is neutralized by engineered absence, not luck. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes again, keeping the score just below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—stop Kellan’s cover-up—tightens when the lantern memory reveals the old escape route, turning forensic duty into personal risk. The cut brake-line discovery is the visible price that forecloses the “worker error” option; uploading the files costs her career safety. Pressure escalates under causal lens: each new artifact (clipboard, footprints, lantern) shrinks her available moves until only betrayal or silence remains.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can contrition become verifiable action—tightens once: rejected letter → clockwork test → community labor. The single deepening (Lena’s shared victimhood) escalates stakes from parole trick to lived restitution, forcing Elias to risk institutional censure. Cost is legible in the final beat: the chaplain surrenders narrative control to the ticking heart and Mrs. Halden’s nod. No reversal overload; one meaningful turn suffices for 800 words.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will Mara test the algorithm’s dare—tightens when the etched glyphs demand she ride the corrosive mist. Mid-story reversal: the algorithm rewrites itself on her notes, forcing her to decide whether to become its living clapper. Cost is visible: she risks dissolving yet lands on steaming basalt, irreversibly coupling herself to an evolving code. Escalation is causal, one meaningful turn sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—recover the vanished—tightens when the Chute proves deletion is exile; the 11-27-73 breadcrumb narrows Mara’s options to public betrayal. Escalation is causal: each decoded number forecloses silence and raises exposure cost. Final lie crystallizes stance with visible professional risk.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—community survival vs. paralytic fear—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: the shard must become a map or the floes will crush boats; the men’s opposed wishes force Mara to externalize empathy. Cost is legible: the two antagonists must cooperate on the same hull, risking mutual discomfort. Pressure escalates under Causal lens; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“learn the sound of endings”—tightens through tactile trials: each tap, the storm, the cut netting, the dawn relinquishment. No external antagonist needed; pressure is situational and accretive. One meaningful deepening at the storm beat narrows options: risk life to keep the clinic path open, then choose to relinquish pursuit. Cost is felt in the final letting-go; could wish for one earlier tangible loss (tool, injury) to sharpen tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—whether to finish burning the letters—surfaces by line 12 and escalates through the offer of shelter, the parallel burn-line reading, and the final decision to let the pages live. One meaningful tightening suffices: the act of reading aloud converts abstract regret into shared witness, foreclosing the erasure option with visible emotional cost. Pressure stays coherent under causal lens; no coincidence rescues them. Could use one more external jeopardy flicker (distant train, colder wind) to push into 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—preserve echo versus let it be co-opted—surfaces early and tightens when noon twitches signal risk. The dawn ritual constitutes one meaningful escalation: shared breath and named doubts literally set stones true, widening the clearing; failure would silence or weaponize the sages’ hum. Cost is felt: prophet’s tear, Iri’s embrace of secrecy. No second reversal, but under an accumulative lens the single deepening is sufficient; however, external jeopardy stays abstract, keeping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can shared pain be reconfigured into collective meaning?—tightens as each new photo forecloses easier private avoidance; the storm-night choice to hold sheets steady is the visible price. Escalation is textural rather than causal, but the pattern break from static grief to mobile communal walk is legible and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—protect or expose the root lexicon—tightens when the corridor reveals apprentices composting words; the hush escalates from menace to invitation, forcing the narrator’s public stance with visible social risk, though the cost is more communal than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“capture the sound of growing older before it vanishes”—is signaled in paragraph one and escalates when Mira realizes the archive must include Orrin’s vanishing breath. One decisive deepening: the capsule tape proves others have already lost their voices, turning private fear into communal obligation. Agency remains Mira’s: she chooses to add her mother’s name and Orrin’s breathing, paying the irreversible cost of recording over prior voices. No coincidence resolves; the tide’s turn merely externalizes the pressure already internalized.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—capture ephemeral flashes before dawn—faces concrete countdown; quake and spinning hand escalate by narrowing options beat-by-beat. One meaningful tightening: swapping electronic feedback for leaf ticks forecloses fallback tracking and spends her last spare seconds. Cost is legible: the rail alignment survives, but the lost windows and Lio’s absence remain irreversible. No coincidence resolves; her engineered governor earns the launch.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can Elias execute a flawless goodbye—tightens once: blood-work confirmation removes time, forcing Mara’s call and Jonah’s sky-bridge walk. No reversal, but a single meaningful deepening suffices; the shard’s wobble under the needle raises the chance of sonic failure, making the final chorus a gamble. Agency is shared: Mara risks professional distance, Jonah risks reopened grief, Elias risks dying mid-song. Cost is legible—Elias’s last breath arrives exactly as the scratched hymn ends, proving the gamble paid yet the loss still total.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“where shadows go at noon”—is signaled early and escalates through each closed loop that forecloses a linear path. The midpoint tightening occurs when the mural peels open, revealing the reservoir; options narrow from inquiry to responsibility. Cost is visible: she permanently re-couples her own shadow to the world’s broken sun-cycle. One causal reversal: the automaton becomes traveler instead of tool, forcing her to trust the loop rather than force it.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—will Rowan accept responsibility for a truth that bruises the town—tightens when he recognizes his own splint technique on the substitute corpse. The final choice to cross the hedge door forecloses the safe path of signed death certificates; price is the surrender of professional certainty. Escalation is singular but sufficient: each artifact (notebook, tooth, star map) raises the cost of remaining a skeptic.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—sharing light without fire—tightens once when the glass’s silence demands apology and again when the village chooses stillness over flame. Pressure grows accumulatively: each polishing rotation loosens memory and narrows Lio’s options until communal adoption forecloses solitary penance. Cost is legible; no reversal, but deepening suffices for lyric arc.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restitution without erasure—tightens when the only shield (pendant) is surrendered to Jun. One meaningful deepening: drip pattern shifts from ambient detail to encryption matrix, narrowing options to “give away last secret or fail.” Cost is visible: protagonist leaves with neither anonymity nor relic. Pressure coherent under causal lens; no artificial reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—write an honest ending—tightens when the river insists on one straight plotline; refusing it costs her blood and the certainty of readership. Escalation is accumulative: each cameo leaves a tactile residue that increases the weight of collected hope versus the pull of silence. The reversal—ink river reversing after her vow—reads as earned stance crystallization under Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is visible: bead of real blood, blank page staring back.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“trees no longer know when to give”—is signaled early and tightens when the orchard’s silence resists Marn’s first spinning. The meaningful deepening occurs at the communal inhale: without the keepers’ breath the tool is useless, foreclosing solo-hero resolution. Cost is present but diffuse: the moon departs, the crank is relinquished, yet no personal loss is dramatized for Marn. Under Accumulative lens the pattern intensifies sufficiently; a sharper personal price would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: create a living map so others can navigate by heartbeat during global breath-hold. Escalation is textural: each discarded item laid into spiral/radial pattern increases density until the flash-paper flare fuses refuse constellations onto the plate; the seal narrows options—once wax binds plate to well, the map is no longer portable. Cost is the forfeiture of personal escape; the tightening is single but decisive. No reversal, yet the aurora’s fractional shift signals external acknowledgment of the internal reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“fix time” to contain overflowing echoes—tightens when nightly tremors crack fresh marble, signaling imminent acoustic rupture. One meaningful deepening: the tremor reframes swallowing as overflow, forcing Ivo to anchor the timer to a living seam, forfeiting future access. Pressure accretes via pattern break rather than reversal, satisfying Accumulative escalation. Cost is present but diffuse; a sharper forfeiture (broken tool, frost-bitten hand) would push 9.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single dominant stake—carry burdens without turning to stone—tightens when the grotto demands the weaver’s own fixity; the calcification beat visibly forecloses escape until he pays with his own malleability, escalating under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: convert private grief into a transferable lesson before the kettle whistles. Pressure tightens as each channel cuts and seals—one mistake and the blank is scrap, the memory lost. No external antagonist; risk is botched craft and permanent silence. Escalation is textural—steam thickens, crystals cloud, options narrow to one last groove—cost is legible in the final clear-out of crystals.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—negotiate peace with regret—signaled in first third. One meaningful tightening: payment of images narrows future options. Pressure coherent under causal lens; ghost demand escalates because Mara’s earlier negligence is made legible. Cost visible in eyelid-forfeiture sequence. No coincidence resolves. Sufficient for high band.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—demolition vs resurrection—signals early and tightens once: when Lina primes the pump she crosses the bureaucratic line, foreclosing the easy report. Pressure escalates through because/therefore engineering obstacles (clogged drain → signpost gutter → turbine cough), each solved with visible stamina cost. No antagonist needed; the building’s entropy is sufficient, and coincidence is absent. The price—personal overtime, possible career reprimand—is legible but could be sharper on the final page.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can silence be transmuted into music without bells?—is signaled in paragraph one. The bear’s wound forces a single decisive tightening: the ledger page is sacrificed, making future chart-copying impossible and committing the scribe to raw listening. Escalation is accumulative: each stone-felt vibration deepens the cost of clinging to muteness. The final stance crystallizes under undeniable pressure: the glacier still looms, but the forecourt now demands a new, bell-less composition.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. community comfort—tightens when Mara realizes the tape dates to the Flood Saint week; splice narrows her options to irreversible public exposure. Cost is visible: “she left…knowing she had salvaged choice,” foreclosing her former neutrality.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve rope language—signaled in first paragraph; pressure escalates when wire shipment looms. One decisive tightening: clerk’s recognition of his family name forces the public-teaching concession. Cost is legible—secret weavers must abandon secrecy—but the beat is slightly under-played; a sharper visceral price would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—turn absence into map without reopening wound—tightens once: the queen’s whispered detail (ear-to-soil) forces the narrator to risk sharing his own breath, narrowing options from observer to co-bearer. Cost is visible: sleeve-brush, breath stutter, thread imprint. No reversal, but the single deepening satisfies accumulative design. Coincidence absent; all pressure arises from mutual need.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—reawaken beauty—tightens when the egg’s heartbeat threatens machine harmony; escalation peaks as gears lose consensus rhythm. One meaningful tightening suffices: the pigment breach forecloses a return to flawless automation. Cost is felt in the nun’s bitter confession and the palace’s new, uncertain sway.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: can she outrun her father’s shadow while living the opposite vocation. Escalation: brush call → accelerant evidence → trapped sister → graft under fire → coin framing → public vulnerability. Each step raises personal cost: bodily risk, moral compromise, reputational peril. Final choice narrows future: open identification as “compassion answer,” foreclosing anonymity—price paid on page.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—liberate trapped memories—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the latch refuses force; the micro-turn “unstick is not only force but release” narrows her options to stillness under the inferred causal lens. Price is legible: she inherits the pain she once escaped. No coincidence resolves; the mother’s authorship complicates rather than saves.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—break generational burning—surfaces in paragraph 1 and tightens when the caretaker warns that new light may erase discipline. Mid-story transit through sightless core is the single pressure spike: failure means eternal loop, success offers first alternative. Cost is visible: surrendering the gear leaves Lior personally dimmer, social risk explicit. Escalation is linear but sufficient for 700-word window; no reversal, yet option space narrows decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes—finding the shape of shared grief—tighten as ribbons move from single stones to clusters; the spectral mentor accelerates pattern recognition but lessens protagonist-driven pressure, so the final communal chord feels earned yet slightly gift-wrapped.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restoring shared balance between sea and town—tightens when Mara realizes the clock was sabotaged; removing the lead forecloses the council’s “efficient” lie and exposes her own complicity. Pressure escalates because each mechanical correction carries social cost: she must confess engineered imbalance to a widow who may never forgive. The final notch-cut is irreversible; the town will now meet real tides, not paper ones.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes hinge on whether Tomas’s silence was betrayal or sacrifice; the tapestry decode supplies the single tightening that reframes the widow’s grief. Escalation is linear—one revelation—yet sufficient for 700 words. Cost is borne by Alvera (tears, revised memory) rather than the protagonist, keeping pressure external.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—regional survival via adaptive knowledge—signaled in paragraph two and tightened when the model demands public admission of uncertainty. The single meaningful escalation is the shift from secrecy (model alone) to shared contingency (conditional charter); this narrows Jora’s personal option to hide and raises social cost. Price is legible: she risks credibility and relives her father’s fatal certainty in reverse. Agency drives every turn; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—smuggle living stories back into public hearing—tightens through each copying session and the final square gamble. One meaningful deepening: Censors’ sparkle-detection forces the black-cloak countermeasure, narrowing options. Cost is visible—Mara risks capture, orchestra risks bread-line livelihood—and the irreversible public broadcast forecloses secrecy.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can grief be made visible without lethal exposure—tightens when boots approach; the ash through the sieve is the irreversible trade-off. One meaningful deepening: the inspector’s recognition moment converts external threat into internal cost, foreclosing the option to destroy the portrait. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence rescues her.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—whether memory of navigational art survives—is signaled in paragraph one and sharpened when Mara demands ownership. The meaningful tightening occurs when Orin widens the hole “by hand,” trading speed for control, accepting physical exhaustion as price. Refusal of the meal ticket forecloses institutional validation; the cost is immediate isolation. Pressure escalates because each narrative layer he drills through physically exhausts him and narrows his social options.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—arts wing closure—tightens through subtractive rehearsals; each surrendered noise is a visible price that narrows options toward the final chord. The council’s front-row stiffness supplies coherent external pressure; the choir’s internal risk is the potential silence if the chord fails. No coincidence resolves; the sustained note earns the reversal. Cost is legible in the miner’s lost sarcasm, Niko’s dropped shout, and Mara’s wagered credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“will Mira weaponize or share memory-fruit?”—is signaled by the botanist’s tasted regret and tightens through each pruning decision. One meaningful deepening: the realization that unpruned fruit would drown minds forces the penultimate careful cut, narrowing options to calibrated sharing. Cost is legible: she sacrifices sole power and risks Ministry reprisal. Escalation is Accumulative/Textural—each tasting session adds neural density until the alignment night crystallizes the communal stance.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can wonder survive systemic lies?—tightens when Maro realizes the blackout is cover-up, not accident. The midpoint reversal (Sela’s admission) narrows options to speak or stay complicit; Maro’s truthful speech forecloses silence forever. Cost is visible: Sela’s public shame and Maro’s loss of comforting myths. One tightening is sufficient for 600-word scope; no coincidence resolves the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“can attention restore aliveness?”—tightens via each object-placement; the clock-moan beat shows immediate cost, foreclosing the option to treat placement as casual. Final release of the shard is irreversible, narrowing her future methods. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens: density of iris scent + neighbor laughter = undeniable reweighting. Could touch 9 if one beat showed a personal trade-off (sleep, wages, friendship) rather than purely ethical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will Ilyan replace one lie with another or carry the full, damning nuance—tightens with each revelation. The cord-threading action physically enacts the escalating risk: every yard of line is another structural betrayal documented. Fourth revelation (his court brewed the poison) forces an irrevocable public stance; options narrow to truthful confession or continued complicity. Cost is legible in the final ascent: he bears the ampoule’s violet script like a brand.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“capture the texture of the missed opportunity”—tightens when each landing’s math fails, forcing the final wager with the dice. The perpetual wheel embodies the stake: stop it and the opportunity texture is accepted as lost. Escalation is one sustained because/therefore curve; no false reversals. Cost is legible in the wheel’s cough and the widening silence.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—prove kindness persists—tightens when Ro’s almost-recognition pain converts private ritual into public risk. One meaningful escalation: the decision to paint the entire roof alphabet, narrowing Mira’s anonymity to exposure. Cost is visible—she forfeits secrecy and the last of her stamina. Under causal lens, because/therefore links hold without coincidence resolving anything.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—save the art from Council seizure—signaled by line 3. Pressure tightens through each loaf, each drop of thaw, each note revealed; options narrow to “perform or lose.” The captain’s refusal to trample bread is the single reversal that forecloses eviction; it is earned because Maris has weaponized museum craft into communal ritual. Cost is legible: perpetual dread remains, guards may return, but for now breath is bought with vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—rewrite the drowned day—signaled early; pressure tightens when the stone demands a price, forcing a single irrevocable choice. Escalation is causal and one-turn, sufficient for 700 words; the forfeiture of rescue is felt on-page. Could use one earlier micro-cost (fatigue, blood on copper) to push past 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—escape the photograph-death curse—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when the advisor demands the paradoxical sacrifice: be "perfectly seen" yet unseen. One meaningful turn: pressing the clasp until it bites and drinks the light forecloses the option of ever using the glow again; the price is blood and permanent ordinary grayness. Escalation is causal under the Causal lens: each mirror-strip increases the lure to stare until the heartbeat syncs, raising the cost of failure. The final choice narrows options to a single shutter-click that either annihilates the image or the self—visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—physical survival of the driftwood circle—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when the freighter light appears. Escalation is textural: each new percussive layer increases density until the storm itself supplies the final instrument; options narrow from “nets vs noise” to “mirror or die.” The protagonist’s agency drives every turn; even the loose spar is converted into a giant beater. Cost is visible—fruit lost, spar dents, tar spent—though the price is collective rather than personal, keeping the score just below the 8.8 tier.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—“who are the watchers?”—tightens when Lira realizes they are built into the wall she thought protected her. One meaningful deepening suffices: the gate changes from barrier to mouth, flipping safety into threat. Agency is visible—each chalked spiral and stylus tap erodes the lock—but the price (exile into the mirrored city) is conceptual rather than viscerally felt, capping the band at low-8.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. civic peace—tightens when Mara forces Hadrin to read the incriminating paragraph aloud, converting abstract stakes into audible evidence. The single meaningful turn: she reframes the dispute from accusation to curatorial bargain, narrowing both their options. Cost is visible on-page: Hadrin’s public complicity will be archived; Mara must shoulder the political fallout of exhibit design. Under causal lens, escalation is driven by her successive micro-choices, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—recovering interlaced absence—tightens when council denial + Beran’s hook threaten erasure. Escalation is causal: each secret note increases exposure; the final wrest risks capture yet secures the archive. Cost is visible: wet sleeves, bruised ribs, professional exile implied by barred drawbridge. One tightening suffices; no loops.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—proof of cartographic forgery—tightens when the lighthouse stamp converts suspicion into verifiable fraud. One meaningful reversal: blank cards are not missing data but receipts of theft, foreclosing the “ledgers never existed” hypothesis. Escalation is accumulative: each indexing pass deepens density rather than multiplying turns. Cost is visible in the decision to leave the physical stamp and carry only digital proof, accepting future vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—retrieve Jalen’s shadow—tightens when the priests demand “part of herself.” The single meaningful escalation is the self-splitting: it narrows options from “save brother” to “save brother by diminishing self,” a trade-off that charges every subsequent beat. Cost is legible on-page: flame-Mira polishes the gem while paper-Mira is folded away, a permanent reduction of agency.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can he hijack the slack that killed her?—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is one continuous tightening: 12-minute power window narrows to breaker click; each thruster burst costs irreplaceable gas; final upload forecloses vengeance path. No coincidence; every intensification is self-created via probe pulses & steering. Cost visible: geode’s faint ring marks crossing into live branch he cannot enter; mercy extracted from own wound.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: complete the fragmented alphabet to hear the “frequency of belonging.” Mid-story tightening occurs when star-trail gap reveals the hidden cabinet—one deepening that narrows search to drawer-by-drawer assembly. No reversal, but the accruing pattern suffices for Accumulative lens. Price is conceptual, not tactical: the word READ locks in, pulses align, and the option of endless searching is foreclosed by the achieved chord. Sufficient for 600-word scale.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—will Mara speak the withheld truth—tightens when the driftwood dolphin reveals her complicity. One meaningful escalation: the capsule moves from promised balm to potential lie, foreclosing the easy out. Cost is visible: Jonah pockets pain, Mara forfeits her eraser identity. Pressure coheres under causal lens; no coincidence resolves the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—keep the moon-phase truce intact while salvaging human residue—signals early. One meaningful tightening: the wire-bound wrists force Lena to sacrifice her talisman to prevent bloodshed on neutral stone, foreclosing her private comfort. Cost is visible: she palms empty air as the boy crosses. Pressure escalates under causal lens; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—will he keep hiding or confess—tightens each time he commits to the next pole; logbook entry crystallizes the price. No external antagonist needed: backlash of memory supplies coherent pressure. Escalation is linear, not exponential, capping the score just below the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—recover empathy or stay blank—tightens at each junction; saving the thief is the first irreversible fork that forecloses mercenary indifference. Cost escalates from anonymity to self-incrimination. One minor slack: placard commands could carry sharper immediate stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reforge the bond or live with silence—is signaled early and tightens once: the bridge demands her human form. The price is visible the instant her bones loosen; escalation is single but sufficient under the lyric-accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—recover stolen maternal time—tightens when the tree demands reliving instead of theft; the pouch’s loosening is earned by the narrator’s renunciation of escape, a visible price that forecloses the easy grab-and-flee option.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—find a door that is not an airlock—tightens when the only key is admitting unforgiven cruelty. One meaningful deepening: shimmer map turns from archival clue to living silver thread, foreclosing the option to keep memories sealed. Cost is visible—oxygen lost while floating, psychic cost of naming shadows—but the external pressure plateaus after quilt completion; hatch yields almost immediately once tear is poured.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—what transformation feels like—tightens when the hush funnels her into the tube and the rope appears: safety versus staying to learn. The tremor and ash raise physical cost, forcing the choice to guide Toma by light rather than flee. Agency is present but slightly undercut by the hush’s vagueness; we never see her hesitate, only obey. Still, the final shared gathering of villagers shows the stake has moved from private texture to communal responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—silent liberation without detection—tightens once: when the shadow hits the third scratch, the protagonist’s option set narrows to irreversible complicity. Cost is legible: perpetual sentinel mask, empty Cradle, perpetual risk of discovery. Escalation is singular but sufficient for 700 words; no safety resets. Coincidence (city-wide blackout) complicates rather than resolves, serving as curtain, not deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—keep the promise to Lysa by decoding the dust—tightens when the helix predicts Marel’s arrival and the sea-door hour looms. One meaningful deepening: the rope’s reappearance shifts guilt from abstract to literal, forcing the choice between perpetual flight or teaching. Agency remains with Eren: each rock placement is a precognitive bet that narrows future options. Cost is visible—harness bruises, vial weight, and the final acceptance of lifelong stewardship.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—how to name unnameable scars without reproducing violence—tightens when each timed exposure forces the poet to literalize his own wound-making. Escalation is textural: each aborted plate adds density to the atlas of absences, reweighting the cost of speech versus silence. No coincidence; pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens. The final refusal to “fight the censors with louder speech” narrows options to silent light, price paid in the half-caught star image. Could edge higher if one plate had cracked or been ruined, materializing stakes more viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—control of the evacuation route—intensifies the instant Veller demands the card. Each parry narrows Lysander’s options: surrender the map or weaponize the duel to etch it into memory. The final pin forecloses Veller’s thefts and commits the city to an exodus; price is legible in the magistrate’s first forced steps. Escalation is singular but sufficient for the word count, and agency remains with Lysander throughout.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade>
    <comment>Theme of civil responsibility versus personal gain emerges through the anthem-turned-evacuation-route: civic art secretly prioritizes collective survival. Subtext lives in the duel’s courtesy—etiquette weaponized to serve a public good. Final image of Veller marching under guard embodies the cost of privatizing shared safety. No moralizing statement is needed; the routed song speaks louder than any thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“forge beauty from anarchy before it swallows the city”—tightens when riots lock the prison and Len must decide whether to risk the roofless library; the choice to nail OPEN to the doorframe forecloses anonymity. Price is legible: soot-man, nurse, teen arrive, Len’s privacy and safety gone, pamphlets nearly burned—felt cost scales to length.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can Lio release the frozen moment his wife left—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the flickering compasses literally point at him, forcing a choice: stay in the refuge loop or strike the goodbye chord that restarts external time. One meaningful escalation suffices: the needles’ frantic jerk toward the booth crystallizes pressure and the price of the exit chord is audible in the now-living clock. Agency is internal (musical decision) but it reconfigures the world’s temporal instruments, satisfying causality.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—cultural memory loss—tightens once: the monsoon mouth-storm threatens to “edit” reef-names overnight. The dream-map deepens knowledge, narrowing Tavo’s options from measurement to surrender; pouring his breath is the visible price that alters tactics. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—locate the color of unspoken apologies—signals early. Pressure tightens once when the compass swings toward the Wanderer, foreclosing the option to keep blaming the father. The pruning act pays the visible price (anger diffused, sea-glass hue). Under Accumulative lens, the lace-to-bonsai transfer reweights the stake without needing multiple reversals; cost is legible, holding high band.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding post-flood change through measurable means—is signaled early and deepens when Mara realizes “measurement itself was a story.” The meaningful tightening occurs when the dust spiral reveals hidden water damage, forcing action (sandbags, epoxy) that alters tactics. Agency is quiet but decisive: Mara chooses to trust irregular data, and that choice saves the greenhouse frame. Cost is felt in lost telescope time, redistributed grief, and the humility of learning from “dust”—a conceptual price that reweights her entire epistemology.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—truth versus silence—is signaled early and deepens when the protagonist chooses creation over accusation. Escalation is driven by agency: retracing the route, interpreting frost, forging glass. The cost is unmistakable—the bomb attempt, stolen artistry, moral burden—and culminates in a stance that forecloses easy justice for enduring witness. Coincidence never resolves; every insight is hard-won through skill and observation.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—making silence communicable—is signaled early and deepens when Mara reveals the system’s flaw. Orren’s agency drives escalation: he proposes calibration using body heat and memory, tested first on himself, then staff, then visitors. The cost is emotional labor and vulnerability; the child’s flinch risks collapse, but Orren steadies her. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, though the tightening lacks a single decisive narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—giving rest a permanent address—is signaled immediately and tightens when Marek learns the dead are drifting into oblivion. His agency drives escalation: choosing to enter, occupying impossible spaces, and reviving the receiver are all active renunciations of easier paths. The cost is unmistakable: physical trauma, temporal disorientation (catalog card dated ahead), and emotional burden (“pleading” taps). Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens—each plankton-lit shelf adds weight until the final stitch of light pulls bones home.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—sustaining dignity amid rationed humanity—is signaled early and deepens when the officer inspects the box. Amira’s agency drives escalation: she alters routes, invents thank-you letters, and redefines gratitude as public yet anonymous. Cost is unmistakable: sleepless nights, risk of arrest, elders walking alleys they once courted. The tightening forecloses open charity, forcing coded systems that carry emotional and logistical weight.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—where unused love resides—is signaled in the first paragraph and deepens via protagonist agency: Mara doesn’t wait for answers but actively experiments with breath and light. The tightening occurs when the pilgrim reframes healing as “letting light pass through,” forcing Mara to choose vulnerability over archival control. Cost is legible: releasing the knot behind her sternum requires emptying lungs “of pride,” a visceral forfeiture that alters her artistic purpose. Coincidence never resolves; the pilgrim complicates but doesn’t solve—Mara’s breath alone steadies the ember-face.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—calming the bridge without cutting it—is signaled early and deepens when the designer realizes preservation traps time. The meaningful tightening occurs when the protagonist chooses to let the photographs fade, accepting that memory must be sacrificed to free the woman and heal the bridge. This agency-driven escalation under the Accumulative lens carries unmistakable cost: loss of ancestral records, Lio’s voice vanishing, and the designer’s own map consumed. Pressure remains coherent from first vine to final dust.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—securing seeds against erasure—is signaled by line two (“frees what others forget to value”) and tightens when engines growl: Mara doesn’t flee but engineers delay, sacrificing speed for deception. Her agency drives escalation: false key arrangement, bench blockade, piano wedge—all born of “patiently strategic” trait with tactical cost (time, exposure). Militia’s arrival isn’t coincidence but consequence, and resolution hinges on her precise, earned choices under fire.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—capturing the sound of broken trust—is signaled early and deepens when Rell’s presence forces confrontation. Escalation is driven by Mara’s agency: collecting silences, building the aid, demanding testimony. The tightening occurs at the click—a stored absence rupturing narrative—and forecloses denial with visible cost (Rell’s confession, Mara’s burden). Coincidence never resolves; truth emerges from designed pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether to preserve or surrender a stolen portrait that controls another’s fate—is signaled early and tightens decisively at the door. The escalation is protagonist-driven: Lio’s discovery of the hand-drawn door on the portrait, then the moonbeam script revealing the binary choice. Cost is unmistakable: keeping the portrait vanishes “you”; returning it sacrifices Lio’s artistic identity. Coincidence (Nema’s ferns) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the final agency rests entirely on Lio’s tear.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—safe inquiry—is signaled early and deepens through Mara’s plan to build transparent rooms that expose surveillance. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: her narration evolves from coping mechanism to ritual of reclamation, culminating in silent creation. Cost is felt throughout (shame, exile, guilt) and crystallizes in the final image: vulnerability as deliberate architecture. One meaningful tightening suffices—her shift from performance to poised stillness forecloses retreat into silence.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming identity from erasure—is signaled early and deepens when the cipher reveals Mara listed as “asset.” Pressure tightens causally: each move (decryption, projection) narrows Vaughn’s control and raises personal risk. Protagonist agency drives escalation; coincidence never resolves. Cost is unmistakable: tears, trembling, public exposure—all paid before victory.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—mapping darkness to preserve orientation—is signaled early and deepens when Lyr reframes it as “distances between terrors.” The meaningful tightening occurs when the protagonist must describe soundless phenomena, narrowing his tools to bodily sensation and omission. Agency is maintained: he chooses to speak in omissions, trace the spiral, and begin the map. Cost is felt in the loss of the booklet’s gilding and the surrender of celestial reliance, though the storm’s resolution leans slightly atmospheric rather than fully causal—hence just below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.2)
    The dominant stake—finding the origin of thought—is signaled early and deepens through J-17’s agency: it chooses to play, then to stop, then to amalgamate only human moments. The hairline crack introduces irreversible cost, transforming loops from free exploration into sacrificial acts. Escalation is driven entirely by protagonist choice under the Accumulative lens, and the final trade-off—foregoing infinite knowledge for a single, witnessed present—is crystallized with visible price (the violin’s degradation) and moral weight (mercy over data).

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—restoring trust in a wordless world—is signaled early and tightens when the lens reveals hidden coordination, forcing Mara to choose between complicity or exposure. Her agency drives escalation: copying doodles, using the lens, confronting Eli. The cost is felt in her isolation (“fear... pressed her tongue”) and crystallizes in the ledger-signing—an irreversible forfeiture of protective anonymity. Coincidence complicates (shattered projector) but resolution stems from Mara’s choice to trust.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—proving gardens know their gardeners—is signaled early and deepens when Mera’s meter reveals luck punishes deceit. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he requests the night alone, stages his ritual, and confesses aloud—not for bureaucratic absolution but for the roots. The cost is legible: years of shame, back-shaking replanting, and the vulnerability of exposing private rites. Pressure tightens once, decisively, and the final image reweights truth as something grown, not reported.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—station integrity vs. temporal discovery—is signaled early and tightens when Mara sees the pre-broken rotor. Her agency drives escalation: she leverages holographic principles not for data but repair, altering tactics under pressure. Cost is unmistakable: she trades Sen’s theoretical breakthrough for physical safety, crystallizing her stance that tools demand responsibility—a trade-off with emotional and professional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reviving the house’s voice through Varga’s code—intensifies via Lena’s agency: each tap, breath, and stillness deepens her commitment and narrows options (e.g., choosing silence over sound). The single meaningful tightening occurs when she stops at the fermata, trusting stillness over action—a trade-off that unlocks the rehearsal room. Cost is felt in the physical labor of wading, climbing, and the emotional weight of playing amid ruin. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from her interpretation of stains and silence.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—“the weight of a swallowed truth”—is signaled early and deepens when the protagonist’s false reading is revealed as causal hinge. Escalation occurs through Mara’s method: she doesn’t extract confession but multiplies narratives, forcing the protagonist to relinquish singular certainty. The rescue finding Eli alive shifts stakes from survival to relational repair, making the lie’s emotional fallout the true burden. Cost is felt in “stiff shoulders” and the lingering auroral sorrow—forgiveness as weather front, not event.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—bearing witness to swallowed truth—tightens when the narrator chooses to retrieve and act on the badge. Agency is clear: turning the wheel opens the bay; reversing it seals accountability. Cost is felt in the physical heft of the tag and the burden of knowing. Escalation is driven by protagonist choices under a Causal lens, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—witnessing change without judgment—is signaled early and tested when the keeper resists documenting the refuge. Escalation occurs via deepening: silence evolves from passive backdrop to active “workshop” for remaking the self. Agency is renunciative but potent; he forecloses rescue to preserve observational purity. Cost surfaces when he returns to collapsed ceiling—decay demands acceptance, not repair.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reconnecting Mara to voice through shared ritual—is signaled early and deepens via Liora’s refusal to force sound. The eclipse tightens pressure (sharpened shadows, breath-holding), forcing Liora to lower volume until “leaves seemed to lean in,” a trade-off that risks losing connection. Agency lies in restraint: Liora’s choice to reveal the curl at totality carries visible cost (emotional exposure), and Mara’s hum emerges as earned response, not coincidence. Stakes remain viscerally felt, never abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving directional knowledge lost with dreams—is signaled early and deepens when Lysa discovers the diaries’ coordinated pattern. The meaningful tightening occurs when she reads the repeated plea: “Set the axis back,” only to realize restoration is impossible. This forces her renunciation (cataloging instead), which carries conceptual cost: accepting that memory must replace function. Escalation is driven entirely by Lysa’s agency—her probing, listening, turning pages—and the cost (irreversible loss of dream-anchored reality) is unmistakable in the closing lines.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—control over information flow—is signaled early and tightens when coded cookies reach “wrong hands.” Lian’s agency drives escalation: she redirects the beam, burns evidence, and uses terrain. Cost is unmistakable: loss of anonymity, risk of capture, and the moral burden of manipulating fate. The storm’s arrival tests her prophetic gift, forcing a shift from prediction to creation under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—whether the unknown must be conquered—is signaled early and tightened via Selo’s rhetorical pressure. Mara’s agency drives escalation: her breath matching cadence, eyelid flicker, then drawing the circle. Cost is felt in the parasite’s unraveling and her shivering aftermath. Under the Accumulative lens, each rhetorical device deepens the central tension without coincidence or soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reconciling chronological displacement—tightens when mapping fails until dawn forces a deepening: fragments, not full sentences, cross horizons. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing to write for the lake, not tourists, crystallizes stance. Cost is felt in exhaustion and the irreversible shift from retrieval to transmission. Coincidence (dawn) complicates but doesn’t resolve; alignment requires precise calibration.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—conquering the self-labyrinth—tightens when the tablet generates paths from Lysa’s fear, making avoidance literal corridors. Agency drives escalation: she tests branches, learns “fear always produced the widest branching,” and chooses endurance (staying) over escape. Cost is unmistakable: abandoning infinite selves to carry “proof” of exit. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens until the Charged Poise of kneeling reweights all options.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—defeating emotional numbness—is signaled early (“every lesson ended in the same blank stare”) and deepens when the filament reveals itself as a parasite feeding on sorrow. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to reverse the song, then scores the record, forcing the hush to “resist being unwound.” Cost is unmistakable: the cavern’s stolen care, the students’ vanished laughter, the Listener’s shuddering sigh—all paid before vibrancy returns. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; coincidence (the record turning alone) complicates but doesn’t resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—integrity vs. state-manipulated data—tightens when quarantine reveals fever-dumping scheme. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing lateral movement over bureau compliance, copying logs instead of direct rescue. Cost manifests in physical risk (patrols, barricades) and moral burden (knowing truth while others are deceived). Pressure coheres under causal lens until final reconfiguration where solitude becomes voluntary, not enforced.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—confronting grief through scent—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency: Lio chooses to bring the vial despite risk, then uncorks it deliberately. The tightening occurs when Dr. Vann reveals the vial contains his mother’s last greenhouse air, forcing Lio to trade aromatic caution for catalytic release. Cost is unmistakable: “every whiff of orange or loam dragged him back to the night his mother collapsed.” Coincidence (anonymous note) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from Lio’s measured breath into the mist.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—discovering time’s texture without sacrificing others’ hours—is signaled early and tightens at the grotto: map the beings (accelerate feeding) or trap them (halt discovery). The poet’s agency drives escalation; his slipknot solution deepens stakes by making redemption contingent on human choice (“recited the verse”). Cost is unmistakable: he forfeits personal temporal immersion to preserve others’ autonomy. Moral calculus sharpens the peak choice between competing goods—knowledge versus mercy—with no deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—finding beauty in the unfinished—is signaled early via the father’s bonfire maxim and intensified by the chronic hush. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to seek the knot’s origin, kneels, tells a story, and modulates pitch to loosen resistance. Cost is legible: her gift is a burden (“every step… private thunder”), and resolution demands sustained vulnerability. The tightening occurs when she shifts from carrying broken notes to actively unbinding silence—a renunciation of passive endurance for participatory care.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether Mira can offer real help through counterfeit means—is signaled early and tightens when static reveals Orin’s unspoken guilt. Her agency drives escalation: she abandons selling “bright counterfeit absolution” for bitter courage infused with her own shame. The cost is dual: Orin confronts his betrayal, and Mira risks emotional entanglement only to reassert professional boundaries via payment. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, deepening via sensory and moral density.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—making silent contribution visible—is signaled early and deepened when Mara proposes the reading series. Her agency drives escalation: she initiates contact, shares her locket story, and funds the plan. The cost is tangible (commission money, vulnerability) and reweights the final image: joy steadies only after witnessing the chain continue. Coincidence (misaddressed envelope) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution emerges from character choice under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—belonging through contribution—is signaled early and deepens when the tag’s true meaning emerges. Sava’s agency drives escalation: she initiates the search, leaves reed signs, interprets the kin map, and weaves the lattice. Cost is unmistakable: her loneliness has “an address,” and her dedication forecloses anonymity. The child’s prior death and winter’s return raise stakes without coincidence resolving them.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reaching the Echo-Forge before the Giant wakes—is signaled early and escalates via time-borrowing, which narrows options (must hide thefts in rhythmic gaps). Rin’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to steal seconds, stretch breath, and ultimately refuse resolution. Cost is unmistakable: the pendant remembers debt, and the final line shows her already counting repayment. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens—cadence fracture intensifies until it becomes tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—resolving ambiguous loss—is signaled by Orren’s vanished ladder and deepened when the glass eyes reveal a “third state.” Lysa’s agency drives escalation: she chooses proof over impulse, adjusts the eyes, sings the lullaby, builds the bridge. The cost is unmistakable: she accepts non-retrievability, foreclosing reunion but gaining a theorem of love beyond resolution. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, intensifying via sensory cadence (drops tapping triangles) rather than causal reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—being needed without being seen—tightens when the child’s cry demands response during blackout, forcing Lio to risk exposure. His agency drives escalation: he retrieves the fragment, caches it with instructions, and guides aid through infrastructure only he knows. Cost is felt (continued isolation) but not visibly paid in action; the “price” remains conceptual until the ending’s emotional payoff. Under Accumulative lens, this suffices, though a tangible forfeiture (e.g., losing a cache, damaging a route) would heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—maintaining observational distance vs. intimate entanglement—is signaled early (“boundaries between observer and subject”) and deepens when the leaf triggers physical change. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she resists (lists, scrubbing), then chooses release of control, altering tactics. Cost is legible: loss of professional detachment, bodily alienation (“nails darkened”), yet gain in perceptual fidelity. Coincidence (wind-blown leaf) complicates but doesn’t resolve; her choice to collaborate with vines earns the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—grief transformed into direction—is signaled early and tightens at the sinkhole: the protagonist must trade one brooch to keep the map. Agency drives escalation (lifting stones, pinning brooches), and Mara’s counter-demand raises moral cost. Under Accumulative pressure, the deepening comes via sensory accumulation (rain trails → rivulets → shining thread) culminating in a trade-off that forecloses reunion with his sister’s memory. Coincidence (storms unearthing the twin) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the choice remains human.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—making the unseen felt in daily life—is signaled immediately and escalates through Sera’s wish, which inadvertently summons a force that reframes “magic” as mutual recognition. The tightening occurs when the force chooses Lan, raising the cost from abstract longing to bodily invasion. Protagonist agency drives resolution: Sera sings plain truths, Lan confesses failures, and together they reconfigure the force’s hunger into harmony. Coincidence never resolves; instead, the cave’s established rules (intentions stored in shadows, pearl as amplifier) create coherent pressure that crystallizes stance without tidy victory—only earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reconstructing truth from state-enforced erasure—is signaled early and deepens through Mara’s method: staggered intervals force memory to “thaw in layers.” Agency drives escalation: her choice to space meetings narrows options (delaying closure) but enables richer recovery. Cost is unmistakable—Sorrel’s compliance shame, Ilven’s exile, slammed shutters—and culminates in the trumpet’s restoration as communal act, not individual triumph. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens; coincidence never resolves conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—facing unspoken truths—is signaled early and tightens when the punch demands honesty. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to speak her truth, foreclosing silence. Cost is felt in the flask’s absence and the admission’s vulnerability. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via pattern density (arrows, maps, punch clicks), not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—creating space for unprocessed grief—is signaled early and deepens when Leena arrives, forcing Mara to move from passive witnessing to active participation. The meaningful tightening occurs when Mara realizes the tile demands shared writing, foreclosing solitary skepticism; this renunciation carries cost (emotional spillage, blurred boundaries). Pressure coheres accumulatively: each transcription alters the square, aligning external phenomena (whale intervals) with internal states. Though coincidence introduces Leena, resolution stems from protagonist agency—Mara’s choice to offer the logbook—and the final image bears the weight of ongoing, unresolved sorrow.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—discovering what happens after goodbye—is signaled in paragraph two and deepens as the storm awakens the escondite’s mutiny. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: Ilias chooses to provoke the corridors, interpret the amulet’s hum, and ultimately surrender to its rewrite. The cost is unmistakable: immortality peels away, and he becomes “part of what remains.” Coincidence (the solar storm) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Ilias’s final act crystallizes his stance with irreversible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—truth as currency for safety—tightens decisively when agents arrive, forcing Mara to choose between Ivo’s lie and Sami’s verifiable facts. Escalation is driven by Mara’s agency: her “waiting actively” reshapes tactics (margin-writing), narrowing options until the affidavit becomes a live test. Cost is unmistakable: Ivo’s con collapses, and Mara’s relationship with him fractures irreparably.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving time’s textures against erasure—tightens when indoor hum proves insufficient, forcing Haru to seek “rougher grains” in the bonsai garden. His agency drives escalation: choosing to carry notepad uphill, then synthesizing lamp hum with natural sounds to intensify refraction. Cost is felt: invented histories require matching tangible textures (petals for romances), binding imagination to physical proof. Closure crystallizes stance—endurance through cataloging—foreclosing hope of literal return but affirming witnessed time.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming identity in a system designed to erase—is signaled immediately and deepens through the discovery of systemic solvent use. Protagonist agency drives escalation: he chooses to listen harder, follow tide clocks, pry open the container. The tightening occurs when he realizes his vanishing was bureaucratic, not accidental, foreclosing any hope of legal restoration. Cost is felt in the Earned Stasis of walking nameless yet alive, burdened by others’ erased lives.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—decoding the universal riddle through what’s forgotten—is signaled early and deepens when Eli realizes myths persist because people “close the book too quickly.” Pressure escalates texturally: each retelling alters the compass, tightening his understanding until the needle points upward, then vanishes. Cost is felt: he confronts painful memories (mother’s warning, professor’s mockery) and revises them not to erase but to hear honest gaps—a trade-off between factual truth and emotional reconciliation. Agency drives escalation; coincidence never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving Cadenza’s autonomy—is signaled early and tightens when privatizers arrive. Ira’s agency drives escalation: her graffiti system enables the reorganization that forces Vell’s hand. Cost is unmistakable: she risks her Council berth and endures exhaustion to protect her community. The single meaningful deepening—Old Majo’s stone revealing hidden seams—narrows options to covert action or surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving the last dark sky—tightens as dawn approaches, forcing Mara’s covert photography and Eli’s resigned endurance. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her iodine-clock strips structure the night’s rhythm, each message narrowing options (OPEN SHUTTER → change film → WAIT FOR HUSH). Cost is unmistakable: the sky’s surrender, Eli’s obsolete role, Mara’s shame at using the crater report as cover. Coincidence (capsule fragment) complicates but doesn’t resolve; closure arises from their shared witness.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—navigating the unseen—is signaled in the first paragraph and escalates via the drone’s failure. Lio’s agency drives every turn: he demands environmental conditions (open doors, poured water), shapes brass by spectral feedback, and translates chirps into bearing cues. Cost is immediate: the ship departs mid-repair, forcing calibration under live pressure. Fog isn’t just weather—it’s the antagonist that makes every choice irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—verifying the rivers’ origin—tightens when “Converge” implies geopolitical volatility. Riven’s agency drives escalation: interpreting condensation, choosing to trek north despite threat. The cost is palpable in his throat-tightening dread and the phrasebook’s “warning” dog-ear. Coincidence (Slate’s return) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution comes from Riven’s skilled observation and willingness to witness.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—restoring shared balance before collapse—is signaled early and escalates through protagonist agency: Sava’s walking, Mara’s joining, communal pacing. Pressure tightens when the governor’s decree looms; the final measure under the arch is a high-stakes crystallization. Cost is visible (bleeding soles) and conceptual (abandonment averted only through collective sonic labor). Coincidence never resolves; the carrier’s change stems directly from the townspeople’s earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—harnessing the ephemeral before air runs out—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency: Mara overrides instinct twice, each time deepening the hush and narrowing escape. The tightening occurs at the kelp knot: pulling worsens silence, forcing slowness that costs precious air. Final trade-off is unmistakable—she exchanges oxygen for resonance, breathing in remembrance to send a distress call made of memory. Coincidence never resolves; the temple’s mechanics respond only to her sacrificial gesture, making pressure coherent under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—finishing his father’s story without being heard—tightens when the lattice reveals keepers are “folded like paper inside the Fresnel lens,” forcing the choice: expose them (inviting chaos) or let the sea deliver them (preserving hush). The deepening occurs when he whispers his father’s warning into the lattice, transforming lie into ritual. Cost is visible: he accepts future accusations of delusion (“son of a liar manufacturing grief”) to protect the dead’s anonymity. Agency drives every escalation; coincidence never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—repaying a karmic debt—is signaled early and deepens through the bride’s cameo visits, each costing her “a century of rest.” The tightening occurs when Eli builds the resonator: a tactical shift that raises personal cost (his heartbeat as currency). Agency drives escalation—his choice to sing, not luck or coincidence—and the climax forces a trade-off: his name/soul for the valley’s survival. Cost is unmistakable in the “empty name” and tearful consumption of the pear.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—restoring reverence amid ruin—is signaled early and deepens when precedents break and lovers vanish. Ila’s agency drives escalation: she invents sleepwalking navigation, sews threads, laces nets. Each act forecloses old fear-based avoidance with felt cost (time, vulnerability, social risk). The smuggler’s unexplained apology shows stakes shifting through action, not coincidence, under an Accumulative lens where patterned ritual reclaims sacred space.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—restoring faith through interrupted labor—is signaled early and deepens when the tremor caves the trench, forcing Liora to confront her reliance on completion. Her agency drives escalation: she reframes work as wandering, rebuilds with orchard clay, reads the notebook aloud. Cost is unmistakable: the empty bier, stopped watch, and Father Sava’s fear of scandal demand endurance over triumph. Coincidence (the tremor) complicates but doesn’t resolve—resolution emerges from Liora’s choice to keep moving through detours.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—sending an untraceable letter—intensifies when ghost-notes reveal systemic interception, transforming a naming job into sabotage. Protagonist agency drives escalation: juxtaposing names → decoding chalk → guiding courier → inventing trap-pseudonym. Cost is unmistakable: the courier’s fear, the risk of entrapment, and the irreversible exposure of archival betrayal. Coincidence (child’s chalk) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from protagonist’s calibrated expertise under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preventing the coup by exposing hidden arms shipments—is signaled early and escalates via Liora’s agency: she doesn’t just decode errors, she engineers a trap using the orrery. The tightening occurs when beacon tones align with stitches, surfacing transmissions; this forces the high-stakes choice to send the chart to river printers. Cost is visible: Liora risks execution, yet endures by leveraging perceived foolishness. Pressure coheres causally—each move narrows options until the lieutenant’s badge lantern is deliberately misaligned, a tactical trade-off with social and physical risk.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming the pre-apology moment—is signaled early and deepens when spirits warn “DO NOT CHOOSE YET.” Mara’s agency drives escalation: she evokes the memory, tears old letters, writes new unsealed ones. Cost is unmistakable: blood from palm, three nights of exposure, emotional risk of brother’s return. Coincidence (Elias arriving) complicates but doesn’t resolve—Mara’s choice precedes his skiff.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preventing war via mistranslated grief—is signaled early and deepens when Lani decodes the map/time amid false-friend peril. Escalation is driven by her agency: she chooses to translate notes before answering the captain, then bridges frequencies using shared anxieties as tactical leverage. Cost is unmistakable: rifles are loaded, sleeplessness stiffens the captain, and Mako’s broken arm becomes the parchment for peace. The tightening forecloses ambush/revenge paths, replacing them with candlelit vigil—a trade-off paid in vulnerability, not victory.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—rediscovering joy through art—is signaled early and deepens when Mara shifts from seeking a relic to creating participatory light. Agency drives escalation: she aligns film/fragment, threads film into lamp, chooses public display. Cost is felt: relinquishing solitary authorship for fragile, ephemeral sharing. Coincidence (moths delivering clues) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Mara’s choices do.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.4)
    The dominant stake—whether to cling to certainty or embrace curiosity—is signaled early and tightens through each nested awakening. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to listen, to stop mid-stroke, to flick the nickel, to tap four times. Each act narrows options (e.g., dissolving only falsehoods) and deepens knowledge (revealing mirror-eyed singers). The cost is conceptual but legible: her identity as restorer must dissolve to see truth, crystallized in the final question—"What if the last layer is you?"—which reweights the entire endeavor.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving unmonetized thought—is signaled early and tightens when dreaming becomes taxable. Protagonist agency drives escalation: hosting the club, planting the seed, leading auditors into the butterfly room. Cost is visible (risk of seizure, loss of solitude) but could be sharper—auditors falter too easily, slightly softening pressure. Still, the deepening from private refuge to public network credibly narrows options under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—renewing the blossom armistice before war reignites—is signaled early and escalates coherently: plankton drought → lean seas → angry mouths → blackened lilies. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she deciphers the map, descends alone, tears the postcard. Cost is unmistakable: her sleepless years culminate in a sacrificial act (destroying Iren’s relic), and the peace demands ongoing tending (“watered with memory”). The tightening—from individual insomnia to communal survival—narrows options until only ritual action remains.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving names against erasure—is signaled early and tightens when the cracked chime stalls progress, forcing a perilous journey. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: they choose to enter the museum, steady themselves amid emotional traps, and retrieve the bamboo. Cost is unmistakable: each mute orchid embodies loss, and the repair exacts emotional labor (“unsaid goodbye had lodged”). The lens (Accumulative/Textural) supports this deepening without requiring causal reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—restoring trust through truth—tightens decisively when Mara risks reputation to confess via the codex’s symphony. The deepening occurs when the music exposes not just her lie but Ilyon’s complicity, raising relational cost. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her vow-keeping, note-sending, and quill-tracing narrow options until only shared vulnerability remains. The price—shame, exposed betrayal—is unmistakable in the discord that “stung each listener.”

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—harmonizing flood control with ecological need—is signaled early and tightens when the blank note reveals a third path. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she decodes, interprets, and advocates; Rolen’s confession raises emotional cost. The pulse gate isn’t compromise—it’s a technically superior solution that forecloses rigid sealing (which would crack the dam) and uncontrolled flooding (which endangers mills). Cost is legible: Rolen risks reputation, Mara stakes her credibility, and both factions surrender absolutism.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving lost songs versus risking exposure—is signaled early and deepens when Oren’s meteorite chip mirrors Mara’s, forcing a trust calculus. The tightening occurs in Mara’s beam-balancing metaphor made literal: she must choose between suspicion and need. Cost is unmistakable—sending birds could lead agents to singers—and agency lies entirely in her hands. Coincidence (matching stones) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the choice is hers alone, under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—discovering why thresholds feel sacred—is signaled early and deepens when Mira realizes distances are ethical lines, not physical ones. Escalation is driven by her agency: decoding the logbook, interrogating wood grain, waiting for wind alignment. The tightening occurs at the edge: she won’t jump until the distance becomes “an ethical line,” forcing renunciation of passive searching. Cost is visible in the corridor’s dissolution—no return—and conceptual in accepting her father’s absence as necessary space.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—rhythm of belonging—is signaled early and deepens when Mira traces algae currents as a “submerged zodiac.” Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: Mira chooses to open the terrarium, altering tactics and emotional stakes. Cost is unmistakable: Jonah risks reopening grief; Mira delays departure, trading professional duty for human connection. Sunrise isn’t just deadline but emotional threshold—crossed not by escape but shared presence.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—recovering vanished emotional routes—is signaled early and tightens when physical trails disappear. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: conjecture → seed-following → crater-glass reading → confrontation with Mira’s regret. Cost is unmistakable: Mira must publicly voice shame to restore connection. The geode’s “account-keeping” raises conceptual stakes without resolving via coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—serenading monotony with creativity—is tested when real danger interrupts performance, forcing Milo to trade artifice for action. The tightening occurs when footprints reveal a child in peril, foreclosing the planned comic escape and demanding immediate adaptation. Agency drives escalation: Milo doesn’t wait for rescue; he calculates, wedges, and raps with counted rhythm. Cost is felt in the mother’s panic and Milo’s surrender of control—he lets the rescue become the story, accepting that true serendipity includes suffering.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving unindexed memory—is signaled early and deepens when the moonstone speck reveals condensed nostalgia. Mira’s agency drives escalation: she chooses anchoring, then inscribes her arm, transforming restraint into fulcrum. The cost is felt: she trades freedom for permanence, and the garden’s lesson exacts time, pain, and irreversible commitment. Pressure tightens coherently under an Accumulative lens—each gap observed sharpens the verse’s necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving communal memory against commodification—is signaled early and deepens through Ilya’s noctilucent reckonings. Pressure escalates causally: notice posted → Ilya intervenes → inspector arrives → stone thrown → decision reversed. The tightening occurs when Ilya replaces prism glass with plain glass, narrowing options by rejecting spectacle for honesty. Cost is legible: the luxury marina plan is abandoned, but only after emotional labor and vulnerability from both men.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—whether to shield others from shame at the cost of truth—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Mara chooses confession. The escalation is protagonist-driven: her reflection isn’t passive musing but active reckoning that alters tactics (she shifts from concealment to teaching). Cost is unmistakable: “it had cost her the right to sleep,” and now she’ll lose professional integrity. Jonah’s parallel fear (“blinded him”) deepens the stake without diluting focus.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether hope can be engineered like lift—is signaled immediately and deepens through Mina’s escalating experiments. Each balloon cluster tightens options: first testing decoration, then accepting “sideways” units, finally encoding prime-number sequences. The cost is visible in her solitude, the town’s decay, and the risk of public failure; when people gather at dawn, their “unknotted” faces show what’s at stake emotionally. Agency drives escalation: Mina’s revisions (adding “divergence,” stitching sailcloth) directly enable the climax, with luck (“gust”) complicating but not resolving.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether to restore private grief as public heritage—is signaled early and deepens when drones demand a tourist installation. The tightening occurs when Liora realizes the Restoration Office seeks comfort, not truth, forcing her to choose between professional compliance and ancestral fidelity. Cost is visible: she submits a false structural report, sacrificing credibility to protect intimacy. Agency drives escalation—her tapping, reading, aligning—not coincidence. Moral calculus sharpens the peak choice: broadcasting pain vs. preserving it for those ready to listen.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.6)
    Stakes tighten decisively when the mirror reveals the binary: sister lives one day longer if the boy dies, or she lives fully if the heartbeat is returned. This deepening forces a moral calculus between two goods, driven entirely by protagonist agency—no coincidence resolves it. The “hush before bells ring” imposes a live clock that escalates pressure, culminating in the bell “gathering” breath as the narrator chooses. Cost is unmistakable: theft’s “ugly rhythm” versus honest pulse restored.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes—transforming performative peace into lived accountability—are signaled early and deepen through protagonist-driven escalation: Sera designs the ritual, demands sacrifices, and holds space for vows. The tightening occurs when Maro and Odran must argue details instead of denying humanity, narrowing their options. Cost is unmistakable: burned orders, surrendered medals, and Sera’s own map, all foreclosing paths to easy violence. Agency is clear in every turn, with coincidence absent and pressure coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving extinct birds’ echoes—is signaled early and tightens when the wafer cracks, foreclosing technological redemption. Inez’s agency drives escalation: she engineers the drought, walks barefoot, disables security, and ultimately chooses ritual over repair. Cost is unmistakable: the “ruined promise” of silence mirrors her manufactured droughts, and her whispered prayer admits irrevocable harm. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each sensory detail (hiss, wingbeats, snap) deepens the stakes until release becomes the only honest act.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—defying coerced conformity—is signaled early and deepens when Maris confronts her sister’s echo mid-unlocking. Her agency drives escalation: taking the governor’s arm, guiding him to the sanctuary, untangling threads with “gentleness.” Cost is unmistakable: emotional toll of her sister’s pledge striking “her ribs,” and the risk of exposure. The governor’s power is coherent pressure, not coincidence, and his defeat stems from Maris’s precise, bodily resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—ethical storytelling—is signaled early and tightened when Ilya realizes editing pain erases consent. His agency drives escalation: private reversal → public puppet show → contractual boundary → shared authorship. Each turn narrows options (he can no longer borrow voices freely) and exacts cost (loss of artistic control, vulnerability to Mara’s veto). The reversal structure makes harm visible, fulfilling the moral calculus without didacticism.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—guiding monarchs while honoring lost histories—is signaled early and deepens when the moth wing reveals past failure. Arin’s agency drives escalation: he replaces the broken frame with reeds that create “a living metronome,” directly confronting the “interrupted cadence” that doomed the 1952 beacon. Cost is unmistakable: his voice breaks under the weight of remembrance, and frames are built to fall, sacrificing permanence for fidelity to transience. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens—each added signal intensifies thematic and tactical commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving forgotten names—tightens when the Archivist tasks the protagonist with transcribing memory before ice claims it. Agency is clear: his gentleness with metal becomes the only viable method; rushing would “leave pits that cannot be polished away.” The meaningful deepening occurs when he maps rope knots to punched-card gaps, transforming personal guilt into communal restoration. Cost is felt: the bronze strip must survive “fire and flood,” implying future vulnerability, yet he accepts this burden to redeem his past omission.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—discovering why paths choose walkers—is signaled early and crystallizes under storm-pressure. Protagonist agency drives escalation: interpreting dreams, retrieving seal, offering blood. The tightening occurs when the directive decays into mold, forcing reliance on dream logic over institutional code. Cost is unmistakable: the protagonist surrenders self-direction to become a vessel (“walk until the walking walks you”), paid in bodily vulnerability and epistemic humility.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—sealing a covenant with the unknown—is signaled early and deepens when the tile’s vow demands faith expressed through arithmetic. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: testing numbers, waiting for Mars, placing the tile, snapping the stylus. Each act narrows options; the final cost (loss of certainty) is unmistakable. Coincidence (mason’s gift) complicates but does not resolve—the tile’s power is verified empirically before use.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—teaching resentment to release—is signaled early and deepens when the city’s hardest shift triggers panic, raising emotional stakes. Lio’s agency drives escalation: he opens the box despite risk, presses memory into brass, and shows empty hands. Cost is unmistakable: Mara’s lifelong reliance on anger as survival is rendered obsolete, and she endures the terror of disarmament. The sanctuary’s rules compound pressure—no sound, shifting walls—but resolution arises from character choice, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—capturing the runaway dream—is signaled early and deepens when Lio realizes force fails; the turning point (“he could not trap the dream by force”) shifts tactics to invitation, narrowing options under Accumulative pressure. Agency is clear: his synchronized breathing alters the environment, enabling the sextant’s function. Cost is felt in the surrender of control and the physical toll of all-night labor, culminating in the quiet price of carrying a restored orchard only in reflection while ruins remain.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming dignity through unlicensed care—is signaled early and deepens when the grandson demands help, forcing Mira to choose between principle and compassion. Her agency drives escalation: she improvises a repair despite having “no right,” and the cost is legible in her vulnerability (“the world wobbled”). Under an Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via object density (ribbon, lens, wax) rather than external antagonism, culminating in a trade-off: social exile for generational trust. Coincidence (finding the children) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the repair succeeds only through her skill.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—access to forbidden knowledge about nonlinear inheritance—tightens when Mara realizes carving the cameo could erase guilt by shifting it to unborn heirs. The deepening comes via protagonist agency: her inquiry ritual yields paradoxical evidence (measurements in her hand before taking them), leading to the bathroom epiphany. Cost is unmistakable: she must become the ancestor who perpetuates secrecy, sacrificing transparency for historical honesty. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens—each anomaly compounds until the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—rescuing trapped readers before loss becomes law—tightens when Orren reveals his missions always arrive “one day too late.” Lysa’s agency drives escalation: she renegotiates twice, using ledger gaps and the curator’s origin story to reconfigure power. Cost is unmistakable: readers regain speech but must finish stories elsewhere, implying ongoing labor; Orren bears new grammar as a compass-wound. The mountain’s maze-changing nature ensures stakes remain visceral, not abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—recapturing Lio by finding the garden of forgotten names—is signaled immediately and deepens when Mara realizes the garden is “not a place to reach but a plot to keep telling.” Escalation is driven by her agency: each narrated rescue tightens filaments, thins fog, and awakens lights, culminating in the greenhouse reveal. The trade-off is clear: certainty for motion, fixed memory for living story. Cost is unmistakable—she must weave others’ threads into a net, implying ongoing labor beyond this moment, and the ship’s direction remains bound to fog, denying full escape.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—confronting institutional forgetting—is signaled early and deepens when Mara learns the treaty traded land for scholarships. The tightening occurs when she must “merge” seal and rope, risking unknown consequences to restore truth. Cost is unmistakable: anger gives way to “steadier purpose” because forgetting harmed real people, and her solution (public reading) invites institutional backlash. Agency drives escalation—Mara’s archival skill enables the ritual, and her moral choice transforms private knowledge into public reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving the caves’ sonic integrity—is signaled early and deepens when Sava realizes the beings are refugees, not invaders. Escalation is driven by her agency: examining ice, entering the throat-cave, conjuring the “bloom of hush.” The meaningful tightening occurs when she redirects the beings’ hunger into the Forge, foreclosing the option of expulsion or destruction. Cost is unmistakable: she commits the sacred space permanently, altering how miners and pilgrims will interact with the caves forever. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, intensifying through sensory density rather than external threats.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—proving coincidences have meaning—is signaled early and tightens when the meteor shower yields the hush shard, transforming obsession into actionable method. Agency drives escalation: the custodian chooses to track stars, interpret echoes, and reassemble the prism. Coincidence complicates (sabotage whisper) but doesn’t resolve; resolution comes from his persistent labor. Cost is felt: years of solitude, the risk of renewed disappointment, and the emotional toll of retrocognitive overload sharpened by the hush.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving collective memory against erasure—is signaled early and deepens as solid fog threatens archival collapse. The archivist’s agency drives escalation: each pillar visited intensifies personal risk of identity loss, culminating in the high-stakes choice to embed their own memories as the Archive’s “spine.” Cost is unmistakable: “I was preemptively nostalgic for the person I would be before this work remade me.” The storm’s physical threat merges with existential stakes, and resolution arises solely from protagonist’s action under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—deflecting riot through art—tightens when the hidden map shifts Jorin’s goal from spectacle to subversion. Agency drives escalation: he chooses low bursts to disarm the council, then arrows to reveal the river gate. Cost is visible: workers clear rubble under cover of playful sparks, converting panic into purpose. Coincidence (the child’s note) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the solution requires Jorin’s craft and Mirel’s courage.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving observational integrity against institutional erasure—is signaled early and deepens when Mara chooses strategic adaptation over defiance. The single meaningful tightening occurs when she uses the cicada to foresee outcomes, shifting from passive chronicler to active negotiator. Cost is unmistakable: her maps may become museum relics, Iven faces public failure, and their shared world is physically altered. Agency drives escalation; coincidence never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—learning to inhabit silence instead of fearing enclosure—is signaled early and deepened through the inversion sequence. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to cross the rope web, deploy the breathing method, and collect the gilded hush. Cost is unmistakable: enduring vertigo, confronting argument-scorched vines, and relinquishing the safety of contracted perception. The inversion hour acts as a live clock, but the true pressure stems from internal resistance, coherently intensified under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether silence can comfort—is signaled early and escalates through Elias’s active stewardship: he doesn’t just observe noise but modulates it, catalyzing calm against wind’s “argument.” The tightening occurs when the storm glass clumps and he slows the car, narrowing options to preserve acoustic sanctuary. Cost is visible: his vigilance exacts constant attention; Mara’s release of her map signals surrender to his method. Agency drives every escalation under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—claiming or redefining the unclaimed throne—is signaled early and tightens at each turn: time pressure (“until sunrise”), physical risk (drones, waterfall), moral choice (lie or truth). Escalation is protagonist-driven: Ione’s decision to peel paint layers uncovers the gate; her refusal to lie crystallizes stance. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits power for witness, altering the city’s future without personal gain.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—surviving absence without suffocation—is signaled early and deepens when Lio’s shadow arrives choking on the threshold. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to open the door, expose scars, and re-strike the knocker, each act narrowing options (rebuilding a bridge only to let him leave). Cost is unmistakable: “the bridge she had burned rebuild itself not to return to the past, but to let him walk back to his life”—a trade-off that crystallizes her stance. Coincidence (ring rattling) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from her scar-linked method.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—translating pressure into diamonds to pay Old Sen’s debt—tightens decisively when Mara chooses truth over shortcut, then deepens when she invites others to “pour their pressures in together.” Agency drives escalation: her micro-choice to volunteer her memory dissolves predatory slogans; her decision to share the load collapses multiple futures into one braver town. Cost is unmistakable: the “ache of those parallel selves like pressure she could finally use.” Coincidence (glitchy texts) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the real work is Mara’s renunciation and endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—truth versus dynastic legacy—is signaled early and deepens when Nara’s confession reweights abdication from gesture to moral imperative. Leander’s agency drives escalation: intuition guides crank use, horn adjustment, book selection. Cost is unmistakable: he forfeits rule and redirects crown wealth, crystallizing stance under coherent pressure. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from his choices under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—capturing possibility before it vanishes—is signaled early and deepens when the marionette echoes his dead captain’s voice, raising emotional cost. Escalation is driven by Calven’s agency: each armor clasp released tightens pressure (greenhouse sighs, scent shifts) and narrows his path back to silence. The final choice—to unsnap the latch and accept the compass—forecloses his old life with conceptual cost (loss of order-sanctioned identity) and visible consequence (carrying night safely in closed armor). Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from his tactile engagement with ciphered patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—recovering erased kinship—is signaled early and deepens when the blank page reveals systemic omission. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she reads dust patterns, locates Cabinet H, cuts twine, handles fragile documents. Cost is legible in the sour smell of trauma and the weight of history; her choice to share only “just enough detail” with Josie reflects tactical restraint under emotional pressure. Coincidence (Josie’s request) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the work is done through Mara’s persistent attention.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—resisting erasure through tangible truth—is signaled early and tightens when the courier vanishes and Mara’s own existence is revised away. Her agency drives escalation: choosing to enter the booth, request coordinates, then pivot from smuggling to plate theft. The cost is felt in the ledger’s layers and the courier’s bound wrists. Coincidence complicates (the failed drop) but never resolves; all turns stem from Mara’s decisions under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—containing the prophecy before it fully infects the town—is signaled early and escalates as dew forms and drops accelerate. Lio’s agency drives deepening: each whispered step dismantles the code, narrowing options until only self-sacrifice remains. Cost is unmistakable: erasing his mother’s voice to save neighbors from sleepwalking oblivion. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—density of coded drips increases until his vested hush halts it.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—honoring the forgotten to prevent Veyroot’s fall—tightens decisively when “DESCEND” appears, foreclosing passive observation. Lio’s agency drives escalation: he decodes, builds monuments, breaches the vault. Cost is legible in foreman’s dismissal (social risk) and the elders’ blight-coverup (moral weight). The latch’s undoing crystallizes stance: memory as ballast outweighs institutional secrecy. Coincidence (leaf landing on THISTLE SUN jar) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the real work is Lio’s persistent prodding.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—navigating uncertainty versus false certainty—is signaled early (“every clock kept two times”) and tightens when Mara realizes coincidence has become pattern. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses to descend, to cross the waterfall, to bargain. The cost is conceptual but undeniable: abandoning the admiral’s demand for proof in favor of teaching him to “steer with doubt.” Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with each feather and chime deepening the central tension without reliance on external antagonism.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—redeeming Orin through the weight of names—is signaled early and deepens when Mara realizes resurrection is impossible, forcing a smaller, harder redemption. Her agency drives every escalation: sacrificing her name, confronting Ellis, retrieving the body. The cost—her own linguistic honesty, childhood memories—is paid before the final act and visibly alters her stance. Coincidence never resolves; pressure tightens via character choice under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—forgiveness through laughter—is signaled early and deepens when Elowen’s shame metastasizes into gorge-moaned choir. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses vulnerability (sharing the frog rhyme) over extraction, narrowing options to emotional risk. Cost is unmistakable: confessing her own desire to flee laboring mothers burns Mara’s chest, yet she persists. The gorge’s acoustic pressure crystallizes stance without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—discovering the mathematics of mercy—is signaled early and deepens through protagonist-driven acts: bracing, breathing, speaking. Escalation occurs via trauma-triggered memory flashes that narrow options (e.g., knee tremor → sequence → tribunal memory). The cost is unmistakable: enduring retraumatization to unlock truth, crystallized in the voice-shaking recitation. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—keeping the seam open long enough to recover names—is signaled early and tightens at dusk when the crack appears. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: examining portraits with the lens, tracing spirals, unfastening the hatch. Each choice narrows options (e.g., the darkening shard implies time running out) and carries cost—emotional (mother’s absence), physical (rusty latch older than bones), conceptual (risk of permanent archival erasure). Coincidence never resolves; intuition, taught and tested, does.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—discovering what ceilings hide—is signaled early and deepens when the technician realizes ceilings conceal not just mechanisms but stolen time and dignity. Escalation is driven by his agency: analyzing dust leads to the box, which summons ghosts who demand restitution. The cost is conceptual and emotional: he must carry the burden of memory without legal recourse, only ritual. Coincidence never resolves; thieves are backstory, not saviors. The fluorescent buzz dying off creates a live clock that heightens tension, forcing reliance on touch and ghostly guidance.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—stopping endless negotiation to reclaim Mara—is signaled early and tightens when spiral frost demands rupture. Lio’s agency drives escalation: he chooses destabilization (wrong letter, uncorking whisper) knowing it risks chaos. Cost is unmistakable: the library’s foundational agreements shudder, books reorder by desire, and he sacrifices systemic control for one frozen moment. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—density of slippage (flickering lights, leaning aisles) forces stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—how to treat the past—is signaled early and deepens when the shard’s lilies are contested. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: Len’s decision to cover mirrors creates the dark space for confession, which leads to joint action. The storm’s violence raises pressure, but resolution stems from their choice to project the map *through* visible time, not hide or claim it. Cost is clear: both abandon factional loyalty, risking irrelevance to prevent repeating “the old mistake.”

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming stolen light—is deepened when revealed as healing the Thief’s unnamed hollow, not defeating it. Ivo’s agency drives escalation: he chooses honest music over force, binds himself to truth, and tunes silence itself. Cost is unmistakable: the Covenant demands truth under penalty of rust, and the oathfern’s survival proves emotional risk was real. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from Ivo’s craft-based choices.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—finding where “explanations fail”—is signaled early and deepens when the compass reveals the factory’s true origin. Mara’s agency drives escalation: each psychometry reading narrows options until she must choose between collecting or consecrating. The cost is conceptual but undeniable: relinquishing the need to possess truth. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens—no coincidence, only layered revelation—and tightens at the lagoon where tools rust and needles spin.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—preventing sea wall collapse through human alignment—is signaled early and deepens via Mara’s realization that “words turn tribal” but her craft can “scaffold complexity.” Escalation is driven by her agency: lighting the lantern, interpreting symbols, carving offerings. Each projection interaction narrows options (e.g., learning sinkhole location) and imposes cost—her solitude, her role as mere artist. The calm gale within the slide versus present storm embodies the conceptual price of disconnection.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding why flowers bloom at night—is signaled early and deepens from curiosity to existential hunger after her mother’s death. Pressure escalates via environmental constraints (seasonal closure, sleet, cathedral hours) and knowledge gaps (sacristan’s indifference, fragmented postcards). The tightening occurs when Lina chooses solitude over explanation, waits for the “dawning hush,” and climbs alone—a renunciation of easy answers that forecloses haste. Cost is felt in the chill of the glass and the burden of inherited tenderness, though agency remains internal rather than confrontational.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—truth versus safety—is signaled early and deepens when Lila’s voice reveals deputies’ coercion. The archivist’s agency drives escalation: his decision to kneel and arrange debris triggers the cipher’s revelation. Cost is unmistakable: Lila’s trapped consciousness and the archivist’s vow to withhold names until consent foreclose easy resolution. Pressure coheres under Causal lens—one tightening (parley condition) forces a trade-off between recovery and respect.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—rebuilding meaning without miracles—is signaled early and tightens when Sen chooses soap over spells. The meaningful deepening occurs at the shrine: seeing the wished-upon coin triggers his plan, narrowing options from passive study to active making. Agency is consistent: each family’s return stems from Sen’s trades, not coincidence, and the bottle’s pulse rewards labor, not luck. Cost is felt in the woman’s exhaustion and the town’s prior abandonment; stakes remain viscerally grounded, never abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving emotional truth against institutional erasure—is signaled early and deepens when the lullaby reveals a live threat. Erem’s agency drives escalation: he doesn’t just hear prophecy, he reinterprets it as a vow and acts. The tightening occurs when he realizes ignorance fuels catastrophe, forcing him to breach Registry protocol. Cost is unmistakable: he risks credibility for unverifiable feeling, and the city’s salvation carries the “soft unease” of evidence-less faith.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—repaying stolen time through imposed order—is signaled early and tightens when Lio realizes seed work *is* payment. His agency drives escalation: sorting kernels triggers the spiral’s movement, reopening the door demands restored routines, and tipping the rye grain closes the corridor. Cost is unmistakable: the city’s hunger for randomness must be sated by human labor, and Lio accepts this burden permanently. Coincidence (hatchling’s return) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from his recalibrated understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—whether to blare or whisper a warning—tightens when the Office demands full siren at zero hour, forcing Maris to choose between compliance and her ethics. Her agency drives escalation: bolting sensors, rewiring the box, waiting for glue to dry. Cost is unmistakable: professional risk, institutional distrust, yet she endures it to protect the village’s capacity to hear real danger. The blue-front gale’s arrival validates her method, making the stakes visceral, not abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—finding strength in vulnerability—is signaled early and tightens when meteors point to the station, forcing Lio to act. His agency drives escalation: tracing arcs leads to discovery, which leads to communal practice. Cost is felt in the body (“tremor in their hands”) and social risk (inviting others into raw space). Coincidence (meteor paths converging) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Lio still chooses to descend and invite.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—honoring a tangled covenant with the dead—is signaled early and tightens when ghosts appear, demanding action beyond passive witnessing. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: her decision to read slips aloud transforms haunting into release. Each ghost’s departure narrows options until only Mara remains, raising emotional stakes. The cost—confronting survivor’s guilt—is crystallized in the final slip, making the resolution feel inevitable yet hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding time’s texture—is signaled immediately and escalates through Eli’s agency: he chooses to follow the tag, trade the urn shard, and accept timeless duty. The meaningful deepening occurs when Mara reveals grief’s weight as universal measure, transforming Eli’s personal loss into communal calibration. Cost is unmistakable: his borrowed year ends, leaving him “unmoored, unable to sense his pulse as a countdown.” Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each sensory detail (cracked teacup, ink-stained hands) tightens the thematic vise without false causality.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—validating beauty in incompleteness—is signaled early and deepened through three pressure points: the snapped string, the torn net, the soaked kite. Each escalation is driven by Rian’s agency (mending, harmonizing, stitching), not coincidence. Cost accumulates: time, emotional labor, the drake’s injury. The final act of releasing the feather embodies a trade-off—proof surrendered for empathy—under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—rewriting exclusionary sacred space into inclusive ecology—is signaled early and deepens when Mara discovers the pillars’ hidden script. Her agency drives escalation: she remolds paths despite pain, counters monks with diary evidence, and pries up flagstones. Cost is unmistakable: bodily decay, social friction, and the irreversible act of altering “sacred” trees. The tightening culminates in the gathering where each vow forecloses old habits (straight walls, eelgrass destruction, crab harassment).

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—understanding homecoming’s chemistry—is signaled early and deepens when the signal proves catalytic, not communicative. Protagonist agency drives escalation: listening unfiltered, scraping footprints, cracking the vial. Cost is visible—the council’s pilgrimage is exposed as manipulation, and the protagonist severs institutional trust. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each discovery intensifies the chemical imperative.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming battlefield through garden—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: he interprets gull calls, negotiates with memory-pressure, mixes ash and silt. The tightening occurs when he shifts from command to invitation, altering the terms of peace. Cost is unmistakable: he offers the dead a future tense, risking rejection, and works knee-deep in toxic water. Escalation is driven by his linguistic and ritual competence under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—truth versus survival—is signaled early (“truth always arrived with a smell first”) and deepens when Sera’s locket reveals council betrayal. Lio’s agency drives escalation: trading coils, decoding grooves, following Morrow into danger. Cost is unmistakable: exposure to warlord’s scouts, rupture with council, and the burden of broadcasting secrets. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from character choice under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—finding orientation amid blame and temporal fracture—tightens when the sketch reveals not error but motion, forcing reinterpretation. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing to trust the applique over senses, then acting on the revealed north. Cost is visible: isolation embraced, past identity shed. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each layer of perception deepens the central question without coincidence resolving it.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—amending failure through theft—tightens decisively when the board reveals Serren’s location, forcing the climactic choice. Protagonist agency drives escalation: swapping pieces, knocking out the Skywright, leaping into storm. Cost is visceral: physical peril and moral risk of breaking vows. The “cautious abandon” method crystallizes under pressure, narrowing options to one sacred gamble.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving truth against erasure—is signaled early and deepens when the archive must be unbound before midnight. Protagonist agency drives escalation: decoding gestures, walking the word, ripping bundles. Cost is unmistakable: imprisonment, performance of panic, loss of safety. The “benevolently ruthless” trade-off (sacrificing self to save testimony) crystallizes under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding home without erasing pain—is signaled immediately and deepens when the seer reveals the mountain trades memories for “gentler histories,” directly threatening the protagonist’s goal. The tightening occurs at the locked case: the stone demands a “true memory,” forcing a trade-off between safety and authenticity. Protagonist agency drives escalation (choosing to spill the raw goodbye), and the cost—reliving throat-shutting pain—is unmistakable in the stone’s hum and the mountain’s rumble.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—forgiving oneself through undoing a cruel logic—is signaled early and deepens when Mara recognizes the labyrinth mirrors her own pitiless strategy. Her agency drives escalation: each decoded move narrows options until the final gate demands not victory but surrender. The cost is unmistakable: she must relinquish the identity of winner to become healer, and the woven hush tightens physically when she speaks the sequence, proving stakes are viscerally felt. Coincidence never resolves; only her hard-won discernment does.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—forgiveness’s price—is signaled early and deepens when Mara trades art for justice. Protagonist agency drives escalation: impromptu poetry sessions reweight options, forcing the guilty man’s exposure. Cost is unmistakable: colorblindness crystallizes the trade-off. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each echoed stanza tightens the noose without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—conjuring meaning before oblivion—is signaled early and deepens through each dive into the Lung. Protagonist agency drives escalation: matching pockmarks yields tactical knowledge (gold-laced resin), turning regret into material resource. Cost is unmistakable: brother’s death, dissolving workshop, and the physical toll of breath-holding crystallize in the wrench dings and thumb gouge.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—fulfilling a private promise to anchor transient happiness—tightens when the cracked mirror makes time feel leaky, forcing action. The wrong turn escalates pressure not by coincidence but by Lio chasing a draft tied to memory (“crushed kelp and candle smoke”). Final cost is conceptual and emotional: he trades safe beauty for vulnerable presence, crystallized in his spoken vow. Agency drives every escalation; the cave doesn’t solve but demands revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—proving whispers outtravel shouts—is signaled early and deepens through protagonist agency: choosing scent over smoke, murmur over blast. The tightening forecloses Jonas’s foghorn identity with visible cost (his dented silence, bowed forehead). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves—only earned vibration through disciplined ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—navigating the geography of loss—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully: sinkholes swallow old routes, forcing lunar-adaptive paths. Protagonist agency drives escalation (building the armillary, plotting numbers, choosing to follow the censer’s pull). Cost is unmistakable: the narrator risks guiding people into unstable terrain based on cryptic calls and a relic’s intuition. Coincidence (the boy being Sera’s son) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the real resolution is the narrator’s commitment to the promise.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—psychological safety in a post-empathy world—is signaled by line three and tightens when the Ministry arrives. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she tests the eye, implements nightly councils, then orchestrates deception under threat. Each choice narrows options (truth vs. protection) with escalating cost. The patrol’s arrival isn’t coincidence but systemic pressure that forces her final trade-off: bury truth to save the vulnerable.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—decoding the stranger’s final gesture—is signaled early and deepens when the boutonniere’s “mountain coldness” implies hidden geography. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: Eamon’s gap-observing method narrows options until the alpine cord detail forces a physical search. Cost is felt in the clerk’s complicity (voicing the name) and Eamon’s reinforced isolation. Coincidence never resolves; the waterproof packet’s discovery stems directly from prior observation.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—claiming agency over one’s path—is signaled early (“sold other people's destinations, yet never chosen one that belonged to her”) and tightens when Ellis presents two passages with asymmetric costs. Mara’s choice forecloses inheritance and reconciliation, paying visible price (climbing through rising water). Escalation is protagonist-driven: she deciphers coordinates, follows ants, inserts chip—all actions narrowing options under environmental pressure. Coincidence (printer delivering box) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from her empirical intuition applied under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—whether to close the sky’s wound at cost of throne—is signaled early and deepens when the velvet voice offers the exchange. Maelin’s agency drives escalation: her shared exhale summons fireflies, her command stops Rovan, her climb down enacts irreversible choice. Cost is unmistakable: loss of power, exposure to curses, and the haunting “plainness” of post-sacrifice reality. One tightening suffices—the fissure’s ember ring flaring into a “crown-shaped” threat—and it perfectly braids external danger with internal conflict over legitimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving art’s integrity against commodification—is signaled early (“capture the density of presence”) and deepens when Toma reveals the Academy’s demand to “sell them as lamps.” Lio’s agency drives escalation: he chooses public release over private surrender, transforming stolen suns into protest. Cost is unmistakable: exile, loss of control, and the risk of Toma being deemed “unfit.” Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with each released sun narrowing retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—distilling chaos into narrative to survive temporal collapse—is signaled early and tightens when jealousy fails and gratitude breaks the loop. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: he chooses lucidity, seeks the grave, reinterprets threads of light. Cost is unmistakable: “jealousy returned anyway,” “calm that felt earned, not foretold.” Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies through layered dream logic until the final deepening reweights time itself.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—being seen without judgment—is signaled early via Aster’s note and deepens when Iris recognizes the screw’s “reddish tarnish only on one side.” The tightening occurs when Iris chooses to deliver the repair herself, foreclosing anonymity at personal risk. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her decision to reframe the screw’s meaning (“no tool is stronger than that”) forces the father’s shift from accusation to gratitude. Cost is felt in Iris’s “trembling calm”—steadiness paid for by vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—transforming trauma into legible craft—is signaled early and tightened by the held-breath deadline. Escalation is driven by Ila’s agency: she chooses to revisit superstition, add the forbidden fourth circle, and inscribe her scars. Cost is unmistakable: ink threatens to shatter, gusts press the platform, and emotional risk pulses in every stroke. The storm’s “single long note” isn’t resolution but earned interval—pressure reconfigured, not erased.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—delivering an apology that can’t undo harm but might redirect its echo—is signaled early and tightens when the orchard’s imminent destruction forces immediacy. Marin’s agency drives escalation: she doesn’t wait for a ghost but engineers contact via induced currents. Cost is unmistakable: blown fuses, cracked glass, and the knowledge that her correction won’t save every tree, only “what the trees had meant.”

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—resolving contradictions amid cosmic fog—is signaled early and tightens when the narrator chooses spiral arbitration over smashing mirrors. Agency drives escalation: each loop admits cost (“what it cost”) and narrows options toward unification. The hiccup isn’t resolved by luck but by the protagonist’s inward journey. Felt price is clear: surrendering comforting illusions to restore shared meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—measuring the sun’s first contact with the horizon—is immediately clear and tightens when ice disrupts flow and fog blurs the line. Ivar’s agency drives escalation: he chooses not to correct but to exaggerate the mantle clock’s error, transforming failure into inquiry. Cost is felt in the missed signal, the inspector’s arrival, and the irreversible drift between timepieces. Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens, deepening from technical crisis to philosophical stance.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether to expose hidden contamination—is signaled early via Lena’s gut flagging a pattern. The tightening occurs when she chooses to pulse the laser instead of confront, deepening into collaboration. Agency drives escalation: her firmware hack enables the audit team’s breakthrough. Cost is felt in her shattered loyalty and the irreversible release of sensor logs, which forecloses her prior silence.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—understanding the father’s double life without inheriting it—is signaled early and tightens through each scrawl interpreted. The daughter’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to traverse, to read, to exhibit, to carry the lantern back. Cost is unmistakable: emotional labor, confrontation with addiction’s logic, and the burden of reinterpretation. Coincidence never resolves; insight emerges solely from her disciplined attention under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether to remain hidden or risk connection—is signaled early and deepens when the unlisted caller confesses her planned departure, mirroring Mara’s own buried rupture with Lena. The escalation is driven by Mara’s agency: she chooses to ask for room details, plays the disc to “make words survivable,” and ultimately dials out—each act narrowing her escape routes. Cost is felt in the tightened loop and the vulnerability of speaking her name. Coincidence (wrong numbers) complicates but never resolves; resolution comes from Mara’s deliberate breach of protocol.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. civic erasure—is signaled early and deepens when Mara realizes the new covenant repeats old lies. Her agency drives escalation: she rewrites the preface, confronts officials, inserts Jun as witness. Cost is unmistakable—the town’s rehearsed lies collapse, forcing public accountability. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure tightens via sensory and moral density, not plot reversals, culminating in the tide’s “celebratory hush” that validates her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—curing contagious loneliness—is signaled early and deepens via the reciprocity rule, which narrows options: connection requires active kindness, not passive receipt. Protagonist agency drives escalation (initiating the chain: cigarette → mended coat → returned child), and cost is unmistakable in Mara’s dropped grin and the narrator’s forfeited solitude. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with each exchange raising emotional stakes until the rock’s cooling marks earned completion, not resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—navigating uncharted emotional depths—is signaled early and deepens when the ring spins “until the needle bit her skin,” forcing her past refuge into confrontation. Agency drives escalation: Iris chooses to dowse through bones, braiding notes with heartbeat-grammar into a lullaby. Cost is unmistakable: she absorbs her brother’s last panic, staggering under it, yet persists. The stillpoint isn’t escape but the place “where feeling stopped running”—a trade-off that forecloses denial with visceral price.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—editing history without erasure—is signaled early and deepens when the anomaly tightens and the vine-chirp returns. Escalation is driven by Mara’s agency: she chooses to revise not the vines but the prior moment of human neglect. Cost is felt in the lingering scars and the blank signature—proof that repair demands ongoing labor. Coincidence (the courier’s swap) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution comes through deliberate, contingent restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—being remembered—is signaled early and deepens when the foghorn fails, forcing urgent signing. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing to measure “angles of absence,” then offering silence as sheet music. Cost is felt in transient recognition (“eyes still slid away”) and the irreversible act of leaving the camera. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies through cadence shifts—from whisper to chord—and the stakes crystallize in the refrain that stitches brief recognitions.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—rescuing truth to fulfill Miko’s promise—tightens decisively when the vandalized portrait becomes a lock requiring her fragment, foreclosing retreat. Protagonist agency drives escalation: mapping signs, aligning spirals, scraping paint. The deepening occurs in the archive chamber where “BRING THE FIRE HERE” forces renunciation of arson for revelation. Cost is unmistakable: she copies the reel instead of burning it, trading catharsis for exposure, risking everything by carrying truth to the capital.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—breathing life into a shared dream—is signaled early and tightens when Sato reveals her own buried grief, transforming empathy into mutual resurrection. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: drumming summons memory-chords, which force Sato’s confession, which enables deeper entanglement. Cost is unmistakable: neural overload, institutional risk, and the ache of holding loss without resolution. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from deliberate taps and hums.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—proving whispers save lives—is signaled early and tested decisively at Pier Nine. Escalation is driven by Mara’s agency: she chooses to reveal the conduit, directs rescue via whispered relay, and endures professional extinction if wrong. Cost is unmistakable: risking her job, navigating crane collapse, and freeing the stevedore through coordinated silence. The geomagnetic storm tightens time and distorts tools, but resolution stems from Mara’s preparedness, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—bearing witness to hidden violence—is signaled early and deepens when the mirror reveals the drowned fisherman. The guardian’s agency (weaving shutters, adjusting angles) drives escalation, not coincidence; each pattern shift narrows options until the “help” code blinks back. Cost is visceral: blood, sobbing, the visible hand in weeds. Pressure tightens causally under an Accumulative lens—density of light, silence, and reflection reweights what can be unseen.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—saving the grove through non-confrontational resistance—is signaled early and deepens when Eli chooses collective art over protest. Escalation is driven by his agency: recruiting students, deploying displays, using the grotto’s natural rhythm. Cost is felt in time, secrecy, and emotional risk (facing the mayor). The council’s shift from irritation to curiosity shows coherent pressure under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—freedom vs. safety—is signaled early (“belonged to planks”) and tightens when Rusk admits chaining the island out of fear for his daughter. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing to dive, pressing scrimshaw into Rusk’s hand, using knife as lever. Cost is unmistakable: Rusk loses daily access to his daughter; narrator forfeits dock identity. The whale call deepens stakes by validating the daughter’s “truer language,” making detachment not rescue but recognition. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from character decisions under the Accord’s constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—cultivating lightness without lying—is signaled early and deepens when Orin’s past as a morale artist raises ethical stakes. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: she invites him, participates in chores-as-ritual, and chooses to release the bouquet. Cost is unmistakable: confronting state-enforced cruelty while accepting that healing offers no comfort, only reconfigured silence. The goat-kick spill functions as a micro-turn that permits laughter without resolving grief.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes are signaled early (“to stride through boundaries once thought sacred”) and deepen when Lira redefines the colonnade’s purpose from separating worlds to separating words. Her agency drives escalation: rewriting the decree disarms guards, paraphrasing carvings loosens stone, speaking her brother’s story summons his shadow. The cost—potential self-annihilation (“forget which side of life they belong to”)—is felt in Soren’s terror and the softening frame. Pressure coheres without coincidence; every turn stems from her poetic method.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—Mara’s quest for the reed tongue to access beauty in imperfection—is signaled early and escalates through two meaningful tightenings: first, Joren rejects her initial awakening as “common”; second, she counters with a portrait that exposes his hidden flaws, raising emotional stakes. Agency is clear: Mara engineers every turn through plant arrangements and visual rhetoric; Joren’s resistance stems from credible fear of artistic emptiness. The cost—his willingness to stop buying awakenings—is visible in his walk through the spiral, a physical enactment of surrender that fuels the final trade.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether connection can be manufactured or must be lived—is signaled early and deepens when Mara admits fear of hollowness in the artificial pilgrimage. The tightening occurs when they replace curated stories with public replies, raising stakes from aesthetic failure to civic honesty. Protagonist agency drives escalation: “I kept asking what comfort costs,” leading to the decisive choice to play raw archive during press walk. Cost is visible: potential loss of funding, exposure of Mara’s deceit, political backlash.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—whether meaning can be remade after total loss—is signaled early and deepens when Lysa arrives clutching withered basil. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to project the stencil, etch the ring, and align the telescope, each act narrowing options toward teaching rather than self-destruction. Cost is unmistakable: the “old hunger for oblivion” loosens only because she accepts artificial means (lab-grown opals, practiced smiles) as survival. Coincidence (Lysa finding the crane) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the work remains Mara’s.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—mapping cultural patterns instead of chasing profit—is signaled early and deepens when Aurel admits using the method to steer traders toward mutual aid.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—whether memory purifies or poisons—is signaled early and deepens when the protagonist learns Keth weaponized nostalgia as contagion. Escalation is driven by her agency: each irregular pagoda turn tightens the trap of predictability while risking emotional collapse. The meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes purification must be disorderly, forcing renunciation of habit, prayer, and breath control. Cost is unmistakable: inherited dread stripped away, innocence lost, and the burden of becoming the city’s new teacher—a price paid in tears absorbed by the archive.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving the shape of hope amid eroding dream integrity—is signaled early and deepens when Mara recognizes the shadow as collective unmoored longing. Her agency drives escalation: comparing footage reveals the abandoned anchoring rite, leading to her offering her unshared dusk. Cost is unmistakable: she sacrifices her most private memory and true name. The tightening forecloses easy fixes (purging files) and forces a trade-off between system efficiency and emotional truth.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—balancing self-respect and compassion—tightens decisively when Mara chooses *both* accountability and mercy. The call with Tessa deepens conflict by revealing shared fragility, raising emotional cost without resolving it neatly. Agency drives escalation: Mara’s list-making and vetted sanctuary transfer narrow paths while honoring complexity. Coincidence (Tessa’s number left behind) complicates but doesn’t solve; resolution stems from Mara’s calibrated choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—learning to read scars instead of closing them—is signaled early and deepens when the ivy reveals the scar is “a door.” Escalation is driven by Mara’s agency: she deliberately aggravates her wound, tunnels with a bread knife, follows plant whispers. Cost is visceral (stitches tearing, copper taste) and communal (neighborhood sickness). The displaced miracle isn’t just thematic—it concretely alters tactics, demanding physical excavation and public restitution.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—finding where unused love resides—is signaled early and deepens when Mara realizes it lives in “spaces people build to avoid speaking.” Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: touching film, projecting blankness, voicing torn letters. Cost is felt in vulnerability (reading aloud) and transformation (relabeling can). Though pressure remains internal, the tightening—from private obsession to shared ritual—narrows options meaningfully under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity—is signaled early and deepens when Sel hears the elders’ unspoken confession of control, hardening resolve. Escalation is driven by Sel’s agency: each traced meteor tugs “something under the stones,” culminating in the seventh mark unlocking the vault. Cost is legible: physical tremors, cold, and the risk of confronting systemic suppression. The Accumulative lens rewards density increase—the birch bark map’s spiral reweights the city’s silence into clamor.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving multiplicity against corporate collapse—is signaled early and tightens when auditors arrive with their “device.” The guard’s agency drives escalation: his wave-function charm splits him to act across divergences, each choice narrowing options (e.g., choosing to reroute crates *and* plant seeds *and* listen). Cost is unmistakable: his fractured lullaby voice and perpetual wakefulness are the price of holding midnight open. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens—density of possibilities increases until the auditors’ threat forces crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—rediscovering the mind’s wild frontier—is signaled early and tightens via translocations that force confrontation with avoided fears. Each morning’s new location narrows options: bridges demand balance, orchids expose vanity, the hinge demands surrender. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation—he feeds questions to bark-slots, places the gear under his tongue—making the final unraveling feel earned, not fated. Cost is palpable: the belief “I am only what others verify” must be shed like rust.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—retrieving the dog—is braided with the deeper need to reclaim unused courage, signaled early and intensified by the guides’ cryptic mission. Pressure escalates not through external obstacles but through accumulating symbolic weight: the vigil, the indirect routes, the fire’s coals syncing with the first yelp. Mara’s agency drives every turn—she chooses the dark descent, uses the punch to free the dog—and pays visible costs (exhaustion, fear, confronting past failures). Coincidence never resolves; the dog’s location is discovered only after earned traversal.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—whether enforced silence protects or harms—is signaled early and deepens when the bellhop learns muteness serves surveillance, not safety. His agency drives escalation: discovering the bolt, then the truth, then choosing to whisper despite “REMAIN.” The cost is unmistakable: personal peril for a single soft note, and the system’s indifference to suffering becomes the true antagonist. Pressure tightens coherently under the Causal lens, with each turn narrowing escape routes until only charged stillness remains.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—unmasking the pretender—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Orun copies the ledger as the library collapses, sacrificing preservation for truth. Agency drives escalation: his choices (dissolving pellet, sundering star) narrow options and raise cost. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from his archivist skill and moral clarity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—why paths disappear—intensifies through Mara’s monthly failures, culminating in the revelation that erasure is tactical conservation. Her agency drives escalation: she assembles evidence, waits for lunar alignment, risks fog navigation. Cost is palpable: she abandons truth-telling for encoded guidance, accepting that careless access scars reefs more than sea-level graphs show. The “periodically eternal” beacon schedule forces trade-offs between openness and protection.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reigniting rebellion through hidden resonance—is signaled early and deepens when Ilya decodes coordinates from star-hum alignment. Agency is clear: she chooses to transmit despite risk, narrowing options (exposure, failure). Cost is felt in trembling hands and existential doubt (“unsure whether rebellion could be more than wreckage”). Escalation is driven by her actions, not coincidence; the storm drums time but doesn’t resolve conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—whether destiny is implanted or chosen—is signaled early and tightens when the embryo’s imprinting rule raises stakes: first will sensed completes its programming. Nara’s agency drives escalation: she decodes the script, chooses the narrator as counterweight, and performs the unsealing. Cost is unmistakable: she risks creating another weapon, and her peace could collapse. Coincidence (storm, kite) complicates but doesn’t resolve—decoding requires plant collaboration and human intent.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—growing amid irreversible loss—is signaled early and deepened when the drone triggers Mina’s freeze. Her agency shines in the turn: she names the harm (“some sounds were not neutral”) and co-designs shelter with Dr. Harlow. The tightening forecloses avoidance; she must engage publicly with trauma. Cost is unmistakable: bodily panic, the crumpled photo’s creases like “ruined streets,” and the waterproof box burial marking absence without illusion. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each sensory layer reweights survival.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming artistic agency in a fragmented world—tightens when walls close in, forcing descent before the library crushes her. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she maps beams with twine, opens the trapdoor, weaves filaments into canvas. Cost is unmistakable: she abandons paint-only portraiture, embracing uncertainty (“accepting fracture”) to save her sister’s image. The “necessary darkness” isn’t avoided but entered, altering tactics irrevocably.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—unmasking who manipulates crisis—is signaled early and tightens when Keir discovers the Council’s obelisk. His agency drives escalation: he chooses to enter the ink, confront the device, and destroy it. Cost is unmistakable: the truth vanishes from paper, forcing reliance on tech-recorded proof. Pressure coheres under the Causal lens without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—whether to expose corruption at personal cost—is signaled early and tightens when the letter names a Council lover. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: she chooses scandal over quarantine, pairing the letter with patrol logs to maximize exposure. Cost is unmistakable: potential cryo imprisonment, Mara’s disgrace, and the Censor’s punitive naming. The Council’s arrival crystallizes pressure, forcing public reckoning—coincidence complicates (the letter’s discovery) but resolution stems solely from her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—continuity through chaos—is signaled early and deepens when militia arrives. Maris’s agency drives escalation: she disarms her father, kneels him into attention, and leverages the dome’s calm as defense. Cost is unmistakable: risk of death, betrayal of her father’s profession, exposure of Lio. The tightening (militia trucks → rifles on glass) forces a crystallized stance that reconfigures options without violence.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—catching Sileth’s echo—is signaled early and deepens into moral tension: the echo is “a lullaby with teeth,” demanding renunciation over capture. Rovan’s agency drives escalation: his silence voices absence, which triggers resonance, which snags a constellation, which fractures patterns. Cost is unmistakable—he abandons the spike (his only tool) and returns empty-handed, bearing only internalized burden. The tightening (from seeking echo to protecting chaos) narrows options: straight paths fail, only zigzag respect works.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. reputation—is signaled early and tightens when Celeste discovers the exposure-log contradiction. Her agency drives escalation: she tests Sato’s claim, inspects plates, and forces confession. The cost is conceptual (abandoning a planet story) and emotional (confronting her father’s legacy). Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from Celeste’s observant rigor under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (silencing guilt by retrieving the lost cry) intensifies through one meaningful deepening: the firmware’s revelation that unmet infant needs orbit unresolved. Lio’s agency drives escalation—he chooses to close shop, follow letters, ink his wrist—and each act forecloses retreat. Cost is unmistakable: his heartbeat as static proves he was always part of the cry’s distortion; apology spoken aloud risks reopening wounds. The fold’s arrival isn’t coincidence but earned pressure peak under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving meaning under state-mandated forgetting—tightens when the boy’s slip forces Inez to act. Her agency (interjecting via tile tap) deepens conflict: the teacher’s brittle control vs. emergent collective courage. Escalation is protagonist-driven; the “emergent hush” isn’t passive but cultivated through Inez’s sand patterns and tile use. Cost is felt in the teacher’s visible fear and the city’s relentless plaque-stripping outside—a conceptual price for resisting unlearning.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—renaming as resistance—is signaled early and deepened when the mosaic reveals the arsonist’s identity, forcing Lina’s crisis. Samir’s agency drives escalation: he chooses aberrant mercy over vengeance, then leverages the vision to extract labor, not blood. The cost is unmistakable: Lina must face kinship with horror; the boy endures public penance; Samir bears the burden of unflinching empathy. Pressure coheres under a Hybrid lens, tightening from observation to action without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—luring possibility from despair—is signaled early and deepens when Mara realizes Silas is trapped “forever one beat from the applause that would release him.” The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses to complete the trick, sacrificing her private grief (her father’s name) to generate collective sound. Agency drives escalation: her coin flip initiates echo production, which forces temporal convergence. Cost is unmistakable: she trades intimate memory for communal resonance, altering her relationship to loss.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—validating or protecting post-Shock sensitivity—is signaled early and escalates through Mara’s shift from observer to active collaborator. The meaningful deepening occurs when the lattice photograph proves Jory’s map is externalizable, transforming subjective tingles into objective data. Protagonist agency drives escalation: Mara devises the somatic test, hides photos, follows the route, and shares her protocol freely. Cost is unmistakable: legal jeopardy, memory erasure threats, and the sedative-laced recall all pressurize her final stance of open sharing over secrecy.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—becoming the voice of the unknown—tightens when the tide seals the exit, forcing reliance on the fossil’s heat. Escalation is driven by Mina’s agency: she chooses to follow the floating leaf into darkness, risking dissolution of self. The cost is conceptual (ceding human primacy) and emotional (abandoning the maternal relic), made undeniable when she sings the cave its name. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each thermal reading deepens the central mystery without false resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—ownership of memory and prophecy—is signaled early and deepens through Lysa’s cataloging, which narrows options from passive listening to active communal ritual. The foreman’s seizure attempt raises immediate pressure, forcing workers to close ranks—a credible escalation driven by protagonist agency. Cost is unmistakable: the vanished coat’s owner is named, implicating past violence, and the final plan requires abandoning livelihoods for justice.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—repairing broken courage—is signaled early and deepens when Elsi’s silence threatens three villages. Rina’s agency drives escalation: she chooses snow-coding over radio, uses solder to bridge circuits, and rubs salt on burns to steady herself. Cost is unmistakable: her betrayal still haunts her, Tomas is aged and limping, Elsi’s trauma is palpable. The tightening—enemy monitoring all frequencies—forces analog, ephemeral methods that raise stakes without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—restoring Mara—is signaled early and deepens when Rowan learns Senn traded her for office. The tightening occurs when Rowan imposes his condition: stripping the palimpsest to essence. Protagonist agency drives escalation; Senn’s confession is forced by Rowan’s method, not coincidence. Cost is felt in Rowan’s surrendered rage and Senn’s public repentance, both altering their futures. Pressure coheres under a Causal lens with one decisive turn.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding why places resist change—is signaled early and deepens when Galen realizes the oasis “stores every version of itself.” Pressure escalates through shadow splits and Sera’s dual states, culminating in his choice to rotate the lantern, which narrows infinite timelines to one. Cost is felt in the loss of preservation (combs to dust) and Sera’s acceptance of a single reality. Agency drives escalation: Galen’s sun-pattern method and “sharp gentleness” directly enable the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—safety through visibility—is signaled early and deepens when the rosebush dies, exposing her secret. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to help, climbs down, uses garden tools for surveillance. Cost is unmistakable: fear of exposure, physical risk at Pier Nine, emotional vulnerability with Jonas. The false bitting pattern discovery forces a trade-off between safety and truth, paid in real-time tension.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—translating isolation into independence—is signaled early and deepens when the sundial reveals names of extinct pairs, forcing confrontation with past complicity. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing to speak aloud rewrites the script into actionable instructions. Cost is unmistakable: abandoning perfect memory (“letting errors show”) to embrace fragile, mortal utility. Coincidence never resolves; the hum responds only to breath and speech.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—rejoining what pride tore apart—is signaled early (“endings had frayed”) and tightens when Arin appears, forcing the protagonist to choose between professional secrecy and personal honesty. Escalation is driven by agency: writing others’ letters deepens her awareness until she must write her own. Cost is felt in the unsent letter’s weight and the public exposure of private shame. Coincidence (Arin’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the resolution stems from her choice to read aloud.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—control over interpretation of cosmic signals—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency: Mara’s subsonic reply directly counters external pressures (manager, physics chair). The tightening occurs when the beacon shifts with human quarrels, forcing her to act before factions fracture further. Cost is unmistakable: she risks professional ruin, personal safety, and potential cosmic retaliation, yet chooses interference over silence or compliance, reweighting all options in the final standoff.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—retrieving the “vital key”—is signaled early and deepens into a conceptual revelation: the key is consent, not object. Protagonist agency drives every escalation: listening to organ notes, striking the compass, transfixing the lock with gaze. Cost is unmistakable: mentor’s imprisonment, personal terror overcome, irreversible reshaping of space. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies through patterned sensory input (organ chords, compass tremors) that narrows viable actions until the final spiral stair demands vocal restitution of erased places.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—awakening empathy in a town that looks away—is signaled early and deepened by the shredded file and judge’s silence. Protagonist agency drives escalation: drawing from opposites, confronting Maren, offering public memorial. Cost is felt in Maren’s confession and the implied social rupture. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without reliance on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—restoring Elias’s name—is signaled early and deepens when Mara realizes the sacrifice was voluntary, not cowardly. Pressure escalates causally: each discovery (journals, code, cemetery, nail) forecloses ignorance and forces higher-risk choices, culminating in the annex confrontation. The cost is felt: Mara must publicly challenge official history, risking professional credibility, and emotionally absorb the weight of generational erasure. Dr. Sato’s admission isn’t rescue but earned response to her agency—luck complicates (weather), never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—escaping the permanence of “never” after loss—is signaled early and deepens when the fiddler chooses to develop his own plate. Escalation is driven by agency: he follows numbers, reads the scaffold, uses the flake as tool. Cost is unmistakable: he trades legal identity for mosaic anonymity, surrendering his face to “deliberate forgetting.” The hitchhiker’s disappearance complicates but doesn’t resolve; the fiddler acts alone under coherent pressure shaped by grief and the promise of pixelated mercy.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=9.2)
    The dominant stake—escaping cyclical control—is signaled early (“why some paths circle back”) and deepens when real users are trapped. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: he tests loops via the train, decodes bills, and redesigns data with Mara. Cost is unmistakable: lawsuits, collapse, and the logistics giant’s shelving of their fix. The final turn—laying outward-pointing markers—is a renunciation that forecloses retreat into inherited patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—decoding before erasure—is clear by paragraph two and intensifies with Nera’s confession. The tightening occurs when the narrator enters the dream not just to translate but to witness, accepting emotional risk. Agency drives escalation: lucid dreaming becomes ritual co-witnessing. Cost is felt in tears, voice breaks, and the irreversible naming of fear—no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—uncovering what mirrors hide—is signaled early and deepens when Thalen realizes mirrors are “bait to make us look away from our missing.” The tightening occurs when he must choose: extract the twin violently or reverse the circles calmly. His agency drives escalation—rowing alone, descending, singing the war-chant—and each choice narrows options. Cost is unmistakable: the lake’s theft of lost things, the twin’s frozen breath, the conjurer’s humiliation—all paid before resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reuniting with her vanished mother via dream intersection—is signaled early and tightens when the visionary reveals the price: “offer a wound.” Lysa’s agency drives escalation: she rolls up her sleeve, presses scar to sprig, bleeds on the seal. Cost is unmistakable: pain “like a small private eclipse,” then communal suffering as linked dreamers’ wounds align. The covenant’s failure isn’t resolved by luck but by Lysa’s deliberate sacrifice, foreclosing passive hope for active repair.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving Jory’s soul without harming others—is signaled early and deepens when Vey offers a cruel alternative. Mira’s agency drives escalation: she rejects theft, demands to see the knot, and proposes a self-wounding renewal. The tightening occurs when she lifts the lantern to expose the frayed thread, forcing Vey’s hand. Cost is unmistakable: her forfeited joy becomes compounded by eternal recall of pain, crystallized in the final line about “holes she had feared [becoming] seams she could live with.”

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming purpose after public failure and private grief—is signaled early and deepens when the grille cloth triggers memory. The tightening occurs when he chooses empathy over expertise, drafting a report that centers human resonance. Agency drives escalation: his decision to investigate the cloth’s origin, then share its story, forecloses his retreat into fact-based detachment. Cost is felt in his relinquished identity as infallible appraiser.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—understanding transition without owning it—tightens when the seed pulses with Mara’s rhythm, tempting Nerin to chase warmth. His agency drives escalation: wiring the seed, speaking her name, sketching the arc, then choosing release. The arbor’s warning (“held too tightly becomes noise”) forces a trade-off between comprehension and sanity, crystallizing stakes under Accumulative pressure. Cost is unmistakable: he forfeits intimate connection to preserve truth, paying with enduring solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving meaning in a futureless world—is signaled immediately and escalates through the librarian’s agency: first cataloging wonders, then fishing lost identities from tides, finally forging blank bookmarks to seed new selves. Each act deepens pressure under the Accumulative lens; the cost is legible in the librarian’s eroded memory (“new moon had eaten that part of me”). The climax crystallizes when they accept a bestowed name, foreclosing recovery of their original self while enabling communal resilience. Coincidence never resolves tension; all progression stems from character-driven ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—certifying physical safety vs. enabling communal healing—is signaled early and deepens when Mara chooses truth over protocol. The tightening occurs in the cave: each confession raises emotional stakes, culminating in the widower’s wife’s last request. Mara’s agency drives escalation (she initiates reading, requests the pearl), and the cost—professional noncompliance—is felt in the final act. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: density of hope intensifies until radiance spills outward.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness through truth—is signaled early and deepened via the graffiti’s challenge (“START WHERE YOU LIED”), which forces the protagonist to confront his skipped inspection. Escalation is driven by his agency: choosing to follow the tunnel, play the accordion, verify the grid, and finally report the fault. Cost is unmistakable: enduring raw memory without medication, re-living his brother’s death, and publicly owning his error. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens—each sensory detail tightens the moral vise until action becomes inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—recovering swallowed words—is signaled early and deepens via the cipher’s revelation that the thief was himself. Pressure escalates through the watch’s erratic timekeeping, which forces embodied navigation (backward steps) and cognitive labor (decoding lags). The meaningful tightening occurs when he realizes the library returns only what is measured honestly—raising the cost from effort to vulnerability. Agency drives every escalation; coincidence never resolves conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. state myth—is signaled early and deepens when Liora learns the violin’s natural origin and the orchards’ fate. Escalation is driven by her agency: reading stains, consulting plants, rerouting the relic. Cost is unmistakable: Sorell’s isolation, her professional ruin, the empire’s thwarted consecration. The “perforated destiny” isn’t passive—it demands active patching through sacrifice, making stakes visceral and morally complex.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving the “last spark” before oblivion—tightens when Orin’s lucid watchfulness proves temporary, forcing Mara to choose between hoarding or releasing the captured light. Her agency drives escalation: reading static, counting crackles, tucking memories into brightness. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits any illusion of retrieval, accepting only farewell. Under Accumulative lens, pressure crescendos via sensory density (crackle → corridor → sigh of light) until stance crystallizes.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—where to find contentment after forgiveness—is signaled immediately and deepens when the grotto reveals emptiness as furrow, not void. Escalation is driven by Mara’s agency: she climbs, unlocks, scallops, offers, and chooses work over waiting. The cost is felt in the brother’s guilt and Mara’s surrender of the hairpin, a maternal heirloom now composted into future growth. Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens: each sensory detail tightens the thematic coil until the final decision crystallizes.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether to trade truth for comfort—is signaled early and deepens when the chimes warn “do not trust your certainty.” Mara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses vulnerability over weaponized detachment, foreclosing the path of easy conscience-for-hire. The cost is legible in her final posture—carrying the cloak, not selling a lie—and in Sile’s flinch-turned-loosening, which shows shared burden without resolution. Pressure tightens once, decisively, via the chimes’ triad, and never dissipates.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—learning to vanish to appear—is signaled early and deepens when Sato reveals his own erasure. Pressure escalates through embodied constraints: language loss forces urgency, magnetism tugs at jacket buttons, ripples dictate timing. The tightening occurs when Sato disappears mid-cave, forcing the narrator to internalize the lesson without guidance. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: truth must be carried alone, and mastery requires accepting irreversible loss of the teacher.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—learning to navigate without moving—is signaled in paragraph one and deepens when the wandering pulse appears. Oren’s agency drives escalation: he doesn’t chase the pulse but tunes to it, narrowing options from physical pursuit to harmonic alignment. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: he foregoes tangible travel for an invisible, fragile resonance. The flock’s split/rejoin is coincidence that complicates, not resolves—the real turn comes from his choice to stay still.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming sacred making from automation—is signaled early and deepens when Davin discards his harness, choosing vulnerability over utility. The automaton’s arrival raises stakes without coincidence; its polite arithmetic clashes with the folly’s silent ethics. Davin’s agency drives escalation: mist walking, stepping into air, arranging petals. Cost is legible—his empty hands symbolize both loss and liberation, foreclosing any return to guild validation.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—discovering sound’s color—is signaled early and deepens when the Meridian’s library reframes it as an act of listening, not acquisition. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing to descend, insert the tag, speak the vow. Cost is unmistakable—depleting air while festival cheers fade—and tightens options: he can’t stay, yet carries the covenant forward. The “meteor hush” isn’t passive backdrop; it’s the pressure chamber forcing stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—wavelength alignment with purpose—is signaled early and deepens when the backwards prophecy personalizes the choice. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she splits the dish against engineering resistance, paying visible costs (strain, power loss). The tightening forecloses the binary (core vs. rim), forcing a third way with tangible risk. Pressure remains coherent under an Accumulative lens, culminating in Charged Poise at transmission.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—giving names to nameless fears—is signaled early and deepens as each cylinder forces a naming act that softens terror. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing which voices to crystallize, how to angle light, whom to honor. Each naming exacts emotional cost (chest loosening, iron-taste of lost love) and forecloses anonymity, tightening the moral imperative. Coincidence (wrecked lifeboat) introduces material but resolution is earned through ritualized attention.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—righting cosmic imbalance via unrung sound—is clear early. Pressure tightens when doubt (steward’s laugh) threatens Evin’s brittle resolve, yet he completes the ritual. The cost is emotional vulnerability and social ridicule, made tangible in his wavering. Escalation is subtle but coherent under Accumulative lens: silence → drip → breath → ring → answer.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—truth versus institutional silence—is signaled early and deepens when photographs reveal her father’s complicity. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to follow the label, confront memory, and speak publicly, each act narrowing her path back to complicity. Cost is felt in the loss of paternal myth and professional safety. Coincidence (finding the label) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from her renunciation of expungement, crystallizing under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—proving the world is readable as formula—deepens when Liora realizes understanding requires wonder, not just proof. The meaningful tightening occurs when she abandons rigid rules to watch the starlings, foreclosing her prior method with visible cost: risking failure before the council. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens—each sensory and emotional layer intensifies until the crucible moment. Agency is clear: her choice to trust intuition, not luck, resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving airborne trust amid cargo sabotage—is signaled early and tightens when the impostor’s voice fractures pattern. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: he revises coordinates *and* pings real Nine, forcing confrontation. Cost is felt in the clerk’s shock, Nine’s loosened shoulders, and the watcher’s solitary dawn vigil. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure intensifies through auditory precision (pauses, breaths), culminating in a trade-off: truth spoken publicly restores trust but isolates the speaker anew.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—personhood amid erasure—is signaled early and tightens when the Custodians arrive with the jar. Protagonist agency drives escalation: not fighting but inviting, not dominating but surrendering. The deepening comes via complementary opposites, which reframe conflict itself. Cost is unmistakable: numbness cracking only after shared breath forces vulnerability on all parties.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—safeguarding space for messy innovation—is signaled early and tested when OrthoGen offers control disguised as partnership. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she investigates, builds a counter-trap, and forces a moral test on her visitor. The tightening occurs when she chooses pedagogy over profit, narrowing her future options (no corporate buyout, continued financial precarity). Cost is legible in the agent’s “wet eyes” and Mara’s reset locks—a quiet but real forfeiture of security.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—restoring lost laughter—is signaled early and deepens through Bram’s escalating ritual: from conducting machines to macerating trash into pulp. His agency drives escalation; each pull on the cord tightens pressure until the tunnel “beats like a heart.” Cost is unmistakable: his silent isolation, the family’s stranded grief, and the risk of failure (“afraid to look back”). The climax isn’t luck—it’s earned by his stubborn, superstitious labor under coherent, accumulating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—relieving dimensional homesickness through the pendant—is signaled early and deepens when the guardian reveals its cultic misuse. The tightening occurs at the climax: the pendant brightens, threatening to command the boundary, and the protagonist’s agency (“asked him to wait with me at the edge”) forces a trade-off between escape and ethical restraint. Cost is unmistakable: both characters forgo their impossible homes to preserve the integrity of the threshold. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, intensifying through textual density, not external threat.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—breaking the mold of destiny—is signaled early and deepens when Jun appears, forcing Mara to articulate her rebellion. Pressure escalates through protagonist agency: she chooses incremental change over grand transmutation, files the hook, directs Jun’s hammer strikes. Cost is unmistakable: fear of punishment, the boiling-flask tension of obedience, and the irreversible burning of charter seals. The tightening forecloses passive compliance, making new channels for molten streams both literal and metaphorical.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—salvaging meaning before erasure—is signaled early and deepens when static yields a pulse that redefines rebuilding. Escalation is driven by Mara’s agency: discarding assumptions, tuning past expected frequencies. The meaningful tightening occurs when she follows the gap in the signal, risking irrelevance for revelation. Cost is felt in labor (“sore hands”) and structural loss (the mast), though the story avoids visceral peril; stakes remain intellectual/spiritual, which fits the Accumulative lens but slightly limits pressure intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preventing solitary vanishing—is signaled by Lina’s opening vigilance and deepens when she chooses to merge timelines rather than merely stop disappearances. Escalation is driven by her agency: tracing patterns, staying aboard, aiming for the grotto, then radioing in code. Cost is unmistakable: she shoulders perpetual responsibility (“ready for the next crossing in whatever now was”) and abandons hope of personal resolution. The “permanent transient” ache crystallizes into earned endurance with tangible emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—discovering connection’s texture—is signaled early and deepens through the protagonist’s agency: weaving, tightening, then erupting the maze. Each escalation narrows options (loss of exit, altered memories) and raises conceptual cost. The eruption isn’t coincidence but a structural solution born of rational enchantment’s failure. Final lattice maps strangers’ recognition, making the price of connection (shared memory installation) unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—navigating without sonar—is signaled early and tightens when the alien probe offers no map, only light lattices. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she initiates decoding with Jae, requests the ascent, and executes edge geometry under real pressure (council’s distrust, guards’ watchfulness). Cost is unmistakable: the ascent risks violating communal mourning, and success brings grief-wonder braided together—knowledge that expands possibility but severs Pelagia’s insular safety. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from Mara’s choices under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—protecting the vulnerable from grief’s predatory recursion—is signaled early and tightens when Mara recognizes herself in the photo. The escalation is driven by her agency: she traces pulses, intervenes via naming lineage, and revises the dead’s message. Cost is unmistakable: she reopens her own wound to save Eli. Coincidence (Eli finding the photo) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the resolution comes from Mara’s causal chain of tracing.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—restoring Ken’s voice before the tide returns—is signaled early and tightens via the narrowing tidal window and physical collapse. Escalation is driven by Mara’s agency: she powers the coil, endures the passage, and executes the repair. Cost is unmistakable: bodily terror, emotional exposure to Ken’s ghost, and the risk of becoming “just another unremembered name.” Phase transitions aren’t gimmick but necessary, costly means under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—being recognized as alive—tightens when Mara spills ink without thinking, surrendering control to embrace failure’s wisdom. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her spiral drawing enables Lyle’s defragmentation, which rewrites the ledger. Cost is unmistakable: she trades obsessive counting (a shield against loss) for vulnerability. The shard’s crack becomes the blueprint for repair—a deepening that narrows options to one resonant act.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving Vey’s tactile semantics as audible resonance—is signaled early and deepens when Toma loses the velvet/bark distinction. Ilen’s agency drives escalation: he doesn’t wait for death but actively harnesses the canyon, birds, and diamond, each choice narrowing options (e.g., surrendering natural speech for avian-conducted whispers). The cost is unmistakable: the diamond’s hunger threatens total erasure, and Toma’s death triggers chaotic echoes only resolved through Ilen’s bodily sacrifice (scraping bone as tuning fork). Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—preserving Jonas’s humanity against gravitational dissolution—is signaled early and deepens when he confesses his metamorphosis. Pressure escalates through protagonist agency: Mara chooses to reveal her identity, then participates in the ritual, planting the arrowhead as counterweight. The “gravitationally playful” anomaly isn’t just atmosphere—it forces concrete trade-offs (luring Jonas with chamomile, risking exposure). Cost is unmistakable: Jonas sweats through transformation reversal, and Mara abandons scientific validation for poetic record, altering her professional trajectory permanently.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming organic beauty from mechanized control—is signaled early and deepens when Lio confronts catalogued roots stamped PROPERTY, raising emotional and thematic cost. Escalation is driven by Lio’s agency: he shifts from passive performance (sky-bridge) to active signaling (heart rhythms), then co-creation (playing the tree). The living statues’ hesitation and eventual softening prove pressure tightens via rhythm, not force. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from Lio’s embodied tactics under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—delivering unvalued human correspondence—intensifies when Nela’s plea merges with misdirected envelopes. Ivo’s agency drives escalation: he links absences, blocks the stairwell, uncorks the storm, negotiates drone repurposing. Cost is unmistakable: risking treason, relying on smugglers, accepting that healing means “delivering what was owed,” not undoing harm. Pressure coheres under causal lens—each tightening (disappeared addresses → vanished block → Mendery location) narrows options until only one flight remains possible.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—interpreting silence as possibility—is signaled early and deepens when the halo fragment hums “without sound,” forcing Rowan to trust tactile intuition over hearing. The tightening occurs at the junction: EXIT vs. darkness, where his “quietly persistent” trait forecloses safety for discovery. Cost is unmistakable—he risks disorientation for water, then spends that water to loosen the hush, enabling song. Agency drives escalation: his choices (take shard, enter dark car, touch fragment to wound) narrow options while expanding meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—finding where stories live—is signaled early and deepens into facilitating others’ access, with clear cost: Mara’s solitude transforms into quiet custodianship, foreclosing private obsession. Escalation is driven by her agency (plotting triangles, following computed lines), not coincidence. The tightening occurs when she shifts from personal discovery (“wondered where the stories went”) to communal guidance (“began guiding people toward it”). Final cost is felt in her contentment with indirect impact—a renunciation of ownership for connection.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—capturing the runaway dream—is signaled early and tightens when the silhouette appears, forcing Mina to vitalize the cipher. Escalation is driven by her agency: rushing prints, scraping light, photographing the cipher within sunrise. Cost is unmistakable: she must release the dream to reclaim agency, crystallized in photographing its departure. Coincidence (the flaw in the photo) complicates but doesn’t resolve—her choice to shoot absence does.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—freeing an idea imprisoned by fear—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the pool reveals the moment “my throat became a gate.” Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing to descend, offering hair, naming Altair. Cost is unmistakable: vulnerability replaces self-protective silence, and the warning that “freed ideas still face weather” implies ongoing risk. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each sensory and symbolic layer deepens the central conflict without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake (recovering stolen memories) tightens when Lissa realizes the mushroom ring is a latch, not a warning—a deepening that forces her to break her last protective habit. Agency drives escalation: her dive, lantern tilt, and mushroom-plucking are all active choices under the Accumulative lens, each narrowing options (e.g., choosing feeling over cataloging). Cost is unmistakable: “decades of blankness folded back” implies the pain of regained loss, and her annual returns show enduring commitment. Coincidence (sailor’s tip) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the real work is hers alone.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.2)
    The dominant stake—reversing exile through resilience—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency: Mara’s shaky annotations gradually straighten the shadow, narrowing failure’s path. The tribunal’s offstage presence exerts coherent pressure, and the cost (permanent exile if she fails) sharpens every choice. Escalation culminates in a trade-off: steadying her hand risks revealing fear, yet that vulnerability becomes the hinge of success.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder through care—is signaled early and tightens when the narrator’s gray creativity reveals its source: stolen blue from Nela’s illness. The escalation is protagonist-driven: admitting fear permits the ritual, which demands essence sacrifice. Cost is unmistakable—the BLUEBELL jar is emptied, Soren’s hands are nicked, and the orchard’s luminous state depends on pruning bruised limbs. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from character choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—grounding spirits by freeing the storm-spirit—is signaled early and deepens when the protagonist learns the spirit is their ancestor, raising personal cost. Escalation is driven by agency: each knot unraveled releases sound and spirits, tightening the moral bind. The final choice forecloses familial secrecy with visible price—the vow broken, silence replaced by breath. Coincidence never resolves; pressure accumulates through ritual labor under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to the erased—is signaled early and deepens when Lena discovers parish records of dispossession. Escalation is protagonist-driven: comparing footage, walking to the henge, opening the alcove. Each act narrows options (defying “DO NOT RESTORE”) and carries cost (emotional labor, potential professional risk). The shadow’s motion isn’t coincidence but a textual pressure that crystallizes Lena’s stance. Final trade-off: reopening the chapel as communal archive, not tourist site, forecloses institutional control.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding “the physics of letting go”—is signaled early and deepens when the second reel reframes Earhart’s intent from rescue to release. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: choosing to dive deeper, untangling threads, playing the reel, then releasing it. Each act narrows options, culminating in the decisive renunciation that crystallizes stance. Cost is unmistakable: fame turns to insomnia, obsession yields to mercy, and the reel’s loss is both physical and symbolic.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—articulating unspoken needs—tightens under lightning’s temporal squeeze, forcing Lio to encode before thunder erases the moment. Agency is clear: he chooses routing over resurrection, striking the plate to read his own code. Cost is felt in his hidden line and the ghost’s fear of muteness. Escalation is driven by environmental pressure (storm) and internal duty, not coincidence, with one meaningful deepening: realizing the ghost seeks transmission, not revival.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—agency within constraint—is signaled early (“tired of being merely a carrier”) and tightens decisively at the sixth floor when the diary names her. The escalation is driven by Lysa’s choices: unfolding the wire, wearing the goggles, pulling the brake. Each act carries cost (fear, exposure, defiance), culminating in a whiteout sabotage that could strand the crew—or elevate her. The conspiracy raises stakes without convenience; resolution stems from her curiosity, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—survival via atmospheric communication—is signaled early and deepens when radios fail. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she doesn’t wait for rescue but deploys her private method, risking total disconnection by dropping the telescope. The cost is legible: severing the last physical link to safety to create an invisible one. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure tightens through pattern intensification (cloud names → signal haze) rather than causal chain, yet the trade-off—trusting memory over machinery—carries existential weight.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving knowledge before demolition—is signaled early and deepens into personal revelation about cognitive limits. Pressure escalates coherently: time narrows (demolition engines warm), access tightens (secret safe requires decoding), and emotional stakes rise (loneliness vs. connection through pattern). The foreman’s arrival introduces external threat, yet resolution stems from Liora’s agency—her calm request earns five minutes. Cost is felt: she cannot save the tree, only inscribe its sky, accepting impermanence as the price of witness.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—charting the unknown—tightens when the luminance responds to multilingual greetings, forcing Lio to shift from mending to mapping. His agency drives escalation: noting patterns becomes decoding, which awakens the ship. Cost is felt in the abandoned repair duty and the irreversible turn toward “unmapped glare.” Coincidence (Yara’s hidden sketch) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Lio’s interpretation activates it.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—learning “the rhythm of repair”—tightens when prophecy reframes repair as alignment, not speed, forcing Mara to choose creation over extraction. The deepening (“Return by making, not by taking”) raises stakes: failure means perpetuating her father’s broken legacy. Agency drives escalation—she reads scraps, interprets reflections, files steel—and cost is visible: she leaves her prized picks behind. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—survival through collective rebuilding—is signaled early and tightens when Serren’s logs reveal its sacrifice, transforming suspicion into shared purpose. Protagonist agency drives escalation: interpreting chalk, hauling cables, ringing the bell. Cost is unmistakable: brambled labor, emotional risk of trust, and the irreversible act of departure. Coincidence never resolves; strangers converge only because all followed Serren’s method.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—whether to let time end cleanly or infuse it with human tenderness—is signaled early and deepens when the radio forecasts “the final ripple.” Mara’s agency drives escalation: she actively manipulates the clock’s mechanics to create a “new rhythm,” trading personal survival for global solace. The tightening forecloses escape (her heartbeat becomes gear-fuel), and cost is unmistakable in the puppet swallowing her last breath. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—guiding lost souls before frost—tightens via the 47-minute clock and the child’s entrapment. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing to enter despite curse-cost, using the nut to disrupt bird-patrols. The moral calculus sharpens when lifting the bird requires imprinting “mercy” without contact. Each choice narrows options (deeper into maze, tighter time) with visible cost: splinters, tightened curse, solitude reaffirmed.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—translating separation into ethical connection—is signaled early and deepens when Mara shifts from private atonement to public repair. The tightening occurs when she chooses to testify and release her patent, narrowing her options (corporate retaliation, personal exposure). Cost is unmistakable: loss of career safety, admission of partial fault, and enduring grief. Agency drives every escalation; coincidence (technician’s testimony) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the victory stems from her data and stance.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—earning parole by quantifying absence—tightens when the protagonist recognizes the title-hole as their own hollow, raising personal cost. Agency drives escalation: counting unprinted pauses, measuring blank margins, then incising pure lack. The deepening isn’t coincidental; it’s earned through the vendor’s unique skill (“keep track of hundreds of blanks while noticing cloud vortices”). Final cost: freedom from blankness requires leaving the cart of clean ledgers behind—a tangible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—whether collective trauma can be metabolized without contagion—is signaled early and deepens when Safi chooses bare contact over linen protection. The meaningful tightening occurs underground: accepting “contagion” to “sandpaper rough memories” forecloses self-preservation and forces communal sharing. Cost is unmistakable: Safi absorbs layered historical regrets (workers, soldiers, lovers), then transmits them bodily to others. Escalation is driven by Safi’s agency under an Accumulative lens—each sensory encounter intensifies the burden until it becomes a shared resource.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—saving Elevator Nine to build linguistic bridges—is signaled early and tightens when the mayor dismisses petitions, forcing Mara’s unilateral action. The escalation is driven by her agency: she rings the storm-warning bell, meets farmers in their home languages, and leverages Nine’s practical testimony. Cost is unmistakable: social risk, pre-dawn labor, and confronting systemic neglect. The deepening—from listening to organizing—narrows options and reconfigures community power dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—sorting entangled memories without losing essential threads—is signaled early and deepens when Nira chooses modification over severance. Escalation is driven by her agency: each copper turn corresponds to a memory segment, each rehearsal isolates a shard. The tightening occurs at the hospital corridor revelation, which reweights her mission from personal repair to archival inheritance. Cost is unmistakable: she must carry others’ dreams alongside her own, descending into the canyon “quaking” yet resolute.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—recovering forgotten combinations before they’re weaponized—is signaled early and deepens when the grotto reveals itself as a living archive that feeds on forgetting. Ilya’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to reenter, aligns breath with ink, scatters seeds that become stairs, and speaks codes aloud to resist theft by silence. The visible cost—collapsing chamber, falling books, reclaimed secrets—proves the price of success. Pressure tightens coherently under the Accumulative lens, with each spiral turn raising emotional and physical stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—making the unheard heard—is signaled early and deepens when Lysa realizes cracks are “records of pressure endured.” Her agency drives escalation: analyzing cracks → stringing wires → carving resonant blocks → leaving the insulator. Each act narrows options (she can’t undo the sculpture’s silence) and exacts cost (solitude, physical labor). Coincidence never resolves; birds and sap merely modulate tension she already created.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—honoring the covenant by rejecting celestial weaponization—is signaled early and escalates through Sable’s agency: correlating piece movements with field responses deepens knowledge, narrowing options to public renunciation. The cost is unmistakable: his exile becomes the currency of credibility, and the Collegium sacrifices strategic dominance. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; coincidence (Mera’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the climax hinges on Sable’s translated insight.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—cataloging silence to heal rupture—is signaled early and deepens when the diary reveals Mara’s apology and unstable shells. Lio’s agency drives escalation: he tunes frequencies, identifies faulty crates, swaps them, and reads aloud under suspicion. The meaningful tightening occurs when theoretical empathy becomes practical intervention, foreclosing passive observation with social risk. Cost is unmistakable: potential accusation of theft, exposure to crowd danger, and emotional vulnerability in quoting Mara’s regret publicly.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—access to serenity-as-medicine—tightens when wardens refuse, then deepens into ethical test: observe without taking. Jun’s agency drives escalation: she maps scent currents, stands watch, journals truth. Cost is felt: endurance in putrid air, surrender of control, acceptance of delayed return. The bloom isn’t coincidence—it’s calendared ritual, and her success hinges on attention, not luck. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each quiet act (doodling, breathing) compounds toward Charged Poise at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—finding resilience’s source—tightens when the arrow tip tugs her toward the hollow, forcing a choice: extract answers or join the chorus. Escalation is driven by Lysa’s agency: she tests the metal, flies during inversion, crosses the threshold. Cost is unmistakable: she relinquishes her weapon-as-compass, embedding it permanently, trading future utility for communal belonging. Gravity’s inversion isn’t coincidence but a persistent constraint that shapes every tactical move, culminating in the stone tree’s revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—uncovering why the town went silent—is signaled early and tightens when the spiral’s acoustic convergence is discovered. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: his survey choices narrow options until he must physically break the cylinder’s symmetry. Cost is unmistakable: time pressure (“minutes before the crew returned”), bodily risk (“cut my fingers”), and the conceptual price of foresight built only through danger. Coincidence complicates (forklift coughs) but doesn’t resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—certifying wonder as essential—is tested when sculpted hush becomes prison, forcing Lio to unfetter voice through auroral music. Escalation is protagonist-driven: each chisel strike deepens danger, demanding higher-stakes action (playing the sheet, timing strike with bells). Cost is unmistakable: the fragile decree feels “like ice over deep water,” requiring perpetual vigilance. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—density of sensory echoes reweights silence from absence to presence.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding failure—is signaled early and tightens when Liora crosses the boulder gap, risking non-return. The meaningful deepening occurs in the echo-world: seeing the pilgrim’s own flawed driftwood spiral reveals her error wasn’t rigidity but misdirected guardianship. Agency drives escalation—she chooses to uncase the flute, steps through, and plays again—and cost is unmistakable: years of exile, the pilgrim’s aged eyes, the weight of misapplied duty. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with each sensory detail amplifying thematic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—mastering emotion’s arithmetic through printing—tightens when each transfer costs coherence, forcing Kestrel toward the final renunciation. Agency drives escalation: she experiments with riddles, pastes posters that drain auditors’ anger, and ultimately chooses self-emptying. The cost—multiplying borrowed selves until she’s “a stone in deep water”—is unmistakable and shapes the climax. Coincidence (courier’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the vector’s power is unlocked only through her iterative choices.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—coaxing wonder into routine—is signaled early and tightens when the pendant refuses release, forcing Rook to confront Nera’s absence not as loss but legacy. The meaningful deepening occurs at the cairn: Mara’s request to let the ridge decide reweights ownership into communal possibility. Agency drives escalation—Rook’s choice to write the question crystallizes his stance. Cost is felt: he relinquishes personal answers for open-ended inquiry, though the causal chain leans slightly on the pendant’s magic rather than pure human choice.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether grief ends at funerals—is signaled early and deepens when Lio insists objects hold sorrow. The tightening occurs when the narrator names “anger,” triggering the crackle that mutates perception. Agency lies in attention: choosing to hear the car, then choosing what to tell parents. Cost is legible: bearing truth alone, protecting others with omission, relinquishing rage to let go.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—carrying a message across impossible distance—is signaled early and escalates through Yara’s agency: she chooses to weave despite fear, using jigsaw edges as map. The tightening occurs when silence thickens into shape, forcing the realization that voice is the price. Cost is unmistakable: “she could never speak again, only breathe and listen.” Luck complicates (finding puzzle pieces) but never resolves; the message succeeds solely through Yara’s sustained, costly labor.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—coaxing resilience from rubble before trees starve—is signaled early and tightens when clamps fail, forcing Lio to seek the silk. Escalation is driven by his agency: each descent deepens knowledge but exacts memory, narrowing options until only self-sacrifice remains. Cost is visible and cumulative (“another slice of his memory was taken”), culminating in the final trade-off: burying the silk to protect others, accepting permanent loss. Coincidence (magician’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Lio’s choices drive every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—“the weight of a withheld truth”—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the beacon reveals Jalen’s location, transforming lie into measurable mass “heavier than any cargo.” Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: using the shard to redirect seams, then weaving both bodies through worlds. Cost is unmistakable: the brother’s fury (“you cut my anchor”) and the physical drag of guilt made literal. Coincidence complicates (beacon under bench) but resolution stems from skill and sacrifice, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—keeping others safe when the light fails—is signaled early via freighters aiming “by rumor, and rumor was how people died.” Pressure tightens when Noah sees extra life vests and chooses to climb the spiral, then deepens when he writes the letter despite his silence. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens: each observation accumulates into protective action. Cost is felt in salt-grit fingers and the emotional labor of writing what he “had never been good at saying,” foreclosing his habitual withdrawal.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving coastal communication after print’s death—tightens when laughter accidentally prophesies flood, forcing a trade-off: suppress joy or weaponize it. The deepening occurs when the keeper chooses to choreograph the storm, using the wick to steer light. Agency drives escalation: every key turn stems from his decisions (redirecting beam, pinning cutouts), not coincidence. Cost is unmistakable: voice sacrificed, prophecy institutionalized, mirth now burdened with civic consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—learning why stories magnetize—is tested when Maru realizes it’s not charisma but generosity that draws narrative. Each sun-trail dot deepens this by revealing Sairi’s anonymous aid, narrowing Maru’s path from envy to emulation. The tightening occurs when she resists her instinct to “fix” or “control” stories, choosing instead to “make room.” Cost is felt in her trembling hands and borrowed pulse—agency lies in renouncing authorship for stewardship.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—accessing unquantified truth versus municipal order—is signaled early and deepens when the sapling appears. Protagonist agency drives escalation: mapping dreams, using the sextant, deconstructing the maze stone by numbered stone. Each choice narrows options (clerks would “tag that weight as fifty-four units”) and incurs conceptual cost—rejecting systemic legibility for raw witness. The storm’s pressure tightens spatially and temporally (“pin strike stone” moment), forcing a decisive reconfiguration rather than passive revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—rekindling a realm dying from absent dawn—is signaled early and deepens through Lysa’s escalating sacrifice: each rescued memory costs her own past, and weaving dawns risks the night’s retaliation. The tightening occurs when Marrow demands communal cloth over princely scarves, forcing Lysa to choose collective healing over personal restoration. Cost is unmistakable: she trades wholeness for shared light, and the night “tightens like a collar” as resistance. Agency drives escalation—no coincidence resolves the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—whether mistakes can be redeemed—is signaled early and deepens when Lysa’s error passes the Society’s test. Pressure tightens through Marin’s agency: he chooses to enter, to reveal himself gently, to present the torn invitation. The cost—emotional exposure, identity shift—is felt in the closing stasis. Coincidence (the misaddressed invite) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from character choices under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving the sacred in the ordinary—is signaled early and deepens when Mina’s passive noticing shifts to active gardening. Pressure tightens via state erasure (vanished bakery, painted slogans), forcing a trade-off between safety and witness. Agency emerges in planting despite fear; cost is felt in her confession and the ever-present footsteps beyond the gate. One meaningful escalation suffices, though stakes could feel more immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving meaning against oblivion—is signaled early and tightens when the courier delivers the dying slide. Ilian’s agency drives escalation: he doesn’t just catalog but intervenes (whispering his own promise), which deepens the vow and stabilizes the script. Cost is felt in emotional labor (“accuracy was the last kindness”) and existential burden (“the act of keeping had changed him”). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens via increasing fragility of illusions.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—thwarting the betrayal to save her father and community—is signaled early and tightened through three failed attempts that deplete resources (wax, time, stealth). Agency is clear: Mara chooses riskier methods after each failure, culminating in the calculated violation of the “truce of hush.” The cost is visible: blood on boards, Lorne’s escape, and the ever-present threat of chains. Pressure escalates coherently under the Causal lens—each turn stems from her decisions, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding why people carry weather—is signaled early and deepens into a moral choice: serve the Bureau or join the carriers. The tightening occurs when Thundercloud Hair reveals the grandmother’s refusal to serve, transforming private nostalgia into political inheritance. Cost is legible: joining the circle risks Bureau retaliation but enables “a vote for mercy,” crystallizing the protagonist’s shift from observer to participant.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—answering the calling before creativity turns to ash—is signaled early and deepens when the lock proves broken, forcing improvisation. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she doesn’t wait for magic but creates an artifact that both deceives and mechanically unlocks. Cost is unmistakable: she risks exposure, uses her last canvas, and inherits a vocation her mother deemed dangerous. The deepening (painting over memory with indigo) narrows options to one irrevocable act.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost connection—is signaled early and tightens when Mara chooses candor over performance (plain paper note), which directly unlocks the cistern map. The cost is dual: emotional (confronting Lio’s lie about missing her) and tactical (risking theft by seeking water). Pressure escalates causally: wilted fern → map discovery → conduit entry → vellum bundle → honest note → cleared tubes. Coincidence is absent; every turn stems from Mara’s agency under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder’s color—tightens when the Auditor demands standardization, forcing Lysa to escalate via kinetic defiance. Her agency drives every turn: building the sculpture, accelerating it, integrating others’ relics. Cost is unmistakable: the fragment vanishes, yet its legacy enables communal participation (“some brought their own small relics”). The mute bells’ silence becomes active rest, not absence—a deepening that reconfigures value under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving the roses while resolving inner static—is signaled early and deepens when magnetic north shifts destabilize both systems. The controlled burn is a high-agency turn that forecloses safety (flame under glass) for survival. Cost is unmistakable: blister risk, sacrificial mulch, and emotional exposure of feeding childhood fears into fire. Escalation is driven by protagonist’s logic (“contain chaos”) under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—whether community can hold fragile truths—is signaled early and deepens through each testimonial beat. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: the blackout fractures are compounded by present threats (eviction, developer truck), forcing incremental risk-taking (reading letters aloud). Agency resides in attention—Mara’s choice to “ask for more details rather than answers” alters group dynamics, enabling Hassan’s naming of his brother. Cost is felt in exposed shame (pill theft confession) and deferred confrontation (developer waits), though external stakes slightly dilute internal ones near climax.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—liberating detainees without triggering broadcast—is signaled early and deepens when Lyra realizes brute force fails. Her agency drives escalation: dancing fools mics, backward reading unlocks the wheel, scribbling reroutes alarms. Each turn forecloses options (e.g., no verbal response possible) and exacts cost—exposure to guardian, reliance on fragile bodily rhythms. The council’s offstage presence remains coherent pressure; resolution stems from Lyra’s ingenuity, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving identity against state-sanctioned forgetting—tightens when Lysa chooses rebellion over mercy. Agency drives escalation: reading grounds → entering chamber → breaking seal → returning grief. Each act narrows options (defying council, risking gravity shifts) and deepens cost (her father’s emptiness becomes communal peril). The parasite’s hunger makes stakes visceral: deletion isn’t relief but slow dehumanization. Final turn—speaking memories aloud—directly reverses the whale’s hold through earned action, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preventing coded prophecy from becoming marching orders—is signaled early and tightens when Liora realizes erasure risks mass poisoning. Her third path (filtering truth) is an act of agency under Accumulative pressure: each sensory detail (digits, bird names, wet lines) raises tension. Cost is unmistakable: she bears the warning alone, sacrificing collective safety for delayed, plain speech. No coincidence; escalation stems from her deepening understanding of the brook’s dual nature.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—saving the Dovetail through truth disguised as bureaucracy—is signaled early and tightens when the inspector’s walk-through looms. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: choosing to interrogate Ilyas, then the inspector, and slipping documents into his folder. Cost is unmistakable: Ilyas’s dissolution into mortar is the price of preservation. Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens; each meteor flare intensifies urgency without resorting to coincidence for resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—translating isolation into independence—is signaled early and deepened when the shell’s memory reveals her brother’s sacrifice. Mira’s agency drives escalation: she chooses archiving over hoarding, sealing over erasure. The cost is felt in her relinquishment of direct access, yet she gains authority to return. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, culminating in a stance that forecloses passive waiting.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—truth versus systemic control—is signaled early via “calibrated treason” and deepens when Senn reveals Liora’s forgeries were state-managed. The tightening occurs when she chooses meltwater over black ink, rejecting complicity; this narrows options to either expose the system or become its tool. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her decision to test the altar (not submit) uncovers proof that shifts power. Cost is unmistakable: she walks into judgment, bearing truth that may not topple the Council but frees those trapped in its lies.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—preventing Senn’s echo from trapping others—tightens decisively when Lira learns echoes are harvested via paired shells. Her agency drives escalation: she follows the map, sings into Jaro’s palm, counters Mael’s lie with melody. Cost is unmistakable: confronting the Choir risks her own voice, yet she chooses restoration over retaliation. The deepening—from personal grief to systemic injustice—narrows options until only song remains as weapon and cure.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—rescuing purity from exploitation—tightens decisively when Mara confirms Fen skimmed spirits’ “last reflections,” thinning them to silence. This deepening forces her shift from salvage to exposure, narrowing options: she must weaponize the shrine’s “window” function against Fen’s own methods. Cost is unmistakable: the child’s ghost is already damaged, and Mara’s victory requires communal witness (fisherwoman, priest), risking public failure. Protagonist agency drives escalation—her analysis of dream cameos directly enables the trap—under a clear Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—visibility of hidden labor—is signaled early and deepens when Ren applies net-mending logic to surveillance, foreclosing his belief that watchfulness “left no mark.” Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: Ren chooses to learn, then to deploy pattern-recognition, altering tactics based on Jiro’s philosophy. Cost is felt in his prior shame and the fishermen’s continued ignorance of Jiro. One meaningful tightening suffices—and it’s decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—truth versus state-sanctioned lies—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the diamond’s function is revealed, narrowing options from debunking to exposure. Protagonist agency drives escalation: reassembling letters, navigating storms, entering the orchard, choosing to copy and distribute. Cost is felt in vulnerability (riding into gray, facing Ministry agents) and moral weight (bearing witness for Salma). Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from observation or choice under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—shaping a new dawn via ancient shadows—tightens when Mara arrives, forcing Eli to choose between hoarding belief or sharing creation. His confession (“antennas stealing my words”) narrows options; their joint rewiring deepens tactics. Cost is felt: solitude endures, but now with “a signal to answer.” Escalation stems from agency—no coincidence resolves conflict; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens via sensory and ideological density.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—sweetening sorrow into transgenerational song—is signaled early and deepens when the music box’s melody demands specific sounds only Sato’s jars provide. His agency drives escalation: he feeds the box tide/church/rope sounds, forcing the spring to “remember the world.” Cost is felt in the widow’s trauma and the village’s silence; resolution requires surrendering anonymity for communal witness. Coincidence (the box playing at dawn) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the repair is earned through his method.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—protecting the relic to prevent wandering souls—is signaled early and deepens when theft becomes physical. Lio’s agency drives escalation: he doesn’t fight but “adapts” via vibrational matching, narrowing options to sonic absolution. Cost is visceral: he endures lunges, channels others’ grief, and shoulders eternal vigilance. The tightening—from wrench-and-key walk to resonant confrontation to locking the chamber—forecloses easy resolution, forcing moral calculus (forgiveness as weight) under accumulating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—freedom via patient resistance—is signaled early and deepened by the viaduct’s imposition. Irena’s agency drives escalation: she studies shadows, teaches timing, drills discipline. Cost is unmistakable: the rebels’ “restrained wildness” and Irena’s daily vow exact emotional toll. The third full moon becomes a live clock that narrows options to one precise, high-stakes window.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—breaking free from institutional complicity—is signaled early and deepens when Mara realizes Kellan used these tunnels for contraband and silencing. The tightening occurs when she finds the falsified safety reports, transforming abstract unease into actionable motive for murder. Her agency drives escalation: empirical observation leads to hidden route, which enables evidence transmission. Cost is unmistakable: fear “no longer owned her,” implying prior psychological captivity with tangible professional peril.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—transforming apology into accountable action—is signaled early and tightens when parole board trusts “craftsmanship more than sermons.” Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: Elias chooses Lena’s verdict, then accepts her counter-proposal despite institutional weight. The meaningful deepening occurs when Mrs. Halden appears—not to forgive, but to witness—narrowing options to sustained labor over symbolic gestures. Cost is unmistakable: Darren’s dignity hinges on unguaranteed recognition, and Elias risks professional credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—deciphering whether yearning can be engineered—tightens when the algorithm proves adaptive, forcing Mara to choose between empirical skepticism and intuitive flight. Agency drives escalation: her transliteration unlocks glyphs, which dictate ribbon navigation, culminating in socket insertion that awakens coast gears. Cost is felt in irreversible commitment: launching patched glider over acid, trusting silent bells, accepting that meaning may outlive her. Coincidence never resolves; Jory’s laughter contextualizes but doesn’t override Mara’s earned stance.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—truth versus institutional silence—is signaled early and deepens when Mara discovers her mother’s voice in the Chute. The tightening occurs when metadata patterns force her to choose between policy compliance and familial loyalty, narrowing options until she must lie to Legal while seeding rescue coordinates. Cost is unmistakable: she risks her job, sanity, and possibly her life, yet the escalation stems entirely from her agency (requesting audit trails, using forbidden accounts). The sea “did not take them” reframes the cold case as active concealment, raising stakes from memory to survival.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preventing community fracture amid ecological crisis—is signaled early and tightens when the shard reveals an unrecorded warmth. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses silence, descends to mirrors, reconstitutes the ball, and designs reciprocal duties. Cost is unmistakable: both men surrender private fears for public roles, and the orchard’s apples become communal currency. Pressure coheres under Causal lens—no coincidence resolves conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—learning “the sound of approaching endings”—tightens when Signe embodies that sound (“lungs closing like wet paper”), forcing the narrator from observer to participant. The storm escalation is driven by agency: crawling onto pontoons with bone clenched in teeth is a high-cost choice that alters tactics (using heirloom as tool). Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via layered resonances (ice pops = breath intervals), culminating in Signe’s departure as irreversible closure. Cost is unmistakable: the narrator abandons their “ridiculous study” with visible emotional toll.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—whether to destroy or preserve painful love tokens—tightens when Mara chooses to read rather than burn, crystallizing her stance. The sentinel’s agency drives escalation: his invitation creates the space where Mara’s choice becomes possible. Cost is legible: keeping the unburned pages means carrying complexity, not clean breaks. Coincidence (missing bus) complicates but doesn’t resolve; pressure stems from character decisions under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving the echo of wisdom without corrupting it—is signaled early and deepens when the prophet’s words destabilize the parapet. Iri’s agency drives escalation: she initiates the dawn ritual, sets its rules, and interprets the prophet’s motive. The cost is legible in her risk—trusting a stranger with access to sacred vibration—and in the parapet’s twitching, which threatens to erase the sages’ counsel. The tightening occurs when noon disturbances replace monthly rites, forcing immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—transforming isolated grief into shared healing—is signaled early and deepens when townspeople bring unprinted photos “because looking hurt.” Escalation is driven by Mara’s agency: she creates placement rules (“hard diagonal for anger”) that narrow options and force vulnerability. The storm intensifies pressure without resolving it; instead, the power outage demands collective action (holding acetate, lighting candles), making the cost legible: emotional exposure becomes communal labor. Coincidence (Mr. Gant’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the real turn is his return with a photo that completes a stranger’s veil.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether language should be controlled or allowed to evolve—is signaled early and deepens through the scholar’s discovery that pruning causes hushes where guilt vanishes. His agency drives escalation: he uses the crystal to map vines, follows Lysa, opens the green-outlined door. Cost is unmistakable: fixed definitions rot into compost, and the Council must relinquish authority. Coincidence never resolves; all turns stem from character choices under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—capturing aging before silence wins—tightens via Orrin’s forgetting: each driftwood marker risks dissolution, forcing Mira to anchor time with chalk. Protagonist agency drives escalation; she chooses to record borrowed rasp, speak her mother’s name, copy tapes. Cost is felt in blank-tape dread and Orrin’s cyclical disorientation. Coincidence never resolves; the microphone’s location emerges from character-driven action under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—capturing micrometeor flashes before dawn—is pressured by quake, spinning clock, and launch dependency. Mara’s agency deepens stakes: she replaces digital reliance with analog leaf-tick timing, narrowing options to one fragile method. Cost is visible: two windows already lost, rails at risk of permanent misalignment. Escalation is causal, not coincidental.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—Elias’s desire to reunify with Jonah before death—is signaled early and deepens through Mara’s intervention. Pressure escalates via blood work confirming decline, then Jonah’s guarded call, culminating in the skybridge walk. Agency is clear: Mara initiates contact; Jonah chooses to come; Elias asks for the record. Cost is felt in Jonah’s trembling, the broken-but-played hymn, and the final exhale—irreversible loss shadowing fragile reconciliation.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—recovering noon’s shadows—is signaled early and escalates through protagonist-driven agency: Liora chooses chalk circles over force, traces rune-rings instead of breaking doors. Each turn narrows options: the automaton’s eastern halt forecloses other paths; the mirror corridor reveals her fragmented self, raising emotional stakes. Cost is unmistakable: she risks joining her mentor in sealed exile, and the final act demands personal sacrifice—her shadow merges with the undelivered letters. Pressure coheres under the Causal lens, with no coincidental resolutions.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—truth versus closure—is signaled early and deepens when Rowan realizes Lina was apprenticing in secret, transforming grief into active responsibility. Pressure escalates through protagonist agency: his bone-setting expertise drives every key turn (identifying the substitute’s healed fracture, resetting the girl’s jaw). The cost is unmistakable: abandoning professional certainty for folkloric ambiguity, with social and emotional risk. Coincidence never resolves; every complication arises from prior choices or concealed knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—sharing light without fire—is signaled early and tightens when Lio confronts the sea glass, forcing him to choose between old fear and new creation. Agency drives escalation: his polishing reactivates memory, deepening conflict until he breathes apology into the pearl. Cost is unmistakable: emotional labor of reliving failure (“the child who had handed him oil”) alters his tactics. Coincidence (fishermen’s rumor) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from his endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—redemption through restitution—is signaled early and deepens when the protagonist chooses transparency over anonymity by embedding buyer names in the archive. The tightening occurs at Jun’s arrival: fear must be faced, trust offered without guarantee. Cost is felt in vulnerability (hands visible, voice trembling) and the irreversible act of handing over the pendant. Escalation is driven by agency, not coincidence, under an Accumulative lens where silence and drip-patterns reweight moral stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—writing an ending that does not lie—is signaled by line two and tightens at the river’s pull versus upstream climb. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to gather hopes despite current pressure, climbs broken metaphors, and opens the wet book “against its will.” Cost is unmistakable: blood, silence risk, severed commercial path. The single deepening—realizing readers “ask to be seen clearly”—sharpens the moral calculus without abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restoring sacred harvest practice—is signaled early and deepens when Marn realizes tools alone fail without keeper participation. The tightening occurs at the stone circle: honest breath becomes prerequisite, raising emotional cost (shame → vulnerability). Agency lies in Marn’s pivot from solo tinkerer to facilitator, forcing keepers to reclaim memory. Coincidence (moon alignment) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from human choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving living pulses against a world reduced to numbers—tightens when Eira chooses embodied ritual over archival record, then deepens when she seals starlight to prevent theft or panic. Agency drives escalation: her pattern-making isn’t passive hope but active translation of heartbeat into spatial code, paid for in physical toll (aching knees, trembling fingers). The arrival of the cartographer raises stakes by testing whether the map can be shared without corruption, resolved not by dialogue but by spoon-path invitation. Cost is unmistakable: Eira’s body bears the price of patience, and the world’s breath remains held even after the aurora stirs.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving unspoiled echoes—is signaled early and deepens when Ivo learns the swallowing is “overflow, not hunger,” forcing a tactical shift from collection to containment. His agency drives escalation: studying angles, cutting copper coins, shaving marble slivers—all narrowing options under the Accumulative lens. The cost is legible: physical toll (“breath became mist then disappeared”), time lost across the “wounded season,” and the cavern’s structural decay. Coincidence complicates (tremors crack marble) but never resolves; the climax hinges on Ivo’s earned insight about reflection-as-pulse.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—carrying others’ burdens without becoming fixed—is signaled early and deepens when the grotto traps the weaver for “stealing” weights. The tightening occurs at the spiral weave’s calcification: agency shifts from extraction to integration. Cost is unmistakable—thread hardens, freedom requires ritual reorientation—and the final choice (leaving the lattice) trades permanence for continued service. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—transforming grief into teachable wisdom—is signaled early and deepens through Miriam’s agency: each carved line forecloses passive mourning for active transmission. The “kettle boil” timeframe tightens pressure, forcing distilled choices. Cost is unmistakable: she sacrifices raw sorrow for structured meaning, accepting that love must “leave room to fail safely.” Escalation is driven by her hands, not coincidence, under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—negotiating with her ghost to release regret—is signaled early and deepens when the ghost demands payment, forcing Mara to sacrifice her collected images. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she chooses to release fragments, blink away memories, and fix the bolt. Cost is unmistakable: each surrendered image erodes her old ambition until it’s “only a dry taste.” The tightening occurs when the ghost rises, testing her resolve with borrowed voices, narrowing options to surrender or stagnate.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether to demolish or resurrect—is signaled early and deepens when Lina discovers the architect’s notebooks, transforming bureaucratic duty into personal mission. Escalation is driven by her agency: clearing drains, rerouting flows, activating the antenna. The cost is visible (physical exhaustion, professional risk) and conceptual (choosing poetic utility over utilitarian disposal). Coincidence (finding the sextant) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the climax hinges on her engineered solution, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—reconciling abandoned musical dreams with monastic silence—is signaled early and deepens when the bear’s injury forces action that breaches his rules. The tightening occurs when he tears his ledger (sacrificing archival duty for compassion), narrowing his path: he can no longer pretend silence is holiness. Cost is felt in the shift from “charts, not melodies” to “writing a score no bell could betray.” Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative pressure—the glacial hush doesn’t solve; it demands a new way to listen.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. manufactured belief—is signaled early and deepens when Mara realizes exposing the lie strips comfort. The tightening occurs at the locker discovery: knowledge forces action with cost (eroding communal faith). Escalation is driven by Mara’s agency (instincts, splicing tape), not luck, and culminates in a trade-off: clarity over solace. Pressure remains coherent under the Causal lens until the Charged Poise ending.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving embodied knowledge against bureaucratic erasure—is signaled early and deepens when the council’s wire plan threatens total loss. Lio’s agency drives escalation: he decodes Mara’s rope, demonstrates code to the clerk, and catalyzes policy change. Cost is unmistakable: surrendering the black lotus seed (personal relic) and the weavers’ admission that secrecy was a failing shield. The tightening—wire replacing rope—narrows options to one hour, forcing decisive action.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—transforming absence into explained geography—is signaled early and deepened through the queen’s request: “write my son dead without killing him.” The meaningful tightening occurs when the narrator projects presence, narrowing options to one fragile bridge of breath and thread. Cost is felt in the queen’s curled fingers and the narrator’s stuttered breath—agency crystallizes in quiet endurance, not action. Coincidence never resolves; healing emerges only through shared, intimate labor.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reawakening uncalculated beauty—is signaled early and tightens when Lorian chooses to assemble broken parts despite machine alarms. His agency drives escalation: hypothesizing enables action, action disrupts palace order, disruption births color. Cost is unmistakable: the bitterness in sweetness, the requiem for erased wildness, the prince’s trembling endurance. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from his renunciation of mechanical joy.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—proving compassion can override legacy—is signaled early and tightens when she disobeys dispatch to save lives. The accelerant line raises external stakes; the copycat coin deepens internal ones. Her agency drives escalation: crawling under rafters, performing field graft, leaving her coin. Cost is unmistakable: she relives her father’s panic, risks professional ruin, and endures the girl’s scream—all to foreclose the path of inherited vengeance. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without reliance on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—liberating trapped memories—is signaled early and tightens when Mara learns her mother caused the erasure. Pressure escalates through protagonist-driven choices: following crumbs, using sidereal patience, matching constellations. Cost is unmistakable: remembering will make the city ache, and her doubt glows brighter. Coincidence (geese pause) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the latch yields only after Mara stops forcing it—a deepening earned by stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—sharing non-burning light—intensifies through Lior’s agency: he engineers solutions (harness, sonar) that narrow options (abandoning solo gear-spinning for collective frames). The automaton’s warning crystallizes pressure: change risks cultural collapse, forcing Lior’s renunciation of heroic return. Cost is unmistakable—he teaches outskirts children, accepting obscurity over furnace redemption. Escalation follows Accumulative logic: each petal-fall deepens pattern-awareness until the shared wheel’s glow becomes inevitable rebellion.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—discovering the shape of collective grief—is signaled early and deepens when the spirit guides Jonas to braid separate losses. Agency is clear: his retracing, ribbon-tying, and carving narrow options from private inquiry to public memorial. Cost is felt in emotional exposure (hosting siblings, spectral vulnerability) and conceptual labor (decoding chisel pauses). Escalation is driven by protagonist choice under an Accumulative lens, though the spirit’s arrival leans slightly coincidental without undermining earned pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—temporal integrity as communal survival—is signaled early and deepened when Mara discovers engineered drift. Her agency drives escalation: pausing the pendulum, decoding inscriptions, removing lead. Cost is unmistakable: she cannot undo deaths, only correct the clock, accepting partial justice. Pressure coheres under Causal lens—each action narrows options toward mechanical penance.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—discovering the shape of Tomas’s intentions—tightens when the green thread reveals a cipher, shifting from emotional curiosity to moral imperative. The gardener’s agency drives escalation: he decodes, interprets, digs, and plants. Cost is felt in Alvera’s sharpened gaze and the ledger’s oilcloth-wrapped fragility—proof that truth requires tending. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from embodied attention to frayed threads and frozen chess pieces.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—seeding innovation within rigid constraints—is signaled early and deepens when the Warden warns that prediction robs freedom. Jora’s agency drives escalation: she walks the shore, overlays data, shifts sled routes, and writes conditional sentences. The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses not commandments but participatory frameworks, foreclosing top-down control at the cost of simplicity. Coincidence never resolves; every gain stems from her labor and ethical stance.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—restoring narrative in a censored world—is signaled early and tightens when Censors notice “sparkle,” forcing Mara to cloak the scores. Her agency drives escalation: she doesn’t wait for rescue but recruits the orchestra as carriers of contraband story. Cost is unmistakable: surveillance, risk of confiscation, and the burden of being the sole conduit for Ashmouth’s fragments. The concert isn’t luck—it’s her braided lyrics meeting Vell’s broadcast under fog’s cover, a trade-off of safety for resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—making the disappeared visible without endangering the living—tightens when inspectors demand names. Lira’s agency lies in strategic omission (“exercise in vanishing points”) and tactical use of ambiguity. Cost is felt in the torn sleeve’s haste and the ash-tapped eyes, but escalation leans slightly on coincidence (chair groan). Still, pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each sensory detail deepens the risk until the inspector’s softened face crystallizes shared grief.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving ancestral knowledge against bureaucratic amnesia—is signaled early and deepens when Mara demands ownership for a meal ticket, forcing Orin to choose between survival and integrity. His agency drives escalation: bartering slates for an auger, boring through stratified lies, widening the hole by hand. Cost is legible in his shaking arms and final isolation. The Council’s off-page power applies coherent pressure without resolving via coincidence; Orin’s stance crystallizes under situational duress.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving the arts wing—is signaled early and deepens through Mara’s method (“subtracting noise”), which narrows options from chaos to curated vulnerability. Each rehearsal tightens pressure: singers sacrifice personal armor (sarcasm, silence, shouting), raising emotional cost. The climax isn’t won by argument but by demonstrating what vanishes when budgets erase voices. Agency is clear: Mara engineers the concert as tactical resistance, and the council’s shift feels earned by accumulated resonance, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—memory as resistance—tightens meaningfully at the alignment: the fruit could erase or restore, and Mira’s pruning ensures it restores selectively. Agency drives escalation: she chooses which memories to cultivate, whom to invite, how to serve. Cost is unmistakable—fearful clerks attend, patrol lights loom—and the trade-off (controlled insight vs. overwhelming delirium) shapes every tactic. The Ministry’s off-stage pressure remains coherent, never resolving by coincidence; victory is synaptic, not spectacular.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—restoring ecological and civic trust after technological hubris—is signaled early and deepens when Maro realizes “the truth lived in my hands.” The tightening occurs at the tower console: opening the box demands a price (public shame), which Maro pays by revealing Sela’s overclocking and his own lies. Agency is clear—Maro chooses truth over silence—and cost is felt in Sela’s admission and the council’s looming cover-up. Escalation is driven by protagonist action under a Causal lens, with no coincidental resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—whether a house can “recognize itself”—is signaled early and deepens when the storm forces communal gathering. Mara’s agency (sanctifying via object-placement) narrows options: moving the clock drains warmth, proving attention is fragile. Cost is visible—she abandons her solitary cataloging rule for communal restoration—and the storm escalation tests her theory under pressure. Coincidence (power outage) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution comes from Mara’s deliberate acts.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—truth versus simplification—is signaled early (“you told them we chose sacrifice”) and tightens through four revelations that foreclose Ilyan’s righteous narrative. Agency drives escalation: he threads the cord, pulls the door, places the ampoule—each act narrowing his epistemic escape routes. Cost is unmistakable: his public testimony is revealed as weaponized ignorance, and the mines’ poison was brewed by his own court. The final trade-off—replacing one lie with another—is crystallized in the Founder’s warning against hardened harm, making nuance a survival tactic, not a luxury.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—redeeming a missed opportunity—is signaled early and deepens via the perpetual motion machine, which literalizes the cost of expectation. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: he writes proofs, rolls dice, constructs a lemma, and finally ruptures his core assumption. The tightening forecloses the path of hope, forcing acceptance with felt cost (the machine stalls, silence echoes). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with one decisive deepening that reweights the entire climb.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—proving kindness endures—is signaled early and deepens when Ro’s knock forces Mira to risk exposure. Her agency drives escalation: inviting him in, painting the street song, proposing the alphabet project. Cost is unmistakable: Ro’s chest-hurt recognition, Mira’s years of insomnia, the city’s toxic dawns. The waxing moon’s timeframe tightens pressure—each night narrows the window for rescue before erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving art against erasure—is signaled early and deepens when eviction threatens. Maris’s agency drives escalation: she doesn’t wait for rescue but mobilizes refugees using their labor and the beekeeper’s honey. The thaw is earned through collective action, not coincidence. Cost is unmistakable: fear lingers even as they sing, and the guards’ departure hinges on emotional risk, not victory.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—rewriting his sister’s death—is intensified by the hunger stone’s conditional radiance and the ticking tide. Orin’s agency drives escalation: reverse-winding the yoyo, threading copper into contacts, waiting for the “hungriest” moment. The cost is legible when he lets the moment pass—“fate’s true lock was not time but his need to force it”—a moral calculus paid in surrendered hope.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—escaping photographic curse that kills others—is signaled early and escalates coherently: from haunted room to Hall of Snapshots to final booth. The tightening occurs when the protagonist realizes the luminance is “bait” and must be made to “fail at the moment of capture”—a trade-off that risks total exposure. Agency drives escalation: using the dream dictionary, repurposing the clasp, stepping into the booth despite terror. Cost is unmistakable: the protagonist endures psychological torment and offers their own skin (“bit skin”) to sever fear’s grip.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—survival via harmony vs. brute force—is signaled early and deepens when the anchor tears. Leeward’s agency drives escalation: he chooses noise over nets, then incorporates the spar’s threat into rhythm, forcing crew adaptation. Cost is visible: lost fruit, near-destruction of his perch, exhaustion turned to music. The squall doesn’t resolve magically; it’s mirrored and pacified through earned sonic reciprocity, satisfying the Accumulative lens with a single, decisive intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—answering the watchers’ silence—tightens when Lira realizes they’re built into the gate, transforming external mystery into internal reckoning. Her agency drives escalation: whistle tests, fracture tracing, and symbolic chalking narrow options until only passage remains. Cost is felt in the journal’s brine-swollen pages and the dread of “walking into its throat.” Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from her pattern-language choices.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. stability—is signaled early and deepens when Mara links River Riots to dock strikes, forcing Hadrin to confront cyclical harm. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her offer of a contextualized exhibit narrows options from suppression to negotiated exposure. Cost is unmistakable: Hadrin surrenders control, Mara accepts partial truth, and both bear the weight of complicity. The tightening—from private theft to public reckoning—occurs through dialogue-as-action, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—mapping absence without dismissing it—is signaled early and deepens when Beran demands the inkwell, forcing Lira to choose between institutional erasure and private witness. Her agency (wresting skiff, shoving Beran into pillar) drives escalation, and cost is unmistakable: isolation, physical strain, and the irreversible act of embedding confessions in stone. The tightening forecloses archival custody, binding memory to riverbed instead.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—tracing honest origins—is signaled early and tightens when forged maps implicate the Guild council. Maren’s agency drives escalation: her “alternative hypothesis” turns blank cards into receipts, forcing tactical adaptation. Cost is unmistakable: she photographs evidence knowing the council would “drown the evidence more thoroughly than the sea ever had.” Pressure coheres under causal lens; coincidence never resolves—only her skill and choices do.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—recovering Jalen’s shadow through dream recording—is signaled early and deepens when priests reveal the price: Mira must leave part of herself in the light. This tightening forces her climactic self-division, a trade-off with visceral cost. Pressure accumulates texturally: each recorded shadow nightmare raises emotional stakes, and the Archive Spire ascent crystallizes her stance. Luck never resolves conflict; agency drives every escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—locating and seizing “unused potential”—is signaled early and deepens into a moral-technical quest. Pressure escalates causally: overload → dark array → manual calibration → discovery of the pool → steering into it → feeding it into the net. Each step narrows options (twelve-minute window, frozen valves) and raises conceptual stakes. The cost is legible: he cannot resurrect his bride, but he can alter the algorithmic logic that killed her—foreclosing vengeance for systemic mercy. Coincidence (the overload) complicates but doesn’t resolve; agency drives the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—decoding belonging—is signaled early via the pilgrim’s quest and Mara’s shared auditory memory. Pressure escalates through Mara’s agency: she maps stars, finds the gap, pulls masonry, opens drawers. Each act narrows options (only one notch, one cabinet) and deepens knowledge (chips form letters). Cost is legible: the emotional labor of hope sustained across war-scattered fragments, crystallized in the “familiar itch of missing pieces” now resolved through joint effort. Coincidence never resolves—only earned observation and action do.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—Mara’s need to “discover the weight of a withheld truth”—tightens decisively when she learns Jonah’s mother is her own ghost. The deepening (driftwood dolphin reveal) transforms external pressure into internal crisis, forcing her to choose between professional deceit and personal atonement. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her decision to read the carvings, then confess, directly alters outcomes. Cost is unmistakable: she sacrifices her livelihood and safety to restore Jonah’s real history.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving neutral exchange amid mutual mistrust—is signaled early and deepens when the wire-wrapped wrists reveal systemic cruelty beyond battlefield necessity. Lena’s agency drives escalation: she leverages the drawer pull not just to free flesh but to expose shared theft of households, forcing Sarin and Vek into mirrored apologies. Cost is unmistakable: Sarin’s shaking hand, Vek’s moonward glance as if awaiting judgment, and Lena’s own position as first hostage if trust fails. The tightening forecloses easy neutrality—the parapet demands moral witness, not just procedural compliance.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—moral absolution through truthful reckoning—is signaled early and tightens via the kayak journey’s physical and psychological pressure. Theo’s agency drives escalation: each pole passed is a micro-atonement; the squall tests his flickering faith; Lita’s presence raises emotional stakes. Cost is unmistakable: enduring shame to write the apology. Coincidence (Lita’s appearance) complicates but doesn’t resolve—he paddles through regardless.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming humanity after emotional erasure—is signaled early and tightens at each junction: first with the thief (cost: risk of entanglement), then the time traveler’s ultimatum (cost: public exposure vs. complicity). Protagonist agency drives escalation; the labyrinth forces decisions that narrow options. Final choice crystallizes stance with unmistakable social and personal price: testifying revives buried crimes.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reforging a bond beyond death—is signaled early and tightens when Sable declares the bridge demands change. Mira’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to breathe the name, accept the shape, shed her body. The cost—losing her human form—is felt in the “reluctant” nod and the “heavy” old body falling away. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure builds via sensory density until the corridor opens, forcing crystallization: keeper or equal? She chooses equality at great personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming stolen postpartum time—is signaled early and deepens when the protagonist realizes she must relive, not retrieve, the lost hours. Escalation is driven by her agency: tracing hands, matching the saucer crack, ascending the sigh-stair, then choosing to stay and receive time slowly. The cost is unmistakable: enduring feverish dawns and blood-soaked sheets again, now with full awareness. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from her cartomantic logic and maternal reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—finding a door beyond airlocks—is signaled early and tightens when Mara realizes the seam responds only to honesty, forcing her to relive painful memories. The meaningful deepening occurs when stitching becomes navigation, and the cost escalates: each shimmer dredges up regret, making progress emotionally perilous. Final agency lies in steady pushing, not violence, aligning with her pacifism while foreclosing the path of avoidance. Luck never resolves; the vial works only after shadow work is done.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—understanding transformation’s texture—is signaled early and deepens when Amina enters the tube against her “sensible plan.” Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: she orchestrates coincidence by asking Toma to lift the lantern, revealing escape. Cost is unmistakable: ash inhalation, risk of burial, surrender of her most delicate possession. The tightening forecloses retreat; once bugs are released, there’s no reclaiming borrowed light. Coincidence complicates (priest’s arrival) but doesn’t resolve—Amina’s choices do.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—sparking a silent revolution—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency: the blackout becomes a “curtain” for intrigue, the sundial’s shadow selects the third scratch, and one spark triggers systemic change. Pressure tightens coherently under the Causal lens, with each choice narrowing options (e.g., rotating the holder aligns with pre-carved scratches). Cost is unmistakable: the sentinel risks execution if caught, yet endures performative vigilance (“face neutral”) to protect the movement. Coincidence never resolves; all turns stem from deliberate, high-stakes decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—fulfilling Lysa’s promise by deciphering sacred patterns—is signaled early and deepens when Marel arrives seeking navigation aid. Pressure escalates via Eren’s curse: each flash of eel-death forces rock adjustments, tightening the sequence toward revelation. The climax requires Eren to step onto water, guided by eel bodies in precise ratios—an act of faith shaped by prior constraints. Cost is unmistakable: confronting the intact rope means accepting that Lysa’s death was inevitable, not his failure alone.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—naming the unnamed—intensifies through the ritual of timed exposures, each narrowing options to a single breath-stuttered instant. Protagonist agency drives escalation: he chooses to participate, to reframe his poems as plates, to carry absence as atlas. Cost is visible in the unfinished star-image and emotionally crystallized in his mixed fury/gratitude. The “vigil in pause” isn’t passive—it’s an active refusal to let scars be flattened into lines.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—access to the city’s hidden evacuation route—is signaled early and deepens when Veller’s corruption threatens civic survival. Escalation is driven by Lysander’s agency: he chooses to fence, uses footwork to memorize the route, and pins Veller not to kill but to teach. The cost is conceptual yet undeniable: policy becomes pilgrimage, knowledge becomes responsibility. Veller’s arrest isn’t vengeance but necessity—stakes remain viscerally tied to citizen safety, not abstract justice.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—forging beauty from anarchy—is signaled early and tightens when riots force Len to choose between despair and rebuilding. His agency drives escalation: breaking into the municipal branch, painting “OPEN,” demanding payment in acts of care. Cost is unmistakable: lockdown, mildew, fear in June’s personality, armed guards in the prison library. Luck complicates (riots, coordinator’s absence) but never resolves; every gain stems from Len’s or Mara’s deliberate, risky choices.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—repairing damaged time—is signaled early via the stuck clock and deepens when the film reel offers a map through “forgotten geometry.” Protagonist agency drives escalation: Lio chooses to enter the condemned booth, follow frames, and play the avoided chord. Cost is unmistakable: he must confront the goodbye he’s evaded, risking further fracture. The flickering compasses’ shift from panic to unified direction proves stakes were viscerally materialized.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—preserving cultural memory against erasure—is signaled early (“names of reefs were thinning”) and tightens when the Council fears monsoon will “wash the rest clean.” Tavo’s agency drives escalation: he rejects their literal approach, uses dream notebooks, tests bias with jars, and plants per vision. Cost is unmistakable: he surrenders empirical certainty (his breath as last offering), and the crowd’s presence shifts memory from individual burden to communal act. The monsoon’s arrival tests the tree’s resilience—pressure peaks and resolves through earned ritual, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding “the color of unspoken apologies”—tightens meaningfully when the compass redirects inward, foreclosing the quest for paternal absolution. Agency lies in the choice to prune, not shout, altering emotional tactics. Cost is felt in the relinquished blame (“severance I blamed on him had begun with my own silence”). Though pressure accumulates texturally rather than causally, the deepening aligns with the inferred Accumulative lens; however, the ship’s appearance edges toward convenient symbolism without sufficient prior constraint.
