  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering why the fire happened—is signaled early and tightens when Jaren reveals the broader conspiracy. Liora's agency drives the investigation (following frost patterns, confronting Jaren), and the revelation meaningfully escalates from personal victimhood to systemic threat. However, the cost at closure is understated: her decision to keep the ledger implies future risk but doesn't foreclose a visible path or exact an on-page price in the final beat, keeping escalation just below high-band threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: rectify silence into perceivable music. The weeks in the conservatory compress learning without on-page reversal or narrowing. The glass-strike at closure operates as discovery rather than earned escalation; nothing was foreclosed or risked to reach it. Liora provides support, not opposition. One meaningful deepening (silence reframed as canvas) but no visible price paid before the triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—answering the distress signal and giving the drowned rest—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Escalation follows the Accumulative lens: each beat (package arrival, memory, wade, library entry, logbook discovery) deepens understanding and narrows options until he must act. The protagonist's agency drives closure: he places the lens, opens the book, and reads aloud, actions that revitalize the light. However, the story lacks a visible trade-off or friction; the undertaker encounters no resistance, and the cost remains emotional rather than a tactical sacrifice that alters his circumstances. One meaningful tightening (logbook reveal) is sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—community endurance under tightening sanctions—is signaled in paragraph one and deepens through anonymous donations, midnight runs, doubled patrols, and the second bell's arrival. One meaningful tightening: "The sanctions worsened. Patrols doubled, and the roads grew dangerous. But the donations did not stop." This narrows options and raises cost, fitting the Accumulative lens. Liora's agency is renunciation and ritual-building (ringing the bell, letting children hold it), an Earned Stasis with visible cost: she declares endurance "not through defiance, but through memory," foreclosing armed resistance. The girl's question and Liora's answer ("some things don't need names") crystallize stance.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—finding where unused love is stored—is clear and repeats across beats. The middle deepening occurs when Lien remembers offering the tear in a past life, reweighting her present possession of it. Yet the father's arrival is coincidental, not a tightening driven by Lien's agency; she does not pursue, discover, or risk to encounter him. The cost of giving away the tear is undercut by its immediate validation (the boy stirs, the fog reveals a path), offering reward without visible sacrifice or foreclosed option. One meaningful deepening is present, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—restoring fading photographs and, implicitly, recovering lost family—is signaled early and tightens when the photograph "reversed" into a horrifying street scene, forcing Elara into the garden. The protagonist's agency at closure (pressing the fragment to her mother) is a decisive physical act, but the cost is stated rather than dramatized: "The woman's form began to disintegrate... into light, into *time*." The garden lets her see, then she acts, then silence—no on-page resistance, no visible tradeoff between restoring the photos and losing the mother's presence, no lasting wound that alters her stance in the final paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs (photograph reversal → garden call → willow doorway), but escalation is compressed and the peak choice feels like the only path rather than a narrowing of live options.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—reaching the vault before scavengers and dispersing seeds—is clear and tightens through the key puzzle, scavenger encounter, and wall collapse countdown. The arrow boundary-marker creates one meaningful pressure point when the scavenger hesitates. However, the vault access itself unfolds without difficulty; Vey simply finds the right key and the door opens. The final instruction "take what you can carry...but not too much" gestures at cost (restraint, planting vs. hoarding) but doesn't dramatize a hard choice or visible sacrifice in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—capturing the sound of trust breaking—is signaled early and pursued throughout. Pressure accumulates through memory (grandfather's obsession, wife's betrayal), physical urgency (cancer "while cells still divided"), and the return to the site. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens depends on a single deepening: adult Elias finally hears the color of his wife's lie and acts on it. No on-page obstacles test his process; the forge works, the foil cools, and "it was something" closes without visible friction or cost paid in the climactic beat itself—the cost is retrospective (the lie, the cancer) rather than a trade-off forcing a new choice. One meaningful tightening is present but the stakes feel more thematic than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—whether to board the train or stay—emerges cleanly in the second half. One tightening occurs when Kael holds the jar and proposes "make our own track," shifting Lira's stance from observer to co-actor. However, the escalation is thin: no prior constraint forces the choice, and the train's departure feels like atmospheric coincidence rather than a narrowing caused by Lira's prior decisions. The resolution (standing together, shadows merging) lacks visible cost; we never learn what the train represented or what concrete path Lira forecloses by staying, so the trade-off remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled: Elias seeks to repair "something deeper" and craft safe inquiry zones. The tightening occurs when he narrates the panel calibration, metaphorically linking pressure balance to his internal state. However, escalation is conceptual rather than causally driven—no live option is foreclosed, no tactic altered by prior failure. The final switch-flip is an enacted metaphor, not a decision with visible cost. One meaningful deepening (calibration metaphor) meets minimum, but cost clarity is weak; band guidance for 8.0+ requires a trade-off that forecloses a live option, not met here.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the truth of Mira's origin—is signaled early and drives the discovery sequence. The confrontation with the caretaker introduces a reversal (he recognizes the shell, flinches), but his immediate capitulation deflates pressure. The final "let's start over" lacks a visible trade-off or foreclosed option; the photograph reveals information but does not force a high-cost choice. One meaningful tightening (the caretaker's arrival) exists, but escalation plateaus rather than crescendos.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding the booklet and completing the map—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through sensory density rather than escalating choices; the oracle kneels, climbs, sits, traces, then stands and releases. No meaningful tightening or trade-off narrows her options; the booklet's revelation ("not a story, but a map") arrives as internal epiphany without visible cost or a decision that forecloses another path. The final act (letting the leaf go) reads ceremonial rather than a choice under competing pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (understanding thought origin) signals early and tightens through looped escalation: pluck → reflection → whisper → forehead press. Each iteration adds sensation, narrowing E-7X's options until he commits to listening. The final collapse and return to mopping constitutes a meaningful deepening—he trades certainty for direction—with felt cost (slower movements, acceptance of pursuit). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens. One slip: the "thousandth loop—or perhaps the millionth" telescopes stakes rhetorically but the page dramatizes only three distinct beats, slightly diluting escalation credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is trust between Mira and Elias, signaled early ("ambiguously clear," "You're lying"). One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias spreads the ticket stubs and admits eavesdropping, narrowing Mira's options—she can dismiss him or engage. The final choice (placing the lens down, agreeing to "start over") is protagonist-driven with visible cost: abandoning the guarded stance each has held for years. Agency is clear, and coincidence does not resolve; the pressure coheres under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake ("Will the garden accept/trust him?") is signaled early and accumulates pressure through the marble exchanges and the garden's shifting responses. The crack-map marble is a meaningful reversal that narrows Elias's path to the seedling. His final choice—to scatter the marbles and trust the garden to choose the next gardener—forecloses his prior ambition with visible cost ("enough to know that the deception had been mended"). One deepening turn is sufficient at this length; escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—proving sideways time—is signaled early and drives the nexus interaction. One meaningful tightening occurs when the lever appears and Elara reaches through the hologram, narrowing her options to act or retreat. Yet the escalation lacks a visible price: the station shudders, alarms sound, but no on-page consequence forecloses a path or forces a trade-off. The xenos' synchronized response and collapsing nexus complicate without landing a felt cost. Agency is present (Elara overrides safety protocols, pulls the lever) but the resolution reads as spectacle rather than a choice with legible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—decode and perform the lost symphony—is signaled early and coheres throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when the program's numbers rearrange into *The Unstruck Chords*, foreclosing retreat and compelling performance. Lena's agency is clear in the decision to wade toward the violin and play, though the cost of that choice (social, physical, relational) is not legible on the page; the water rises and images move, but no price is paid. The piece operates under Accumulative lens; escalation is achieved through deepening atmosphere and pattern convergence rather than causal reversal, which fits the design.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake signaled early: Elias seeks "the weight of a swallowed truth" tied to his failed prediction. Pressure tightens when the illustration appears (complication), intensifies when he identifies the flower and its burial association (escalation), and culminates in the excavation and photograph discovery (tightening that forecloses his prior stance). The note "You were wrong, but so were we" narrows options by redistributing guilt with visible cost. Agency is clear: he chooses to descend, dig, and carry the truth back. No coincidence resolves; the protagonist's decisions drive the turn. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—facing "the things that moved at night" and the truth Elias has been running from—is signaled early but remains abstract. Pressure tightens when the figure turns and Elias chooses to stay rather than run, then deepens when he offers the valve wheel. The clanking's cessation registers as consequence, but the cost (what Elias forfeits by acknowledging the ghost shift) is felt more than visible. One meaningful turn occurs; coincidence (the wheel fitting the panel) assists resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether to keep or release the new book—is signaled late (roughly two-thirds in) and resolved quickly. The keeper's witness-stance creates a low-agency frame: she observes change rather than driving it, and the story provides no live antagonist or competing desire to test her commitment. The release of the book narrows one option (possession) but the tightening feels modest because no alternative path was dramatized. Under the Accumulative lens, the pressure accrues through recurring motifs, but the final act lacks a visible trade-off or price that would elevate the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—解开 curl mystery and connect with Liora—is signaled early but never pressured. Liora's arrival at the creek answers the mystery without friction; no reversal or tightening choice narrows options. The eclipse gathering unfolds as planned with no visible cost: Elias plays, the town links, the sun returns, and the "first note of a song" is declared rather than earned through sacrifice or renunciation. Pressure is static, not escalating, under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: understanding what the walls have heard and why the dragons matter. Pressure coheres through accumulative textural deepening—diaries hint ("The axis is slipping"), the silo groans, the tapestry shivers—culminating in the tightening moment when Elara realizes the stories aren't behind her but "ahead, in the spaces between the threads." Agency is attention that forecloses her prior collection method; the cost is the abandonment of her historian role for an unknown threshold. The escalation is one meaningful turn under the Accumulative lens, meeting length requirements, though a second micro-constraint (a visible hesitation or price paid in the reaching) would sharpen the stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: recover the hidden specs and understand Linus's design. The discovery of the microdot (loose stone) narrows options, but Elias faces no visible trade-off—he simply accepts the woman's framing. The woman's arrival introduces external pressure, yet Elias's compliance feels frictionless; no dramatized choice between protecting the secret and fulfilling his father's plan. One meaningful tightening (microdot → photo → woman) is present, but the final turn lacks visible cost or agency under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding possession/stillness before it completes—is signaled early but remains abstract. One meaningful tightening occurs when "the anchor groaned, its walls shifting," and the violet "burned now, not with pain, but with clarity." However, protagonist agency is passive: Father Elias layers sound and applies violet, but the revelation arrives ("he saw") without a decision that forecloses a path. Coincidence (the anchor's responsive trembling) complicates but does not resolve, fitting the Accumulative lens, yet the cost of his "risking the unraveling" never materializes as a visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake: escaping chronological homesickness by "cracking open" the mirrored horizon through memory. Pressure accumulates through four memories that deepen her relationship to hidden sound and belief. The tightening is her shift from bitter laughter at the fortune to closing her eyes and "conducting" silence. However, no on-page cost or forfeited path is visible; the horizon "cracking just a little" is asserted without a legible price, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (conquer the labyrinth of self) and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias faces the scarred self and the choice crystallizes: "you can choose which version of yourself gets to walk out." However, the escalation is largely situational—visions complicate but do not force trade-offs with visible cost. The protagonist's final act (letting go of the door) is his decision, but the labyrinth collapse and return feel granted rather than won through a forfeiture that narrows live options on the page. Pressure is present but does not narrow options through a felt price at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mira's dominant stake—to break through emotional numbness—is signaled early and tightens when she reaches for the needle with "sharp" frustration, then deepens at the drum tap when she feels the silence "press against her skin like a second heartbeat." The escalation is driven by protagonist attention and endurance rather than external reversals, fitting the Accumulative lens, but the final image's cost is more emotional permission ("let it in") than a foreclosed path with visible price. The agency is genuine but the trade-off remains understated.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to investigate the sealed eastern quarter—is signaled early through the cryptic message and escalates through the prickle of being observed and the discovery of mechanical sounds. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias shifts from passive observation to the decision that "integrity demanded more than observation," narrowing his options. However, the escalation is largely internal and contemplative; no on-page opposition or visible cost (time, safety, resource) complicates his choice, and the "progressing laterally" method is declared rather than tested against resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering time's texture—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through sensory deepening (grotto's heartbeat, rope tightening/slackening) rather than causal reversals. The climactic choice (pull or leave the rope) is framed as impossible, yet Lirien's decision feels preordained by her motivation with minimal dramatized hesitation. The rope pull narrows options (commits to unraveling time) and the vision sequence shows cost (falling through moments, seeing the prisoner), but the escalation lacks a visible trade-off or forfeited alternative that would charge the stakes higher. One meaningful tightening is present but the price feels more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—coaxing music from a silenced place—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the hum's emergence, but no reversal or tightening occurs: the greenhouse cooperates, the fish synchronize, and the moment resolves without a trade-off or visible cost. The protagonist's agency is demonstration rather than decision; coincidence (the hum answering at the right tide) enables rather than complicates. No option is foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—selling grief through the petal—is clear, and the static's dissipation provides one micro-turn (the charge fades, the transaction completes). Yet pressure remains flat: Darian's acceptance is assured ("he never did"), removing tension, and Liora's detachment is declared rather than tested by a competing want. The "same time next week" confirms routine rather than escalation, and no on-page cost alters tactics—Liora simply tucks away the spent petal and steps back into the dark, repeating her opening posture. Under an Accumulative lens, one meaningful tightening is expected; here the cycle closes without deepening or a visible price that narrows future options.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake (uplifting silent contributors) is signaled early, and Elias's decision to deliver the photo provides one meaningful tightening. Yet the escalation lacks on-page friction: Mara's immediate agreement to the fund proposal bypasses conflict, and the coincidence of the misdelivered envelope both complicates and resolves without Elias facing a genuine trade-off. The cost of initiating the fund is promised, not demonstrated, and no live option is foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (graft onto community) is signaled early and tightens once when Liora sees the tag and places the sculpture, narrowing her options from solitary observation to public participation. The travelers' discovery and the arbor's blaze provide one meaningful pressure point. However, the turn feels more granted than fought; the tag appears just as she's about to give up, and acceptance follows immediately without friction or trade-off that would raise the cost into high-band territory.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—finding the threshold where echoes are born and borrowing time—is signaled early and pursued consistently. One meaningful choice occurs: Liora chooses the downward spiral over the upward path, narrowing her route. However, no reversals complicate her descent, and the hourglass resolves the quest without visible trade-off or foreclosed alternative. The final act (touching the hourglass) is determined rather than tested, and the cost of "uncaging the moment" remains told, not shown.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding ambiguous loss and reconnecting with his sister—is signaled early and coheres through the ritual. Pressure accumulates via atmosphere and intensifying sensation (breeze, glowing eyes, warmth in chest), consistent with the Accumulative lens. However, escalation is primarily textural rather than driven by protagonist agency narrowing options; Elias performs one action (placing the eyes, whispering) and the orchard responds. The resolution reweights his understanding but does not dramatize a trade-off or foreclosed path with sharp on-page cost. The tightening is sufficient for this length under the chosen lens, but agency remains passive-receptive.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Elias's need to validate Voss's work and perhaps emerge from hiding—is signaled early and sustained. The outage provides urgency, and Mara's arrival narrows his window. One meaningful tightening occurs (creaking floorboard → door opening → beam of light approaching). However, escalation under the Situational lens requires stance crystallization with cost; here the protagonist freezes in observation ("He could step forward... Elias closed his eyes") rather than making a choice that forecloses an option. The constraint (Mara's presence) complicates but does not force a decisive reconfiguration on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—whether to control or surrender to the sapling's transformation—is signaled early and tightens when the bark softens under her touch. One meaningful reversal occurs (branches twist toward her, forcing the realization), but the escalation lacks a visible price: Mara's surrender feels atmospheric rather than a trade-off between competing professional commitments or a tangible loss of method. Under the Accumulative lens, the pressure coheres, yet the final cost reads as conceptual rather than dramatized with on-page consequence that forecloses a prior path.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: the painter seeks resolution of the dreams and the meaning locked in the brooch/woman. Pressure tightens once when he finds the cave and realizes "she was here, in the amber, trapped," which narrows his options from solitary investigation to interpersonal exchange. The woman's appearance and her demand—"you paint to forget... there's more to see"—forces the final choice with agency (he hesitates, then takes her hand). The cost of being pulled under is felt but not yet paid on the page; the tide swallowing paths behind them registers as foreclosure with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—Elias seeking to hear/understand the cave's magic—is signaled early. The pilgrim's arrival introduces a second pressure ("magnify the magic"), but her agency drives the climax while Elias observes. The pearl crack and shadow surge constitute a reversal, yet it lands off Elias's choice; he lunges reactively. One meaningful tightening occurs (shadows coil, cave trembles), but the escalation is powered by the pilgrim's action rather than protagonist trade-offs. Cost is declared ("he hadn't understood its price") without a visible forfeiture that narrows his options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.2)
    One dominant stake is clear: reunite the valves to reveal suppressed history. The piece delivers one meaningful tightening when the three valves together form the harbor map, narrowing ignorance to knowledge. The grizzled guard's cooperation and Dain's reliable intel feel convenient rather than hard-won—no credible loss or tactical shift occurs when obstacles appear. The conceptual cost at closure (historical erasure confirmed) is legible but the protagonists don't pay a visible personal price on the page, which prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—Elias's drive to map hidden places and cross thresholds—is signaled early and escalates through a causal chain: discovery of arrows → lifting the manhole → descending → encountering the conductor's ultimatum. The woman's "Will you come?" forces a binary choice with clear cost: accepting means abandoning the known world. Agency is protagonist-driven; each step narrows options. The ticket punch hums and burns, creating a persistent constraint that shapes tactics (he must possess it to gain entry). One strong tightening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to believe the tower's legends—is signaled early and tightens when the tile flares and floods Elias with entangled memories. One meaningful pressure point occurs on-page: his decision to transcribe the memories, which forecloses his prior skeptic stance. The whale songs provide ambient urgency but do not create a ticking clock that forces tactical trade-offs. Cost is present (worldview shift, commitment to return) but more felt than sharply visible; the story does not dramatize what Elias sacrifices or omits by choosing belief over continued skepticism in a way that alters his next move on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—unlocking the amulet to learn what follows goodbye—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Kael lunges and Veyra reacts, channeling her awareness into the fragment, but this turn reads as reactive rather than a protagonist-driven choice that forecloses a path. The cost (Kael vanishes, fragment goes inert) is stated in summary rather than shown through visible loss or trade-off that alters her later tactics. No persistent constraint (injury, tool depletion, time pressure) shapes the final image, keeping the escalation functional but not viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will hand over the ink pot—is signaled when the woman names it. Pressure tightens once: her demand narrows Elias's options from refusing to testing her ("Prove it"). Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (Elias's choice to set the pot "between them"), but the cost remains implicit; we don't see what Elias forecloses by not keeping or surrendering the pot outright. The woman's backstory (brother in a cell) arrives late and is told, not tested, reducing the felt weight of the trade. The final beat ("by waiting actively") reweights the situation but doesn't force a visible sacrifice or trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—collecting textures of different times—is signaled early but remains abstract and unchallenged on the page. No reversal or tightening narrows options: the stationer writes, discovers mysterious ink, writes more, feels peace. The mysterious entry and train whistle gesture toward a haunting presence but don't force a trade-off or decision with visible cost. The closure moment ("The stationer's shop is never truly empty") is a thematic assertion without agency-driven pressure. Coincidence (the found page, the whistle) complicates atmosphere but does not escalate stakes or test commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—searching for "the seams where reality frayed"—is signaled early and sustained. The encounter with the woman offers a micro-turn (revealing shared quest) but Elias's agency remains observational; he doesn't face a choice that narrows options or imposes cost. The tide "coming in" at the end supplies atmospheric pressure but does not force a decision with visible tradeoff. One tightening deepening is visible (the scratched name reframes his search) yet the protagonist's passivity and lack of on-page forfeit cap escalation credit under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—disproving vs. understanding the Ephemeral Compass legend—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the seashell hum, the astronomer's vision, and the cello discovery, but escalation is additive rather than tightening: each beat adds information without foreclosing options or raising cost. The fisherman's question ("Do you listen, or do you let the past stay buried?") returns at the end, but Elias's choice to listen lacks a visible price; there is no forfeited path or dramatized trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving the raft's autonomy against investors—is signaled early and sustained. Lan's tactics (notes, sabotage, counter-graffiti) show agency, but the escalation feels more like a list of moves than a tightening that forecloses options. The privatization vote is declared urgent ("the night before"), yet no on-page reversal tests her commitment or forces a trade-off between competing goods. The final moment offers belief rather than a choice with visible cost. The pressure coheres but doesn't narrow decisively under the Situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake is clear: photograph the crater before it's destroyed. Pressure is diffuse—Elias carries out his task without meaningful obstacle or a choice that narrows options. The "three lunar nights outlasting" is summarized rather than dramatized. The final turn (pocketing the vial, accepting impermanence) lacks on-page cost; the bulldozers remain abstract, and no live tactical friction tests his commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—decoding the drone's feedback before the ship's departure—is signaled early and tightens as the anchor lifts. However, escalation is modest: Elias never faces a meaningful reversal or complication that forces a trade-off. The resolution (drone returns, feedback clear) arrives without visible cost or a narrowed option set. The time pressure (maiden voyage beginning) is declared but not dramatized through altered tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—finding the rivers' origin, the singular convergence—is signaled early and sustained. One tightening occurs when the keeper's muttered phrase ("or where the ice remembers") prompts Mira's realization, but this deepening hinges on thematic echo rather than a trade-off or foreclosed option. No on-page reversal tests Mira's commitment; the falcon's arrival and the phrasebook are complications inherited, not overcome. The request to go to the lake is an extension of intent, not a choice under duress with visible cost. Escalation is coherent but diffuse; under the Accumulative lens one meaningful pressure point suffices, yet the cost at closure remains implied.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—restore resonance to enable the town's echo-memory—is signaled early and pursued methodically. Pressure accumulates via density and cadence (day one silence, day three *click-click*, day five full murmur, day seven shimmer), consistent with the Accumulative lens, though the tuner faces no opposition or forced trade-off. The final act (seventh strike, light shimmer, departure) narrows options by foreclosing keeper status with visible cost: the town listens but is "not restored, not truly." Agency reads as endurance and calibration rather than decisive pivot. One meaningful deepening (day-three breakthrough) tightens the pattern; no explicit antagonist or reversal is required under this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—survive and answer the distress signal—is signaled early and tightens through the oxygen gauge, the diver's fragmented instruction, and the temple's resistance. One meaningful turn occurs when Lira shifts from attempting to "harness" the hush to offering something true (the vial). Agency is clear: her decision to uncork the vial forecloses her mother's gift and resolves the conflict. Cost is legible (the empty vial, the diver's dissolution) but the trade-off could feel sharper if we saw Lira hesitate longer or weigh competing uses for the perfume. No antagonist required; the temple's gathered hush provides coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: to "thread the labyrinth of his own story" and confront his father's lies. Pressure accumulates through the ledger discovery (father's name scratched out), the fabric-tearing noise, and the hovering shape. One tightening occurs when Elias speaks his name and the hush recoils—this narrows options (he must run) and forecloses the passive investigative path. However, the escalation lacks causal agency; the hovering shape appears without prior dramatized setup, and Elias's climactic choice (speaking his name) feels more externally prompted than internally driven. Cost is present but muted—he runs, chasing hush again—without visible sacrifice that reshapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (repaying the debt) is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when the bead triggers involuntary memory. The reversal—debt repayment is not gold but "the weight of remembering"—narrows Liora's escape and forces acceptance with felt cost. Agency is present: Liora closes her fingers around the bead, choosing to see the vision rather than flee. The bride applies pressure as silent witness rather than antagonist, which works under the Accumulative lens but means no direct confrontation escalates tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—transforming ruin to reverence—is signaled early. The footprints and needle discovery provide one meaningful tightening, narrowing her path to the loom. However, escalation is gentle; no live option is visibly foreclosed with cost, and the resolution reads cooperative rather than earned through struggle. The voice and labyrinth guide her more than her agency forces trade-offs. Pressure coheres under an accumulative lens but lacks a felt price at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake (restore lost faith) is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. The discovery montage offers no meaningful tightening—each find (child's sandal, priest's censer, mural) adds texture without narrowing options or raising cost. The sundial placement in the central chamber is the sole turn, yet it unfolds without resistance or trade-off; the chamber "trembled" and light spilled, granted rather than earned. The woman's validation ("You've returned") confirms rather than tests commitment. No visible price alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—solving the mystery of the letters and codes—is signaled early and drives Elias's investigation. The tightening occurs when the decoded message points to the arcade at dawn, but this is a reveal rather than a choice that forecloses options. The mother's appearance resolves the mystery without Elias having to decide, endure, or renounce anything; coincidence delivers the answer. No visible cost or trade-off is shown on the page at closure; the "searching for his own [name]" line is thematic summary rather than a felt price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—preventing the coup by spreading hidden truths—is signaled by mid-story and pursued consistently. Pressure tightens once: Liora discovers the date, realizes urgency, and acts. However, the escalation is smooth rather than forced by hard trade-offs; no doors close, no visible costs narrow her options before the ending. The scribe's curiosity and the crowd's arrival feel frictionless. Agency is present (she chooses to disguise herself and distribute fragments) but the final image of the coup being challenged happens off-page, diluting immediate consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—finding "the moment before deciding" and confronting the unsent apology—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure tightens when the spirits' song swells, condensation writes "Try," and the apparition appears, forcing Liora to speak aloud. However, the final act is ambiguous: she speaks "not to the apparition, but to the air," then pockets the shard and defers the letter again. This reads as a micro-deepening rather than a choice that narrows live options with visible cost, keeping the score in the mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—Lena's need to graft new meaning onto old wounds—is signaled early and braided with the boy's parallel fear. The coral fragments' synchronized pulse provides one meaningful tightening: connection replaces isolation. Under an Accumulative lens, the final word "Home" reweights prior anxieties. Yet no on-page choice narrows options or costs Lena a resource, relationship, or tactical path. The anesthetic numbs pain but doesn't degrade her decisions, and the Dr. Voss coordinates never force a trade-off. The ending reconfigures meaning but lacks a felt price that would push this into the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—rediscovering joy through art—is signaled early and tightens when Liora captures "the moment *before* the joy was lost." The reversal (hand now holding the apple) meaningfully reweights prior material. However, the turn occurs off-page during chemical development; the discovery is reported rather than dramatized as a choice under pressure. The old woman's line "You gave it back its joy" confirms the shift but costs remain more felt than visibly paid (no trade-off, constraint, or tactical alteration preceding the success).

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is clear: Elias came to restore certainty but the mural resists, revealing nested layers and supernatural agency. Pressure accumulates through the four awakenings, each tightening the supernatural grip (sound answering him, dishes moving, nickel reflecting Gabriel's face, trumpet becoming metal). The final beat—understanding the mural as door—operates as recognition rather than agency-driven choice; Elias does not decide to step through or refuse with visible cost on the page. One meaningful deepening is present, but escalation is driven by external revelation rather than protagonist trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (restart covert communication under the regime) is signaled early and tightens when the inspector arrives, forcing immediate tactical adjustment. The map moment narrows options—Elias commits despite visible risk. The ending shows messages planted with escalating boldness ("By the time the tax collectors noticed, it was too late"), demonstrating agency-driven escalation under the Causal lens. Cost is present but slightly abstract; the "warping had begun" implies consequences without fully dramatizing the price on Elias or the network.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: transmute pain into beauty, escape writer's block caused by the sister's absence. Pressure accumulates through sensory texture and the shell's responsive environment rather than external antagonist. The tightening occurs when Elias's reflection projections turn inward ("only his own face, fractured and weary"), forcing him past avoidance into writing. Agency manifests in the decision to write despite 73 sleepless nights and prior failures ("words always soured"). The cost is visible—three tear-stained pages, exhaustion—but the breakthrough feels somewhat soft; the shell "leaning in" and words arriving "without thinking" reduce the felt difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving the sound of forgotten names—is signaled early and sustained. The piece deepens through discovery (the ledger, the song, the method) but lacks a live tightening that narrows Liora's options or forces a trade-off. The bamboo tube challenge is resolved by patient iteration rather than escalating pressure. The ending reweights her purpose, but the cost (softened regret) reads as relief rather than a visible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—restore the symphonies and undo erasure—is signaled early and tightens when the voice demands a choice ("listen or turn away"), forcing Elara's final commitment. That moment narrows options with visible cost: she shatters the ink well and stands alone in uncertain silence. However, the escalation is more atmospheric than tactical; the curators' buried truth and the Velyrians' self-silencing enrich context but don't generate on-page opposition or complication that Elara must navigate. The cost is felt but not tested by competing pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—reconciling protection with honoring the past—is signaled early and persists. The envelope discovery provides a meaningful turn, but it arrives through coincidence rather than Mira's agency. The resolution ("they were dancing") asserts harmony without showing a trade-off or visible price paid on the page. One tightening beat is present (reading the letter), sufficient for this length, but the final stance crystallization lacks the felt cost required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: preserve/recover the lost songs, signaled early and tightened when Lena reveals the lyric sheet. The ledger discovery mid-story deepens mystery and narrows Elias's options (run or stay). Lena's offer forces a trade-off between solitude/safety and collaboration/exposure. The cost of choosing to stay is legible but understated—more crystallization than visceral sacrifice. One clear pressure point (ledger → lyric sheet → Lena's invitation) suffices for this length under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding Mira's disappearance and threshold sacredness—is signaled early. One meaningful deepening occurs: Elias moves from searching for answers to accepting that she left because she had to. Yet the turn lacks agency-driven escalation; no on-page reversal or choice narrows his options. The weather code and grain analysis are invoked but generate no tactical friction or live test. Cost is legible at closure (he walks away, lets go) but remains a realization rather than a forfeiture shaped by prior pressure under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding belonging—is signaled early and pursued through clue-gathering, but pressure remains informational rather than visceral. The "until sunrise" deadline is mentioned once and never narrows options or forces a sacrifice. The final chamber sequence offers discovery without a meaningful choice: Elias places the feather, the city answers, and when the passage closes he simply follows Liora out. No live option is foreclosed with on-page cost; the "silent promise" substitutes resonance for agency.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—why some paths disappear—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. The tunnel journey tightens space and light, and the crater glass's color shift from blue to red suggests escalation, yet no live option is foreclosed on the page. Liora's hesitation ("She stopped") deflates immediately without consequence. The resolution ("some pieces were meant to stay missing") is a philosophical acceptance rather than a choice that narrows tactics or pays a visible cost, leaving pressure more atmospheric than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Lira wants to break monotony with something new. The tossing of the bishop and the improvised dance constitute one meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens. The violinist's arrival functions as a complication that enables the final beat, but his appearance feels more serendipitous than earned by Lira's agency. Cost is conceptual (committing to return, investing in unpredictability) rather than a visible trade-off that narrows options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Liora's refusal to perform for a world that won't listen versus the chance to encode the old ways—is signaled early and tightens when the tattooist offers his skin. The nostalgia ban provides clear external risk (skinning alive), and her choice to tattoo him forecloses solitary safety for shared exile. Under the Situational lens, the pressure is coherent and the stance crystallization earns the closure. Weakness: the man's willingness to die is asserted rather than tested; a beat of hesitation or cost-negotiation would sharpen the escalation and make the mutual commitment feel less convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Elias's search for meaning in the "noctilucent reckonings"—is signaled early but remains abstract. Pressure accumulates atmospherically (dream, mist, atrium pull) rather than through narrowing options or a costly choice. The old woman's instruction ("throw it into the center") and the resulting vision offer a tightening, but Elias's agency is passive observation rather than decision. No visible price is paid; the resolution feels granted rather than earned, limiting escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—translating stolen voices/trauma into expression—is signaled early via Elias's scars and the note. Pressure accumulates as the stranger reveals the throat scar and takes the pen, but the escalation is textural rather than a tightening of options. The "rewriting the bargain" image implies healing, yet no prior path is visibly foreclosed; Elias's grief "soften[s], just a little" without demonstrating what he sacrifices or risks. One meaningful deepening is present but cost legibility at closure is weak.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—proving hope is a force via pattern-finding—is signaled early but never tested by meaningful opposition or cost. Elara arranges shells, the gauge activates on its own, and she declares success without sacrifice or trade-off. No on-page reversal narrows options; the needle's movement is a gift, not a consequence of her prior choices. Escalation under the Accumulative lens requires density increase or cadence shift that reweights the stake; here the final beat asserts resolution without visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—unraveling his father's mystery and the walls' secret—is signaled early and tightens as Elias moves deeper. The woman's appearance and the map introduce a meaningful pressure point, and the climate-shift context adds thematic weight. However, escalation operates more through accumulation (finding the negative, reading the diary, opening the door) than through a decision or reversal that narrows options. The final image is charged but stops at anticipation; Elias does not yet choose to engage the map or refuse it, so agency remains poised rather than exercised with on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—persuading the mirage into visibility—is signaled early and coheres under the Accumulative lens. The arrival of the bells provides one meaningful tightening that accelerates Liora's painting and crystallizes the mirage's edges. However, the piece lacks a visible price or trade-off: Liora's final belief costs nothing on the page, and no live option is foreclosed. The watchman's presence adds texture but does not generate reversals or escalate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether this treaty will hold—is signaled early. Kessar's question "What's left for you when the wars end?" introduces a secondary existential pressure but does not tighten options. The piece offers one micro-turn (Kessar's coin gesture shifts tone) but no escalation that narrows Liora's choices or raises cost. The final agreement feels preordained rather than wrested from competing goods; the "price of redemption" is invoked but not tested through a trade-off or visible sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving the extinct birds' echo—is signaled early and coheres through the piece. However, escalation is minimal: Elias walks, kneels, taps his phone. No reversal or tightening narrows his options; the dams open without friction, negotiation, or visible cost that alters later tactics. The accumulative lens cannot rescue the lack of pressure; the final act feels like execution of a plan rather than a choice forced by mounting stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—proving "resistance was possible"—is abstract and never tested by a concrete on-page dilemma. No reversal or tightening occurs: Liora approaches the sanctuary, solves three symbolic puzzles in sequence without setback, and leaves "lighter." The thread-untangling beats feel like checklist stations rather than escalating pressure. Coincidence does not resolve (the threads release through memory alone), but neither does protagonist agency narrow options or impose visible cost. The accumulative lens requires density increase or pattern break that reweights the stake; instead, each beat reiterates the same symbolic gesture without accumulating friction.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.1)
    Dominant stake—transforming how stories are told—is signaled early but remains abstract. No on-page reversal or tightening that narrows options. The argument with her brother is summarized, not dramatized. Liora's ritual (lighting candle, tracing symbols, speaking a story) proceeds without opposition or cost. The final line ("The work was just beginning") postpones stakes rather than testing them. No visible price paid that alters later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—honoring the last monarch migration—is signaled early and coheres. Pressure accumulates through the monarchs' arrival and Liora's signal-building, but no reversal or tightening forecloses a live option. The butterflies depart and Liora packs; this is a natural conclusion rather than a choice that narrows tactics or imposes visible cost. Agency reads as witness and ritual rather than decision under friction, limiting escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving forgotten names—is signaled early and sustained, but no reversal or obstacle complicates Elias's work; he proceeds from transcription to weaving to completion without friction. The ending offers a felt price ("if only for a moment," "their voices...ardent and fleeting"), yet the lack of on-page tightening or trade-off keeps escalation minimal. Under the accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening would suffice, but here the beats layer rather than narrow options, which places the score in the functional mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding path-choosing—is signaled early but remains abstract. The storm provides temporal pressure but does not force a trade-off. The dream sequence and the woman's exposition deliver answers without Elias facing a lived dilemma or cost. The key materializes as a solution rather than emerging from prior struggle. One modest tightening occurs when Elias steps into the storm, but the final turn hinges on the woman's gift rather than protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—preserving knowledge across regime collapse—is signaled in paragraph four and sustained through the tile's use and the figure's test. One meaningful tightening occurs when the figure challenges "You seek to bind what cannot be bound" and Nabu-sharru must clarify his intent, narrowing from binding the heavens to sealing a covenant with the future. The star-mirror revelation deepens the stake by reframing success (scholars in an unborn age) rather than reversing it. Agency is present but passive: the astronomer's final "let it be sealed" is acceptance rather than a decision that forecloses a live alternative with visible cost on the page. The mercenaries' arrival supplies external pressure but does not test the astronomer's commitment in a way that alters his tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Elara confronting her village's destroyer—is signaled early but never truly tested. Veyra's amnesia removes the ethical friction; cellular memory solves the persuasion challenge without Elara risking anything. The "scheming pacifist" setup promises tactical complexity, but the sanctuary's magic provides all solutions. No visible price is paid; the text tells us "the weight lift[ed]" without showing what was forfeited or which path was foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—capturing the runaway dream—is signaled early and pursued on the page. The glass mountain's sudden appearance and the climb provide escalation, and the dream's descent offers a reversal (it comes to him when he matches its rhythm). However, the protagonist faces no meaningful trade-off or visible cost; the sextant mends, the fog recedes, and he smiles. Under the Accumulative lens, the tightening is present but the price legibility is weak, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Liora seeks to persist and bridge wisdom after a breach. The girl's broken pendant introduces a tightening—repair becomes a test of that persistence. The exchange of ribbon commentary and the final peach gift constitute one meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens, reweighting "safety" from talisman to self-knowledge. Agency is decision and endurance with visible cost (Liora keeps the ribbon, accepts the peach, internalizing loss). Pressure coheres but remains gentle; no reversal narrows options sharply, keeping the score mid-7s.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—solving the pistachio shell's mystery—is signaled early and tightens when the curator moves from scholarly cataloging to active inquiry in the bath. The realization that "emptiness was the point" and the orchard's shift in response constitute a meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. However, the escalation is primarily cognitive rather than driven by external pressure or trade-offs; the curator faces no visible cost or foreclosed path until the final decision to "pursue" rather than "own," which reads as abstract stance rather than embodied consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (find the library) is signaled early. One tightening occurs at the renegotiation beat, where Elara trades expertise for a sister-search. The door-opening is a threshold but lacks visible cost—no stamina spent, no tool lost, no social credit burned. Escalation under Accumulative lens requires density increase or cadence shift that reweights the stake; here the final image adds information (sister found) but doesn't foreclose a live option or charge prior pressure with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding Liora's disappearance and the chimera-twin myth—is signaled early but never tested by a tightening that forecloses options. Elias encounters clues (tarot card, ledger, mirrors) in sequence without opposition or trade-off; the garden is reached without obstacle. The final exchange with Liora offers no decision point: she speaks, he agrees, fog swallows them. No reversal or deepening alters his tactics; coincidence (the ship's layout, the garden's availability) facilitates rather than complicates. Cost is conceptual (loss of individual identity?) but not legible on the page as a forfeited path or visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake (translate confusion into clarity about House Vaelis) is signaled early. Liora encounters one meaningful reversal when she discovers obliteration instead of exile, but this arrives via vision rather than on-page agency that narrows options. The final choice to archive lacks visible cost—no tradeoff between secrecy and exposure is dramatized, and the door's vanishing removes consequence rather than imposing it.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (find and preserve the bloom of hush) is signaled in paragraph four and tested immediately when the bloom proves fragile. Escalation is causal and protagonist-driven: Ryn's touch stills the world, her binding shrinks the bloom, and the beings' awareness forces her flight. The binding decision forecloses staying or further exploration, a visible trade-off. The bloom's collapse is an on-page cost that narrows future options (she has a fragment, not the whole). One clear reversal (beings sense her) tightens pressure and the final act (clutching the humming stone, emergence into wind) reweights her original goal with earned limitation.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: rekindle the idea of light and prove coincidences have meaning. One meaningful tightening occurs when the prism fractures starlight and reveals the beacon's pulse, narrowing options from passive custodianship to active journey. However, escalation is gentle; no genuine obstacle or loss complicates the walk toward the beacon. The coincidence that resolves (prism → beacon signal) is the same coincidence Elias seeks to validate, creating a circular proof without friction or agency test. Cost (leaving the pavilion) is present but not viscerally contested.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—salvaging the past before it dissolves—is signaled early and coheres under an Accumulative lens. Pressure accumulates through sensory intensification and recursive meditation rather than causal reversal. The third monument deepens understanding (the observatory as echo-chamber, not answer-vault), but this realization doesn't narrow options or force a visible trade-off; Elara's final choice to walk the fog bridge backward is declared, not tested against cost on the page. The story delivers one meaningful tightening but the price of her stance remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—bring light where none is left—is signaled early via the mosaic note. One meaningful tightening occurs when Liora ignites the torches and the shadow-figures appear, shifting her understanding from defying hopelessness to remembering it. However, this tightening is realized through passive perception (she sees the figures) rather than a choice that narrows options or forces a trade-off. The kerosene rag is nearly spent when she lets it fall, suggesting a resource cost, but that action is described rather than dramatized as a decisive sacrifice that alters her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—Liora's avoidance of the brother's question—is signaled early and pressure tightens when the cicada vanishes and she realizes "the door it opened wasn't in the grotto, but in the silence she had left behind." Her agency is renunciation of continued avoidance, an Earned Stasis that forecloses further escape. The cost is legible: she must face the pause. One meaningful tightening (the cicada sinking, the realization) suffices under the Accumulative lens, though the escalation remains more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Liora's need for space versus her father's prohibition—is clear early. Her decision to step onto the trellis despite claustrophobia provides one meaningful tightening under the situational lens. The boy's dialogue and the doll exchange deepen her understanding but do not escalate pressure; his "next time" line is a micro turn, not a reversal. Gravity's inversion creates urgency, yet the cost of her choice (returning to the bunker, now knowing freedom exists) remains conceptual rather than viscerally demonstrated.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—teaching silence to comfort grief—is signaled early and tightens when Elias diagnoses the woman's attempt to "catalyze" and "force" silence into shape. The reversal arrives when he stops the gondola and models receptive stillness, altering her tactic from control to surrender. The cost is visible in her prior tension and the pen's long hesitation; agency lies in her choice to close her eyes and listen. Under the Accumulative lens, this single deepening plus cadence shift (train whistle returns, pen moves) suffices. However, the resolution feels somewhat convenient—one directive and a moment of quiet dissolve complex grief—without additional on-page friction or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—finding the unclaimed throne to restore a steward—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through discovery beats: waterfall, grove, flake, mural, staircase, chamber, throne. Yet no on-page reversal or tightening narrows Veyra's options or forces a trade-off. The ruby flake dissolves conveniently when she sits; no loss or cost alters her tactics. The "until sunrise" timeframe appears only in the penultimate sentence, retroactively declaring urgency rather than shaping prior decisions. Under the Accumulative lens, the ending should reweight the stake with cost, but the throne simply "settles onto her shoulders" without a visible price or path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to answer the door and re-engage—is signaled early and tightens when the child reveals the matching scar. The keeper's hesitation and the doorknocker's wild swing create pressure, and the final touch forecloses her isolation with visible cost (her own lungs expand). One meaningful deepening occurs when recognition links past and present. However, the child's arrival is coincidental (she "found you" without prior setup), and the keeper's agency at closure is reactive rather than a hard-won choice. Cost is felt but not fully causal; escalation is present but convenience dilutes it.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—escape from regret via the quantum swap—is signaled early and tightens at the porthole. Turning the bolt counterclockwise forecloses the easier path, but the price (keeping his broken history) is told in summary rather than felt in the beat. The pivot to teaching workers arrives off-page, undercutting agency at closure. One meaningful tightening is present; cost clarity is the limiting factor for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake (uncovering the family's fall) is signaled early and pressure tightens when Elias steps onto the bridge and turns the crank, narrowing his focus to the standing-wave revelation. Yet the escalation is primarily informational; the protagonist receives the truth rather than making a choice that costs him something on the page. No visible trade-off or foreclosed option accompanies the climactic moment, leaving the cost abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—capturing the shape of possibility—is signaled early but remains abstract. Aldric's action (unsnapping the sword belt) is a renunciation, yet it feels like capitulation rather than a tightening choice with visible tradeoff. The woman's appearance and the marionettes' surge happen *to* him; escalation is atmospheric rather than driven by protagonist decision. One meaningful pressure point (the program warming, the woman's offer) deepens the texture, but cost at closure is asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—uncovering Daniel's story—is signaled early and tightens once (button → landlady → postcard). However, the escalation relies on convenient information handoffs rather than protagonist-driven reversals: the landlady "remembered" and "pulled out a postcard" without prior setup or cost to Elias's inquiry. The resolution (writing the note) feels like a culmination of research rather than a choice that forecloses a live option with visible price, keeping this in mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—exposing revised histories to crack the regime's illusion—is signaled early and escalates through the tunnel descent, console discovery, and enforcer arrival. Lira's agency drives each turn: she chooses to use the key, to upload the drive, to press ENTER despite armed opposition. The broadcast succeeds, and the enforcers' hesitation dramatizes immediate consequence. Cost is legible in her forward step toward capture, though the final price (death or imprisonment) is deferred off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—hushing the prophecy before it takes root—is signaled early and coheres under the Accumulative lens. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elias "understood: the only way to hush the prophecy was to play it back," narrowing his tactical approach. Agency appears as attention and endurance (playing "until his lungs burned"), and the lighter case afterward implies cost. However, no live opposition or trade-off tests the commitment; the music simply "dissolved" the whispers without friction or failure risk, leaving escalation felt but not dramatized through contested pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—decode the message in falling leaves—is signaled early. Pressure does not escalate under the Accumulative lens: the moonstone dust multiplies, Liora arranges leaves into names, but no tightening choice narrows options or forces a trade-off. The overnight dream-transformation (moss-stained hands, vine-tangled hair) is coincidental rather than driven by protagonist agency. The final act (building a larger monument, arranging leaves) repeats prior moves without visible cost or consequence that alters later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—following the compass rose to understand the broken clock—is signaled early and escalates through three spatial moves (docks → greenhouse → cavern → city). One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias steps into the waterfall's mist, narrowing his options to commitment. The clock's activation at the end is a protagonist-driven act, but the visible price is not dramatized: no lost tool, no bodily cost, no social forfeiture appears on the page. The city's pause suggests consequence, yet the outcome reads as liberation rather than trade-off, and "uncertainty was not the enemy" lands as theme statement rather than felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: understanding Elias's vanishing and the coin's theft. The carved name reversal meaningfully tightens pressure—Liora's assumption of theft transforms into recognition of confession. The final act (coin pressed into Elias's palm) is protagonist-driven and forecloses the path of judgment with visible gesture. Cost legibility is moderate; the "fingers lingering" moment and the phrase "no longer heavy with it" signal relief more than sacrifice, softening the trade-off's felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—finding real laughter to remember his own humanity—is signaled early and pursued through his listening and approach. The woman's appearance provides the pressure point: her broken melody and confession create the opportunity, and her gift of laughter (plucked from the harp's song) narrows his existential burden into a tangible warmth. One meaningful tightening occurs when she recognizes him and chooses to stay rather than flee, leading to the exchange. The resolution is protagonist-enabled (he listens, sits, receives) with visible cost: her departure into light and his transformation from ghost-like to embodied at dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering "the mathematics of mercy"—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through sensory triggers and the stranger's appearance, but escalation lacks a meaningful tightening driven by protagonist agency. The vial offers a solution without Elias wrestling a trade-off or foreclosing an option; he hesitates briefly then drinks, and the revelation arrives via external gift. The ending gesture ("braced himself") suggests acceptance but no visible price is paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—honoring overlooked histories—is signaled early and held. Pressure accumulates through the fragment's hum, the painting's hidden map, and the night of writing, but escalation under the Accumulative lens is modest: the fragment dictates rather than Liora wrestling with trade-offs. The ending reconfigures her understanding ("retrieval" vs. translation) but without narrowing options or visible cost; she returns to the market empowered, not diminished. One meaningful deepening occurs, sufficient for this length, but the final image lacks felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—sealing the temporal wound to free the ghosts—is signaled early and tightens when Mira moves from observation to action. The barrel's application is protagonist-driven and narrows options (she cannot simply repair the elevator mechanically). One meaningful pressure point: the discovery of the fracture forces her theory into a test. Cost is present (the lift of burden, ongoing vigilance) but somewhat abstract; a sharper price—failed first attempt, tool damage, or a visible renunciation—would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—halting the library's collapse—is declared but never tested by a decision that forecloses an option. Elias places the paper and the world dissolves; no reversal, no visible tradeoff, no loss that alters his later stance. The whisper complicates by triggering the rupture, yet coincidence (faceless messenger delivers it) initiates the sequence. Under an accumulative lens, one deepening or tightening is required; here pressure is asserted ("the rupture deepened") without a protagonist choice that narrows his path or costs him something legible.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is clear: Elias vs. the Core's reductive cataloging. Pressure is declared (the team will "strip the asteroid bare") but remains off-page threat rather than escalating on-page confrontation. The peak choice—returning to the deepest chamber, placing the shard, speaking verse—arrives without prior failed attempt or visible cost that narrows options. Liora's challenge ("You're erasing it") supplies thematic friction but does not force a trade-off or adaptation in Elias's tactics. The ending gesture reads as unearned success rather than a decision with legible price.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.5)
    Dominant stake—reclaim stolen light, mend fractures within—is signaled early but remains abstract. The only on-page tightening is Elias's recoil from the memory, followed immediately by resolution via the stranger's repetition. No reversal narrows options; the chip enables the final act without cost. Coincidence (the weeping woman delivers the chip) initiates the plot without protagonist agency. The ending restores balance through insertion, but Elias faces no trade-off: no tool is broken, no relationship severed, no path foreclosed. Pressure accumulates atmospherically but does not escalate through protagonist choice.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding why the factory closed and what the lagoon demands—is signaled early and tightens when Elias decides to delve. The compass spinning then stilling at the submerged arch is a clear pressure point. However, the final act (uncorking the vial over the water) reads more as acceptance than a choice that forecloses alternatives; the cost is felt in the vial's hum but the trade-off between collecting and being claimed needed one more visible renunciation on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—Elias finding/understanding the archway and his role in it—is signaled early. The piece deepens through the lantern slide shattering and rearranging, then Mara's arrival, but escalation is gentle: Elias accepts each revelation without significant resistance or cost until the final carving. The bridge-building act is a meaningful tightening, but the ensemble pauses to watch rather than opposing or complicating his work, reducing friction. The storm "quieting, as if listening" is atmospheric but not a dramatized consequence of Elias's choice.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—understanding why flowers bloom at night—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening occurs when the postcards spread across the altar and the stained-glass flowers "seemed to glow brighter," narrowing interpretive options toward the epiphany. However, the protagonist's agency is passive observation and summary insight rather than a decision that forecloses a path. No visible trade-off or tactical cost; the ending grants resolution without renunciation or endurance that constrains later options.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (uncovering Miriam's truth) is signaled early, but escalation is mechanical: each new piece of evidence arrives on cue without narrowing Elara's options or forcing trade-offs. The lagoon's retrocognitive trap and the pursuing men's arrival are external complications, not consequences of Elara's choices. The zeppelin escape resolves tension via Rourke's timely lift-off and the lagoon's convenient elimination of antagonists, undercutting protagonist agency. No visible price is paid—Elara retrieves the ledgers intact and escapes unscathed, leaving the cost abstract ("never truly buried") rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake—open the bottle or reimagine the town—is signaled early but never tightens into a forced trade-off. Elias's shift from physical attempts to mental experiment is a turn, but it lacks visible cost: no dramatized exhaustion, no forfeited resource, no narrowing of options. The ending pivot (letting the image go) is passive and coincidental—the town revives without Elias paying a legible price or making a choice that forecloses a path. Pressure is declared ("days" of staring) but not escalated through failed attempts or compounding consequences; the resolution feels granted rather than earned by protagonist agency under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: document the city's grief and determine if silence is "void or vessel." No reversal or tightening narrows options; Elias performs ritual actions (recites languages, records sounds) without facing a decision point or trade-off. The "accidental prophecy" realization shifts his interpretation but does not alter his tactics or exact a visible cost. Pressure remains descriptive rather than escalating under the accumulative lens; the final act (packing the phonograph) confirms understanding without dramatized consequence or forfeited path.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering the texture of borrowed time to reopen the past—is signaled early and drives Liora's action with the acorn cap and hatchling. One meaningful deepening occurs when she presses the cap to the hatchling's chest and glimpses the greenhouse, narrowing her understanding and forging a path forward. The cost is conceptual (accepting the vortex inheritance's weight) and the ending reconfigures her stance from preservation to forward carry. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres, though Liora's agency is more receptive than decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to sound the alarm—is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful reversal: Liora judges the storm weeping, releases the rope, then the storm "changes its mind" and she must act. The escalation is causal (her misjudgment narrows her window) and the cost is legible on the page ("she had been wrong, but she had been listening"). The piece enters the 7-band because the tightening forecloses a path with felt consequence. It does not reach higher because the secondary pressures (priests' installation, villagers' safety) remain somewhat abstract and the wire-swap itself, while clever, doesn't constrain the climax as tightly as it might.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—Elias's need to find meaning in his custodial role—is signaled early and tightens when the star's descent offers validation. The evening alarm and star-tracing act as a meaningful turn that reweights his self-perception, and the morning return demonstrates the cost (he cannot go back to seeing himself as "just" a janitor). However, the escalation is more contemplative than driven by high-pressure agency; the star arrives as gift rather than through Elias's choices, and no live option is visibly foreclosed. The resolution earns its quiet weight but lacks the sharp trade-off or visible price that would push into the 8+ range under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: preserving silence and the weight of unspoken words. The ghosts' gathering near the box and the woman's insistent gesture tighten pressure in one meaningful escalation under the Accumulative lens. Elias's agency is quiet but present: he hesitates, lifts the lid, reads the message, closes the box, and releases the flower—choices that foreclose his prior covenant with visible cost (the ghosts dissolve, solitude shifts). The resolution is earned by his perception and the ghost's dramatized insistence. Cost is felt in the lighter silence and the acknowledged broken covenant.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding time's texture and stitching it back—signals early and escalates through fragment discovery, key acquisition, and dream revelation. The piece delivers one meaningful deepening when Elias realizes the time capsule is a person's absence, reweighting prior clues. However, the urn's healing and role-assignment arrive through dream and passive receipt rather than protagonist agency under pressure. No live option is foreclosed with visible cost; Elias accepts the keeper role without struggle or sacrifice on the page. The final act of writing tags is generative, not a choice between competing goods, limiting felt escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: tending to grief and discovering a way forward. The piece tightens once when Mira sees the woven dawns and decides to write—this moment reweights her stance from passive observation to active creation. The kite string snap complicates but does not resolve. Under the Accumulative lens, the deepening is meaningful but the cost remains conceptual (accepting incompleteness) rather than a visible on-page price that forecloses a path. No reversal or hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—preserving the orchard against developers—is signaled early and tightens through Elias's afternoon work. The one-week deadline creates urgency, and his remodeling (wrapping wire, shaping arches) narrows his options: he cannot stop the developers but can force them to confront a labyrinth. The cost is visible (his remaining time, his failing body) but not acute in the moment; the escalation is more accumulative (density of wire work, animal trust) than a sharp turn. The fox and badger scenes add texture but no reversal or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—understanding the chemistry of homecoming—is signaled early and tightens when Elias must concede the amber to Liora's mortar. The convergence of footprints and the dust's glow create one meaningful pressure point. Minor slip: Elias's agency at closure is diluted; Liora handles the amber, and the reaction occurs passively. The escalation under Accumulative lens is sufficient, but the protagonist's final act feels observational rather than decisively costly.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake is signaled early: Elias seeks to "fertilize the idea of return" after the reef's death and the battlefield's forgetting. Pressure accumulates through atmospheric density and the heron's implicit invitation, but escalation remains textural rather than a choice under stress. The scattering of seeds is a meaningful gesture, yet coincidence (the heron's arrival) enables rather than complicates, and no live option is visibly foreclosed. The ending offers endurance and patience but lacks a dramatized tradeoff or cost that would raise the stakes past contemplative ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—whether to answer the call and search for the missing—is clear, and the phonograph message tightens pressure by revealing survivors. However, the story ends at the threshold: Elias decides to go but does not face an on-page reversal or pay a visible price that narrows options. The tightening occurs (message → decision) but lacks a second beat or felt cost at closure to meet high-band escalation standards. Agency is present but not yet tested under meaningful resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—mapping time and making the station a library—is signaled early. The anomaly's flicker provides one meaningful tightening that narrows focus to the tear in the void. Elias's agency at closure is decision (reaching for the sketchbook), but the text does not show what he forgoes or what immediate price crossing the threshold will exact. The compass and sketches complicate the moment, yet escalation under the Accumulative lens needs a visible or felt cost in the final image to enter the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (retrieve the sundial lid) is signaled early and pursued consistently. The guardian's challenge creates one meaningful tightening when Lirien "miscalculated," forcing adaptation. However, the resolution lacks visible cost—she gets exactly what she came for, and the reframing (object→question) feels more like a philosophical upgrade than a trade-off. The stakes shift from external (retrieve relic) to internal (embrace wonder) without forfeiting the original goal.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Liora's desire to unbind from scripted identity—is signaled early and coheres throughout. One meaningful deepening occurs when the historian challenges her method and she asks him to teach her, narrowing her path from solitary pattern-spelling to collaborative historiography. However, the escalation lacks an on-page cost that visibly forecloses options; the shift feels more like willing acceptance than a forced trade-off. The interregnum provides situational pressure, but coincidence (the historian's convenient arrival and expertise) complicates without the protagonist driving the key turn through her own agency under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (understand home / find the stone) is signaled early and coheres. The feather-journal map discovery provides one meaningful tightening that narrows Elias's path. The descent escalates sensory pressure ("mercury in his blood surging," stairs to tunnels to mouths), but coincidence—finding the stone exactly where the map leads—resolves the search without protagonist trade-off. The stone-touch revelation and feather dissolution occur, but no live option is foreclosed; Elias gains understanding without visible sacrifice, reducing cost legibility under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Elias's need to forgive himself—is signaled early and braided with the platinum labyrinth investigation. One meaningful tightening: the black thread's discovery and the mirror-door confrontation force Elias into the memory where he must face his mistake. The resolution is earned by Liora's line ("You only get to forgive yourself") and Elias's resulting exhale/stillness, a renunciation of the endless guilt loop with on-page cost (labyrinth cools, fidgeting stops). Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens, though the mirror sequence leans passive—Elias observes more than he chooses—slightly reducing agency at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—Lira's need to "refract a single truth into many" before the ritual—is signaled early but remains abstract and never tested by a concrete on-page cost. No meaningful tightening occurs: Echo's arrival offers enablement without complication, the poetry beats repeat without escalation (blade/whetstone, pale spire, canyon—each receives applause but no consequence), and the final choice ("The ritual could wait") defers rather than forecloses a path. Agency is present in Lira's decision to speak, but the cost is conceptual only ("courage to speak") and not dramatized as a trade-off that alters later tactics. Coincidence (Echo's timely appearance and the spire's convenient revelation) complicates without forcing harder choices.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—conjuring meaning from fragments—is signaled early and coheres. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias discovers the pockmark-scar map, narrowing his approach from abstract alchemy to concrete pattern-matching. The final beat (pressing charm to statue) forecloses passivity and dissolves the threat of oblivion, but the agency feels slightly passive: the statue splits "with purpose" and memories "flood back" rather than Elias extracting them through struggle. Cost is present in the breath held and the workshop's shudder, meeting the threshold for this band.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—returning to keep a promise buried beneath the light—is signaled early. Elias's wrong turn and the shell's evasion create one meaningful tightening when he lunges and finds the hidden tunnel. However, the escalation plateaus; the older paintings and blank canvas appear without resistance, and the wet palette's convenience ("as if someone had been here just moments before") undercuts agency at closure. The final act of painting lacks a visible trade-off or foreclosed alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.9)
    One dominant stake is clear: proving the whisper thesis. The vial drop constitutes a single escalation that tests the premise, and the echo provides atmospheric confirmation. However, Elias faces no meaningful opposition or trade-off—Maren's skepticism is passive, and no cost (time, reputation, safety) is legibly paid for the experiment. The resolution feels inevitable rather than earned by a choice that forecloses an option. Under the situational lens, pressure is coherent but static; the story deepens texture without a turn that narrows Elias's path.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake (following the calls to find his sister or the lost) is signaled early but never tightens into a trade-off or narrowed choice. The midnight phone call delivers coordinates without complication; Elias packs and leaves with no visible obstacle, loss, or tactical shift. Pressure remains flat: he walks toward discovery with the same hopeful posture throughout. One meaningful deepening or cost-laden choice is absent, keeping this below the 8.0+ entry band.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—cultivating psychological safety versus confronting enforced honesty—is signaled early and tightens through one major reversal: the eye amplifies truth instead of occluding it, forcing Mira to choose burial and acceptance. Her agency drives the closure (she digs, buries, relinquishes silence) with visible cost: "Her fear remained." The empathy-virus context and involuntary truthfulness raise the price of confrontation. Pressure coheres under the Causal-Accumulative lens and escalates meaningfully when the eye "demands attention" and the dream sequence forecloses retreat, narrowing her to the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—decode the stranger's final gesture—is signaled early. Pressure coheres through Elias's investigative choice ("not by digging through pockets… observe the gaps"), and the borrowed memories deepen understanding in one meaningful tightening. However, escalation is modest: Elias encounters no opposition, and the final decision to keep the boutonnière does not foreclose a live alternative path with visible cost. The stranger's passive death and Elias's receptive role limit agency at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—honor the shop promise versus pursue the hidden path—is signaled early and tightens when the chip warms and the door appears. The water rising adds urgency, narrowing options. The final act (inserting the chip) is protagonist-driven and forecloses the inherited duty with conceptual cost. However, the trade-off between "hollow promise" and new hope is more told than tested through competing on-page pressures; one additional complication or micro-reversal would have elevated escalation. Cost clarity is present but somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake (unravel recurring dreams) is signaled early via the scroll and starlight symptoms. Pressure coheres through the ascent—air thins, world shrinks—but no reversal narrows options; the queen proceeds unopposed to the mirror, touches it, and transforms. The mirror woman's exposition ("memories," "summons") replaces dramatized discovery. Agency at closure is thin: the touch is executed without visible trade-off or cost. One tightening (the scroll's warning) sets the journey, but escalation flattens once she enters the grotto; coincidence (the mirror awaits, the transformation completes) resolves rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding Elias's cryptic return and revaluing the past—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias appears and offers the vial, forcing Liora to confront what she sought versus what he achieved. However, the escalation is more conceptual than visceral; the "cost" of Elias's transformation ("time... the kind you feel") is asserted rather than shown in tactics or sacrifice. The final choice to "share" the presence lacks a clear foreclosed alternative or visible price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—Elias distilling chaos, competing with past selves—is signaled early and sustained. The scroll's message tightens dread, and the fire-clutch moment offers a potential tactic (burn it), but Elias doesn't choose; the door interrupts. Pressure accumulates atmospherically yet the protagonist never forecloses an option or pays a visible price on the page. One meaningful intensification (door-rattle) arrives via external coincidence rather than protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: Clara seeks meaning restoration; Elias must map absence into presence. The request "humanize it" and Clara's revelation about the boy deepen pressure in one meaningful turn. The etching decision narrows options (he commits to symbolic labor), and the cost—emotional exposure, years of displacement confronted—is legible but not dramatized as a visible trade-off (e.g., no shown exhaustion, no other customer waiting, no grief physically manifested in the act). Escalation is steady under the Accumulative lens but lacks a second tightening point.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—transforming grief and failure into usable magic—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Liora deliberately lets the ink harden, reversing her prior approach. However, the reversal feels more like a thematic pivot than a pressure-driven escalation with visible cost. The new rune appears as a gift rather than the result of agency that forecloses a path. No live trade-off is dramatized; the storms will return, but Liora's smile suggests resolution without sacrifice. Cost is asserted ("scars are stories") but not legible in a concrete on-page action or forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear early: Elias seeks to deliver an overdue apology and reconnect with his guilt. The ritual with the copper wire provides a tightening beat that narrows options (will it work or fail again?), and the moment when he hears his own voice constitutes a meaningful deepening that forecloses his twenty-year avoidance with visible cost. The orchard's impending destruction operates as a time constraint that adds urgency. Agency is present in his choice to perform the ritual and accept the imperfect result. Slight gap: the stakes remain largely internal, with no external antagonist to test his commitment further.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake (unify the illusions / preserve truth before the universe forgets) is signaled early. The "universe's hiccup" establishes abstract threat, but no on-page tightening narrows Elara's options—she kneels, presses the book, speaks definitions, and the void complies. The transition from temple to void is a shift in location, not a reversal or deepening that forecloses a path. Agency at closure (speaking definitions aloud, weaving threads) occurs without visible resistance or cost; the hiccup "smooths into silence" without dramatized friction.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake signaled early: restore the clocks' function and understand the horizon anomaly. One meaningful tightening occurs when the mantle-clock key refuses to catch, forcing Elias to the master clock and then to the blood-drop choice. That choice forecloses passivity and enacts a physical cost (the bright, clean pain). The escalation is visible but thin: most beats are observational until the final act. No secondary reversals complicate the path; the Harkin logs supply context but do not alter Elias's present options until he integrates their metaphor at the end. Cost legibility is present but arrives late.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—decoding her father's cryptic system to understand his final theory—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the matchbook flame transforms the lantern's light and rearranges the equations. However, the escalation is textural (accumulation of clues) rather than a choice under pressure that narrows options. The resolution ("she would pay his debts... not by playing the games he'd lost") asserts agency but does not show a visible cost or foreclosed path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is Mara's refusal to fix the callers, which escalates when the woman signals readiness and the boy stops calling. The "teach endings how to begin" motif reframes earlier passivity. However, the escalation is largely summary (the woman "didn't speak," the boy "stopped calling") rather than a dramatized turn where Mara's choice narrows her options. The cost—her wondering—is conceptual and undramatized, preventing higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: preserving Liora's memory versus letting her go. Pressure tightens through reflection and the locket's physical presence, culminating in the release. The act of dropping the locket forecloses the preservation path with visible cost. One tightening is sufficient for this length. However, the escalation is more contemplative than urgent; Elias's internal debate does not encounter on-page resistance or a complicating reversal, and the decision reads as preordained rather than wrested from competing impulses under immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—curing loneliness—is signaled early and remains coherent. One pressure point exists: Elias offers the moon rock and the logistician reframes the transaction as catalysis rather than trade, then departs. This constitutes a single tightening, but it does not narrow live options through Elias's agency; instead, the logistician's unilateral reinterpretation and exit impose the turn. The cost is conceptual (he paid his debt forward) rather than a visible trade-off or forfeited tactic, and no escalation precedes the final beat—Elias waits, the logistician arrives, the exchange occurs, and the logistician vanishes without on-page resistance or adaptation from Elias.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—finding the stillpoint to understand herself—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the trail of notes and the compass's guidance, tightening when the forest parts to reveal the clearing. At the tree, the melody swells and Liora presses her palm, triggering the emotional flood; this deepens the stake by naming her unspoken feelings. The cost is conceptual: she will never find the stillpoint again, but she now carries its map. Under Accumulative lens, this single intensification and its opportunity cost satisfy the length, though the peak moment leans on summary rather than a tactical trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—correcting the town's corrupted memory—is signaled early but never tested on the page. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; Liora moves from doubt to resolve without obstacle, cost, or foreclosed path. The anomaly's time-blurring could create pressure but instead functions as excuse ("a misstep today could be erased tomorrow"), deflating stakes. Elias's encouragement is supportive rather than oppositional. The ending intent ("decide what to keep") promises escalation but does not deliver it within the text.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (translate silence into music) is signaled early and threads through gestures, camera framing, invisible orchestra. One meaningful deepening occurs when Lena's hands weave patterns that "seemed to hum," narrowing from concept to near-realization. Elias's "Keep going" acts as encouragement rather than reversal; no on-page trade-off or tightening forecloses options. The escalation reads as accumulative intensity rather than causal pressure, and the cost at closure (feeling seen vs. forgotten) is declared but not paid in visible forfeit.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the arsonist's purpose—is signaled early and tightens once when Elara realizes the seal's function. However, the escalation is cognitive (learning the truth) rather than a choice under competing pressures; no live option is foreclosed. The Ember Scribe's acceptance of her help arrives without resistance, deflating potential conflict. The lock turning implies future cost but does not dramatize a present price paid. One meaningful deepening (promise-as-lock twist) shifts knowledge, but agency remains observational until the final collaborative act.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—reach the lagoon to find Liora—is signaled early and drives the escape. One tightening occurs when the restraints snap and Elias commits to the run, narrowing his options. However, the escalation relies heavily on the serum's effects rather than protagonist agency; Elias moves through the sequence more as vessel than decision-maker. The climax is a lyric merger rather than a choice with visible trade-off; we feel transformation but not a legible cost that forecloses a former path. Under the Accumulative lens, the drumming motif deepens, but pressure remains atmospheric rather than forcing a on-page stance crystallization with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: prove the whisper theory and unlock the labyrinth's secret. Pressure tightens when Elias decodes the map and identifies the woman's walk as the living lock. However, the woman's immediate acceptance and the handoff of the key deflate tension rather than escalate it. No visible cost or trade-off accompanies the exchange; the ending opens a door but does not dramatize what is risked or lost. One meaningful deepening (recognizing the pattern) occurs, but the final beat lands as cooperative setup rather than consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: Maris's ongoing commitment to teach through silence, tested by the child's challenge ("Mama says you're a witch"). The encounter tightens when the girl questions Maris's silence and her tools, forcing Maris to demonstrate rather than explain—she uses the mirror to show the gap, the shutters to reveal the dark, the pebble to embody starlight. The girl's shift from suspicion ("You're a witch") to understanding ("You're not a witch") marks a meaningful deepening that changes the child's knowledge and stance. However, the cost to Maris remains abstract—no live option is foreclosed, no trade-off imposed—so escalation reads as solid but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—stopping "something" stirring in the grotto—is abstract and never tested on the page. Elias's walk into the night with magnets and the window-display synchronization are preparations, not a tightening or deepening that narrows options or forces a trade-off. No reversal occurs; the story ends before pressure escalates to a choice with visible cost. The phrase "humble rebellions" is declared but not dramatized as a tactic that fails or succeeds.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Lirien's need to resolve her mother's disappearance and her own self-concealment—is signaled early and drives the journey to the island. The scrimshaw discovery and the whale's call provide intermediate pressure points. However, the island sequence lacks escalation: the temple doors open without obstacle, the mother-figure offers wisdom without conflict, and Lirien's return to the docks costs nothing visible. The final image declares transformation but does not narrow options or exact a trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is "to cultivate lightness in grief" through ritual, signaled early. Pressure accumulates via density (nightly tea narration, whittling progression, flower decay) but does not meaningfully tighten or deepen. The dream functions as a micro turn but does not foreclose an option. The ending recapitulates ritual without visible trade-off or escalated cost, missing the band guardrail for 8.0+ (tightening that forecloses a live option).

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—"to stride through boundaries once thought sacred"—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates via sensory intensification (the ice crack, louder hum, melting ice), but no on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows options or forces a trade-off. The poet's actions (tracing quartz, kneeling, paraphrasing with breath) are exploratory and ceremonial rather than decisions under opposition. The "tremor of certainty" functions as internal confirmation rather than friction, and the ending delivers transformation by assertion rather than earned cost, preventing entry to higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: Elias seeks to overcome the wall of colorblindness and capture twilight's exact hue. The jasmine's violet awakening offers a tightening—proof that "different sight" might suffice—and the final brush dip signals a shift in confidence. However, the escalation is gentle; Liora's price ("a painting...of what you feel") is accepted without visible friction or trade-off dramatized on the page, and no live option is foreclosed with felt cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (understanding why connection was lost) is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates through the artificial pilgrimage ritual and the discovery of the vibrating lens, which syncs with Elias's pulse—a meaningful tightening. However, the final moment lacks a clear trade-off or decision that forecloses a live option; Elias "understood" but the cost of that understanding is not dramatized on the page. The piece delivers one deepening but stops short of showing the price or altered tactics that would elevate escalation into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will remain paralyzed by grief or find a way forward—is signaled early through the mourning ring and scattered tools. The origami trail provides one meaningful tightening: each figure narrows his spatial options and pulls him toward the observatory, culminating in the telescope moment. However, the escalation is driven by external prompts (the child, the figures) rather than Elias's own agency testing higher costs. The resolution unfolds through revelation (seeing Liora's face, hearing her advice) rather than a choice that forecloses a live option with visible price. The final act—pressing the stencil to his wrist—is a symbolic acceptance, but what has he renounced or paid to earn it?

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—decoding the anonymous deck as warning or invitation—is signaled early and tightens when the message instructs her to multiply paths. The anonymous reply at the end shifts her from observer to participant, a meaningful deepening. However, the escalation lacks a second reversal or visible trade-off: she sends one word and receives confirmation, but no on-page cost (time, safety, social capital) is dramatized to charge the turn with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding the Veythi's downfall and purifying the archive—is signaled early but never faces a concrete on-page test that narrows options. Elara's tactic of "steadily unpredictable" movement to avoid traps is told rather than dramatized in a beat where it alters her choices. Kael's appearance complicates but does not escalate; the resolution ("You have to let go") is handed to Elara rather than earned through her agency under pressure, and no visible price is paid.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—proving the river's shadow persists to restore the valley—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through juxtaposed footage and the shadow's movements, but no on-page reversal forces Elias to trade off competing goods or alter tactics under cost. The footage merge is a discovery, not a decision with visible forfeit. The shadow stilling and Elias's smile suggest resolution, yet no live option is foreclosed with felt price. Under the Accumulative lens, the piece deepens without a tightening choice that narrows paths, limiting escalation credit.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—how to recover trust and protect what matters after betrayal—is signaled early and tightens through the middle. Elias's choice to trim rather than reconstruct the tail is a meaningful reversal: he abandons his initial impulse (adhesive, reconstruction) for a harder boundary (tweezers, acceptance of incompleteness). The cost is legible: "You only lost a piece of yourself. I lost the whole illusion" and the final act of writing represent a foreclosed path—his former belief in universal goodness. The pressure accumulates through image and action rather than external confrontation, consistent with the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: Elias seeks closure (signaled by "had come here for the quiet" and scar-reading motivation). The tunnel descent provides one tightening (moss warns "turn back," he continues) but the escalation is geographic exploration rather than a choice that narrows options or raises cost. The chamber discovery and coffee-ring realization shift understanding, but no on-page decision or renunciation forecloses a live path with visible price. Pressure accumulates texturally but agency at closure is passive recognition, not alteration under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—finding where unused love and forgotten songs are stored—is signaled early and drives Mira's psychometry work. The piece offers one meaningful deepening: touch → vision → projector activation, which tightens knowledge and narrows Mira's search to "the storage place…behind the screen." Yet the escalation is largely internal revelation without visible cost or tradeoff; Mira encounters no resistance, makes no sacrifice, and the film strip's blackening edge is noted but doesn't alter her tactics. The ending promise ("I'll find you…I'll bring the tune back") followed by the song appearing "all along" deflates the pressure rather than charging it with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—trapped creativity—is declared but never tested by a live on-page complication. Liora's prior attempts (candlelight, rainstorms, tree bark) are summary-only. Tonight's action consists of gazing, listening, and laughing; the "unspoken words grew louder" and creativity "surged" without a reversal or tightening that narrows options. The aurora "flared" coincidentally, offering no resistance. No trade-off is dramatized; the ending claims stories "would never leave her again" without a price that alters later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake: understanding and accepting a hidden mission. The clock touch triggers the archive visit, a meaningful deepening. But Elias remains reactive—he is told what to do by the disembodied voice rather than making a choice that narrows options. The final decision to pocket the clock and guard the sparks lacks on-page friction or visible trade-off; we do not see what he gives up or what immediate consequence follows.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—following the wild frontier of thought—is signaled early and persists. The gear pickup sharpens the hum (a micro-intensification), and the translocation scene introduces the guardian's question. However, the philosopher's final choice lacks visible cost or trade-off; he simply steps forward without renouncing safety, certainty, or a prior path. The accumulative lens allows for deepening rather than reversal, but the ending does not foreclose an option or show a felt price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake ("find where unused courage waits") is signaled but remains abstract; no concrete live option is foreclosed. The cove arrival deepens atmosphere but doesn't narrow tactical choices. Mira's pressing the punch into air and stepping forward feel gestural rather than agency with visible cost. Escalation reads as atmospheric intensification (twilight → lanterns → stars) under the Accumulative lens, sufficient for mid-6s but lacks the trade-off or felt price for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—understanding why the choir was silenced—is signaled early and pursued through investigation. The missing bolt functions as a tightening that narrows Elias's path to confrontation with Madame Veyra. However, escalation remains largely epistemic: Elias learns the fortress erases evidence, but no live option is foreclosed on the page. His final choice to leave without answering Madame Veyra's offer reads as refusal, yet no visible price or trade-off is dramatized—he simply walks away with resolve intact. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening occurs, but cost clarity at closure is weak.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—unmask the pretender by proving his use of the rune—is signaled early and tightens when Liora finds the scroll and internalizes the rune's pulse, which narrows her tactic from general investigation to truth-wielding. Agency is present in her year-long tracing and the decision to claim the scroll, but the escalation is cognitive rather than a choice under competing pressure; no live option is foreclosed with visible cost on the page. The pretender remains off-stage, and the resolution is poised rather than paid, capping the band.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—discovering why survey paths vanished—is signaled early and tightens through the four-day assembly sequence. However, escalation reads as additive discovery rather than a choice that narrows options or imposes a visible tradeoff. The answering knock shifts atmosphere but does not dramatize a decision with felt cost. One meaningful deepening is present but agency at closure remains observational.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (discover meaning / reignite the fire) is signaled early and tightens through the stone-circle approach. The hum escalates from "couldn't ignore" to "teeth ache" to "roar," narrowing Lira's options to one: press her palm and commit. Agency is clear in the final act; the cost is felt as irreversible engagement with the old magic. One meaningful tightening under the accumulative lens is sufficient at this length, though the stakes remain largely internal and conceptual—no secondary pressure from another character or external antagonist complicates the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—Mira's choice to unseal the embryo—is signaled by mid-story but escalation is asserted ("the springs trembled") rather than dramatized through tactical narrowing. The Council's off-page threat declares external pressure without on-page test. The night of unsealing compresses the peak action into summary ("her hands pressed to the obsidian"), eliding the moment where refusal was still possible. One tightening (decoding → unsealing) is present but cost remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—endurance versus collapse—is signaled early and tightens when drone engines trigger her freeze. The orchid-watching beat is a decisive tightening: external threat meets internal paralysis, resolved by attention that slows her pulse. Agency is renunciation and attention, foreclosing flight with on-page cost (she stays, buries the photo, tends the cutting). One meaningful pressure point is sufficient at this length. The final watering is a crystallization of stance with felt cost: she chooses fragile routine over miraculous consolation.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: whether Elias can move beyond fixating on the woman's departure and face his own role. One meaningful tightening: the walls literally close in, forcing him to redesign the artifacts and lie down rather than flee. The erasure of the portrait and rewriting of the tarot cards are protagonist-driven choices with visible cost (he forecloses clinging to her image). The resolution through "drawing the shape of the ache" is earned by the prior sequence. Under the Accumulative lens, the pressure accumulates through claustrophobic imagery and culminates in a deepening that reweights his stance.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—saving the child and understanding the ink-time theft—is signaled early and provides one clear tightening when Elias lunges for the ephemeral form. But the resolution is convenient: the ink solidifies just long enough for revelation, the child recovers fully, and Elias's next move is declared off-page. No visible cost alters his present options; the drone's escape does not foreclose pursuit. Escalation under a Causal lens requires a narrowing or trade-off with on-page price; this delivers exposition and a vow instead.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—provoke the Order by planting the letter—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: Elias moves from possession to action at the chamber threshold. The hesitation moment ("The letter felt heavier now") gestures toward cost but remains largely told rather than embodied as a visceral tradeoff. No visible price is paid on the page beyond walking away; the Order's retaliation is implied, not felt here.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (Liora's refusal to become her father's target/her assertion of continuity over chaos) is signaled early and held. The father's arrival tightens pressure, but the turn—her handing him the rose and his hesitation—feels more thematic echo than a choice that narrows options with visible cost. The "bounty would remain unclaimed" is told, not shown; we never see him choose or refuse. Under the Accumulative lens, the cadence shift and rose image provide some deepening, but agency at closure is passive (he stands, she kneels again) rather than a foreclosing act.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—catching the goddess's echo—is clear from paragraph three. The garden's escalating dissonance creates accumulative pressure, and Kael's zigzag walk represents a tactical choice shaped by that pressure. However, the resolution feels mystical rather than agency-driven: the echo "caught him" as much as he caught it, diluting protagonist causality. The cost at closure is implied (he's "left standing alone") but not dramatized as a visible trade-off. One meaningful deepening occurs when the garden stills, but what concrete option was narrowed or what price paid remains oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—proving her father's murder—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the archives are scrubbed, prompting Elara to write the three letters. Agency is present (writing, sealing, choosing to go) but the escalation is largely internal recap rather than on-page pressure that narrows options. The final "stepped into the light" offers stance crystallization but the immediate cost (danger at the printworks) is told via radio warning, not felt in her body or choice-making. Cost legibility is implied rather than undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—hushing the dissonance of old guilt—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the machine spits "You left us behind" and Elias responds by tattooing, raising the cost of his silence. However, escalation is largely internal; the firmware's accusation and the tattoo ritual feel parallel rather than because/therefore linked. The final quiet is granted rather than wrestled: what does Elias forfeit to achieve it? No live option is visibly foreclosed on the page (does he destroy the machine? abandon future tethering?). The cost—three constellation marks and the amber going cold—registers symbolically but lacks a concrete trade-off that alters his world or future tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Liora seeks to "trap the grotto's murmurs" and discover meaning. Pressure accumulates through the mandala's resistance (lines shift, mock her) and Maren's challenge ("You're doing it wrong"). One meaningful tightening occurs when Liora hears/feels the grotto breathing and realizes the hush is "full, swollen with the things people had stopped saying." Agency at closure is muted: pressing the tile flake stills the mandala, but this feels more responsive than decision under conflicting pressures. The cost (acknowledging the town's unsaid weight) is conceptual and implied rather than a visible forfeiture that narrows options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether to honor or erase *Amira*'s name, embodying aberrant mercy—is signaled early and tightens when Liora finds the stepping stone. However, the escalation is primarily textural (accumulation of memory and detail) rather than a dramatized choice under pressure that narrows live options. The final placement of the tessera feels more like a symbolic affirmation than a decision that forecloses a path with on-page cost, keeping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: Liora's longing for an encore, with Elias serving as her champion. The coin-spin beat tightens the situation by fracturing time and producing echoes, but the escalation is atmospheric rather than driven by agency—Elias enacts a plan without visible obstacles or costs. Liora's hesitation ("It's impossible") dissolves without dramatized resistance or trade-off. The ending gesture (taking his hand) is poised but lacks the felt price or foreclosed option that would anchor high-band conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: understand and control (or accept) the pill's telepathic effects. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mara touches the light-thread and accesses someone else's memory, forcing her to revise her hypothesis from "rewired" to "revealed." The final choice to "live with it" rather than reverse it is a renunciation that forecloses the original goal, but the cost feels more conceptual than visceral—no visible trade-off in the moment. Escalation under Accumulative lens is present (static shock → somatic markers → painting skin → painting air → touching memory), but agency at closure is more acceptance than decision.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Eira's need to translate the unknown that has been calling her—is signaled early and escalates as the entity emerges and offers her a role. One meaningful tightening occurs when the entity reaches for her and the device shatters, forcing the merge. However, the merge itself is not a dilemma Eira must solve or a trade-off she wrestles with on the page; she "understood" and accepted within two beats. No visible option is foreclosed with felt cost—she gains voice, warmth, and purpose without dramatized loss.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—unscrambling the prophecy through button cataloging—is signaled early and drives the middle. Pressure tightens as the catalog nears completion, and the discovery of the last silver button triggers the sand reversal. However, the escalation is gradual accumulation rather than a sharp turn, and Mira's agency at closure (turning the hourglass over again) is a renunciation that forecloses wonder with visible cost. The lack of a secondary complication or visible tactical trade-off keeps the score in the mid-7s.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (finding where unused courage waits / seeking proof beyond absolution) is signaled early and coheres under the Accumulative lens. One meaningful tightening occurs when the pillbox opens and reveals the key, narrowing Elias's options from passive remembrance to active choice. The descent to the door and the file's contents deepen the stake from personal redemption to collective responsibility, reweighting cost. Agency is present: Elias chooses to open the pillbox, use the key, and pocket the file; these are renunciations and endurances that foreclose paths. Cost is conceptual and relational (leaving the pillbox, accepting incompleteness) but legible in the final image. Pressure remains coherent throughout, though the key's arrival feels slightly convenient rather than earned through escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—crossing safely before the storm breaks—is signaled early and tightens as rain accelerates. However, the rope repair succeeds without complication, and the crossing itself unfolds smoothly; no reversal tests commitment or alters tactics. The final "no weight, no urgency" declares resolution rather than dramatizing a price paid or path foreclosed. The piece accumulates atmosphere but does not deliver a meaningful on-page tightening that narrows options or forces a trade-off with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: understanding why the oasis persists. The piece deepens rather than escalates—Ren moves from observing (clay, light patterns) to lighting the fire and listening, which triggers the final transformation. Under the Accumulative lens this qualifies as one meaningful tightening. Weakness: Ren's agency is passive reception; he does not make a choice that forecloses an option or pays a visible cost. The oasis acts upon him (lantern whole, bowl filled) rather than his decision altering the outcome. The ending feels bestowed rather than earned through protagonist pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: Elias's attempt to sustain beauty against decay, signaled by the rosebush and winter's approach. Lila's arrival tightens pressure—her father's death and the rusted key force a choice. Elias's decision to give up the bitting gauge narrows his options (he loses his paternal anchor) and enables Lila's future. Under the Accumulative lens, this single deepening suffices at this length. The cost is visible but the escalation is gentle; the exchange feels more handoff than hard-won turn, keeping it in the solid mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—coexisting with the past without being consumed—is signaled early. Escalation reads as accumulative deepening: Lira uses the sundial, the hum intensifies, she reads the scale-bound book, and the library responds. However, no on-page reversal narrows options or forces a visible trade-off; the resolution ("her heart lighter") declares relief without showing what path she foreclosed or what cost she paid to arrive there.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—finding the pattern that connects all things—is signaled early but remains abstract. No on-page reversal narrows options; the keeper and artist offer clues without cost, and Mira's letter-writing is recounted ("That night, Mira sat...") rather than dramatized. The artist's disappearance and the single mirror's appearance read as convenience rather than pressure; Mira arrives at insight without a visible tightening or trade-off. Agency is present in her decision to write her own letter, but the act forecloses no live path with legible price.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake (stop the tricksters before reality unravels) is signaled early and the subsonic activation is a decisive on-page choice. The tightening occurs when Mara moves from analysis to interference, and Voss's skepticism briefly tests her resolve. Yet the escalation is modest: no genuine reversal or trade-off beyond Mara's internal steadiness, and the tricksters are defeated off-page with no visible cost beyond her exhaustion. The "if you're wrong? Then we're already lost" exchange gestures toward stakes but does not dramatize a price paid or path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the spatial-mutiny key—is signaled in paragraph four and sustained. The organ hum and the figure's appearance tighten pressure; the figure's warning ("once you see the truth, you can't unsee it") forces a trade-off. Elias's choice to grasp the compass is protagonist-driven and narrows options (he cannot unknow the Nexus's true nature). However, the world-shift and the figure's dissolution happen *to* Elias rather than being caused *by* a second on-page decision, limiting escalation to one meaningful turn. The cost is largely perceptual (claustrophobia forgotten, stars reframed) rather than a visible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—awakening empathy for Liora—is signaled early and sustained. However, escalation is thin: the figure arrives, reveals information, and Elara accepts the lance without a meaningful decision that narrows options or imposes visible cost. The mist thickens and the sibling departs, but these are atmospheric shifts, not pressure points driven by Elara's agency. The resolution ("finally whole") asserts completion without dramatizing a trade-off or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: honor Elias and decode his warnings. Pressure tightens through the nail discovery, reversible-stanza puzzle, and furnace unlock—each narrows options under the causal lens. The "exile is reversible, but so is the sky" revelation and "He'd been sent" reweight the ancestor's story with conceptual cost (Mira now faces the same hidden mission). Agency is present but leans interpretive: Mira reads and unlocks rather than making a high-stakes trade-off in the moment. The final "whether she was brave enough" flags future cost without paying it on the page, softening escalation's bite at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—Lena's desire to "sculpt possibility"—is signaled early but never tested by a concrete obstacle or choice with visible cost. The hitchhiker's vanishing is recounted backstory, not an on-page pressure source. No reversal or tightening narrows Lena's options; she plays, reflects, and departs with the same openness she began with. Under Accumulative lens, a deepening or cadence shift that reweights the stake is needed; here the ending restates rather than transforms. The glass flake is pocketed without altering tactics or forging a tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—why some paths circle back—is signaled early and pursued through reflection. Pressure accumulates via the train's territorial markers, the foreign bills, and the startup's collapse, deepening Elias's question without a sharp on-page reversal. The ending reconfigures his understanding (circles become spirals) with conceptual cost, but the escalation remains textural rather than forcing a high-stakes choice that narrows options. One meaningful tightening is present but the felt cost at closure is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—decoding the temple inscriptions and understanding the shared burden—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through repeated dream visions, but escalation is textural (more vivid, more insistent) rather than a narrowing of options or a trade-off. The final realization that inscriptions are "an invitation" rather than "a puzzle" is a conceptual shift, yet no on-page choice or forfeiture makes the cost unmistakable. The decision to gather dreamers is announced, not tested, leaving agency and price implicit.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: lift the curse by proving loyalty to the Circle while confronting buried guilt. The plant's test creates immediate pressure (physical pain, memory extraction) that narrows options to confession or failure. Escalation is driven by Veyra's agency: she plants the seed, endures the pain, and speaks the frozen truth. The reversal—curse lifts but reveals her complicity and the child's vendetta—transforms the "success" into a new, worse problem. The cost is visible on the page (lost anonymity, future threat) and scales well for this length. One clear tightening; no need for multiple reversals here.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—reaching the intersection of dreams—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or cost. The woman's arrival grants access without resistance, and the final "Together" dissolves tension rather than tightening it. No meaningful reversal or trade-off narrows options; coincidence (her appearance) resolves rather than complicates. Agency is absent: Elias doesn't decide, renounce, or endure with visible cost—he simply accepts.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.7)
    The dominant stake (saving her brother) is signaled immediately and drives all action. Pressure escalates through a meaningful tightening: Liora's weeks of preparation establish capability, the stranger's appearance complicates with a concrete price, and the memory-choice forces a genuine trade-off between competing goods (brother's return vs. preserving his memory). The final sacrifice forecloses the original path with visible cost—she walks away "lighter" but "heavier," no longer pursuing retrieval. Agency is clear throughout; the protagonist's decision at closure resolves the pressure she created.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—Jake's search for purpose after public failure—is signaled early but remains largely internal and abstract until the final scene. The quarry cataloging offers no visible opposition or tightening; Roy's mention of singing is a thematic echo, not a pressure point. The pit visit introduces a micro-turn (hearing Lena's voice), but Lena's arrival is coincidental and her line about "confidently uncertain" delivers thematic summary rather than a choice that forecloses options. One meaningful deepening occurs (Jake's willingness to share the cloth), yet the cost—what he risks or loses by engaging—is not legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—understanding and reestablishing the spirit's connection—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through Elara's methodical investigation (tracing cuneiform, feeling vibration, pressing the seed) and tightens when the seed pulses and the arbor responds, narrowing her options from searching to waiting. Agency is present but somewhat muted: her final act (planting the seed, translating new script) flows logically but lacks a visible trade-off or competing path foreclosed with sharp cost. The resolution—connection reestablished—is earned by her persistence, yet the escalation reads more as patient accumulation than a choice under competing pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—preserving wonder by cataloging migrating identities—is signaled early and coherent. The filling of the creel creates a single meaningful deepening (empty → full → adrift), but no on-page reversal tightens options or forces a trade-off. Elias's agency is contemplative arrangement rather than decision under pressure; the final release is serene, not earned through conflicting wants or visible sacrifice. Accumulative escalation is present but the cost is not legible in a specific line.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: the inspector's mission to inspect/dissolve bunker grief, tightening when she realizes "this was the wall she'd been trying to dissolve—not between strangers, but within herself." One meaningful deepening occurs at the crown discovery, narrowing the question to her own courage and fear of erasure. Agency is renunciation/confession ("I'm afraid of being forgotten"), which forecloses passive inspection and demands self-exposure. Cost is conceptual (the pearl dulls, her secret spoken) rather than a visible forfeiture that alters tactics. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens but the final cost reads muted—no live option visibly closed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: finding a way to live with guilt after causing a drowning. The stake is signaled early and remains coherent. However, escalation is minimal—Lena moves from bathroom to platform, from reading graffiti to walking toward the river, without a tightening that narrows options or a reversal that tests commitment. The graffiti about forgiveness being "the path you walk when you stop running" offers insight, but Lena does not act on it in a way that forecloses a prior path with visible cost. Agency defaults to interior realization rather than decision or renunciation that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—"to find the library of unspoken words"—is declared but never tested by a meaningful trade-off or tightening that narrows options. The protagonist's actions (reaching for a book, reading aloud, penning the second letter) unfold without opposition or cost; no reversal or escalation forces a choice that forecloses a path. The watch's chime and the letter's completion feel coincidental rather than earned by prior agency, and the "set her free" resolution arrives without visible sacrifice or consequence shaped by the protagonist's decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—dream versus empire—is signaled early and pursued on the page. The violin's first note triggers telepathy (complication), the father's arrival tightens the dilemma, and Elara's decision to play forces the rupture. However, the father's vanishing happens *to* him without visible resistance or negotiation, so the protagonist's agency in that beat is partial. The cost is declared (he's gone, future unwritten) but not dramatized—no mourning, no tactical consequence, no price paid afterward—so the escalation's final turn feels asserted rather than earned. Mid-6 band for one meaningful tightening with incomplete cost proof.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—capturing one last spark before oblivion—is signaled early. The ritual proceeds smoothly: Liora presses the chip to the figure's lips, the figure revives, and the emerald dims. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the one complication (the figure's fading spark) is resolved without visible cost or trade-off. The ending affirms Liora's mission rather than testing it, so escalation under the Accumulative lens remains modest.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (finding the source of contentment) is signaled early. The tightening occurs when the voice whispers, narrowing Mira's understanding, and the hairpin dissolution forces a threshold moment. However, the escalation is internal and reflective rather than driven by protagonist agency under pressure—Mira listens and accepts rather than wrestles with cost. The resolution (pressing hairpin into water, receiving insight) feels more like passive revelation than earned alteration. No visible price paid; the climb back is described as "lighter," reversing pressure without demonstrable trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can unhook Veyra from guilt—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes Veyra wants nuance, not absolution. The mirror shard's pulse and the cloak's loosening mark a tightening/deepening under the Situational lens, and the final reconfiguration (the lighthouse no longer feels accusatory) reweights the stake. Cost is conceptual: Elias foregoes the auditor's verdict and accepts uncertainty. The escalation is legible but relies on atmospheric cues (chimes, mirror warmth) more than character agency; Elias's question is reactive rather than a high-stakes wager.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (learning to vanish/step outside time) is signaled early but never genuinely tested. The grotto's hum and frozen rings present atmospheric pressure, yet Elara faces no forced trade-off or live cost—no failed attempt, no bodily consequence, no renunciation. The grandmother revelation reframes but does not tighten options. The ending grants understanding without foreclosing a path or imposing a felt price, rendering escalation more thematic than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—learning to navigate without moving—is signaled early and the bird-flock disruption provides one tightening moment. The door opening offers a spatial reversal, but it arrives without resistance or trade-off; Elias simply presses the arrowhead and enters. No visible cost is paid, no option foreclosed—he gains access without loss. The piece deepens atmosphere but does not escalate pressure through agency-driven choice with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—find the sacred in the simple—is signaled early and tested when Elias unstraps his satchel (literal and metaphoric burden), drinks the light (risk of self-knowledge), and chooses to plant rather than cast a grand spell. One meaningful tightening: drinking the fountain forces him to confront failure memories, narrowing options to acceptance or continued self-reproach. The resolution is protagonist-driven with visible cost (he walks down alone, having renounced grand ambition). However, the mentor's guidance feels slightly too helpful, reducing friction; the courtyard sequence could apply more pressure before the epiphany lands.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering "the color of sound"—is signaled late (midpoint, via the book) and competes with the unexplained key-tag mystery and the woman's "truth you've been hiding behind." Pressure accumulates through Elias's wandering and the woman's cryptic prodding, culminating in the visual epiphany: lanterns pulsing in sync with the harbor bell. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elias perceives the synesthetic phenomenon, but the resolution lacks visible cost: he hands over the key without on-page hesitation, loss, or tactical constraint. The woman's exposition ("That's the color of sound") tells rather than dramatizes the realization, and "understood then" summarizes the turn instead of showing the internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—aligning wavelength with the universe's song—is signaled early and tightens when Elias realizes the prophecy is backwards, forcing a strategic reversal ("let purpose align with him"). This reweighting narrows his options from active pursuit to receptive stance, and the static resolving into "a single, clear note" confirms the shift. Pressure accumulates through texture (static bursts crescendo, his doubt "gnawed" then "sharpened focus") rather than external opposition. The cost is legible—abandoning a lifetime's approach—but the final image of readiness to listen feels more like Charged Poise than decisive action with immediate consequence. Agency is present but contemplative.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—giving names to nameless fears—is signaled early and pursued throughout. Pressure accumulates through Elias's repeated listening to recordings and tracing the atlas until he commits to naming. One meaningful tightening occurs when he presses his hand to the page and the creatures respond, though this reads more as lyric intensification than a decision that forecloses a live option. The cost (centuries' weight lifting, silence achieved) is stated rather than shown through a visible trade-off or loss. Under the Accumulative lens the deepening is present but borderline for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—repairing the bell to restore fish and right cosmic imbalance—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through Elias's timed water application, though the escalation reads more as procedural iteration than a choice that narrows options under rising cost. The fish's return at the bell's strike provides one meaningful tightening, and the cost (cracks remain, imbalance persists) is stated rather than dramatized in a trade-off beat. No antagonist or reversal; coincidence does not resolve, which fits the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—preserve truth vs. let the town heal—is signaled early. Escalation occurs when the fourth photograph reframes his father's story, but the turn is informational rather than a forced trade-off under external pressure. The final choice to carry the photographs back is declared with thematic weight ("the stories had to be told") yet lacks an on-page antagonist or material cost that would narrow options at the closure beat. One meaningful deepening is present, sufficient for this length, but the cost remains conceptual and future-facing rather than felt in the present scene.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Liora seeks to reconcile control and wonder before "the final transformation." The flame memory offers a meaningful deepening (past failure reweighted as understanding rather than control), and the crystal-planting gesture tightens her stance. However, no live option is dramatized as foreclosed—she never attempts control on the page, so the renunciation lacks friction. The starlings' unpredictable patterns illustrate her theme but do not force a trade-off with visible cost. Escalation reads as thematic accumulation rather than a pressure spike that narrows tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: survival and proving patterns matter. Pressure accumulates (wind picks up, branch groans, snap) and one reversal (the fall and catch) tests the makeshift harness, narrowing options with visible cost (buckle biting, gasps). Agency is present—he knots the vine, adjusts grip, pulls back—but the cost is physical sensation rather than a trade-off that forecloses a live alternative path. The city's "promise" remains abstract; no secondary pressure from below alters his tactics. The snap delivers urgency, but the resolution (pull up, keep climbing) extends the situation without decisive closure of the dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—defeating emotional numbness—is signaled immediately and drives all action. The training sequence escalates through failed parry → retrieval → "crack that echoed through the sky" → raw attack that cracks the numbness. Veyra's opposition remains consistent, and the sword-loss/recovery cycle narrows Kael's options until he abandons technique for "raw, clumsy need." The final step carries felt risk (fly or fall), though the precipitating cost is more atmospheric than material.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: restore laughter to the household. Escalation traces a clear pattern (first police, second weeping, now listening) that deepens through Elias's repeated attempts. The girl's movement forward and the mother's laugh provide a meaningful tightening that forecloses further intervention. The leaf blower's sputtering fuel and Elias's decision to walk away impose a visible cost. No antagonist is required; the silence itself functions as opposition. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, though the final turn could impose a sharper trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Mara's search for answers and relief from dimensional homesickness—is signaled early. The encounter with the guardian and the inscribed book provide one meaningful tightening, but the guardian's exit and Mara's shift ("didn't feel the need to wait") lack a visible price or trade-off. Uncertainty as constant and the pendant's role complicate but do not escalate into a choice that narrows live options with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—escape from perfectionist paralysis—is signaled early and tightens through Elias's realization and the explosive sequence. Agency is clear: he chooses to pour mercury, to stand in the flames, to accept the twisted shard as enough. The three explosions escalate viscerally, and the final act forecloses the gold-seeking path with visible cost (the crozier destroyed, no gold produced). One minor slip: the explosions feel more atmospheric than tactically constrained by prior choices.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—finding the origin signal—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira realizes "beginnings were just endings in disguise" and adjusts her method ("not by searching, but by discarding assumptions"). However, escalation is muted: the voice tells her the answer, she tunes differently, and the result arrives without visible cost or trade-off in tactics. The tower's collapse happens *to* her rather than being shaped by her choices, and coincidence (the perigee's peak timing) resolves the search rather than her agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—preventing the ferry from vanishing—is signaled early via the radio. Pressure accumulates through the appearance of the commuter echoes and the thickening air, but Elias's intervention (speaking to them) is declarative rather than a forced choice with visible cost. The resolution feels coincidental: the commuters "find their way home" off-page, and the ferry stabilizes without Elias renouncing anything or altering his stance. One tightening occurs (the commuters stir and step forward), but agency is diffuse and the cost of success is not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—discovering connection's texture—is signaled early but remains abstract. The thread's movement provides one tightening (winding around his wrist, tugging him forward) but Elias never resists or trades off a live option. The door and void-space arrival feel like inherited progression rather than protagonist-driven escalation. No visible cost: he doesn't lose his sketch, his grip on waking reality, or a chance to return. The ending crystallizes a sensation but not a choice with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—learning to navigate by starlight—is signaled early and drives the arc. Pressure tightens when Lirien observes the alien vessel aligning with her tracked star, a meaningful turn that narrows her understanding and opens the path to teaching. However, escalation is mostly procedural (salvage → forge → experiment → understand) without visible trade-offs or losses; the "slow work, fraught with failure" is told rather than shown. Tael's skepticism dissolves without friction, and the ending declares expansion rather than testing commitment with a legible cost. One tightening is present but agency at closure is aspirational, not decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—finding Miriam to protect vulnerable voices—is signaled early and pursued throughout. However, escalation is largely geographic (moving deeper into the mist) rather than driven by protagonist choices that narrow options or raise costs. Elias warns her, she steps forward; the mist thickens, she runs; Miriam appears, she reaches out—each beat advances location but not tactical complexity or visible trade-off. The final moment when the mist recoils and the dead call louder suggests a tightening, but what Lena has risked or lost to arrive there remains abstract. No on-page decision forecloses a path or demonstrates a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Elias came "to return what was taken." The tidal clock provides urgency ("three hours before the lower levels flooded"), and the discovery of the data slate deepens the mystery by revealing the researchers aren't dead but phase-shifted. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens is atmospheric rather than choice-driven—Elias's agency is passive (following the codex, reacting to revelations) until the step through the wall, which feels more like submission than a decision with visible alternatives. The phase transition and reversal land with cost (drowning, sealing), but the protagonist's role in triggering it is unclear, reducing the sense of earned consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—Elias seeking to resolve his feeling of borrowed time—is signaled early and sustained. The ghost encounter provides one meaningful deepening when "defragment" reframes his accumulation of guilt into "space between mistakes," narrowing his self-perception from error to possibility. The heartbeat counting operates as persistent constraint. However, Elias remains largely passive; the ghost delivers wisdom rather than Elias earning it through a difficult choice with visible tradeoff. The cost at closure is felt but not fully embodied in action or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake (capture the texture of echoes) is signaled early and tightens when the diamond vibrates and the echoes answer. One meaningful escalation: Elara shifts from listening to conducting, a turn driven by her agency (humming, matching pitch). The cost is visible in the canyon's silence afterward and the transformation of the diamond from cursed to vessel. No explicit antagonist, but the echoes' resistance (chaos, overlapping fragments) provides coherent pressure under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to engage the threshold's call—is signaled early and tightens when Elias refuses Maren's warning and presses the phone to his ear, a choice that costs him his human form. The voices on the phone shift from warning to invitation, a meaningful reversal. Minor gap: the "missing return" backstory frames stakes but remains off-page; we don't see a prior on-page cost that Elias paid before this scene, so the escalation within this single beat feels compressed rather than compounded.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is clear: Liora must keep playing or the statues will uproot the orchard. The locust shell introduces a second option—escape—and she pursues it by altering her music, which triggers the vines and her flight. One meaningful tightening: the statue's foot shifts, pressure mounts, she runs. The leap and landing impose visible cost (jarring bones, entering a hostile world). The child at the end raises a new stake (will beauty survive in the mechanical world?) but the escalation is somewhat muted—vines appear without prior setup, and the statues' pursuit after the leap is asserted rather than shown pressuring her final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Jace's role as carrier of the undeliverable, tested by complicity in Mira's smuggling—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through reflection and Mira's arrival but lacks a clear on-page tightening that narrows options or forces a visible trade-off. The final act (packing the bottle, continuing to carry) is framed as endurance rather than a reversal; the cost is felt in the weight metaphor but not dramatized as a foreclosed path or tactical shift. Escalation under the Accumulative lens is present (density increases, tone shifts) but one decisive intensification with agency and visible price would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—restoring the lost circus through Elias's craft and belief—is signaled early and tightens once when singing animates the fragment and train. The escalation is smooth but relies on a single causal hinge (fragment glows → world responds). No secondary complication tests commitment; the oasis materializes without cost or tradeoff. The resolution feels more granted than earned, undercutting agency at the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Elias seeks "the place where stories live." The scarf discovery and hyperbolic-geometry door provide one meaningful tightening. However, escalation is thin—no reversal tests his commitment, no visible trade-off alters tactics. The woman's appearance in the void and mutual hand-squeeze resolve the search through recognition rather than a choice that narrows options or imposes cost. Under the Accumulative lens, the deepening is present but the price remains asserted ("the scarf… a comfort") rather than legible in forfeited agency.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—capturing the dream, reaching the woman—is signaled early and pursued through escalating attempts (painting air, then photography, then physical journey). One meaningful tightening occurs when the photograph finally comes out clear, narrowing Elias's options to departure. However, the arrival scene deflates pressure: the woman is simply waiting, no obstacle materializes, and the final exchange ("Not yet, but I will") sidesteps resolution rather than paying a visible cost. Under the accumulative lens, the cost of the journey and the act of capture should reweight stakes, but the ending defers that price off the page. Agency is present but closure lacks the felt trade-off needed for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake: freeing the trapped idea. The middle ritual (untying hair, weaving, holding to starlight) adds texture but not a meaningful tightening of options or a visible trade-off. The locksmith faces no opposition, doubt, or cost; Elara's internal conflict is summarized rather than tested on the page. The ending gesture—handing over the braid—delivers permission without demonstrable sacrifice or narrowed path, reading as resolution by declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—recovering Liora and the lost summer—is signaled early and drives Elias's return. The tightening is clear: detecting the celestial map narrows his path, contact with the ring triggers memory fragments, and the ring's opening forces the encounter. However, escalation under the Causal lens lacks a meaningful mid-story choice or reversal where Elias's agency alters tactics; he follows breadcrumbs rather than forcing trade-offs. The closure cost (Liora vanishing again, ring snapping shut) is legible but feels more like atmospheric denial than a visible price Elias paid through his own action or hesitation in the climactic moment.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—whether to risk mentoring again after prior failure—is signaled early and tightens when Mira asks to try walking backwards, then requests the teacup. The story delivers one meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens: Elara's gradual shift from solitary annotation to direct engagement. The cost is legible in "part fear, part hope" and the wound-like smile, and the final act of handing over the cup forecloses her isolation with felt consequence. Agency is decision under pressure; coincidence (Mira's arrival) complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving the color of wonder and reviving the orchard—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates through the song, the shoot's emergence, and the travelers' echoes solidifying, but escalation is textural rather than causal: each beat adds density without narrowing Maren's options or forcing a trade-off. The resolution (the bud appears, the tree lives) arrives without visible cost or renunciation on the page. Maren's agency is present in planting and singing, yet no moment tests her commitment or forecloses an alternative path. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is present (understanding the seed as vessel, not just bridge), but the stakes never tighten into a dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—free the trapped spirits versus preserve the mask—signals early and tightens through the knot-unraveling sequence where each released voice deepens the silence and makes the mask pulse. Elias's realization that freeing the spirits requires unmaking the mask is a meaningful escalation driven by his own actions (unraveling knots) that narrows his options to butchery or abandonment. The Fisher King's intervention arrives as external complication rather than organic pressure, but Elias's final choice to drive the needle is his own agency with visible cost (the threads scream, unmake vs. restore). The price is legible on the page and forecloses the restoration path.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether to reopen the chapel and confront the village's silence—is signaled early and tightens when Elias pries the door open. However, the escalation is largely external (folklore → footage → physical barrier) rather than driven by competing internal pressures. The ending reweights understanding but does not show a trade-off or visible price paid; the shoe is recognized, not chosen against an alternative. One meaningful tightening is present, but agency at closure is passive observation.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: understand Liora's experiment and the Marigold's fate. Pressure tightens when Elias deciphers the ledger, realizes the globe is a key, and encounters the ghost. The climactic choice—shattering the globe—is triggered by Liora's whisper ("Let go") rather than Elias's internal conflict or prior tactical failure, reducing agency. One meaningful deepening occurs; the cost (releasing the transmission, surfacing without salvage) is legible. Coincidence (finding the globe intact, the ghost's appearance) complicates but does not resolve, holding within situational allowance.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—giving the ghost a voice and helping her be remembered—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure tightens when Elias realizes the bolt plate is a key and the storm offers a window for action. However, the escalation is gentle: no live option is foreclosed, no trade-off forced. Elias succeeds without visible cost to his resources, time, or safety. The ghost's departure and the word "Enough" register as resolution, but the protagonist's agency feels more like facilitation than a choice under duress. One meaningful deepening occurs (the bolt plate melding with the ghost), but it lacks the friction or price that would elevate this into the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to unfold the captain's secret—is clear and tightens when Lira realizes the diary's true nature. The captain's interruption creates one pressure point that tests Lira's commitment. The resolution through renunciation is legible with felt cost (leaving the goggles, walking away). However, escalation is mild: the captain's "You always were too curious" doesn't substantially raise the cost beyond what Lira already felt internally, and no persistent constraint shapes her final choice beyond moral intuition.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—memorializing the sky to prove empty spaces remember—is signaled early but remains abstract until the *Astraea* appears. No meaningful tightening occurs before the final paragraph; the cloud observations are parallel rather than escalating. The vision of his father's airship introduces a new stake (confronting loss) rather than deepening the established one. The final act (climbing the railing) is agency, but it doesn't narrow prior options because no prior choice was tested. Coincidence (the *Astraea* appearing) triggers resolution rather than protagonist decision under accumulated pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: Liora seeks the fractally precise sky sketch to understand how to capture vastness. The quest tightens through coin → wax map → hidden safe → sketch discovery, then deepens when she realizes possession would violate reverence. The cost is legible in her choice to leave it: "some things were not meant to be possessed, only witnessed." However, the escalation is linear rather than pressured—no missteps, no competing pull to take it dramatized as temptation. The single meaningful choice suffices for this length but lacks visceral struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—charting a discovery to earn the cartographer's sigil—is signaled early and sustained. Elias's midnight investigation and his presentation to Orlan form one meaningful tightening. The reversal when Orlan pulls out the matching lantern narrows Elias's understanding and opens a new path. However, escalation is moderate: no loss, refusal, or competing pressure tests Elias's commitment, and the final turn is delivered by Orlan rather than forced by protagonist agency under duress. The story deepens knowledge but not cost.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—learning "the rhythm of repair" to mend the gears and understand the broken machine—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the hall of mirrors scene, but escalation is gentle: Elias kneels, arranges gears, listens, and they turn. No on-page reversal narrows his options; the gears' success feels granted rather than fought for. The prophecies and mirrors supply information but do not force a trade-off or visible price. Agency is limited to observation and arrangement; the cost (if any) is conceptual and off-page, not dramatized as a forfeited choice or failed attempt.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake (orchard health) is signaled early. The accumulation of messages and villager experiments provide one meaningful deepening. Yet the resolution—restoration after communal effort—is consequence-free; no credible loss or trade-off is dramatized. The villagers' shift from hoarding to sharing is asserted rather than tested under pressure. Closure lacks the visible cost required for higher bands under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: soothe the world before its end (not save it). Under the Accumulative lens, escalation reads as deepening through the layering of objects and the cadence shift from adjustment to song. One meaningful tightening: "The doomsday clock ticked once, then stopped" narrows options and charges the final act. Agency is renunciation (letting go of control) with visible cost: uncertainty ("didn't know if the lullaby would reach"). The protagonist's choice—to whisper rather than turn back the clock again—drives closure. Coincidence does not resolve; the outcome remains open yet weighted.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—save a traveler before frost or another life is lost—is signaled early and tightens when the man appears and birds dive. Mira's agency (scattering nuts, pointing rather than leading) drives the escalation and the man's survival demonstrates visible cost: she risks exposure, works quickly under time pressure, and must trust her indirect method. The mechanical birds provide external opposition that raises urgency. The resolution is earned by Mira's realization and action (assembling the nut-trail) with a trade-off: the curse holds, but she remains bound to the orchard.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake: reconciling professional failure and relational erosion, signaled early. One meaningful tightening: the foam insight narrows her research approach from rigidity to flexibility, altering her plan to return. Agency is present—she chooses to sketch new equations and return—but the cost of that return (what she sacrifices to re-engage Mara or the lab) remains implicit. The river's braided paths create situational pressure that forces stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.1)
    Dominant stake ("find where stories begin") is signaled early but remains abstract. The woman's arrival and transaction offer a reversal opportunity, yet her request and the moonlight's transformation into a key lack visible cost or tactical consequence—Elias gains a coin (a "compressed sigh") but no path is foreclosed. The ending smile and open door function as thematic echo rather than a tightening that narrows options under pressure. One tightening is present (the exchange) but agency and cost are ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—freeing Kael from grief that has "seeped into the very stones"—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Maren chooses to grasp Kael's hand despite the contagion risk, and the contact floods her with his memories. The resolution is earned by Maren's active choice to share the weight, and Kael's standing and walking constitute a visible change. However, the escalation is primarily dialogic persuasion rather than a tested trade-off; Maren's own grief (mother's laughter, canyon walls) is mentioned but never brought into friction with Kael's. The cost—her memories "lighter" and his "eyes clear"—is stated rather than demonstrated through a later tactic shift or forfeiture. No persistent constraint (time, stamina, social credit) shapes their exchange beyond the touch-contagion itself.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (turn the tower into a place of unity) is signaled early but never faces on-page opposition or complication. The grain elevator workers arrive hesitant, then immediately join; no tightening or reversal occurs. The weeks-pass summary tells us the resolution rather than dramatizing the pressure of bringing fragmented voices together. Mara's agency is decision without cost—no live option is foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether to modify or preserve the broken mirror—is signaled early and tightens through the woman's whispered advice ("You don't have to fix it"). The escalation reads as deepening under the Accumulative lens: Lena's understanding shifts from technical repair to ethical witness, and the choice to retain the fractures forecloses the path of "making whole." Visible cost is present (she inherits the woman's certainty-loss), but the pressure remains largely internal and reflective; no external complication or second character tests her resolve, so the tightening lacks a second beat of friction that would push this into the 7+ range.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—finding forgotten combinations—is signaled early and pursued consistently. The middle tightening occurs when symbols shift and doodles bleed onto blank pages, narrowing Elara's options to accept the guardian role. However, escalation lacks a visible trade-off: no rival pressure, no cost of entry, no path foreclosed. The grotto groans and the hour nears its end, but Elara simply tucks the book away without dramatized consequence. Agency is decision (claiming the book), but the price remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—creating music in silence—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through Elias's repeated attempts (thumb along crack, knuckles strike, adjustment of angle), but no live option is foreclosed or trade-off forced; he simply refines until success. The piece delivers one meaningful deepening (insulator placement enabling sound) without escalation that narrows choices or imposes cost. Under the Accumulative lens, the tightening is present but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—deciphering the eclipsed covenant before the celestial cycle shifts—is signaled early and pursued consistently. Pressure accumulates through Lysara's arrival and the ritual hum, but the covenant's revelation arrives without meaningful resistance or cost; no live option is narrowed. The final decision to stay affirms continuity rather than trade-off. Under an accumulative lens one deepening suffices, yet the lack of a visible price or tactical shift in the climactic moment keeps this in mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—recovering Liora's truth—is signaled early and drives Elias's tuning attempts. Pressure tightens when Liora herself appears, shifting the task from mechanical to relational; her gift of the tuning fork enables the final beat. The resolution is protagonist-adjacent (Liora provides the key frequency) rather than fully protagonist-driven, which softens agency slightly. Visible cost is present but muted: the years of estrangement are acknowledged, yet the reconciliation feels more affirming than forecloses a path with sharp pain. One meaningful escalation under a Causal lens is sufficient at this length, but the cost could be more viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to cultivate the dangerous seed to bring serenity—is signaled early and clear. Pressure coheres around the elders' warnings and Mira's ambition, but escalation is minimal: Old Nara's arrival introduces a complication, yet the grandmother's journal resolves tension rather than tightening it. The protagonist's agency at closure is interpretive (she "understood") rather than a decision or renunciation that forecloses a live option with visible cost. The seed "would take years to bloom, if it bloomed at all" defers stakes rather than crystallizing them, resulting in a diffuse rather than charged final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—finding the source of resilience before gravity inverts—is signaled early and tightened by the one-hour countdown. The pressure remains coherent under the accumulative lens as sensory details (hum, vibration, echo voices) deepen the atmosphere. However, the escalation lacks a meaningful cost or trade-off: Lira lands, kneels, hears the echoes, and understands without sacrifice or reversal. The first tremor hits as confirmation rather than complication, and she chooses not to flee without visible consequence. The lack of a live price or foreclosed option caps the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—investigate the absence, then escape the transforming city—is signaled early. The thermal-signature discovery constitutes a meaningful tightening that shifts Elias from investigator to fugitive. However, his agency is largely reactive: the city acts upon him rather than his choices driving escalation. The chase offers physical peril, but no on-page decision alters his trajectory; he runs because the environment attacks, not because earlier investigative moves forced a trade-off. The cost (entrapment) is visible but delivered by external force rather than earned through his own tactical gamble.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—releasing the amber sheet's melody before the sculptor's work disrupts the hush—is signaled early. Pressure tightens through the three chisel strikes that shatter her notes, but Eira's responses are repetitions (ring next bell, focus harder) rather than escalating agency or trade-offs. The resolution arrives when she rings the largest bell "with a final, determined strike" and succeeds without visible cost; coincidence (the sculptor's silence) validates her effort rather than her choice forcing a price.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding the guardianship failure to mend the boundary—is signaled early and drives the sequence. The discovery that the boundary was "never a wall... it was a thread" constitutes a meaningful reweighting of the problem. However, the escalation is gentle: Elias follows markers, enters the tear, and receives instruction rather than wrestling with conflicting methods or facing a trade-off. The final act of playing a melody feels enabled by the figure's direction rather than by Elias's agency under pressure, and no visible cost (lost resource, foreclosed option) appears on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake (understanding emotion's mathematics) is signaled early and persists. One meaningful tightening occurs: the woman's arrival and the fragment's dissolution narrow the physical setup, but Elias's agency in that moment is passive—he borrows her voice, the fragment dissolves at her touch, not his decision. No on-page reversal or choice forecloses a live option with visible cost; the equations "still there, waiting" implies stasis rather than a reweighted path. Pressure accumulates texturally (humming fragment, borrowed voices layering) but does not escalate causally to force a trade-off that the protagonist enacts.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—whether to cross the threshold the mentor crossed—is signaled early and tightens when the stranger offers the choice explicitly. The pendant's intensifying vibrations and the ridgeway's breathing provide accumulative pressure, but the courier's agency is passive: the stranger arrives, the pendant "guides," and she "lets the vibrations guide her." The final step forward forecloses routine deliveries with visible cost (magic spent, mentor's fate now hers), yet the escalation is primarily external stimulus rather than protagonist-driven choice under competing pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—proving objects absorb emotions—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through Elias's communion attempt: frost reading, prism use, palm to quartz. One meaningful deepening occurs when the man's memory surfaces and reframes the premise. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens relies on thematic reweighting rather than a turn that narrows live options or forces a trade-off. The resolution (understanding objects as mirrors) is conceptual; no visible price is paid, no path foreclosed on the page. Agency is present but cost legibility at closure is weak.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—carry the message before the last light fades—is declared but not tested with visible alternatives or trade-offs. The journey proceeds without on-page reversals or narrowing options; obstacles are summarized ("valleys where the wind carried no sound") rather than forcing tactical choices. Kael's death upon arrival removes the anticipated confrontation, and the realization that the message was "for her" shifts meaning but does not emerge from protagonist agency or a prior decision that foreclosed a path. Pressure remains atmospheric rather than escalating through choice.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—seal the mines to save the orchards—is clear and sustained. However, the night's work proceeds without a meaningful reversal, complication, or cost that narrows Elias's options. The silk weaves itself "as if drawn by an unseen hand," reducing protagonist agency at the peak beat. The mine "groans," suggesting structural risk, yet no tactical adaptation or price materializes. One tightening deepening is present (understanding the leaching problem and choosing the silk solution), but escalation flattens during execution.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering the withheld truth about fragmented selves across the multiverse—is signaled early and tightens when the other Kael activates the gate. The escalation is driven by Kael's agency (choosing to touch shard to console), but the final decision is withheld from the page, leaving the cost abstract. One meaningful reversal occurs (other Kael's declaration that "you're the only one who can do this"), yet the scanner's coordinate lock and Kael's decision feel like setup rather than closure. The pressure coheres under a causal lens but doesn't fully land with a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—protecting the feeling of safety, or responding to the anonymous call—is present but diffuse. Elias's agency manifests in the stone reply and relighting the lamp, which narrows options (he commits to the exchange). However, the stones rearranging themselves removes his final choice from the page, and the cost of connection is told ("didn't feel alone") rather than shown through a visible trade-off or foreclosed path. One meaningful tightening occurs (the spiral grows, the final note arrives), but the price remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (shaping a new dawn via the lighthouse) is signaled early but escalation under the Accumulative lens is thin: Veyra adjusts the lantern and the vision clarifies without resistance, reversal, or visible cost. The woman's "We are ready" line is received without friction or trade-off. No live option is foreclosed on the page, and the final decision to "step into the light" is projected rather than executed with a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding "why some people magnetize stories"—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. The traveler's arrival introduces complication, and the map's symbols align with the sun trails, creating one meaningful deepening. However, no reversal forecloses options; the dye master's realization at dawn involves no trade-off or visible cost. The piece accumulates texture but does not tighten choices or demonstrate agency with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: understanding the tower's hunger and his role as memory-keeper. The sextant discovery and moonlight healing provide one meaningful deepening that changes Elias's relationship to the tower. However, escalation is textural rather than choice-driven; the sextant "clicks" on its own, the realignment happens without Elias's agency, and the trees' script appears as revelation rather than a price paid. The storm "still howls" but no longer feels like a prison—acceptance without visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (rekindling dawn) is signaled early and tested on-page when Elara plants the seed and sings despite vocal failure. One meaningful tightening occurs when her voice trembles and she must continue anyway. However, no live opposition materializes—the villagers join without resistance, the seed sprouts immediately, and the dawn arrives on schedule. Thekeeper's role as guide rather than gatekeeper flattens the conflict; Elara never faces a trade-off or loses something to gain the dawns.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to follow the invitation and unmake his mistake—is signaled early and tightens once: Elias moves from contemplation to action, choosing to leave. That tightening is meaningful and driven by his agency. The cost is visible (he abandons his post, steps into uncertainty), but the story offers no second reversal or complication; the choice unfolds smoothly without a counterpressure beat. The regret over the woman is told rather than tested; we needed a moment where staying tempted him concretely, raising the price of departure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake: finding absolution/the sacred amid erasure. One meaningful tightening occurs when the woman offers seeds and Elias moves from passive observation to active planting. The cost is conceptual—accepting that restoration is small, stubborn work rather than grand gesture—and is legible on the page ("tenuous," "first green shoot"). No antagonist or multiple reversals, but pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens and the ending reweights prior material. Agency reads as decision with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—saving the library from oblivion—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates as Elias works the slide and the illusion flickers, but the escalation feels more procedural than agonizing. The final "locking" of frequencies stabilizes the vow, yet no live option is visibly foreclosed; the turn reads as affirmation rather than a choice that costs him something immediate and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—thwarting the deal's unraveling—is signaled early and tested concretely at the knife confrontation. The escalation tightens through two false starts, then forces Lena's agency (stepping forward, invoking her father's reputation). The resolution is earned by her choice, and the cost is legible: she's only delayed betrayal, not stopped it. One meaningful tightening (the knife lowering "just an inch") forecloses the immediate violence with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled: Elara wants to understand why some carry weather. The compass pulls her to the storm-man, creating one meaningful tightening—she follows curiosity into the clearing. However, the encounter delivers answers without forcing a trade-off; the storm-man's revelations are given freely, and Elara's acceptance carries no visible price or foreclosed alternative. Escalation stalls when exposition replaces pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—finding the source of the laughter—is clear, but escalation is thin: Elias sketches the lock, finds the painting, and opens the door without meaningful resistance or narrowing of options. The "three days" of sketching is summary-only and does not dramatize struggle. No visible price is paid; the lock clicks open without a trade-off, and the golden light arrival feels convenient rather than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—finding where lost conversations go—is signaled early, and the map reconstruction creates one meaningful tightening. However, the escalation is driven by discovery rather than agency under pressure; Liora solves a puzzle without trade-offs or visible prices that alter later tactics. The staircase revelation functions as a cliffhanger rather than a choice that forecloses a path with on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving wonder's colors—is signaled early and remains coherent. Elias's descent and choice to break the orb constitute one meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens, narrowing his options (the orb is destroyed, not preserved) and producing a visible outcome (the sculpture sings brighter). However, the cost is oblique; the orb's destruction and the fragment's melting feel more like natural progression than a trade-off that forecloses a live alternative. No sharp reversal or forced dilemma tests his commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Eli's need to resolve inner static and understand his purpose—is signaled early and tightens when he opens the box and screams. The controlled burn decision is agency as renunciation: he sacrifices the roses and his fears to achieve peace, forecloses his caretaker role. The cost is visible (farm destroyed, box smoldering, roses gone). Under the Accumulative lens, the magnetic shifts and static intensify until the burn reweights his stance. However, the turn from "containing chaos" to "release" arrives quickly; a second on-page complication or failed containment attempt before the burn would have elevated escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—solving the mailbox mystery and proving that listening heals—is signaled early and accumulates through three clue beats (Mrs. Hargrove, Mr. Chen, Clara's arrival). The escalation is additive rather than narrowing: each fragment deepens context without forcing a trade-off or raising cost. Clara's climactic moment carries emotional weight, but Elara's agency is witnessing, not decision under duress. No on-page reversal tests commitment; the resolution lands through coincidence (Clara arrives at dawn) rather than protagonist-driven pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—liberating "the truth" or "the lab's final secret"—is declared but never tested by a dilemma that forces Elara to trade one want against another. She rolls dice, reads her journal, watches Kael dance, and the coordinates appear; no reversal, no foreclosed option, no visible price paid. The water rising is mentioned but does not alter her tactics. Escalation under an Accumulative lens requires density increase or cadence shift that reweights cost; here the final chamber simply appears when cued by the cipher, a revelation without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is clear: Marlowe seeks his sister and the truth about deleted memories/echoes. The story tightens once—when the journal confirms the whale is a vessel and echoes persist—narrowing his options from denial to pursuit. Gravity fluctuations and the journal's sketch provide escalation under the Accumulative lens. However, agency is muted; Marlowe is guided by symbols (coffee grounds, journal) rather than making a high-cost decision on the page. The ending crystallizes his choice to answer the whale, but the trade-off (what he risks, what he abandons) remains implicit rather than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.0)
    The dominant stake—hushing the prophecy—is signaled early but never tested by a reversal or complication. The summoner faces no opposition, internal friction, or visible price; he simply enacts his plan in a straight line. The story substitutes atmospheric intensity ("tranquil blaze," "terrestrially cosmic hum") for escalation, offering no moment where options narrow or cost becomes palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding Veyra's hidden legacy—is signaled early and tightens when Mira reveals her identity and the "agreed-upon lie." However, the escalation is primarily revelatory rather than a narrowing of options under pressure. Elara's agency at closure is agreement rather than a choice with visible cost; no tactic is visibly altered or path foreclosed on the page. The phrase "some truths are too heavy to carry alone" gestures at cost but does not dramatize what Elara or Mira must give up to pursue this new path.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—freeing or understanding Liora—is signaled early. Pressure tightens when the shimmer forms and Liora explains she's "archived," then offers the key to set her free. However, the escalation is largely expository (told through Liora's explanation of government containment) rather than a decision under competing pressures. The final commitment ("I'm not afraid anymore") lacks a visible trade-off or foreclosed option; Elias's acceptance feels declarative rather than earned by on-page cost or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving the truth and freeing herself from the past—is signaled early and coheres. Vey's arrival narrows options (hide or reveal), and the key mechanism provides one meaningful reversal that changes tactics. The final choice—revelation without destruction—carries visible opportunity cost (she foregoes vengeance). However, Vey's non-reaction after the scroll reveal deflates expected escalation; his passivity ("he did not move") undercuts the promised confrontation. Agency is clear but the antagonist's collapse softens the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding why echoes persist—is signaled early but never escalates or faces an on-page test. Liora encounters no obstacle, trades no competing value, and suffers no visible loss. Veyan's arrival provides exposition and the missing shell half; coincidence resolves the premise. The singing at closure is collaborative rather than agentic, and no cost (time, stamina, relational friction) appears on the page to charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—salvaging something pure, then discovering sabotage—is signaled early and tightens once when Mara realizes the red-coated woman was the saboteur. The dream-to-descendants arc provides accumulative pressure, but the week of interviews is summarized rather than dramatized, flattening escalation. The final choice to stay silent lacks a visible trade-off; no on-page consequence (a relationship severed, a tool abandoned, a future option foreclosed) makes the cost tangible. One meaningful deepening is present, but the lack of dramatized price caps the score in mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—Ren's longing to share his vision of hidden patterns—is signaled early but remains abstract and low-pressure. Mei's arrival is coincidental rather than protagonist-driven, and her whistle does not represent a reversal or tightening so much as a convenient delivery of what Ren already wanted. The sketch and invitation to "stay" feel like symmetric satisfaction without visible trade-off or foreclosed path. No meaningful escalation or deepening occurs; the piece moves laterally from solitude to companionship without testing commitment or forcing a choice between competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the stillpoint and its suppressed truth—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias realizes the liquidation was a cover-up. However, escalation lacks agency-driven cost: the stranger arrives and offers help, the diamond is handed over, and the revelation is delivered without trade-off. The final image reweights knowledge but does not narrow options or exact a visible price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—Elias's bid to lead versus Kael's charisma—is clear, but escalation is asserted rather than tested: the voices simply tell him to act, he descends without obstacle, and the crowd's turn happens in a single beat without a prior micro-reversal or visible cost that narrows his options. Kael's "confidence cracking like ice" summarizes a capitulation we do not witness through dialogue or resistance. The ending leaves Elias poised but does not show a tactical price paid or a path foreclosed with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—escaping obscurity and meaninglessness—is signaled early. One tightening occurs when the girl asks "What are you doing?" and Elias realizes he is "the translator between generations." However, this is an internal realization without a visible trade-off; no live option is foreclosed, no prior tactic abandoned. The Cost Proof Test in Q4: I cannot identify a sentence where Elias sacrifices a path or pays a price at the moment of insight. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure deepens but does not narrow options with on-page cost, capping the score at mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—protecting the sacred key from misuse—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure escalates through Elias's agency: he chooses to disrupt the scavenger's frequency, then chooses to plunge his hand into the water despite personal cost. The scavenger's presence and vibrational matching create genuine opposition. The final act of grasping the key forecloses the path of avoidance and the cost (confronting his own guilt) is legible on the page. One small slip: the scavenger's sudden collapse after the tuning fork shatters feels convenient, reducing the tension slightly before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding the viaduct's hum and the brewing revolution—is signaled early but never escalates through protagonist agency. Elias observes, kneels, stands, and extends his hand; no choice narrows options or imposes visible cost. The stranger's appearance is coincidental, and the shared acknowledgment ("You feel it too") does not alter tactics or foreclose a path. One tightening (the hum deepening) occurs, but it is environmental rather than driven by Elias's decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—escaping Voss's control—is signaled by the second page. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias overhears the conspiracy, but this arrives via coincidence (he happens to be there) rather than his investigative agency. The decision to send evidence is clean but lacks visible trade-off; no resource, safety, or relationship is sacrificed on the page. The escalation reads as discovery rather than narrowing options through Elias's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias sent an innocent man to his death—is signaled early and tightens when Kael confirms the heart was "not meant for the living," forcing Elias to act. One meaningful reversal (apology insufficient, proof required) narrows options with visible cost: his vocation now demands justice over mere words. Agency is clear in the final beat. Pressure coheres under the causal lens, though the middle section's reflective weight slightly dilutes escalation momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—ring the bell before the workshop dies—is signaled early and tightens cleanly as the gears grind to a halt. Elias's agency drives every beat: he works faster, fits the final gear, pulls the cord. The rising acid sea and Veyra's warnings provide coherent external pressure. The echo's arrival reverses expectation (no sound, but a *feeling*) and the closure choice to interpret it as "it heard us" carries visible risk, though the aftermath cost is deferred off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—uncovering what Nexis hides—is signaled early and tightens through the numbers pattern to the video discovery. The video revelation raises personal danger and forces Lena's choice to copy the file, a meaningful escalation that narrows options. Yet the final turn feels passive: she watches footage, then decides; no on-page complication (system alert, observer, conflicting evidence) tests her commitment in real time. The cost is asserted ("digging further would put her in danger") but not dramatized—no trade-off between career, safety, or conflicting loyalty plays out on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—save the village from the ice threat—is signaled early. One tightening occurs when the ice creature breaches, but Elias's response (hurl the fragment) is not earned by prior tactical failure or a narrowed set of options; he simply tries it. No visible cost accrues: the fragment glows, the beast dissolves, and the villagers are saved without forfeiture. The coincidence of the path appearing and the fragment working without setup undermines escalation under a Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: learning the sound of endings, signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the parasol exchange and the man's death, but escalation is gentle rather than sharp; the tightening comes in Elias's acceptance of the clipboard, which narrows options (he stays rather than leaves). The resolution is more renunciation than decision, fitting the lens, though the cost could be more visceral. One meaningful deepening is present; no explicit antagonist is required here.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—whether Liora will risk reopening to Elias—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when she voices "You hurt me," forcing him to account and her to choose forgiveness or closure. The burned letter narrows options: its arrival compels the vigil, and her holding it "like a fragile truce" pressures the exchange. Cost is visible in her tremor and his pained nod, though the lift in her chest and his smile arrive quickly after years of estrangement, slightly softening the earned reversal. Agency is hers in reaching out, but Elias's epiphany feels more told than tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dominant stake: preserve the echo of wisdom (signaled early). Escalation under Accumulative lens occurs via the clearing's bloom and the thread's appearance, which deepens understanding. Yet the line walker's agency is minimal—he waits, watches peripherally, and accepts instruction. No reversal or tightening forecloses a live option; the prophet's arrival is convenient rather than hard-won. The "decide what to preserve" framing promises a choice, but the protagonist never selects between competing echoes or pays a price to keep the thread alive. Pressure accumulates via imagery but does not force a trade-off, leaving escalation legible but stakes untested.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—honoring the workers' lives by creating a visual narrative—is signaled early and remains coherent, but no meaningful escalation or tightening occurs on the page. Elias faces no resistance, no competing pressure, and no moment where his choices narrow options or impose cost. The act of placing the final photograph at the center is described as completing the masterpiece, yet this move was always available and never at risk. Under the accumulative lens, escalation would require a density increase, pattern break, or cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost; here the story maintains a single meditative register throughout, and the ending dove flight is coincidental rather than causal. No on-page reversal or deepening alters tactics or knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: decode the crystal's pattern to explain impossible garden growth. Elias performs escalating experiments (whisper, hum, temple press) that deepen his understanding in one causal sequence. The accumulative lens allows pressure to cohere through density rather than reversals. However, no visible trade-off or foreclosed option appears; the discovery arrives without cost to tactics, relationships, or resources. The ending reweights meaning but lacks an on-page price that charges the final image under the selected lens.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—capturing the sound of growing older before forgetting—is signaled early and remains coherent. The driftwood spiral arrangement provides one on-page tightening (completing the pattern to reveal the stone and receive the tape), and the woman's withholding ("First, you have to finish") generates mild pressure. However, the escalation is mechanical rather than agency-driven: he places sticks in sequence without visible trade-offs, and the tape arrives as reward rather than consequence of a hard choice. No live option is foreclosed; the cost remains abstract (he'll forget again, but the story asserts he won't this time). The reversal (receiving the tape, seeing his younger self) deepens understanding but doesn't narrow options or force a tactical price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—capturing the impossible vision—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias replaces the shutter with the clock hand, narrowing his options to this one experimental shot. The foundations shaking adds external pressure, but the escalation is largely atmospheric rather than driven by Elias's agency. The cost at closure is the observatory's destruction, but this is circumstantial rather than a trade-off Elias consciously accepts; he clutches the photograph in triumph, suggesting the price was bearable and external.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—executing Lena's "flawless goodbye"—is signaled by the doctor's call and sustained throughout. Pressure accumulates through Lena's specific requests (the song about mundane things, the vinyl reunification), each narrowing Elias's performance into a more intimate farewell. The tightening is meaningful: the shift from generic "what do you want to hear?" to "hymn the mundane" forces a choice that tests his understanding of their friendship. The reunification of vinyl shards at the end forecloses the path of solitary grief, offering shared brokenness with felt cost (his tight throat, the vigil). Agency is present in Elias's acceptance and performance, though the lack of internal resistance keeps escalation from reaching the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—finding where shadows go—is signaled early and sustained. The descent and mirror-chamber discovery provide one meaningful tightening. Yet Liora's agency at closure is limited: the guardian tells her what to do, she complies, and the shadows return. No live option is foreclosed with visible cost; the loop closes mechanically rather than through a choice that trades competing goods. Escalation is present but the cost legibility required for 8.0+ is missing.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: find the changeling, set the town's wound. Pressure accumulates through the discovery of the second tooth, the map's appearance, and the maze navigation, with one meaningful deepening when the child offers the third tooth and Lena understands her role. The ending reconfigures her stance—she can keep what the town could not—but the coincidental appearance of the map (teeth vanish, map appears) edges toward convenience rather than earned agency. Cost is legible in her acceptance of the child and the town's ignorance, scaled appropriately to this length.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—sharing light without burning—is signaled early and coheres throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when Liora touches the pearl and the world stills, narrowing her tactical options to reflection rather than force. The resolution is earned by her descent and discovery, though the pearl solves the problem without requiring a visible tradeoff or sacrifice on the page (she gains the pearl, no cost is dramatized in the retrieval). The ending reweights her failure, but the final act is more gift than wrestled choice, preventing high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias's surveillance will heal or widen the rift—is signaled early and tightens when he proffers the notebook, forcing Mira's vulnerability. The escalation is earned under the Accumulative lens: months of observation → confrontation → mutual release. Cost is legible in Mira's trembling and the siblings' joint decision to relinquish the pendant, foreclosing individual possession. However, the final image of "tension...unraveling" softens the price slightly; a sharper physical or relational trade-off would lift this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—collecting ephemeral hopes to give them weight—is signaled early and braided with his unfinished novel. Pressure accumulates through three cameo encounters, each vanishing before he can act, and the protagonist-ghost's rebuke ("You never let me be anything more than a sketch") tightens the meta-conflict. The ending pivot lacks a visible trade-off or forfeited option; Elias's acceptance ("let them pass through him") is told rather than tested on the page. One meaningful deepening is present but escalation stops short of forcing a choice with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (restore the old songs and practices) is signaled early and coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when the tendril tightens and she recalls the sacred practices, prompting her to sing; the arbor's golden response narrows her path to communal persuasion. Cost is legible in the final image—she must now face village scoffing—but the escalation is primarily textural (hush deepens, light flares) rather than a hard trade-off. The villagers' future resistance is forecast but not tested on the page, so pressure peaks in the arbor moment without a second live choice.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—to seal the pause between heartbeats, not the heartbeat itself—is signaled by the first third and remains coherent. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elias folds the flash-paper into an origami jar and strikes the match; the jar's glow and its settling onto the plate narrow options (he cannot repeat or undo the act) and the final line acknowledges release as the price of possession. Under the Accumulative lens, this single intensification is sufficient. Agency is present in the deliberate folding and ignition, though the lack of an alternative path or visible trade-off in the moment keeps the score in the 7-band rather than 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: repair the timer to capture wonder. One meaningful tightening occurs when the timer mechanism first stutters, then the quartz adjustment births the reflection. However, escalation is thin—Elias kneels, pries, adjusts—but no live option is visibly foreclosed or traded off on the page. The boy's touch solves the problem without Elias making a high-cost choice; coincidence (the reflection appearing at this moment) resolves rather than complicates. Cost is conceptual (abandoning "storage" model) but not felt in tactics or visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding the weight of a choice never made—is signaled early and remains coherent. Liora's agency is renunciatory: she lets burdens settle, breathes through pain, and chooses not to be crushed. However, the escalation is announced rather than dramatized; the risks (calcified air, bones to bronze) are declared but never test her tactics or force a visible trade-off. The burdens dissolve without on-page consequence, and the "lightness" at closure lacks a legible price. One tightening occurs (match struck, air thickens), but the cost remains atmospheric rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Elara's relationship to grief and the uncarved blank. One meaningful tightening occurs when she moves from letting the kettle boil (passive ritual) to picking up the carving knife—a decision that narrows options and forecloses the prior stasis. The carved lion is not Jarek's roaring beasts but "quiet...both fierce and still," reweighting what remains after loss. The cost is legible on the page: she stops trying to "harvest lessons" and accepts that "some things couldn't be contained, only held." Agency is decision (to carve) followed by renunciation (setting it down), with visible emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—negotiating with her ghost to resolve regret—is signaled early and the ghost's arrival mid-story tightens the scavenger's options. Yet the escalation is more atmospheric than causal: the scavenger dips her fingers, the ghost speaks, the wheel sinks, and then the ghost dissolves without a visible trade-off or cost that alters tactics. The "now you listen" directive reweights the stake conceptually but does not narrow options on the page; coincidence does not resolve, but neither does protagonist agency drive the final reconfiguration with a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is Mara's assessment, reweighted at closure into a search for resilience. The water's redirect and the woman's presence deepen the puzzle, but no on-page reversal narrows Mara's options—she follows the trail and is rewarded with answers. The woman's endurance carries implied cost, yet it occurred off-page; Mara's sketching is documentation, not a trade-off that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Elias reconciling his buried dream—is signaled early through the music box and forecourt memory. One meaningful tightening occurs when the girl's request forces him into contact with his past. However, the bear's arrival does not escalate pressure through protagonist agency; it offers a convenient external prompt. The final kneeling gesture crystallizes his stance, but the cost (what he forecloses by returning) remains abstract. No trade-off or tactical choice narrows options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—uncovering forgotten truths—is signaled early but remains abstract. Pressure accumulates through symbolic objects rather than narrowing options: the sundial's needle spin and mirror's reflection deepen mystery without forcing a trade-off. The protagonist's agency is observational (watching, reaching, lifting) rather than renunciative; no live path is foreclosed with on-page cost. The figure's whisper *"You've been looking in the wrong places"* offers a turn, but the protagonist's response—lifting the mirror—feels like acceptance without struggle or visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—decode the rope to uncover ancient wisdom—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through pattern revelation (simple knot → complex cipher → place name) but does not tighten into a choice with trade-off or cost. The flicker in the water hints at complication but does not force a decision. Agency is observation rather than renunciation or stance crystallization; Elias's plan at the end (return to the old woman) reads as next step, not transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding grief's movement to stitch the kingdom's wound—is signaled early and tightens when Lena kneels to embed the thread, a micro-choice that forecloses passive observation. One meaningful deepening occurs: the thread shifts from stolen artifact to symbolic suture, reweighting her obituary practice as an attempt at healing rather than documentation. The king's absence and the court's polished denial supply external pressure, though these remain atmospheric rather than on-page antagonistic force. Cost is felt in "hollowed out, as if she were the one being buried" and visible in the final image of shadows swallowing her.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—reviving the Luminis to restore beauty—is signaled early and tightens through three escalating attempts: over-wound contraption, hummed melody, sung lullabies. Each attempt narrows options and raises cost (the egg shudders, cracks but doesn't part, finally hatches). The protagonist's agency drives the turn from mechanical assembly to memory-based song, and the cost is legible: years wasted, public failure implied, and the bird's refusal to sing yet. No antagonist is required; the flawed method itself provides opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—proving scars can sing, demonstrating healing over destruction—is signaled early but remains abstract and never tested. No on-page tightening or trade-off occurs; Lena's decision to teach the girl is unopposed and costs nothing visible. The girl's question ("Why do you come here?") offers a beat of mild curiosity but no reversal or escalation. The siren in the distance is a token gesture toward external pressure but does not force a choice. Under the Accumulative lens, a deepening or cadence shift is required; here the mood remains static from first to last paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (liberating trapped memories) is signaled but remains abstract until the grandmother's arrival. One tightening occurs: the key turns, the basin splits, forcing the descent choice. However, the cost is implied rather than viscerally felt—no visible trade-off or forfeited option precedes her stepping down. The grandmother's wisdom arrives as convenience rather than a pressure reversal Elara must navigate. Agency at closure is present (she uses the key) but feels low-resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: breaking the generational cycle by sharing light without consuming fire. One clear tightening occurs when Kael's ship emerges and confronts Elias, raising immediate cost ("You're repeating the same mistake"), then the gear's activation disables Kael's weapons—a reversal that narrows tactical options. The resolution hinges on Elias's choice to activate the gear despite opposition, though Kael's swift shift from threat to wonder undercuts the escalation slightly. Cost is legible: Elias accepts that "the cycle wasn't broken" while seeding future change, a trade-off present in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding his father's loss and his own grief—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the spectral ribbon, the poem discovery, and the butterfly migration metaphor. However, escalation is passive: Elias waits, finds, and realizes rather than making a choice that narrows options or imposes visible cost. The final act—draping the ribbon—is symbolic but not a trade-off that forecloses another path. The story deepens meaning but does not tighten through protagonist agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—restore the pendulum's balance—signals early and tightens once: Elias discovers the inscribed handle, recognizes his forgotten sins, climbs the tower, and transfers the burden to the bob. The tightening occurs when he realizes the tide hasn't washed his guilt clean, forcing the ritual transfer. Agency is clear: he chooses to press each name into the brass, and the cost is legible—he strips the handle and casts it away, foreclosing return to incremental absolution. The pendulum's resumption earns the resolution. No antagonist required; the imbalance itself is the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=4.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering Margaret's story—is signaled early but remains investigative rather than escalatory. Elias encounters blue, red, and gold threads in sequence, each leading to a new artifact, but no reversal narrows his options or imposes cost. The ending beat ("Tomorrow, he would plant roses... Tonight, he would listen") is a continuation of his gardener's care, not a tightening or trade-off. No live option is foreclosed, and the protagonist's agency does not drive a meaningful turn under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—sparking innovation among stagnant scholars—is signaled early but never tested on the page. Elara faces no meaningful opposition, reversal, or cost; she writes, the future "bends to her will," and she succeeds without complication. The phrase "not because she controlled it, but because she understood its rhythms" asserts mastery rather than dramatizing struggle. No tightening or deepening narrows her options or forces a trade-off; the predictive model "had been right" without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—making stories return—is signaled early, but escalation is weak. Elias tunes the radio nightly, hears more lyrics, gathers dust, and succeeds without meaningful resistance or narrowing options. The "first word formed" moment involves no visible price; no resource is spent, no relationship strained, no alternative foreclosed. Coincidence (the radio's broadcast timing) enables rather than complicates, and the ending "next night, he would gather more" defers rather than crystallizes cost.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—Elias's need to complete his mother's unfinished portrait and understand her cryptic journal—is signaled early and persists. One meaningful tightening occurs when the mask-vision reveals "You can't keep what isn't yours," narrowing his understanding. However, the escalation from observation (touching frames, kneeling) to the final scattering lacks a mid-story choice that forecloses a live option; the ash-scattering feels like fulfillment of an off-page plan rather than a pressure-driven turn. The cost at closure (walking away, not looking back) is visible but muted.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.2)
    One dominant stake is clear: Elias must decide whether to keep his findings buried or risk exposure. The story offers one meaningful tightening—his resolve to take the evidence to the surface—but the escalation is more internal deliberation than on-page pressure that narrows options through external friction or a visible tradeoff. No antagonist or complicating event tests his commitment; the decision feels like natural conclusion rather than a forced choice with legible cost. Agency is present (his decision to act) but the final step lacks dramatized consequence that would make the price unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—braiding diverse voices into harmony—is signaled early and pressure accumulates through rehearsal sequences. However, escalation is additive (rehearsal 3, 5, 7) rather than causal; no single on-page reversal tightens options or forces a trade-off. The choir's transformation from divided to unified is told in summary ("By the third rehearsal...") rather than dramatized, and the protagonist's agency is passive observation plus zither-playing without meaningful resistance or cost. No visible price is paid; the resolution arrives without a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—grow the knowledge fruit to heal memories—is signaled early and pursued on the page. The celestial alignment imposes a time constraint ("hours away," then "alignment began," then "had passed"), but no on-page tightening or reversal tests Mara's resolve; the seed sprouts on cue, the fruit ripens "at an unnatural pace," and eating it succeeds without complication or price. The vision fades, leaving Mara whole and hopeful with seeds to spare, which undercuts escalation. No live option is foreclosed, no choice forces a trade-off, and luck (the alignment, unnatural growth) drives outcomes more than protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—save the hives to preserve the city's wonder—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when the riddle reveals sabotage, narrowing Elias's options. Yet the tower infiltration has no obstacle or trade-off; the solution (strike the match) is provided by the riddle rather than earned by Elias's agency under pressure. The ending restores the hives but leaves the saboteur unaddressed, so the closure feels incomplete rather than a crystallized stance or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: understanding why houses feel alive. Pressure accumulates through atmospheric intensification (tide, silence, house leaning), and one tightening occurs when the shard pauses the house, narrowing Elias's understanding. The final realization—houses listen to themselves—reweights his quest. However, escalation is largely observational; Elias does not face a forced choice or trade-off, and the cost (walking away, unanswered) is more acceptance than a foreclosed path with visible price. Under the Accumulative lens, the deepening is sufficient but not urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.6)
    One dominant stake (uncover the garden's secret) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when the statue reveals the bloom as prison, not cure. The diver's agency—pressing the ampoule despite the new knowledge—narrows options and the cost is immediate and visible (tendrils lash out, the monstrous truth freed). The escalation is clean under a causal lens: revelation → hesitation → choice → consequence. No unnecessary reversals; pressure coheres and deepens exactly once, which fits this length.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (proving limits of infinity) is signaled early but remains abstract. The dice roll creates a physical effect (shudder, cracks, tilt) but Elias faces no trade-off, no tactical adjustment, no cost that narrows options—he simply continues climbing. No genuine escalation or deepening occurs; the staircase changes and he adapts without friction. The "texture of a missed opportunity" remains a label rather than a felt pressure that forces a choice. Agency reads as execution of a plan rather than decision under constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—proving strangers remember kindness—is signaled early and coherent. Pressure accumulates through the painting ritual and moonlight-charged reflection, but no on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows options. The decision to distribute paintings is presented as resolved certainty with no visible cost, alternative, or friction. Escalation remains textural rather than choice-driven, consistent with the Accumulative lens but limiting closure force.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—rescuing dying arts—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the silent hives, the unfinished tapestry, and Liora's family memory, then tightens when she bakes the bread. However, the escalation lacks a genuine reversal or narrowing of options; each step (dream, bakery, baking) proceeds without meaningful resistance or cost. The bees' return feels like external validation rather than a choice-driven consequence, and no live trade-off is visible. The story offers one deepening (personal memory to communal rescue) but the final act doesn't foreclose a path with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—reversing time to "step beyond fate's design"—is signaled early and tightens through three yoyo drops: the first rise, the higher ascent, and the final plummet that splits the stone. Each trial narrows options and raises conceptual cost. The protagonist's agency drives escalation, but the mechanics of consequence remain abstract: "the world *reversed*," "the lighthouse groaned backward," "the storm clouds unraveled." Cost is implied (Elias now bears "the weight of time") yet the exact trade-off—what he lost or risked—is not concretely legible on the page. The accumulative lens justifies the lack of a causal reversal, but visibility of price at closure is partial.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: confront the fear that he is hollow. The mirror's lunge provides one reversal, and the advisor's aphorism ("starve it") shifts tactics. The resolution—pressing his palm and the reflection recoiling—feels abrupt; the cost is visible (cloak discarded, advisor gone) but light. No secondary constraint shapes the attempt. The tightening is legible but minimal; the mirror conflict resolves in a single gesture without sustained trade-offs or escalating price.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—transforming obstacles into euphony—is signaled early and propels each beat. The mallet-striking sequence tightens rhythmically, and the clouds' fractal shift offers visual escalation. Yet the accumulative pressure never narrows options or imposes a trade-off; Leeward encounters no resistance, miscalculation, or refusal. Without visible cost or a live choice that forecloses a path, escalation reads decorative rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—Mira's need to understand the watchers and prove the cracks are doors—is signaled early and tightens when she discovers the expedition. The encounter with the transformed figures raises cost and narrows options: she can no longer ignore what lies beyond. However, the escalation relies more on atmospheric dread than on a trade-off Mira makes under pressure; her decision to flee is reactive rather than a forced choice between competing goods. The final boarding of the ship reweights her stance but doesn't fully dramatize what she's forfeiting by continuing her search.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to expose or preserve the forgery—is signaled early and tightens when Liora challenges him. The final decision (private collector displaying both versions) narrows options and forecloses pure-truth advocacy with a conceptual cost. However, Liora's too-quick agreement ("You're not stealing it... You're preserving it") deflates the confrontation before a harder trade-off can land, reducing the felt price of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—witnessing and responding to absence—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through each note but lacks a meaningful tightening or trade-off that narrows options. The progression is additive (note one, note two, note three) without escalation or visible cost that alters tactics. Elias's final note is thematically resonant but not a decision under duress; he simply completes the pattern. No reversal or moment where his agency forecloses a live path. The drawbridge descent signals closure time but does not force a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—tracing the stamp's origin—is signaled early and pursued consistently. The ledger discovery provides one meaningful turn (shifts from "no records mentioned it" to finding the family crest in official use). However, the escalation is modest: no live option is foreclosed, no visible trade-off occurs. The "alternative hypothesis" that it's "more than a mere tool" is confirmed without resistance or cost. The final choice to stay in the library rather than return to the waking city above could have been sharpened by showing what he's renouncing.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (processing grief through dream-lanterns) is signaled but never tested by a competing cost or opposing force. No meaningful escalation occurs—Veyra's process is described in steady summary until the lantern shatters, an event that happens *to* her rather than because of her choices. The whisper of her brother's name and the light coiling around her suggest stakes but arrive without prior tightening or a decision that forecloses a path. Accumulative pressure requires a cadence shift or density break at closure; this piece offers ambient atmosphere instead.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—finding answers about unused potential and grief—is signaled early and Lena's hunt drives her forward. The geode flaring and the ghost solidifying create a mid-story tightening, but the ending reverts to "the hunt wasn't over," which undercuts closure rather than narrowing options or forcing a trade-off. The alarms and her flight constitute complication, not escalation driven by her agency. No visible price is paid at the end; she simply runs, leaving the cost off the page.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—decoding belonging—is signaled early and tightens as the chip responds to the drone, the stars reveal patterns, and the station appears. The escalation is functional under the Situational lens, but agency is weak: the drone and chip do the work while Elias and the pilgrim watch. The final choice (powering down, following) feels more like acceptance than a decision with visible trade-offs. No on-page cost is shown—stamina, tool loss, social consequence—that would sharpen the commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—Elias discovering the truth about Liora—is signaled early and tightens when the uncle confirms she was taken and hands over the key. The carved symbol functions as a reversal that narrows options from vague suspicion to actionable lead. Agency is clear: Elias chooses to break the watch hand and pursue the boathouse, forfeiting his memorial anchor. The cost is visible and proportionate, though the uncle's convenient arrival and full confession reduce the price of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prisoner-exchange stake is declared but never tested on the page—the spymaster and heirloom remain props, and the exchange itself occurs off-page ("The prisoners would arrive soon"). Seris and Elias trade tokens (drawer pull shown as proof, locket received), but these gestures lack friction or cost. No reversal narrows options; the scene ends before escalation pays off, capping pressure in the mid-5s.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—aligning heart and action by charting his own course—is signaled early and tightens through Elias's physical journey and reflection. The kayak's gravitation to the island narrows options, and the compass throw is a decisive agency moment that forecloses the father's path with visible cost. The escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as a cadence shift: the rhythm of paddling, the wind's spray provoking laughter/relief, then the island arrival and the hurling act. Pressure coheres and intensifies once, sufficient for this length. The cost is legible: the compass is gone, the old life swallowed, and the utility poles no longer feel like a lifeline.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—Elias seeking a reason to keep going—is signaled early, and the left/right tunnel choice provides one on-page tightening. However, the choice itself carries no visible cost or consequence that narrows later options; Mara's comment "Most people pick right... Because it's easier" labels difficulty without dramatizing it. The chamber of mirrors deepens interiority but doesn't escalate pressure through agency or a trade-off. Escalation under the Accumulative lens would require a cadence shift or density increase that reweights the stake with cost; the final realization that "the labyrinth was a mirror" reprices the premise conceptually but does not land with a felt price that alters Elias's tactics or forecloses a path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—reforging a bond beyond death—is signaled early and drives the conjuring ritual. The ritual itself provides a single tightening: spices ignite, his form wavers and transforms into the phoenix-bird. Under the Accumulative lens, this suffices as one meaningful pressure point. Agency is present: Liora gathers, grinds, speaks the old words, and accepts the transformation. However, the escalation reads more as inevitable unfolding than as a choice that forecloses live alternatives—Liora never wrestles with whether to proceed or considers abandoning the ritual. The visible cost (he will not return "as he was") is declared but not tested through competing options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—finding where lost time accumulates—is signaled early and the cartomancer's agency is visible in the ritual of spreading the cloth and tracing the crack. However, escalation is minimal: she arrives, reflects, traces, and rests her hands; no option is foreclosed or narrowed mid-scene, and no external or internal pressure forces a difficult trade-off. The cost is legible in the image of her not flinching and in the "quiet, choking beauty of what endures," but it accrues through lyric accumulation rather than a turn that tests commitment or alters tactics. The Accumulative lens allows for this design, yet even within that mode the piece would benefit from a more visible shift in her stance or a concrete realization that changes her next move.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake: open the locked dimension. One meaningful tightening occurs when the last photograph (woman and child) accuses "You were supposed to save us" and Liora's needle trembles—her confidence cracks, then she presses the locket and succeeds. The escalation is accumulative (photograph by photograph) rather than causal, fitting the inferred lens. Agency is renunciation: she opens the door but does not enter, letting the ship dissolve and staying behind. The cost—solitude, the empty locket—is legible on the page. Coincidence does not resolve; her persistence does.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—save the village from eruption—is signaled midway but arrives via prophecy rather than escalating from Elias's prior orchestration of coincidences. The woman's mirror-vision is a reversal, but it is delivered rather than earned through Elias's choices. No on-page cost is visible: he runs, but we do not see what he sacrifices or forecloses. The final beat reads as setup for future action rather than a completed tightening with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—obtaining the governor's letters to enable a revolution—is signaled early. Pressure escalates when the aide leaves a new parchment revealing the governor's timeline. However, Mira faces no meaningful obstacle or trade-off; she retrieves the parchment unopposed, lights the torch without resistance, and departs. The story delivers one tightening (the aide's arrival), but Mira's agency never forecloses a live option with visible cost. The resolution reads as smooth execution rather than earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—mending the sacred patterns and keeping the promise—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure deepens when friction disappears, the star dust swirls, and the eels return with the shard, narrowing options toward the final placement. However, escalation is driven more by puzzle-solving than protagonist agency under competing costs; Elias follows a revealed map rather than making a choice that forecloses a live alternative. The resolution feels destined rather than earned through dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding the cartography of scars—is signaled early but never faces meaningful resistance or cost. Elias arrives to wait and reflect, the photograph obligingly reveals its pattern during a lightning flash, and he departs with an insight that requires no sacrifice or alteration of prior stance. The darkroom timer beeps twice but does not tighten pressure or force a choice; it marks time without consequence. No on-page reversal narrows options or alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—"landing a fatal question"—is signaled early but never tested on the page. The exchange consists of two mirrored rhetorical questions with no consequence, followed by Elias's monologue about the needle card; Isolde's "breath hitched" and final exhale are told reactions, not turns that narrow options. No visible tightening, no price paid, no foreclosed path. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen through pattern or image; here it remains static until the declared endpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Lumen's desire to join the blooming resistance and stabilize identity—is signaled early and coherent. The key's use and the library's unlocking provide one meaningful tightening, but the escalation lacks a second pressure point or complication. Elias's appearance offers affirmation rather than a trade-off or friction that tests Lumen's commitment. The resistance and rebuilding remain abstract claims ("the resistance had begun") without on-page cost or tactical constraint that narrows options under the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: Elias will use music to "surprise fate" and take refuge from grief. The stake is signaled early and pressure accumulates as twilight approaches, travelers gather, and he waits "until the horizon invites night." One meaningful tightening: the moment he lifts his hands, lets the final note hang, then launches into the wild, discordant piece—a deliberate act that narrows options (no return to safe nocturnes). The resolution is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens (he chooses the unplanned encore), and the cost is legible (arbor trembles, ocean revealed, compasses still, clock ticks). However, the travelers apply no direct opposition; they witness rather than complicate. The film-reel "loophole" and the idea of summoning a storm remain abstract rather than tested tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—protecting cultural memory before the monsoon—is signaled early. The seed planting provides one on-page reversal (revelation of the bargain), narrowing Liora's understanding. Yet escalation lacks agency-driven pressure: Nani hands her the seed, the dream arrives passively, and the sprout unfolds on its own. The final decision to "tell them… enough to prepare" avoids concrete cost; no live option is foreclosed, no relationship strained, no resource spent. Pressure coheres under a causal lens but does not tighten into a trade-off with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—finding "the color of unspoken apologies" and diffusing regret—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the compass's guidance and the lace's instructions, leading to the micro-turn when Elias understands the color as "cerulean regret." The final act (weaving the lace thread into the bonsai) narrows options with a visible cost: he relinquishes the desire to undo the past. However, the stakes remain largely internal and symbolic; no external opposition tests his resolve, and the escalation reads more as gradual realization than a choice that forecloses a live alternative under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.3)
    Conflict escalates through protagonist agency in the duel of wits, from initial tension to revelation of the cipher; stakes are personal and intellectual with legible cost in Isolde's surrender and the new journey.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (joining the resistance through rebuilding) escalates via Lumen's agency—unlocking, sorting, handing Elias a book—and costs his old identity; the tightening is legible and irreversible under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.2)
    Escalation is driven by Elias's agency from hesitation to playing the encore, tightening stakes through traveler arrivals and nightfall; the cost is legible in the clock's restart, foreclosing his grief-stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clear and escalate via the monsoon's deadline; Liora's agency drives the tightening, and the cost of the revealed bargain is felt, though the escalation relies slightly on a convenient dream beat.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant internal stake (resolving regret) escalates through accumulative deepening as Elias interacts with the compass and lace. Agency drives the climax—he chooses to diffuse rather than undo—with visible cost in relinquishment.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—how Elara will orient her work and attention after the flood—is clear but very low-intensity, mostly unfolding as contemplation rather than pressured choice. There is some deepening as she moves from noticing dust to treating it as a “map” and a new research path, culminating in her decision to stay and watch despite the looming storm. However, there’s little escalation or narrowing of options; no concrete alternative path is vividly alive and then foreclosed on the page. The result is more a beautifully textured meditation than a pressured conflict arc.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—uncovering what truly motivated the fire and what threat remains—is clear and tightening as Liora moves from suspicion to direct confrontation. The main escalation beat is Jaren’s admission that the entire canyon was targeted, which reweights everything prior. However, opposition on the page is relatively soft; Jaren yields quickly and the danger remains mostly off-stage and future-leaning. The result is tense and effective but not maximally pressurized for this word count.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can transform his imposed silence into a new kind of music—is clear and emotionally meaningful. However, conflict and escalation are gentle: he studies, experiments, then the big attempt simply works, with no visible risk of failure beyond his internal fear. There’s little external or interpersonal pressure, and no genuine reversal or complication once the device is introduced. The final success, while thematically satisfying, feels low-friction and somewhat inevitable from the moment Liora reveals the heat-mapping tool.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether he will answer the ancient distress signal and restore a light that grants the drowned rest—is clear and thematically weighty. There is a single meaningful tightening when he discovers the logbook and multiple broken lenses, recontextualizing his task as part of a long-failed duty. However, there is almost no active opposition: the sea parts, the doors open, the ritual succeeds without resistance, and he pays no visible price beyond emotional heaviness. The result is a beautifully textured progression with modest on-page tension rather than a robust escalation of conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stakes—material survival and preservation of communal memory under sanctions—are clear and humane, and Liora’s decision to begin sustained food runs is a meaningful commitment. However, pressure and cost escalate only in summary (“patrols doubled”), with no scene-level complication or concrete near-miss to test that commitment. As a result, the conflict remains relatively low-tension and internal, more about gentle persistence than true narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—what to do with her unused love and this inherited compassion—tightens when the desperate father appears, forcing her to act rather than contemplate. The beat where she chooses to give away Kwan Yin’s tear and instructs him to “Breathe” is a clear escalation tying internal and external stakes. However, the healing unfolds very smoothly, with no real resistance, doubt, or potential failure in the moment, so the price of her choice feels low. As a result, tension is present but never truly sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—repairing/time-rewriting around lost family and dissolving memories—is clear early via the fading photographs and tightens effectively when Elara steps into the street and sees her mother with the child. The escalation is coherent: a quiet metaphysical problem becomes an immediate, embodied crisis when she must choose whether to intervene in a trapped event. However, the peak choice (pressing the fragment to her mother’s chest) comes fast, with limited sense of competing options or moral calculus; the cost is felt but the pressure could be sharpened by more visible dilemma. Conflict between desire to fix and fear of erasure remains somewhat under-exploited in the climactic beat.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clear and aligned—reach the vault before rivals as the regime collapses—and the tremors provide a ticking backdrop. The key-decoding, traversal, and scavenger confrontation form a logical escalation path, but each conflict resolves with minimal friction, especially the machete man who yields after a single line. Internal stakes (Mira’s shift from mere survival to active participation in “spreading seeds”) are present but underplayed in pivotal beats. The result is solid, coherent tension that could be sharpened by at least one moment where success feels genuinely in doubt or costs them something tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can meaningfully “capture” the sound of trust breaking before he dies—is signaled early and held. Pressure deepens as he unearths the notes and confronts his wife’s lie, leading to the choice to use himself as the source of the imprint. However, escalation is relatively gentle; there’s little sense of a narrowing path or a live alternative that he might refuse, and no real on-page reversal. The resolution feels earned but low-voltage, more elegiac than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Lira continues as a solitary “thief of light” or steps into a co-created destiny—is clear but gently pressured. Escalation hinges on the approaching train departure, the jar’s intensifying glow, and Kael’s alternative proposition to “make our own track.” The key decision not to board is protagonist-driven and credible, yet the felt price of missing the train and abandoning her initial plan remains abstract and idealized. As a result, tension is present but never bites as hard as the imagery promises.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias remains frozen in avoidance or risks engaging with creation again—is legible from early on. Pressure deepens when he abandons the journal, turns to the panel, and realizes the metaphor of calibration and pressure in relation to himself. However, escalation is relatively gentle; there is no moment where a real alternative path (staying inert, walking away) is dramatized under acute tension, so the final switch-flip feels meaningful but low-cost. The conflict stays mostly interior and reflective, with minimal sense of what he tangibly risks losing or breaking by choosing action.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the truth of her origins and deciding whom to trust—is clear and coherently pressured by the caretaker’s appearance and the physical search. Escalation is driven by her agency: confronting him with the shell, exploiting his reaction, prying up the floorboard, and opening the box. Internal and external conflicts braid effectively as she must choose between recoil and engagement with her betrayer/protector. The cost at the end (accepting a relationship built on a lie) is present but could be shaded with a slightly keener sense of what she gives up.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake is internal and metaphysical—whether she can transform unknowable silence into a comprehensible “map” without destroying herself or the world’s mystery. Escalation occurs through the progressive dimming of the last star and her deepening engagement with the booklet and silence, culminating in the choice to complete the map and relinquish speech. The pressure is coherent but very gentle; resistance or risk (what might be lost or broken by success) is implied more than dramatized. As a result, the ending is satisfying but not as taut or costly as it could be for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding the source of his thoughts—is clearly signaled and the violin/loop device deepens that quest in the middle. However, the conflict remains largely internal and contemplative; there’s little sense that failure to understand will cost him anything tangible beyond continued unease. The loop sequences do escalate in intensity (crack of breaking glass, disturbing reflection), but they don’t meaningfully narrow his options so much as enrich his impressions. The final choice is to continue the pursuit under the same external constraints, which reads as a quiet, credible stance crystallization but with low on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central conflict—whether these two can trust each other enough to drop their defensive secrecy—is clear and sustained. Pressure escalates modestly from a procedural breach (missing lens) to a moral/emotional breach (systematic eavesdropping) to a mutual admission of fear and weariness. The narrative earns one meaningful tightening when Elias spreads the tickets and admits “I’ve been eavesdropping,” forcing Mira to reinterpret him and herself. Still, the stakes remain small-scale and largely interior; there’s little sense of a real alternative path being chosen against with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether the garden sees and “knows” him, and whether he can mend his self-deception about that—remains coherent and gently tightens as the garden begins to respond to his marble placements. The key escalation is the unsolicited marble with the map, which forces a new level of engagement and culminates in the seedling decision. However, pressure never feels truly acute; the garden’s “judgment” and any risk or consequence of failure stay relatively abstract. The ending’s renunciation has cost, but the conflict could bear a slightly sharper test of his need for control to reach a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.4)
    The core stake—proving her sideways-time theory versus the safety and stability of the station—is established, and her decision to override the AI provides a real beat of agency. Pressure escalates when she engages the nexus, the lever appears, and the station shudders into temporal disturbance. However, the risks feel abstract: the alarms and AI protests never force a specific trade-off or sacrifice on the page, and no alternative path is seriously entertained. As a result, tension exists but never quite tightens into a genuinely costly dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Lena will successfully decode and give voice to the lost symphony—is clear early and escalates as the water responds, the in-between appears, and Elias manifests. Pressure tightens primarily through revelation and eerie transformation rather than concrete danger, so the conflict feels more spiritual/artistic than life-or-death. Her crucial act—choosing to play—is a genuine commitment but not framed against a sharply drawn alternative or risk. The resolution is satisfying but somewhat gentle, with limited on-page sense of cost or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s need to re-evaluate his culpability and the weight of his mistake—is signaled early and sharpened by the mysterious, impossible flower. Escalation is modest but real: unease at the illustration leads to research, then physical descent and literal unearthing of buried evidence, culminating in a reweighted understanding of blame. The cost is primarily internal and conceptual, with little resistance in the external world, keeping tension more contemplative than gripping. One more concrete obstacle or genuine doubt at the clearing could have intensified pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake is essentially epistemic and emotional—whether Elias will confront and reframe what’s happening—rather than survival, which is fine but underpressured. Tension builds with the clanking, the tunnel, and the faceless figure, yet Elias rarely feels genuinely imperiled or cornered; he simply watches and then cooperates. The key move (offering the wheel) resolves the situation smoothly without a demanding trade-off or clear loss. Conflict thus reads more as eerie encounter than as a crucible that truly tests or scars him.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she will maintain her stance as detached witness in the face of an anomalous, living book—is present but kept abstract. The discovery of the book is the single clear tightening, and taking it to the river is a decision, yet the pressure on that choice is understated and largely unopposed. There’s little sense of viable alternative paths or real loss if she chose differently. Conflict thus reads as more philosophical mood than live tension, limiting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are almost entirely emotional and remain gentle: the cost of not understanding the curl’s origin and the desire for connection/belonging. The story offers very little resistance—once he takes the curl to the creek, Liora appears and accepts him immediately; there is no genuine risk of rejection, loss, or moral tension. The eclipse scene is celebratory rather than pressurized, so escalation registers as more breadth of wonder than tightening of stakes. As a result, the resolution is pleasant but feels lightly earned, with no real trade-off or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s search for meaning in a dreamless, tilted world—remains a bit abstract but is consistently present. Pressure escalates moderately: her curiosity is sharpened by the diaries’ warnings (“The walls remember…”, “axis is slipping”) and culminates in the revelation that the tapestry is a door and the axis has always pointed elsewhere. However, there is little sense of what she stands to lose or sacrifice by reaching out, so the choice reads as intriguing more than perilous. As a result, conflict is resonant but relatively low-intensity, fitting a lyric mood but limiting stakes potency.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—what Linus has really done and what Elias will do with that inheritance—is intriguing but remains more intellectual than visceral on the page. The mystery escalates (from logbook clue to microdot to photo with a false retirement date), and the woman’s arrival adds external pressure, yet she never credibly threatens or forces a hard trade-off. Elias’s final “Then let’s play it” is a stance shift, but the immediate risk (to his safety, loyalty, or moral code) is only softly suggested. As a result, tension is steady and engaging but does not quite crest into a sharp, felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.9)
    The central pressure—fear of being possessed versus the drive to understand—is clearly signaled and does tighten as the ritual progresses and the anchor physically reacts. The escalation is primarily internal and textural, with the added heartbeat and the anchor’s groan marking a real cadence shift. However, the stakes remain abstract: what possession entails or what Elias concretely risks losing never comes into sharp focus. As a result, the final “invitation” feels intriguing but not sharply priced in terms of irreversible consequence or foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is internal—whether she can crack the “mirror” of a fixed-feeling future by reclaiming her own memories. Pressure does deepen as she moves from passive recollection toward pressing the shell to her ear and confronting the charged silence. However, escalation is gentle; there’s no clear narrowing of options or decisive trade-off beyond continuing to stand in this liminal dawn space. The final shimmer reads as earned but low-intensity, with the cost of staying in this unresolved state only lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will try to “conquer” his fragmented selves or accept one—emerges clearly once the labyrinth appears. Escalation comes with the vision of multiple versions (dead, regretful, monstrous) and crystallizes at the door where he is told, “You can’t conquer the labyrinth… you can choose which version of yourself gets to walk out.” Still, the external pressure is fairly static; there’s little on-page resistance besides the older self’s exposition, so the climax relies mainly on conceptual conflict rather than rising situational tension. The cost (relinquishing other possibilities and power) is implied but could be sharpened by a clearer loss.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—Mira’s battle with her emotional numbness—is clear from early on and coheres through the scene. Escalation is primarily internal and textural: from frustration and skepticism to a visceral experience of hush that forces her to face the emptiness she’s avoided. The key tightening is her decision not to flinch from the quiet but to accept it, reconfiguring numbness into something playable. The price is understated but present: she abandons distraction-as-coping and steps into a more painful awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.5)
    The central conflict—Elias’s pull between safety/solitude and the risk of probing the sealed eastern quarter—is clear but remains low-pressure on the page. The main tightening comes when he discerns the mechanical rhythm under city sounds, reframing the quarantine as concealment rather than mere containment. However, stakes never escalate beyond implication; there’s no concrete on-page threat, consequence, or specific fear to sharpen his dilemma. The final choice to move toward action is thematically potent but doesn’t feel hard-won under escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will confront or continue avoiding the painful scent-memory—is legible and tracks through the scene. Pressure tightens with the woman’s appearance and his confession about his father, culminating in the decision to keep the vial and accept grief as something carried. The conflict remains mostly interior and could support one more concrete, resisting beat before the shift, which currently lands gently. Still, the emotional cost of choosing endurance over escape is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Lirien risks pulling the rope and potentially “unraveling time”—is signaled clearly and tightened effectively as she recognizes the rope as a key. Internal stakes (fear vs surrender) align with the external, and escalation is coherent up to the moment she grips the rope and the grotto erupts in light. What’s missing is a felt price: after an impressive flare of danger, the story restores equilibrium without evident loss or irreversible cost, so the risk reads more atmospheric than consequential. The conflict functions and resolves but never quite bites as hard as its own rhetoric promises.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—can she coax a response and find beauty within this ruined, hushed world—is present but remains low-intensity. There is one meaningful tightening: when the hum answers, she changes tactics (using the bowl, then improvising in duet), but she is never truly at risk of losing something if nothing answers back. Without any concrete price, opposition, or real doubt, the tension stays atmospheric rather than pressurized. The result feels lovely and cohesive but not yet like a conflict that tests her values under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.4)
    The central pressure—Liora’s need to maintain professional detachment while performing an intimate, falsified grief for Darian—is clear but never truly tightens beyond the initial act of placing the petal. There is little escalation: once the petal is applied, the scene moves smoothly to resolution without a sharper test or a meaningful narrowing of options. The “same time next week” beat hints at a moral/emotional cost but doesn’t feel like a hard trade-off forced by new pressure. Competent tension, but relatively static for elite-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.3)
    The stakes are primarily emotional and ethical—whether unseen contributors are acknowledged and supported—and they remain quite low-key. The main tensions (to open or not, to deliver or not, how Mara will react) are resolved smoothly without genuine jeopardy or sacrifice. The proposal of the fund arrives quickly and is accepted without resistance, so escalation is more linear completion than sharpened pressure. As a result, the piece feels thematically warm rather than dramatically tight.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.7)
    The dominant stake—Liora’s desire to belong—is clearly signaled early and tightened through the decision to join the travelers and risk exposing that desire. The shared search and the possibility the tag “only appears when you’re ready to see it” create a concrete test of that inner stake. Escalation is modest but coherent: from solitary intention to communal search to an irreversible offering and public recognition. The cost—surrendering the sculpture and her old role as observer-only—is felt but could be made slightly sharper in terms of what she fears losing.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—reaching the place where echoes are born via borrowed time—is clear, and the descent plus intensifying sensations provide a basic escalation. However, Liora encounters little concrete resistance: the whispers, cold, and burning pendant create atmosphere more than genuine obstacles or dilemmas. Her main “choice” (taking the downward spiral) is underdeveloped in terms of what she risks or forecloses, and the final turn of the hourglass lacks a clearly felt price. The result is a nicely tense progression that stops short of real pressure or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—reframing his sister’s disappearance and his relationship to her absence—is clear from early on and intensifies as the ritual proceeds. The meaningful tightening is the moment the orchard “answers,” forcing him to confront presence-in-absence rather than an answer or reunion. The cost is subtle but legible: he accepts that he will not get closure in the conventional sense and must live with the open door. However, conflict remains primarily internal and contemplative, with no serious sense that his attempt could go wrong or leave him worse off, which limits escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central conflict—remain invisible versus risk exposure and connection—emerges clearly and tightens as he races to cache the tape and Mara enters with a flashlight. The outage and approaching footsteps are solid external pressures that converge effectively in the rare manuscripts room. However, escalation plateaus at the moment of maximum tension: Elias’s agency stalls at “crouch and hide” rather than triggering a committed choice with visible cost. The stakes feel real but are not fully cashed out in action at the close.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—whether Mara will cling to control or accept a non-human agency she doesn’t command—is present early and deepens as the sapling’s metamorphosis intensifies. The key tightening comes with physical contact and the branches turning toward her, which forces a choice in how she responds. Escalation is more internal than external; there is no overt danger or heavy cost beyond psychic risk, which keeps tension at a quiet but sustained level. The resolution through endurance/surrender is earned, if not searingly fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—what he will do with the burden of this memory/story—is present but remains fairly abstract. There is clear escalation (intrusive dreams → compulsion to follow rain → uncanny cave → personified pressure from the woman), yet his internal struggle at the peak is brief, with limited sense of what he risks by going with her. The exchange premise suggests a cost, but that cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page. As a result, tension is intriguing and atmospheric rather than fully gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.0)
    The main stake—what happens when magic is “magnified” and made visible—is legible and escalates from curiosity to existential threat as the shadows gain teeth and devour the pilgrim. The cost is concrete (a life lost, the cave altered, Elias now watched), and the tonal shift from harmony to discord underscores it. However, key reversals (using the pearl, the crack, the surge of shadows) are driven almost entirely by the pilgrim, leaving Elias’s agency minor; he lunges too late and makes no true trade-off. This limits how sharply the conflict can crystallize around his decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the truth behind the exile and erasure—is clear, but on-page pressure is relatively gentle. The main “obstacle,” a guard who owes Dain a favor, collapses conflict instead of sharpening it, and there’s no real reversal or cost in acquiring the third valve. Knowledge does deepen (realizing erasure, seeing the map), but the escalation is intellectual rather than experiential, which keeps tension low. As a result, the ending reads more like the start of a dangerous mission than a pressured culmination within this scene.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.8)
    There is a clear through-line of pressure—follow the strange pattern or walk away—but the tension remains largely abstract and curiosity-driven. The stakes (“fortress of unspoken truths”) are conceptually rich yet not grounded in what Elias stands to lose, so the choice to descend and then to accept the conductor’s hand doesn’t feel sharply costly. Escalation happens via setting deepening (street → courtyard → tunnel → archive → conductor) rather than escalating conflict. Because fear, doubt, or competing obligations never seriously test him, the final “yes” feels too easy.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.2)
    The primary conflict is internal—whether to cling to skepticism or open himself to the tower’s unsettling offer of shared memory. Pressure escalates from abstract doubt to embodied, intrusive visions, then to the ethical question of what to do with them, culminating in his choice to write and implicitly to return. Stakes are mostly moral and existential (how he will orient himself to memory and kindness) and remain somewhat gentle; no option feels truly dangerous on the page. The single tightening turn is effective but low-intensity, so the sense of cost, while present, is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—whether Veyra will risk triggering the amulet to pursue her existential question under external threat—is coherent and present early. Escalation from subtle field shifts to Kael’s materialization to the physical lunge and reality-warp serves as a clear tightening. Yet the actual sacrifice is under-specified: we don’t fully know what she risks in dimensional terms, and Kael’s removal feels more like an incidental byproduct than a consciously weighed price. The internal vs external stakes brush against each other but never quite fuse into a sharp, costly decision.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.0)
    The core conflict—who controls the ink pot and for what purpose—is clear, with the woman’s brother’s imprisonment supplying concrete external stakes. Pressure escalates in a straightforward way with her entrance and demand, and Elias’s final conditional offer meaningfully alters their relationship and the pot’s fate. However, the tension remains largely intellectual; we rarely feel immediate danger or loss beyond reported harms offstage. The final choice forecloses easy surrender but doesn’t yet force a painful tradeoff or visible sacrifice in the moment, limiting the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—whether he can meaningfully connect with or “refract” the town’s lost time and lives—is clear but stays largely internal and abstract. There is some escalation: the mysterious written page, the intensifying hum, and the suggestion of a train whistle all nudge his sense of being linked to other histories. However, pressure never sharpens into a real dilemma or trade-off; no live option is clearly foreclosed, and the peace he reaches doesn’t require a visible sacrifice. The conflict functions for a quiet, lyric piece but lacks the bite or concreteness that would make the stakes truly compelling at a top-market level.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s need to locate himself amid erased histories—is clear, and the woman plus the harbor environment provide gentle external pressure. However, escalation is mostly conceptual; his tactics don’t significantly change, and there’s no sharp narrowing of options beyond the quiet shift at the end. The decision not to run from the tide and to accept layered truths is a valid Earned Stasis moment, but the on-page price feels mild. Overall tension is steady rather than tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is Elias’s worldview and, secondarily, the fading of history’s “echoes.” The pressure increases conceptually—from skepticism to the realization that “the pages are closing”—but Elias never faces a hard, on-page trade-off; his choice to keep searching is low-friction. The Compass offering “choices” is thematically strong yet not dramatized as a specific dilemma he must solve now. As a result, tension exists but feels gentle rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preventing the investors from taking the raft’s “heart” and privatizing Carnivale—is clear and signaled early. Escalation exists but is modest: Lan goes from perception to subtle obstruction, yet her operations never force a genuinely costly trade-off, and external pushback is largely absent. The privatization vote and the threat to Vey remain conceptual; we don’t see a turn where a strategy fails or risk spikes in-scene. The ending reweights stakes internally (belief in chosen survival) rather than through a sharpened external consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.5)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal: the tension between bureaucratic task and personal reverence, between the inevitability of destruction and the desire to witness. The external stake—the last undisturbed crater before bulldozers—never faces real-time opposition or complication; the mission proceeds smoothly. The primary tightening is emotional: building from observation into the weight of taking the “first photograph” and then recognizing its finality. As a result, escalation is modest and the sense of cost, while present, is quiet rather than sharply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—decoding the feedback and “sending it home” before the ship leaves—is signaled clearly, and the ticking ship departure provides light pressure. Yet escalation is gentle: there’s little sense of what is truly at risk beyond abstract understanding, and no serious doubt that the drone will function. The key choice (to trust his interpretation and release the drone now) is thematically apt but not sharply contested by fear, alternative options, or visible sacrifice. As a result, tension remains relatively low and never quite tightens into a testing turn.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—Mira’s drive to locate the rivers’ true beginning (and deeper “convergence”)—is clear, with internal and external stakes braided. Escalation comes from the interpretive turn when the keeper says, “Or where the ice remembers,” which reconfigures the riddle and prompts her decisive request to go onto the lake. However, conflict remains mostly conceptual and atmospheric, with minimal concrete resistance or on-page price paid. The pressure tightens once but never becomes truly acute.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—coaxing the town back into resonance—is legible, and there is a gentle sense of escalation as the soundscape thickens from single clicks to a full phantom market. However, antagonistic pressure is mostly notional; the danger that “ghosts, like bells, could shatter if struck too hard” never materializes as a tested risk or hard choice. The tuner’s tactics never have to adapt to a setback or reversal, and options are not meaningfully narrowed—he simply persists until it works. This keeps the piece meditative rather than truly tense, limiting conflict intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.8)
    The core stakes—rescue vs. self-preservation vs. being subsumed by the hush—are clear and escalate logically as oxygen runs down and Lira reaches the central chamber. The main tightening is her choice to risk her last emotional tether (the vial) to free both the diver and herself, foreclosing the path of keeping that private comfort. However, the external danger feels abstractly intense rather than viscerally constricting, and the hush never quite pushes back once she acts, softening the sense of price at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—Elias confronting the hush that has swallowed lives and his father’s truth—is signaled early and tightened through the ledger discovery and the progressive incursions of soundless threat (floorboard, tearing fabric, hovering shape). Pressure grows coherently toward the beat where hush “coils around his throat,” forcing a clear, high-stakes choice: remain silent or assert selfhood. His choice to speak his own name provides a satisfying escalation-to-resolution arc with visible costs (lattice shattering, beam reactivating, him forced into flight). However, the hinted broader stakes (guards, bodies, towns swallowed by silence) stay mostly abstract and are not fully stress-tested on page.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Liora will continue to flee her guilt or finally endure the full weight of remembering—is clear and emotionally legible. Pressure escalates meaningfully when the ghost bride appears and then when the bead warms and triggers the bloody memory, narrowing Liora’s options to a kind of forced reckoning. The conflict is almost entirely internal, but the ghost’s presence and the bead’s growing heat externalize that pressure effectively. The cost is contained but real: she gains no absolution, only the inescapable burden of lucid remorse.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Liora can transform ruin into reverence rather than remain a passive wanderer of wreckage—is clear but low-temperature. Pressure modestly escalates with the uncanny footprints and the needle’s whispered rebuke, then tightens at the loom where she must commit to sewing with memory. Still, opposition is mostly atmospheric, and there’s little sense that saying no or failing to reimagine would exact a specific loss beyond remaining in vague stasis. The result is a beautiful but relatively gentle arc of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—recovering and reanimating a buried faith—is clear from the outset, and there is one solid escalation when the excavations culminate in the central chamber and the pedestal that matches his relic. However, opposition is mostly environmental fatigue (blisters, aching back) rather than meaningful risk, and there’s minimal sense that he might fail, be harmed, or be wrong. His agency drives the turn (choosing to place the sundial), but the price feels modest and the path lightly contested. As a result, tension remains more contemplative than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering who is reaching out and, beneath that, what it means for Elias’s identity—is clear and consistent. Pressure does increase modestly as he decodes the message and realizes the significance of the “golden light,” leading into the appearance of his mother. However, conflict remains largely internal and contemplative; Elias isn’t forced into a difficult trade-off or visible loss, and the reunion arrives without resistance or complication. The result is emotionally engaging but relatively low in escalated tension and concrete cost.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.2)
    Conflict here is primarily intellectual and social rather than physical: Liora versus an unseen power that moves the stars and prepares a coup. The stakes are labeled as enormous (a coming coup, world-scale conspiracy), but the on-page pressure on Liora is relatively gentle—her plan faces no significant resistance, and each step (decoding, traveling, recruiting) works on the first try. There is one clear tightening—the discovery of the equinox date—but little subsequent escalation or visible price for acting. The absence of a tangible counterforce in scene keeps the tension more atmospheric than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central stake—whether Liora will confront the fear underpinning her unsent apology—is clear early and coherently intensified. Escalation runs through the spirits’ increasingly pointed interventions (condensation spelling “too late”/“stay,” then “Try”), the shard’s proof of power, and the apparition forcing her to articulate her incapacity (“I didn’t know how”). The decisive tightening is her choice to speak “I was afraid” aloud, reframing the unsent apology from static guilt to an active first step. The conflict is largely internal and quiet, but the pressure and price are still palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is internal—what Lena does with her fear and injury “after the storm”—with the boy’s presence externalizing the cost of that choice. Pressure does increase (from solitary reflection to the eerie mirroring of casts and coral, then the glowing “Home”), and the decision to reach out and align their messages is a meaningful tightening. However, conflict remains relatively low-friction: there’s little sense of competing options or real risk in choosing connection, and the anesthetic softens urgency rather than sharpening it. The result is emotionally engaging but not sharply escalated.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Liora can “give back” or recover joy from a ruined past—is clear, but the pressure on it is soft and meditative rather than sharply escalating. The main deepening beat is the development surprise, where the child now holds the apple, which reconfigures what’s at stake emotionally. However, there are few genuine constraints or hard trade-offs; waiting for the right light and then choosing to return are relatively unopposed. The ending is satisfying but not hard-won, so tension feels modest rather than tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s relationship to the mural as stable object vs. living door—emerges clearly and tightens through the four “awakenings.” Each interaction (cleaning lips, noticing the dishes, picking up and pressing the nickel) meaningfully escalates the situation, narrowing his ability to treat the fresco as mere work. The final question from the trumpet coils around him, but his stance in response remains poised rather than decisively chosen, so the price is conceptual rather than dramatized as a hard trade-off. The escalation is coherent and satisfying, though a slightly clearer articulation of what he stands to lose by “stepping through” would sharpen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will risk turning his greenhouse into a node of rebellion under a surveillance regime—is clear and present early. Pressure tightens through the inspector’s entrance and the implicit danger of being caught with the gourd and the plan, leading to Elias’s decision to commit. However, after the inspection, resistance feels relatively smooth; we jump to “the warping had begun” without a second on-page test or visible price paid. Escalation is solid for this length but could benefit from one additional concrete complication or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can break his paralyzing silence and turn grief into sustaining art—is clear and present early. Pressure tightens through his long insomnia, the unsettling projection of his own face, and the almost-recognized melody that finally tips him into writing. The major “turn” is him beginning to write and sustaining that choice through three pages, with visible emotional cost. The conflict remains primarily internal and gently escalated; an additional on-page test or complication to that decision could heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether forgotten names and feelings can be meaningfully preserved—is clear, but it remains mostly conceptual rather than felt as urgent threat. Pressure deepens modestly via Liora’s repeated failure with the tube and the eventual half-success of a single note. The key turn is her decision to try the tube differently when the light reveals its “mouth,” which yields the responsive orchid chime and internal shift. Still, there’s little explicit narrowing of options or visible price paid beyond long-term, implied melancholy.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—risking an unknown but serious cost to restore a dangerous form of truthful speech—is clearly articulated and escalates as the language responds, the voice appears, and the ink well fractures. Pressure tightens at the “Will you listen, or will you turn away?” beat, forcing a binary choice that narrows her options. However, the consequences of saying yes remain abstract; we’re told it’s costly and fearsome, but no concrete loss or irreversible mark is shown yet. The tension is real but remains more intellectual and atmospheric than viscerally testing her limits.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—how to manage the volcano’s power without betraying its history—is clear, and the uneven “breath” of the mountain gives a gentle external pressure. Escalation occurs through knowledge: the discovery and decoding of the envelope tighten her internal conflict and force a stance. However, tension stays relatively low-key; the valley’s danger and the consequences of failure are mostly implied rather than viscerally felt on the page. The resolution is internally earned but could benefit from one more concrete sign of risk or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.4)
    The core stake—whether Elias continues to flee his past or re-engages with the lost songs—is clearly signaled and coherently developed. Pressure escalates via new information: the coded ledger, the lyric sheet, and the revelation of a predecessor’s pursuit tighten the sense that his work isn’t over and that others share his obsession. However, opposition is almost entirely internal and somewhat underplayed; his resistance to Lena’s offer never feels truly dangerous or likely to prevail. As a result, the final choice, while earned, reads more as a gentle slide into inevitability than a hard-fought trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will continue to pursue Mira across thresholds or accept the distance between them—is clear but stays largely internal and contemplative. Pressure accumulates gently rather than sharply; there’s minimal escalation beyond deepening reflection and the momentary prism “vision.” His final choice to turn away and accept her departure is meaningful but comes without a strong preceding pinch or concrete test of his resolve. As a result, tension feels more atmospheric than truly tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s longing for belonging versus the time-bound need to escape before the facility seals—is clear and converges at the end. Escalation is present but mild: discoveries come with little friction, and the alarms/closing passage arrive very late, granting only a brief moment of real dilemma. Elias’s hesitation is compelling but too quickly resolved to fully register as a hard, pressured trade-off. The conflict remains more contemplative than sharply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Liora can recover missing paths or must accept their disappearance—is clear, and pressure does intensify as she moves from luminous chamber into darker tunnel, with the glass turning unsettling red. The key tightening is her hesitation at the tunnel and the new, raw emotion that challenges her prior belief. However, the conflict stays largely contemplative; options never feel sharply foreclosed, and the cost of either advancing or retreating is more implied than dramatized. The ending renunciation is persuasive but lands as a gentle pivot rather than a hard-won trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—breaking out of numbing repetition to create something genuinely alive—appears early and does guide her choices, particularly discarding the bishop and inviting the violinist. Escalation is gentle rather than sharp: the main tightening is her shift from solitary routine to risky improvisation with another person. The cost (loss of the bishop as talisman, stepping into untested performance) is present but underplayed, so tension never truly bites. This works for a quiet lyric piece, but for elite venues the pressure feels a bit too soft.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—defying the nostalgia ban and risking brutal punishment—is clear and concrete, with the skinned poet anecdote providing sharp external pressure. Conflict escalates once the tattooist arrives and asks Liora to become complicit, culminating in her decision to act and accept criminal status. However, the internal and interpersonal struggle is relatively smooth; her hesitation is brief, and the choice feels emotionally right but not rigorously tested on the page. The final cost is mostly projected into the future rather than partially paid in-scene, which keeps the tension solid but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake is largely existential—whether Elias will engage with and reinterpret the “reckoning” and his relationship to light. Pressure increases only mildly when the old woman frames his gift as necessary, but there is no concrete negative consequence for refusal, and his compliance is near-frictionless. The promised “reckoning” does not manifest in a way that forces a difficult choice. As a result, conflict feels low-grade and escalation soft, despite a nice conceptual turn.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how trauma can be articulated after a supernatural bargain—remains mostly internal and low-pressure. There is a mild tightening when the stranger reveals their scar and takes the pen, but there’s little sense of a live alternative (silence, flight, rejection) being seriously at risk. Elias’s agency in choosing to listen and facilitate writing is meaningful but not strongly contested or costly on the page. As a result, the conflict feels truthful yet somewhat static, more contemplative than escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake is Elara’s need to prove to herself that hope and her work have meaning, with the gauge and patterns as instruments of that search. Pressure slightly rises with the dream and especially when the needle begins to move, but Elara is never forced into a difficult trade-off or renunciation. The key turn—the realization that the gauge is a bridge—is offered as an almost pure gift, not something wrestled from resistance or danger. As a result, conflict feels soft and escalation modest, limiting the story’s emotional bite.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will inherit and survive his father’s mystery—is clear but never truly pressured into a difficult choice. Escalation is mostly atmospheric (humming walls, shadow, thicker ivy, glowing symbols) rather than driven by Elias’s agency beyond continuing forward. The appearance of the woman and the living map deepens the situation, but he is not yet forced into a trade-off or loss on the page. The result is compelling setup that stops just short of a felt on-page test of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Liora can bring the mirage into fuller being and claim her inherited “grace”—is signaled early and returns at the end. Escalation is primarily internal and textural: the mirage’s pulsing, the impending bells, and her increasingly urgent painting create a gentle tightening. However, options never feel meaningfully narrowed, and there’s little friction or trade-off opposing her desire; the watchman observes but doesn’t pressure. The result is a beautifully rendered but low-intensity conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Liora and Kessar can accept the ongoing cost of peace and “redemption” rather than walking away—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure deepens through Kessar’s probing of her identity post-war and the presentation of the treaty and coin, which force her to confront doubt versus commitment. Escalation is more internal than external; there’s no sharp reversal, but the emotional narrowing from “No. But we have to try” to “Then let’s carry it together” is clear. The cost of that choice is implied (lifelong burden, possible failure) rather than viscerally felt, which keeps this in the strong-but-not-searing band.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether he sustains his manufactured desert vessel or releases the water—is clear and morally fraught in concept. There is one main tightening: arriving at the convergence of cracks and having to choose to open the dams. Yet the on-page pressure is mostly retrospective; by the time we see him, his decision appears already internally settled, so we don’t feel genuine escalation or a tested reversal. The result is thematically weighty but dramatically low-tension for an elite short piece.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Liora can resist conformist pressure and claim a resistant voice—is clearly announced and thematically coherent. There is one meaningful tightening when she confronts the black thread and her own long-held silence, which functions as the closest thing to a test. However, the process is otherwise smooth and unopposed: each thread yields as soon as she recalls an aligned memory, and entering the sanctuary or gathering echoes never truly threatens failure or loss. As a result, escalation feels modest and the on-page price of success remains low.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—how to wield stories ethically against familial and artistic skepticism—is clear but remains mostly at the level of contemplation. Pressure does not meaningfully escalate in-scene; the argument with her brother and the contentious bar audiences are recounted, not dramatized, so her present choice faces little active resistance. The “tightening” is largely tonal (darkness, then returning light) rather than a real narrowing of options. As a result, the resolution feels more like a reaffirmation than a tested stance.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the monarchs will respond to Liora’s signals in this last, fragile migration—is clear, and there is a meaningful tightening when they arrive and then decisively depart. The main escalation is conceptual rather than dramatic: the butterflies’ appearance briefly seems to affirm continuity, only for their non-return to force Liora into a costly acceptance. That said, moment-to-moment pressure is gentle; there are no real reversals beyond the single “they came / they are gone” arc, so tension remains more reflective than gripping. For a quiet, lyric piece at this length, the escalation is sufficient but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will continue to accept forgetting as the default or commit to active remembrance—is clear but lightly pressured. There is some escalation as we move from the foundry’s off-page collapse, to the discovery of the card, to the present ceremony and vow, but each step is largely summarized rather than dramatized under live strain. The cost of his choice (a life spent in painstaking, solitary work against the world’s forgetting) is conceptually present but not concretely felt through loss of an alternative or a visible sacrifice. The piece succeeds as a quiet, accumulative meditation, yet the conflict never truly tightens or risks reversal in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake is epistemic/spiritual—understanding why paths “choose” walkers—and that is signaled and followed through. Escalation is modest: the dream and the woman’s cryptic answers deepen the question but don’t generate true jeopardy or painful trade-offs. The storm and the directive’s decay promise more concrete stakes than are actually dramatized. By the end, Elias’s “now go” beat has the feel of an initiation, but without a visible price or sharply narrowed alternative, the conflict stays contemplative.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Nabu-sharru can secure a non-bloody covenant with cosmic forces before the new regime consolidates—is legible and consistent. The main tightening comes with the tile’s activation and the appearance of the veiled figure, followed by the approaching mercenaries, which narrows his options. However, the external danger remains mostly offstage sound until the very end, so the conflict feels more meditative than pressured, and his internal struggle is resolved with relatively little friction once the figure reframes the covenant. The cost is there but understated, which limits the sense of escalation under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will pursue vengeance or release—is clearly signaled, and the confrontation with Veyra plus the cellular-memory trigger provide a genuine deepening. Pressure escalates when he realizes “You were there,” but after that, the conflict resolves relatively smoothly into mutual admission and partial absolution. There is limited sense of foreclosed options or sacrifice beyond her internal shift; she abandons revenge without facing a concrete, resistant counter-impulse in the moment. The result is emotionally satisfying but a bit too gentle and linear for higher-band tension.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the mirror maker can reach and “capture” the runaway dream without destroying it—is legible and escalates via the appearance of the glass mountain and the thinning air as he climbs. His agency drives the main turn: choosing to follow the fog’s path, then to climb, and finally to hold the dream gently rather than possess it. However, there is little sense of real danger, trade-off, or sacrifice beyond mild exertion, so pressure never quite tightens into a genuinely costly choice. The resolution feels graceful and earned, but somewhat low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—what to do with broken promises and inherited talismans of safety—is clear but remains low-key and mostly internal. There is a gentle tightening when the girl frames the pendant as protection and asks if it will “still keep me safe,” forcing Liora into a morally charged answer. However, escalation is modest; there’s little sense that any real option is foreclosed or that a visible price is paid beyond emotional honesty. The story functions as a contemplative vignette rather than a fully pressurized conflict, which limits this category.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether she will engage with the shell’s mystery and what that does to her understanding of knowledge—is clear but scaled to an internal, reflective register. Escalation occurs as she shifts from years of baffled avoidance to allowing herself to genuinely inquire, culminating in the gallery return where the orchard visibly reacts. However, there is little sense of alternative paths or true risk; no option feels closed off at a cost beyond prior frustration. The conflict remains primarily puzzle-solving plus awe, not a pressured trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stakes—finding the library and possibly Elara’s sister, with the implied danger of getting lost or changed—are clear and escalate modestly as they move deeper. The negotiation scene and the threshold at the carved door are the main tightening points. However, once terms are set, obstacles largely evaporate: the library is found without real resistance and the sister appears unmarred, so no meaningful option is foreclosed. The conflict resolves a little too cleanly for the high stakes implied by the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—recovering Liora / the truth of the chimera twins—is clearly signaled, but pressure stays mostly atmospheric rather than sharply escalating. Moving deeper into the ship and into stranger spaces is a tonal tightening, yet Elias never faces a hard, explicit choice on the page; the “chimera twins were a choice” arrives as concept more than dramatized dilemma. The ending implies a sacrifice (of ordinary life or separate identity) but doesn’t stage his decision moment beyond showing up. As a result, tension is steady and textured but not fully sharpened into a decisive test.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Liora will uncover and then expose a deliberately erased history—is clear and escalates when she realizes Vaelis is not myth but victim of obliteration. The vision of the grand hall and the revelation of systematic erasure is a meaningful deepening that tightens the moral implications. However, there is little on-page resistance or counter-pressure; no concrete threat or competing need tests her resolve beyond a single ominous line (“You were never supposed to find this”). As a result, the final choice feels more like a natural extension of her character than a pressured trade-off with a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—can Ryn secure a lasting refuge of silence from an invasive, warping presence—is clear and escalates from navigation to direct contact with the bloom and a time-sensitive binding attempt under external pressure. Her choice to anchor the bloom to the stone forecloses the possibility of leaving the hush intact in situ and leads directly to its collapse, a tangible cost that sharpens the conflict. The energy beings’ pressure is present but somewhat abstract and could be made more concrete or personally threatening in the moment of binding. Internal tension (duty to maps vs. urge to transform/preserve silence differently) is gestured at but not strongly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—whether Elias can reclaim or revalidate the beacons and thus the meaning he assigns to coincidences—is established and followed through. There is a single clear escalation when the prism reveals the beacon’s flicker, reconfiguring his options and prompting departure. However, opposition is largely absent: no real risk, counterforce, or internal resistance tests his commitment, so tension remains contemplative rather than gripping. The result is conceptually engaging but relatively low-pressure conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara risks mental and existential unraveling to reclaim/reshape the past—is clearly signaled but kept largely internal. Pressure escalates through the progressively stranger monuments, the implied fate of her vanished predecessor, and the growing sense that this place can “unravel a mind,” culminating in her decision to defy the elders and take the fog bridge. However, the threat remains mostly conceptual; we never see a concrete consequence or near-miss that forces a sharper trade-off. The tension is steady and meaningful but not maximally tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—bringing light/meaning into a place of erasure and hopelessness—is clear but remains largely abstract and uncontested. There is a mild escalation when she lights the rag, ignites the torches, and the figures appear, raising the emotional and conceptual stakes. However, she never faces a real alternative tactic, moral cost, or external resistance; the path from goal to outcome is smooth. As a result, tension exists more as atmospheric pressure than as sharpened conflict with foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.6)
    The main pressure is internal: whether to remain in avoidance (grotto, observation) or face the implied life-decision in the conversation above. The cicada experiment offers a satisfying escalation—a tangible, uncanny event that forces a shift in how she reads her situation. Still, stakes remain mostly conceptual and quiet; the emotional and practical consequences of returning upstairs are not fully dramatized, so the sense of risk stays somewhat muted.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central conflict—Liora’s need for space and sky versus paternal prohibition and her own claustrophobic history—is well established, and the decision to step onto the trellis is a clear high-stakes choice in her scale of life. Pressure deepens through the unstable trellis and the ticking clock of gravity righting itself, culminating in the forced separation from the boy and a future-oriented promise. However, the story favors mood over sharp escalation; once she steps onto the trellis, the danger never tightens into a true dilemma, and no option is fully foreclosed beyond the hour’s temporary end. The emotional cost is present but subtle, leaning more on implication than on a felt sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central conflict—whether silence can be made to hold grief instead of amplifying it—is clear and thematically grounded, with Elias and the woman embodying two stances (control vs. surrender). Escalation is modest: the storm glass pulsing/darkening crystallizes the pressure point, and his deliberate halt of the gondola plus the shared listening act as the main tightening and turn. The “price” is largely internal and quiet, a relinquishing of her attempt to force silence into shape, but it’s more implied than viscerally dramatized. As a result, tension is consistently present but never feels acute or truly risky.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—claiming the throne to stabilize a failing world—is signaled early, but on-page tension largely centers on solving a single puzzle and then deciding to sit. Escalation is mild: the peel/mural moment adds some uncertainty about deception, yet no real setback or competing pressure emerges to narrow options sharply. Once the staircase appears, nothing resists her; the test feels more like a confirmation ritual than a serious trial with risk. The final “until sunrise” clock appears too late to retroactively intensify prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether she will reopen herself to others’ suffering—is evident early and tested by the persistent knocking and finally the child’s imminent suffocation. Pressure escalates from abstract dreams to physical, frantic knocking to a single fragile life on the threshold. Her agency in touching the scar and accepting reconnection resolves the conflict. The main weakness is that the moral and emotional cost of reversing years of self-protection is more told than dramatized in the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—live with the consequences of your worst choice or overwrite yourself with a better version—is legible and escalates well from eerie curiosity to a morally loaded decision. Pressure accumulates through the texts and the unfolding porthole, culminating in a clear trade-off between comfort and integrity. The price of refusal (permanently foreclosing the “better life” path) is conceptually strong, though the emotional and concrete downsides of stepping through are only lightly sketched. A bit more visceral wrestling at the hinge would make the stakes feel even sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the truth of the dynasty’s fall—is signaled early and escalates as the handle activates, the bridge hums, and the Council of Erasure is revealed. However, the pressure remains largely one-directional: once the key is recognized, there’s no significant resistance, trade-off, or live alternative path; Elias simply proceeds deeper into revelation. The specter’s warning (“bridges can be burned”) hints at future cost but doesn’t force an on-page decision. The result is compelling but closer to an elegant unveiling than a tightened crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.0)
    The core stake—whether Aldric remains in renunciant stasis or accepts a terrifying new form of agency over reality—is intelligible and culminates in a decisive act (unsnapping the sword belt, accepting the strings). Escalation is present (from eerie curiosity to direct offer to metaphysical transformation), but the pressure does not tighten into a hard dilemma; there’s little sense of what he concretely risks besides a generalized identity loss. The marionette surge at the end feels more like an inevitable engulfing than a crucible shaped by his resistance. As a result, tension is present but not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake is largely emotional: whether Elias can wrest meaning and solace from one boy’s fragmented history. Conflict is gentle and mostly internal; the external path (find landlady, receive postcard) involves almost no resistance or complication. There is some escalation in knowledge—from mysterious button to confirmed cherished object to Daniel’s peace in France—but little sense of risk or real possibility of failure. The ending feels tender rather than hard-won, limiting tension.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—exposing the regime’s revision of history—is clear early and steadily escalates from stealth approach to direct confrontation under threat of arrest or death. The meaningful tightening comes when the system responds with “YOU WERE NEVER HERE” and the enforcers burst in, forcing Lira to choose between self-preservation and pressing ENTER. The external danger and internal resolve align well, though the piece could gain from one additional complicating obstacle or tactical loss before the final rush.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—the city’s potential drowning in noise and the need to preemptively hush the prophecy—is clearly stated and maps onto Elias’s choice to perform. Escalation is primarily internal and atmospheric: mist thickens, faces in the fog, lungs burning, and the pressure of endurance to finish the piece. However, there’s little sense of a live alternative or the possibility of failure; once he begins, the outcome feels assured rather than contested. As a result, the climax reads more like an extended, beautiful cadence than a pressured turn with sharply narrowed options.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Liora can extract meaning/order from the leaves—remains coherent, and there is one clear tightening when the monument crumbles and the silver dust triggers comprehension. However, conflict is almost entirely internal and contemplative; there’s little sense of real risk if she fails, nor of sacrifice when she succeeds. The transformation into a folkloric figure is intriguing but reads more as apotheosis than hard-won resolution. As a result, tension feels muted relative to the ambition of the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake is Elias’s stance toward uncertainty, but on the page the pressure is mild: he mostly follows the compass without serious resistance or competing obligations. The one real tightening is his decision to step into the waterfall despite hesitation, yet that hesitation is brief and more rhetorical than fraught. The frozen city and synchronized figures hint at higher external stakes, but those stakes are not made concrete enough for his action (starting the clock, disrupting the rhythm) to carry a felt price. As a result, escalation registers more as a series of curiosity-led discoveries than as intensifying conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Liora’s need to understand Elias’s disappearance and the meaning of the coin/name—is established, but on-page pressure is modest. The main turn is the discovery of her name on the anvil, which deepens the emotional stakes and propels her into the tunnel, yet there’s little external or internal resistance after that. The closing act (returning the coin) reads as an uncomplicated yes rather than a hard-won trade-off, with minimal sense of what she risks by forgiving or rejoining him. As a result, escalation feels more contemplative than truly testing.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is internal—whether the collector can reclaim authentic laughter and some measure of selfhood—and it is signaled early and paid off via the gift of the laughter-note. Pressure does tighten a bit with the appearance of the woman and the risk-laden intimacy of their conversation. However, conflict remains gentle and largely unopposed; his goal is never seriously threatened, and there’s no meaningful on-page price or credible alternative that he must forgo. The piece reads more as a mood-driven encounter than a test of resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—can Elias find an ethically legible limit to cruelty—is clear, but conflict is mostly internal and relatively under-contested on the page. Once the stranger appears, Elias encounters minimal resistance: his hesitation about the vial is quickly overridden by description of its gentleness, so the key decision lacks palpable risk or competing impulses in the moment. There is one major deepening—the drink that shifts perception and grants knowledge—but no strong reversal or narrowing of options beyond that conceptual turn. The cost of what he learns (or of accepting it) is more implied than felt as an immediate sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Liora can meaningfully engage with the drowned lighthouse’s fragmented history—is clear but largely internal and low-pressure. Escalation is gentle: curiosity → recognition → revelation about the lighthouse and her role → commitment to ongoing search. There’s little genuine opposition or trade-off; no option is dramatically foreclosed, and the cost of “keep searching” is more implied than dramatized. Tension is present but operates at a soft, reflective level rather than through acute conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—containing a metaphysical “wound” so ghosts don’t leak into the present—is clear, and there is a discernible tightening when the lantern flickers and the crack appears. However, opposition is mostly atmospheric rather than actively resisting Mira; she never seriously risks failure beyond a moment of burning pain. The conflict resolves quickly once the mainspring is applied, so escalation feels more like a smooth reveal than a hard test of her limits. Effective but relatively low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—the integrity of a perfect but brittle system versus necessary collapse—is legible and escalates as the rupture spreads and the library physically shudders. Elias’s key acts (uncorking the whisper, then deepening the rupture with the printed page) drive the turns, and the visible price is the destruction of the entire library. However, there’s little real sense of alternatives or resistance; he moves fairly serenely toward dissolution. The conflict thus feels more like an elegant conceptual unfolding than a pressured, contested choice.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stakes—whether this civilization is remembered as data or as a living poetic culture—are signaled clearly and tied to Elias’s dwindling time before Core strips the site. Pressure escalates from simmering dispute to the temporal storm’s peak, forcing his risky mirror ritual as a last-chance gambit. That said, antagonistic pressure from the Core is mostly conceptual and off-page during the climax, and the danger of failure in the ritual is more implied than viscerally felt. The conflict functions and tightens once but doesn’t quite reach a knife-edge of cost or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central tension—remain in safe, self-deceiving repair-work or accept the covenant’s demand and risk inner fracture to restore lost light—is clear and escalates as the chip pulses and the memory overwhelms him. The jolt of seeing his father’s grief-stricken death is the main tightening beat that forces a choice. However, the world-in-the-balance stakes are mostly declared, not felt, and Elias’s shift from terror to resolve happens with limited resistance once the thematic terms are spelled out. Conflict remains primarily internal and is satisfying but not deeply harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stakes are largely conceptual—understanding what happened to the expedition and what the petrichor really signifies—rather than tightly dramatized as danger or moral dilemma. There is one clear tightening when the grandfather rises from the lagoon, but Elias is never forced into a real choice between competing harms or desires. His final action with the vial is more a continuation of his established pattern than an escalated, costly decision. As a result, tension stays atmospheric rather than truly sharpened into conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will join this timewoven alliance to help “keep the world from unraveling”—is clear but only lightly pressured. Once Mara explains the situation, he more or less goes along; there’s no substantial moment of doubt, competing obligation, or costed refusal, so escalation feels more like a guided tour than tightening conflict. The main turn, his decision to carve the bridge, reads as almost inevitable given his skillset rather than a hard-won choice. The world-saving scale sits at a conceptual level without being felt as real risk in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Liora’s need to understand why flowers bloom at night and what that means for her art and self—is clear from early on. Pressure escalates modestly: quiet contemplation turns to a quasi-visionary experience at the cathedral, culminating in a changed relationship to her question as she finishes the mural. There is no real external opposition or strongly felt alternative path, so the “reckoning” is more a deepening than a contested choice. That restraint fits the mode but keeps the stakes from feeling truly sharp or costly.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stakes—unearthing suppressed civil-rights truths versus very real physical danger—are established early and escalate from archival curiosity to life-or-death confrontation. Elara’s choice to go to the lagoon, wade in, and seize the ledgers under threat provides a meaningful tightening of pressure. However, the most dangerous external beat (the armed men) is resolved more by the lagoon’s agency than by Elara’s decisions, softening the sense of price paid through her own calculus. The personal and moral stakes around leaving Miriam trapped are gestured at but could bear more explicit on-page cost at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—reviving Hollow’s End by conceiving a new kind of wish—is compelling in concept but lightly pressured on the page. Opposition is mostly abstract (entropy, failure, the town’s apathy) and summarized rather than dramatized, with “for days, he sat” compressing what might have been testing beats or setbacks. The one tightening comes when he “knows” the bottle holds the last wish, which reframes his mental efforts but doesn’t introduce a new cost or constraint. As a result, escalation feels more like a smooth ramp of contemplation than a sharpened conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake is interpretive—what the foghorn’s silence means and what Elias will do with that knowledge—signaled early and carried through. Pressure escalates gently via the “accidental prophecy,” the pomegranate omen, and the uncanny playback, culminating in Elias’s conceptual shift and renewed sense of purpose. However, the conflict remains almost entirely internal and contemplative, with little sense of risk, opposing force, or trade-off; his closing choice costs him very little on the page. The result is a satisfying but low-tension arc rather than a truly testing crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether she can and should reopen the past via the vortex—is clear, and the attempt with the hatchling constitutes a real tightening and partial reversal. Pressure escalates texturally when the wind howls and the greenhouse vision appears then collapses, narrowing her sense of what’s possible. However, the conflict stays mostly internal and contemplative; there’s no urgent counterforce (time limit, danger to hatchling, personal risk) beyond generalized loss. The ending crystallizes her stance more than it tests it under sharpened consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and when to sound an alarm that can disrupt the village—is clear early and sharpened by her secret rewiring, which forces agency instead of an automatic siren. The story delivers one strong escalation when the storm shifts from "weeping" to catastrophic, turning her philosophy into an immediate risk. Her final choice does carry cost (she has been wrong, undermining her confidence and possibly her standing), but the consequences remain mostly inferred rather than shown in concrete fallout. Tension is steady and clean, though not harrowingly intense.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake is existential and internal: whether Elias’s lifelong tending in obscurity can amount to more than custodial afterthought. Escalation is modest but real—the alarms jolt the piece from meditative description into a singular test of his watchfulness and faith in omens. His agency consists of seizing the moment with the lantern glass and accepting the event as an “offering” rather than a random occurrence. The price of that stance (the aching recognition of his own longing and solitude) is implied but could be made a touch more sharply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—maintaining his vow of silence/solitude versus responding to the ghosts’ pressure—is clear but remains abstract and gently applied. Escalation hinges almost entirely on the arrival of the sharper, more solid beekeeper ghost, with limited layering of earlier tension beyond observation of the other ghosts. Elias’s hesitation at the box is acknowledged but not deeply dramatized as a wrenching trade-off given seventeen years of commitment. The cost is present but muted, keeping conflict from fully tightening into a high-stakes beat.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—recovering/framing lost time and understanding its new texture—is clear but remains quite abstract, with little sense of real risk if Elias fails. Pressure does accumulate via increasingly uncanny artifacts and the dream revelation, but there’s no serious resistance, counterforce, or difficult trade-off. The key moment (realizing the urn is a person/time and accepting the role) reads more as a granted insight than a hard-won decision under duress. As a result, tension is steady but muted, and escalation never quite bites.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—whether Mira will remain locked in grief or find a way to metabolize it through her art—is clear and gently escalates via the snapped string and the encounter with the woven dawns. Pressure is internal rather than dramatic, but the story does mark a tightening when she chooses to enter the water and then to treat the feather as a quill. The cost (continuing to feel grief while refusing numbness) is implied rather than sharply dramatized, which keeps tension solid but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.6)
    The central conflict—Elias vs. developers’ impending destruction—is clear, and the dominant stake (the orchard’s fate) is signaled early. However, pressure remains mostly abstract; the developers are a future tense threat, and nothing new materially tightens the noose once we’re told they arrive in a week. Elias’s agency (choosing to remodel as defiance) matters, but the process unfolds smoothly, without a test, setback, or sharpened trade-off. As a result, tension plateaus into mood rather than escalating into a felt crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the pilgrimage and its chemistry of “homecoming” are real enough to overturn Elias’s skepticism—is clearly signaled, but the pressure on that stake remains relatively gentle. Once Liora appears and explains, Elias offers minimal resistance before accepting and participating in the ritual, with little sense of what he risks losing by believing. The tightening beat is the moment he produces the amber and allows her to use it, yet this choice doesn’t visibly foreclose a competing path on the page. Conflict is coherent and thematically apt but under-escalated for the standard targeted.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—whether any kind of return or renewal is possible in a dead, forgetful world—is present but remains largely conceptual. There is one clear tightening: the heron’s arrival and “question” precipitate Elias’s choice to scatter seeds now, here. However, opposition is ambient rather than active (entropy, time, societal forgetting) and never directly forces a trade-off or hard renunciation. The result is a beautiful but relatively static pressure profile with understated cost.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will let himself be pulled back into searching for the lost, despite the psychic cost—is clear early and tightens with the riddle and then the cylinder’s revelation that “they’re not dead.” Escalation is primarily informational rather than confrontational, but each new piece of knowledge narrows his options and raises the implied danger. The internal conflict between self-preservation and his compulsion to “translate distance into closeness” is present but not acutely dramatized in the final choice, which he makes without much on-page struggle. As a result, the climax is solid but not fully wrung for tension.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.8)
    The core stake—whether Elias will respond to the anomaly as threat or opportunity, prison or threshold—is clear and coherently linked to his identity. Pressure does increase with the glimpse, the compass burning, and the station reacting, culminating in his decision to draw the anomaly. However, the escalation is gentle and largely internal; no concrete risk, sacrifice, or foreclosed alternative is clearly dramatized. As a result, the outcome is satisfying but not sharply tested, softening the felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—obtaining the sundial lid and confronting the unknown—is clear, and tension does rise when the shadow appears and Lirien initiates the risky trade. The chess-piece bargaining provides a solid pressure point, but after the guardian calls her “not clever enough,” no real loss or narrowing of options materializes; it simply hands over the lid. The conceptual warning (“time is not what you seek. It is what seeks you.”) deepens stakes thematically but doesn’t translate into concrete on-page cost. As a result, escalation feels more like an eerie reveal than a true test.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—whether Liora will remain a pawn-like performer or claim authorship of history—is clear but largely internal and low-intensity. Pressure does deepen once the man appears and challenges her method (“You’re doing it wrong”), forcing her to question her approach and ask him to teach her. However, escalation is more intellectual than visceral; there is little sense of what she concretely risks by changing or failing to change. The final renunciation is conceptually satisfying but could carry more felt cost if the dangers or losses attached to becoming a historian were more sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—finding the stone to understand “home” and his buried talent—is clear, and pressure intensifies as he moves from dreams to physical descent and reality frays. The meaningful tightening is the descent into the mountain’s depths and the encounter with the stone, which reweights what’s at stake from individual to collective talents. However, conflict remains largely atmospheric and internal; there is little concrete resistance or anguished choice, and the price of proceeding never sharpens into a dilemma. Escalation is present but could bear more friction or visible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s drive to undo or atone for his role in Liora’s death—is signaled early and threads through every beat. Pressure coherently escalates as the threads yield more specific guilt (name, date, move) and culminates in the door to the masquerade where he is tested with the possibility of change. His attempt to “touch the move he should have made” and the subsequent denial from Liora force a trade-off between fantasy revision and painful acceptance. The conflict is primarily internal but remains tense; a slightly sharper sense of risk in the memory scene could heighten stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—Lira’s need to break imposed silence versus submitting to the elders’ ritual—is clear early, and pressure coherently rises as her improvised poems begin to alter the world. Each new act of speaking intensifies the situation, culminating in the spire awakening and Echo’s realization that she’s “forging” truth, which nudges her toward postponing the ritual. Yet the elders’ demands and potential consequences stay offstage, so no option is dramatically foreclosed in-scene; the decision to let the ritual “wait” has conceptual weight but limited felt sacrifice. Strong internal pressure, modest external test.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant conflict—against oblivion and fragmentation—is clear, with the external risk of the failing workshop framing his internal stakes. Tension escalates modestly via the workshop’s tilt and his frantic mapping of scars to pockmarks leading to the insight that the statue is a vessel. However, once he sees the pattern, the path to resolution is relatively frictionless; nothing meaningfully tests or threatens to derail his attempt. The emotional and moral cost of regaining all those memories remains implied rather than pressured on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant pressure is internal—can he keep or renegotiate his old promise to the sea/self—and it tightens through the shell’s apparent return, its sinking, and the tunnel’s revelations. The panic when the shell starts to sink is the clearest external escalation, forcing physical risk and revealing the deeper chamber. The final choice to paint “the space between” rather than reclaim the past is a credible, if quiet, resolution with conceptual cost. Overall tension is more meditative than urgent, which limits peak intensity but fits the design.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can prove his whisper theory in the face of Maren’s skepticism and the storm’s roar—is clear and tightened by the decision to drop the vial at the storm’s peak. Escalation is modest but effective: the oppressive pre-storm air, the first rain, then the deliberate timing of the experiment as the storm “hungry” culminate in the faint returning note. Elias’s agency drives the key turn, and Maren’s reaction (from mockery to startled belief) confirms the pressure mattered. However, the price of failure or success feels largely intellectual and relational; no meaningful alternative path or sacrifice is sharply foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Elias can navigate this “geography of loss” toward some connection with his sister/the vanished world—is clear but largely abstract. Conflict remains mostly internal and low-grade; no concrete obstacle or opposing force intensifies the pressure. The midnight call and symbol shift act as a mild tightening, but they don’t foreclose options or force a hard trade‑off. As a result, tension accumulates texturally rather than via meaningful tests of his resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.1)
    The central stake—Mira’s need for safety vs. the cost of facing unoccluded truth—is clearly signaled and tightened as the eye subverts her hope of protection. Trying the eye escalates pressure (voices, amplified fears, nightmares) and forces a nontrivial choice to reject what might be her only shield. The resolution is credibly earned by a series of turns that deepen rather than reset the conflict. The stakes remain mostly internal and philosophical, limiting visceral tension but fitting the story’s quiet scale.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is whether Elias remains a passive keeper of ships or becomes an active keeper of this stranger’s story, signaled once he decides to investigate. Escalation is mostly internal and textural: the borrowed memories intensify, and the boutonnière subtly revives, prompting his interpretive leap. However, the pressure never sharpens into a genuinely difficult trade-off—his acceptance of the burden reads almost inevitable and low-risk. Effective for quiet fiction, but not yet a fully taut conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias remains bound to his inherited shop or steps into the unknown—is clear and coherently pressured by the flood and the mythic door. Escalation tracks under a causal/situational lens: external tension (rising creek, roaring water) tightens as his internal dissatisfaction peaks, culminating in the choice to use the chip. However, the conflict is relatively low-friction; he never seriously considers turning back or defending the status quo once the door appears. The price of the choice is implied rather than dramatized as a felt loss in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—what it means for her to answer or refuse the summons—is present but stays largely internal and conceptual. There is one real tightening at the mirror, where she chooses to reach through, but the climb is summarized as “treacherous” without dramatized jeopardy and she never seriously considers turning back. The “grotto hungers” line promises danger that never materializes on the page as risk or sacrificial cost. As a result, tension hums rather than ratchets, and escalation feels graceful more than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—what to do with the power to “revalue the past” and whether Elias is still himself—is signaled early and carries through. Pressure deepens when Elias appears and reveals the vial, and again when she chooses to use a drop on the curl rather than merely contemplate it. Still, conflict remains mostly internal and relatively gentle; there’s little sense of risk or potential harm if they misuse this power. The final decision forecloses nothing concrete on the page beyond an implied shift in how she’ll pursue her craft.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes are primarily existential and psychological—who Elias is in relation to his other selves and to time—signaled early by the grave and deepened by the self-written prophecy. Pressure escalates via the recognition that he’s “competing” with time and his mounting jealousy of the past self who wrote the scroll, culminating in the ominous presence at the door. However, agency is mostly contemplative: the closest to a high-stakes choice is whether to burn the scroll, and he doesn’t act; the key turn (door opening) is external, so we don’t see a trade-off or foreclosed path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stakes are quiet but coherent: can Elias give the clamp—and by extension Clara’s lineage and his own altered senses—a renewed, human meaning. Pressure deepens when Clara asks him explicitly to “humanize it,” raising the task from technical repair to existential significance. The revelation that the last baby was named Elias tightens the emotional stakes and pushes him toward the mapping act. The cost is subtle (a redefinition of self rather than a painful sacrifice), which keeps the tension from fully peaking but suits the story’s scale.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Liora can transform paralyzing grief and failure into a new kind of magic/voice—is clear early. Pressure intensifies via her trembling hand, the ink’s betrayal, the recall of the failed binding spell, and the risky decision to let the ink harden again. The decisive move is internal but active: embracing the “failure state” of crystallization and reinterpreting it, which forecloses retreat into silence. Still, the conflict remains almost entirely interior and contemplative, with relatively low on-page jeopardy or reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s need to confront his failure and offer an overdue apology—is clear early and tightens as he commits to the ritual, with the coil and copper wire representing a real step back into dangerous work he has abandoned. The escalation is quiet but present: he moves from passive recollection to active summoning, through the bottle’s glow and near-failure, to the partial, ambiguous success of the “I’m sorry” note and the bottle’s crack. The cost is primarily psychological and conceptual: he doesn’t get Clara back, can’t prevent the orchard’s destruction, and must accept that miracles are fragmentary acknowledgments, not repairs. The pressure could read as slightly low-intensity for some readers, but it coheres under a situational/causal lens focused on internal risk.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—preventing the universe from unraveling—is stated early and the need to “unify” words and illusions provides a clear internal goal. Pressure does deepen when the arbitration stone is revealed as dark and inert, but resistance is largely conceptual rather than dramatized. Once she presses the dictionary to the stone, obstacles vanish; the reactivation and subsequent weaving happen without reversals or hard trade-offs. As a result, escalation feels more like a smooth ascent than a tightening, and the ultimate cost of success remains diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—reconciling the station’s function (and the world’s horizon) with its refusal to move—remains clear and tight. Pressure escalates from puzzling malfunction to reality-warp (“air itself was folding”) to a risky embodied act (drawing blood on the razor edge) that forces a choice. The climactic turn is driven by Elias’s agency rather than coincidence, and the cost, though modest, is specific and physical. The conflict is primarily conceptual and atmospheric, so tension never quite hits a visceral “no going back” register appropriate for the most competitive markets.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.2)
    The central conflict—Elias’s desire to understand/perhaps transcend boundaries versus the risk/unknown of what Mara offers—is intriguing but mostly intellectualized. There is a small escalation as Mara reveals her long-term manipulation (spores “on your jacket, in your coffee, once even in your shoe”) and hands him a literally potent hybrid spore. Yet Elias never appears seriously tempted to refuse, and no concrete danger or sacrifice is dramatized, so the pressure remains low and the final “now, we let go” doesn’t feel like a hard trade-off. The stakes are suggestive rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will continue her father’s pattern of gambling to clear debts or find a different way—is clear and thematically aligned. Pressure escalates as she moves from mere curiosity in the library to literally igniting the numbers, forcing a commitment to engage with or reject her father’s method. The internal conflict remains largely cerebral, and external resistance is minimal, so the tension feels more like a slow tightening than a squeeze. The final renunciation of “playing the games he’d lost” is a credible, if relatively quiet, earned stasis choice.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara’s chosen role as a quiet listener is meaningful or sufficient—is clear but largely internal and low-pressure. There is one notable tightening when the woman for Daniel says, “I think I’m ready,” and when the boy stops calling, which forces Mara into a reckoning with the results of her non-intervention. However, Mara’s “agency” is mainly a consistent refusal to act differently, and we never see that stance tested in a live decision under new pressure. As a result, tension feels contemplative rather than escalating toward a concrete dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central conflict—whether to keep clinging to Liora through artifacts or relinquish that grip—is clear and culminates in the concrete act of dropping the locket. Pressure coheres as an internal escalation: his fear of memory fading versus the pain of releasing the last physical tether. That said, the path feels relatively smooth and contemplative; we get limited on-page resistance or moment-by-moment hesitation before the climactic action, which softens the sense of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s desperate need for relief from loneliness via the logistician’s trade—is clear and concentrates into the central confrontation. Escalation is quiet but present: anticipation → offering the rock → the line “This isn’t a trade. It’s a catalysis” serves as the key tightening turn that forecloses his fantasy of transactional cure. The cost is conceptual and emotional rather than situationally pressured (no strong external constraints, deadlines, or real risk of refusal beyond hurt), which keeps tension in the “strong but not searing” band. More friction—hesitation, potential rejection, or a competing option—could heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—finding the stillpoint to understand herself—is clear, but pressure stays gentle throughout, with few moments where options truly narrow or cost feels sharp. The main tightening occurs when the forest thins to reveal the clearing and the hum intensifies, yet Liora never hesitates, doubts, or faces a meaningful alternative. Her agency is present (trusting the ring, stepping into the clearing, touching the tree, allowing absorption) but unopposed, so the journey reads more like inevitable pilgrimage than tested pursuit. The final realization carries emotional weight, but the path there lacks real friction.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.5)
    The central stake—whether Liora will risk re-editing a history she’s already damaged—is clear but largely internal and conceptual. Pressure rises modestly via the dream’s renewed clarity and Elias’s prompting, culminating in her decision to act; this gives one real deepening. However, there’s little sense of what she stands to lose right now beyond generalized fear, and no external counterforce or escalation beyond conversation. The conflict feels meaningful but low-intensity and somewhat static.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Lena’s need to turn grief and silence into a form of connection—is clear but under-pressured. The main tightening is her choice to keep composing when she could withdraw, encouraged by Elias’s “Keep going,” yet that decision doesn’t feel materially costly in the moment. External conflict is minimal; Elias is supportive rather than oppositional, and no specific risk, rejection, or loss is brought into the foreground. As a result, tension remains gentle and never fully sharpens into a test of values.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—uncovering/undoing the civilization’s self-imposed seal—is clear, and the confrontation with the Ember Scribe provides a natural inflection point. Most of the escalation is cognitive (revelations about the “promise” and the key) rather than through increasingly constrained options or visible price. Elara’s core conflict—stop the arsonist or join him—resolves without a meaningful on-page test of commitment, fear, or moral qualms. The ending raises the scale of consequences but doesn’t make a specific, felt cost bite yet.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—find/rejoin Liora before the universe “exhales” again—is clear and escalates from passive experiment subject to active escapee to someone drumming at the edge of reality. The serum-induced drumming and memory bleed create a nice intertwining of internal and external conflict. However, antagonistic pressure (scientists, physical risk of the serum) is underplayed, and there’s little sense of alternatives or trade-offs once he commits to the run. The cost of merging (loss, danger, or sacrifice) is conceptually there but not stressed as a pressured choice.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the truth about whispers and the labyrinth’s deeper logic—is present but stays conceptual rather than materially risky. Pressure does escalate somewhat: the storm intensifies, the humming grows, and the appearance of the woman whose walk forms the "lock" is a clear tightening. However, there’s no explicit price for failure or success, and giving away the key doesn’t foreclose a sharply drawn alternative path. As a result, the story feels like an evocative prologue to a conflict rather than a conflict reaching a scaled-to-length peak.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.8)
    The core pressure is social/spiritual: being branded a witch versus persisting in a misunderstood calling, with the child as a test case. The girl’s accusation is a solid inciting beat, and the silent teaching sequence is a meaningful response, but escalation is very soft—there’s no moment where Maris’s path feels genuinely at risk. The stakes feel more conceptual than visceral, and there’s little sense that refusal or failure would truly cost her something new in this scene. The ending resolves comfortably with no lingering dilemma, keeping conflict in the competent-but-quiet band.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—preventing a returning, vaguely defined threat tied to his sister’s disappearance—is signaled but remains largely anticipatory. Pressure deepens mainly through ominous cues (whispers, town’s unease) rather than escalated obstacles or narrowed options. The main “turn” is Elias deciding to act now, but this choice is not visibly costly or contested; no real alternative path is dramatized. As a result, tension feels textured rather than sharply escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Lirien will remain ghostlike within a cruel world or accept a different mode of freedom and belonging—is coherent and signaled early. Escalation occurs through her increasingly committed actions: pocketing the scrimshaw, going to the fringe, entering the temple, staying as it dissolves. Yet there is little sense of a live alternative path or concrete cost when she encounters her mother; the revelation about violence and detachment resolves tension more than it sharpens it. The ending offers earned stasis/reconfiguration, but the pressure never quite bites hard enough to feel fully tested.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—whether Elias will submit to mandated happiness or preserve his grief through ritual—is clear but remains largely internal and static. The dream of his wife’s narrated laundry is the closest thing to escalation, briefly intensifying his pain and investment in the ritual. However, there’s little sense of narrowing options or an external test; the mandate’s threat is historical, not presently pressing. The closure as endurance works, but the conflict never quite sharpens into a felt dilemma with on-page alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake is the risk of self-dissolution or transformation by entering a forbidden, reality-softening space, signaled early via elders and tradition. Escalation arrives mainly through sensory and spiritual intensification (the ice crack, rising hum, deeper attunement) culminating in her letting the atrium “speak through” her. Still, tension stays gentle; there’s no hard reversal or sharply framed alternative path, and the cost is subtle (fatigue, reconfigured identity) rather than acutely felt. Effective for quiet literary work, but not maximally pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can transcend or reconceive his colorblindness—is clear but never feels truly risky or contested on the page. Liora’s “price” is modest and not meaningfully tested, and no antagonist or strong counterforce pressures him beyond his own mild hesitation. The one escalation beat is his decision to attempt the feeling-based painting, with Mara’s shard adding depth rather than genuine complication. As a result, tension remains low and the ending, while graceful, lacks a sense of costful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.2)
    Conflict is largely internal and philosophical: Elias struggles with what connection is and whether it can be “controlled” or reconstructed. The hum is a meaningful deepening, but there is little sense of narrowing options or a concrete price for his new understanding. Stakes are framed in broad terms (“why connection felt like something that had to be excavated”) but never quite bite into a specific loss or risk in the moment. The escalation is gentle and coherent, yet feels more like an atmospheric swell than true pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will remain entombed in grief or risk re-engaging with memory—is clear and sharpened by his decision to follow the first cryptic message instead of retreating. Pressure escalates in a gentle, accumulative way through increasingly uncanny locations and the scented traces of Liora until the lotus/observatory sequence forces a stance: look where he has refused to look. The emotional cost is legible but quite subtle, and the external “quest” itself offers little real resistance or risk, so the middle can feel more like guided wandering than tightening conflict. The ending is nonetheless earned and not cheaply resolved by coincidence alone.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she engages with whoever is mapping her as she maps others—is clear but largely internal and conceptual. Escalation is present (weirdness intensifies from Tower to Fool to Hermit, then the text, then the blueprint realization), yet the pressure on her is more eerie than urgent; nothing forces a painful trade-off beyond curiosity vs. safety. Her final decision to reply is a real turn, but the cost is only lightly implied rather than felt. Sharpening what she stands to lose would strengthen the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can “purify” the archive without repeating the Veythi’s fatal obsession with order—is signaled early and tightened when Kael manifests and triggers the archive’s transformation. There is a meaningful turn when she realizes Kael is a remnant born of her longing, forcing a stance on nostalgia. However, conflict remains mostly internal and is resolved with relatively little friction; she understands and complies almost immediately after Kael says, “You have to let go.” The archive’s threat (pattern-traps) is described but never actively endangers her in scene, so the sense of risk and cost is more inferred than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the past (the river) can persist in some form that might enable renewal—is clear, but conflict is largely interior and atmospheric. Escalation appears in the tightening around the merged footage and the shadow’s behavior (coiling, sharpening, then dissolving), which gently raises the emotional pressure without presenting real resistance or hard choices. Elias’s key agency moment is choosing to work the terminal instead of clinging to the stone, but the cost of that choice is underplayed. The tension is steady and suffices for a quiet, lyric piece, yet it never quite feels truly dangerous or precarious.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—how Elias will respond to betrayal without losing his gentleness—is clear and threads from early recollection of the poacher through the medical task. Pressure is modest but real: will he cling to the illusion (reconstruct the tail) or accept loss and adapt (trim, let it heal, revise his practice)? The escalation is primarily internal and subtle, hinging on a single deepening rather than multiple turns, which suits the piece but keeps tension relatively low. Cost is present but quiet: a renunciation of comforting beliefs rather than an acute dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.8)
    The primary stake—internal closure/reconciliation with his strange gift and history—stays somewhat soft and never quite crystallizes into a sharp “what might be lost” on the page. Escalation exists (hourglass breaking, garden voices intensifying, warning moss, then catastrophic shattering of all the hourglasses), but the pressure rarely feels dangerous or morally fraught. Elias’s key choice is to keep going despite the warning, yet the narrative doesn’t clearly mark or price that as a risky trade-off; it simply yields revelation. The ending is satisfying but reads more as an unveiling than a hard-won, costly resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—unlocking the lost tune and the stored unsent love—is clear, and pressure does build from quiet waiting to trembling booth to burning film and self-activating projector. However, the conflict remains mostly conceptual and internal; there is little sense that failure or psychic overload would carry concrete consequences beyond disappointment. Mira’s choice to lean into the intensifying, even destructive vision is a meaningful tightening but not deeply contested. Tension is present but could be sharpened by more explicit risk or friction.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.5)
    The primary stake—regaining lost creativity—is clearly articulated, but pressure remains gentle and mostly internal, with little escalation beyond reiterated frustration and fatigue. The main tightening is the moment when the unspoken words grow louder and the single bright star appears, yet this functions more as a magical gift than a test that forces a trade-off or exposes cost. Liora’s agency is modest (she decides to come here, to look, to listen, then to let go), and nothing significant is lost or foreclosed besides the symbolic dependency on the instrument. As a result, the climax is emotionally pleasant but not particularly tense or risky.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake is existential and vocational—what Elias’s watchfulness is really for—rather than survival or relational. Conflict is mostly situational and internal, with the clock and archive arriving as almost benevolent intrusions rather than sources of genuine risk. The “dunes are dangerous” warning never manifests as specific threat, so Elias’s choices don’t feel tested under real cost. Escalation is primarily conceptual (revelation of the archive’s function) without a clear narrowing of options or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—whether the philosopher will remain within an ordered, machine-built containment of thought or step into the unruly frontier of his mind—is present and coherent. There is a clear tightening when he realizes the gear is a map and meets the guardian, culminating in his nonverbal choice to step forward. Yet the pressure never feels truly fraught; there’s little sense of what he might lose beyond an abstract safety, and no serious temptation to refuse the call. The conflict is thus quietly philosophical rather than sharply dramatized, limiting tension and perceived cost.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will remain a passive “passenger” or actively seek her own courage—is clear but not strongly pressured. The main tightening comes from entering the inlet and labyrinth of reeds into the cove of those who mis-timed their choices, yet there’s little on-page resistance or risk around her decision to step ashore. Elias’s questions and the eerie setting gently nudge her toward a stance rather than forcing a difficult trade-off. As a result, escalation feels more like deepening mood than genuine narrowing of options with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—truth vs the safety of institutional forgetting—is established early and tightened when the missing bolt exposes active erasure, culminating in Elias’s refusal to accept “necessary” silence. However, the pressure remains relatively low-temperature: Madame Veyra’s opposition is largely philosophical, and Elias is not forced into a sharp, on-page trade-off with immediate consequences. Escalation exists (clue → confrontation → revelation), but the conflict never quite bites into a concrete dilemma beyond a principled internal stance. The ending’s cost is implied rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—unmasking the pretender by recovering the rune and archival proof—is clearly established, and there is a conceptual sense of high consequence. Yet on the page, opposition is almost entirely latent; the library yields its secrets after modest effort, and there are no time, physical, or moral pressures that force a trade-off. The main tightening is the discovery of the scroll and the realization of what the rune can do, which deepens stakes but doesn’t significantly narrow options or exact a price. The scene reads more as setup for future conflict than as a pressured conflict beat in itself.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering why survey paths disappeared—is clear early and pursued consistently, with escalation through the discovery of a deletion pattern and the revelation that someone on-station hid the pages. However, opposition is mostly abstract and off-stage; there’s no on-page antagonist or direct risk beyond unease and conceptual loss. The final turn (answering knock, deciding to remember/follow the paths) is thematically rich but not tightly bound to a difficult trade-off or foreclosed option. As a result, tension is steady rather than sharply tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is internal: whether Lira will remain in the inherited lull of disillusionment or risk re-engaging with the world’s “forgotten magic.” Escalation is present—the hum grows, she physically closes distance, and contact with the stone produces a qualitative shift—but tension remains mainly atmospheric rather than sharply conflictual. There is no explicit immediate danger, counter-force, or concrete trade-off at the peak, which keeps the pressure relatively low. The ending clarifies stance but doesn’t strongly foreground a price for that stance.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Mira risking sanctioned stability to trigger a radical rebirth—is clear, and tension steadily accumulates toward the night she unseals the embryo. Her choice is consequential and irreversible, with clear political and ecological implications. However, the conflict is largely one-sided: the Council never appears on-page, the environment never truly threatens her, and Mira experiences little real doubt in the climactic moment. As a result, escalation feels more like an inevitability unfolding than a hard-won decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Lena can find a way to live with trauma without submitting to false “healing”—is clearly established and returns under pressure when the drones pass overhead. The main escalation is internal: her body’s flashback-driven freeze confronted by Mira’s intervention, using the orchid as a somatic anchor. The price is her choice to endure and stay, burying the photograph and accepting a harder, unsentimental form of persistence. The conflict remains quiet and largely internal, so it never quite reaches a knife-edge decision point, but within that register, it tightens meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.6)
    The conflict is primarily internal—whether to dissolve into darkness or to reconstruct meaning—and that stake is clear early and tightened through the walls closing and the tarot’s accusatory spread. Escalation reads as accumulating pressure rather than sharp reversals, but the move from passive brooding to active redesign (portrait, cards) to literal surrender to the closing walls is a credible progression. The cost—risking obliteration of self in order to reconfigure—is present but could be made slightly more perilous or specific in terms of what he stands to lose. Still, his final choice to re-engage (drawing the ache) feels earned rather than conveniently redemptive.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—saving the child while uncovering what’s happening to time—is clear and escalates as the boy worsens and the ink entity manifests. Elias’s decisive act of grabbing the ink-shape is a strong, agentive turn that redefines the situation and yields new knowledge. That said, external resistance is minimal; the entity’s struggle is brief and somewhat easy, and Elias doesn’t face a sharply framed tradeoff or visible loss in acting. The promised larger conflict with the time-thieves is deferred entirely off-page, so escalation tops out at “intriguing glimpse” rather than fully charged confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will risk defying the Order’s control of history—is clear, and the piece does escalate from private unease to a decisive act of subversion. Internal and external pressures interweave (his fear of silence vs. the Order’s surveillance), and the choice to plant the letter rather than destroy or keep it is a meaningful turn. However, the path to the chamber feels too smooth: there are no real obstacles or reversals, and the “networks stirring” never manifest as tangible danger that narrows his options. As a result, tension remains more atmospheric than actively escalating, and the visible price of his choice is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—will the father claim the bounty on his own daughter—is clear and weighty from the moment his silhouette appears. Liora’s agency manifests in choosing nonviolence (sheathing the knife, offering the sandbag and rose), and his choice to forego the bounty is a genuine cost. However, the pressure curve is quite gentle: there’s little feeling that violence might truly occur, and the external danger remains mostly implied rather than tested on the page. A slightly sharper beat where his intent wavers or her safety feels more precarious would elevate escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—securing the goddess’s echo to restore a world whose patterns are failing—is clear and present early, and pressure coheres as the garden spirals from harmony into chaos. There is one meaningful tightening when he reaches the absolute silence and must decide to offer the rail spike and “voice silence,” which leads directly to resolution. However, the conflict remains largely atmospheric; concrete consequences for failure and a tangible personal cost are only lightly sketched, so escalation feels more like a graceful swell than a grueling test. Strengthening the sense of risk or sacrifice at the climax would raise the stakes considerably.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will accept her father’s erasure or endanger herself to pursue the truth—is clearly signaled and tightened as off-page antagonistic pressure surfaces (“They’re watching the printworks”). Escalation comes from knowledge deepening rather than set-piece confrontation, but the move from private suspicion to public letters to planning a graveyard-level investigation is a meaningful narrowing of options. The price of intervention is mostly conceptual and prospective rather than concretely dramatized, which keeps the tension just short of searing. Nonetheless, her final decision forecloses the safer path of passive acceptance in a way that feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will continue to evade or finally bear his guilt—is signaled early and escalates through increasingly explicit hauntings (from disembodied cries to translated accusations to faces on screens). His agency at the climax (choosing to tattoo specific constellations with amber) directly resolves the immediate pressure of the voices. The internal cost is legible—he forecloses the fantasy of escape and commits to permanent self-marking—but the external resistance is light, and the resolution feels almost too frictionless once he starts the procedure. Another small complication or hesitation under the needle could have sharpened the sense of price.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Liora can wrest coherent meaning from the grotto’s mess of whispers—is present from the outset and tightens as the mandala resists her control. The arrival/intervention of Maren and the flake’s disruption provide organic escalations, moving Liora from control to surrender/listening. However, the conflict remains largely internal and conceptual; there is little sense of a concrete cost if she fails beyond ongoing “unraveling,” which softens pressure. The final act (pressing the tile) is a meaningful choice, but the trade-off (what she gives up or risks by doing so) is mostly implied rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—how Liora will respond to Amira’s legacy, with vengeance or aberrant mercy—is clear and sharpened when she finds the name on the stone. Pressure escalates internally as the stepping stone becomes “accusation” or “invitation,” culminating in the choice to keep the name and redefine the place. The cost is emotional and ethical (living with her own inaction and Amira’s act while refusing erasure), but external or immediate consequences remain abstract. A more concrete sense of risk or opposition in the present would deepen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Liora can move from spectral stagnation toward a new kind of “encore”—is clear, and it tightens when the fractured possibilities appear and she confronts them as either hope or cruelty. However, pressure remains mostly emotional and relatively soft; there’s little sense of what Elias or Liora stand to lose beyond hurt feelings or dashed hope if this fails. Elias never seems at risk or seriously challenged, so escalation leans on spectacle rather than cost. The final choice narrows options but doesn’t foreground a concrete price.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara can understand and control the pill’s lingering effects—is clear and threads the whole piece. There is a meaningful deepening when she accesses an alien memory, raising the implication that she’s entangled with others’ minds. Yet opposition is mostly abstract; nothing truly resists her except uncertainty, and her experiments succeed without notable setback or sacrifice. As a result, tension is present but gentle, with limited narrowing of options or visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Eira engages with the awakening unknown—is signaled and escalates from dream-pressure to direct contact. The fissure opening and the entity’s approach create a clear tightening, and the shattering of the device plus her swallowing by the cave register as a cost. However, the conflict is largely one-sided: the entity’s offer and subsequent merging feel almost foregone, with limited on-page struggle, negotiation, or alternative path. As a result, the climax reads more as an inevitable absorption than as a pressured, high-cost choice.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—what it will mean if/when the prophecy activates—is clear, and tension does accumulate as Mira approaches and then completes the catalog. The hourglass reversing provides a genuine tightening/turn, and her choice to calmly invert it again is a form of Earned Stasis that crystallizes her stance. However, there’s little sense that any real alternative path was live; she never seriously entertains fear, desire, or resistance that might sharpen the decision. The conflict remains primarily conceptual and serene, which is elegant but somewhat low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake is Elias’s willingness to re-engage with a dangerous, guilt-ridden past versus continuing in self-erasure, and this is established early in his return to the bluff and the codes in the snow. Pressure escalates with the opening of the pillbox, the appearance of the door, and especially the discovery that the file contains his own confession and a list of abandoned agents, which reframes his guilt as a live obligation. However, all external obstacles yield easily (the key “turned without resistance”), so the conflict remains purely intrapsychic and relatively smooth in its progression. The cost is conceptual and emotional rather than viscerally dramatized, which keeps this strong but not ferocious.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—get the damaged ferry safely across before the storm worsens—is present but relatively low-intensity. There is one clear tightening when the rope begins to unravel "faster now," prompting him to pull out the needle and work quickly, yet we never feel that true failure is near or that he faces a difficult trade-off. Internal tension about time "running out" is asserted more than dramatized through reversals or hard choices. The resolution, while apt for a quiet piece, comes with minimal felt price beyond physical effort and aging joints.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake is essentially epistemic—Ren’s desire to understand the oasis and its resistance to change—rather than survival or relational, which is fine but keeps pressure low. Escalation arrives via intensifying anomalies (shimmering air, scent of honey, stronger thrumming), culminating in the ritual and realization. Still, Ren is never forced into a difficult trade-off, and no real option is foreclosed; the oasis simply reveals itself. As a result, tension feels contemplative rather than gripping, limiting the score.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake is emotional: how Elias relates to loss, legacy, and the approach of winter, tested by Lila’s bereavement and the key. Pressure tightens at the reveal of the father’s death and resolves in Elias’s relinquishing of his father’s tool, a meaningful though quiet act. Conflict is entirely gentle—there’s no overt resistance or clash between Elias and Lila, so the tension is more atmospheric than confrontational. The cost is legible but subtle, keeping the piece in a strong but not high-intensity band.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is Lira’s internal struggle between being overwhelmed by inherited memory and using it constructively, which is signaled early and maintained. There is a modest tightening as the hum grows louder, she aligns the sundial, and the shadow points to the scale-bound book, but resistance is low and there are no hard choices or visible losses. The warning that some memories should not be carried alone gestures at higher stakes but never meaningfully constrains her options. The resolution—reading the book and feeling lighter—arrives with little on-page cost or test of her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira can move from stitching others’ hearts to confronting her own unspooled thread—is established early and returns at each major beat. Pressure deepens with the artist’s directive to “write your own letter,” forcing her into an action that breaks her habitual role. Escalation is internal and understated rather than dramatic; there’s no hard external test, but for this lyric mode the narrowing of options (she must either stay ghostlike or risk self-exposure) is clear enough. The cost remains mostly conceptual, which limits intensity but not coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—freeing the community’s perception from cosmic tricksters—is established early and tied to Mara’s need to act subtly. Pressure increases somewhat as she readies the generator and Voss challenges her, and the moment before she presses the button carries a modest charged pause. Yet there’s essentially one straight line of action with no reversal or meaningful setback: once she has the idea, nothing truly threatens to derail it, and Voss’s skepticism folds quickly. The price paid is mostly conceptual (“if you’re wrong, we’re lost”), with little dramatized cost or narrowing of options at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Elias vs his fear in pursuit of the Nexus’s secret—is clear, and the hum/music provides a satisfying escalation path into the encounter. The main tightening comes when he’s offered the compass with a warning, but there is little real friction or hesitation before he accepts. Internal conflict between safety and knowledge is gestured at rather than fully dramatized in that climactic moment, so the cost of his choice feels more promised than paid. The awakening of the ship raises future stakes without making him pay a concrete on-page price yet.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Liora will be remembered and “seen” versus forgotten as a cold case—is clear, but the conflict stays largely conversational and reflective. Pressure does deepen when the sister introduces the lance and the corruption angle, which reweights what Elara is doing at the quarry from curiosity to a more ethical obligation. However, there’s little real narrowing of options or visible price beyond emotional commitment; Elara’s decision to draw is aligned with her existing identity and not strongly resisted. The result feels thematically charged but low in lived friction or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will confront and carry forward Elias’s dangerous truth—is clear and does tighten as she decodes more of his intent. Escalation comes mainly through knowledge turns (reversible exile, the nail as key, “He’d been sent”) rather than through hard tactical constraints. The furnace “opening on its own” and the looming storms add situational pressure, but she’s never forced into a concrete trade-off or loss on the page. As a result, the conflict feels meaningful but somewhat low-intensity for elite publication standards.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.4)
    Conflict is primarily internal and situational: how Lena orients herself toward absence, possibility, and the trace of the hitchhiker. The dominant stake—whether she treats the hitchhiker’s disappearance and the flake as a reason to stop, doubt, or continue in her way—is present but understated. Escalation is modest: the repetition of the bridge-song and the sharpening/then dissolving valley suggest a deepening, and the rain introduces a soft external nudge, yet no real option is dramatically foreclosed. It’s a beautifully textured mood piece but under-pressured for top-tier conflict scores.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—whether Elias will remain caught in his father’s cycle of hollow ventures or step off—exists, but pressure is almost entirely internal. The only tangible external “escalation” is the approaching rain, which nudges him toward leaving but doesn’t present a real cost. His final movement away from the train marks a choice, yet that choice never feels seriously contested by a live alternative beyond reflection. The conflict is thoughtful and thematically apt, but lacks a concrete turn where he visibly risks or loses something to make the decision.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will remain a passive chronicler or accept a more vulnerable, communal role—is clear but remains primarily internal and conceptual. Pressure does accumulate via successive dreams and the uncanny insistence of the inscriptions, culminating at midnight when he chooses to act. However, the escalation lacks concrete consequence or counter-force; nothing visibly pushes back against his choice. As a result, the turn is meaningful but not sharply pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—lift the curse vs. expose a devastating truth—is signaled early and intensifies as the plant digs through her worst memories. Escalation is coherent: the tendrils tighten with each deeper memory, culminating in the explicit confession that forecloses her old self-concept and any easy loyalty to the Circle’s narrative. The price is emotional and moral rather than physical, but it’s unmistakable, especially once the mirror shows the raiders were her kin and the child’s future vengeance. External threat from the vortex could be slightly more active to parallel the strong inner conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will step into the unknown intersection and remake the covenant—is clear but faces little resistance. Tension comes mostly from anticipation and mood; once he has the clipping, his commitment to “heed the call” is never seriously tested. The woman’s arrival and the transition to the intersection unfold with no real friction, reversal, or narrowing of options. As a result, escalation feels modest and the final “Together” reads more like the completion of an already-made decision than a costly turn.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—recovering the brother versus losing the defining memory—is clearly signaled and tightened when the stranger specifies the required price. The negotiation around the seed and memory provides one meaningful escalation, and the final choice visibly forecloses a path (keeping the memory intact) with emotional cost. Tension is mostly internal, with external danger underused; the potential threat of the orchard or stranger never quite sharpens into a second layer of pressure. Still, for this length, the conflict/stakes scaffold is strong and coherent, if not maximal.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Jake will remain trapped in a failed past or risk re-engaging with a possible future—is clear but kept mostly internal. Pressure escalates modestly from routine appraisal work to the eerie nighttime visit and the uncanny sound that forces him to confront what he’s lost. However, Lena’s arrival resolves much of the tension by coincidence, and Jake’s final “choice” is more a gentle reframing than a hard trade-off with visible on-page cost, keeping the conflict strong but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—reestablishing contact and understanding the spirit’s migration—is clear but remains largely intellectual. Escalation is minimal: she implants the seed, waits, glimpses a figure, and receives a reassuring message, all without serious resistance, jeopardy, or painful trade-offs. The story doesn’t truly test how far she’ll go or what she’ll risk, so there’s no beat where options sharply narrow or a live path is foreclosed. The result is a gently deepening curiosity fulfilled rather than a conflict that tightens and extracts a price.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—what to do with the stories and how to honor them within a stalled future—is present but remains abstract and gently handled. There is a mild deepening when Elias realizes the creel “was not empty at all” and chooses to send the books away, shifting from preservation-as-hoarding to preservation-as-release. However, there’s little genuine resistance, risk, or felt trade-off; no path is meaningfully foreclosed beyond a conceptual shift. Tension is primarily atmospheric rather than situational or moral, which keeps escalation modest.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake is internal: whether she will remain a detached functionary or risk acknowledging and releasing both others’ and her own abandoned hopes. Pressure escalates as she moves from reading confessions to actively dissolving them, then peaks at the discovery of the child’s crown and the hidden “I wanted to be brave,” which forces her to confront her own fear. The cost—self-exposure and the loss of the pearl’s power—is present but quiet, making the conflict feel more contemplative than gripping. For an elite venue, a slightly sharper sense of risk or resistance in her could deepen the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Lena can live with the truth of her culpability—is clear, but escalation is relatively quiet and internal. Pressure deepens as she reads increasingly pointed graffiti (“Forgiveness isn’t a place...”) and recalls the drowned man, leading to the reframing that she no longer seeks forgiveness. However, there is little active testing of her resolve beyond contemplation; the scene doesn’t tighten options so much as clarify her stance. The walk toward the river is a meaningful but understated act, not a sharply foreclosing turn.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—whether and how she will confront the “unspoken” and her fate between the two letters—is intriguing but remains abstract. The library’s threats (aisles vanishing if she hesitates, the notion of fate being “sealed”) never materially endanger her or force a painful trade-off, so tension rises more in idea than in felt pressure. The main tightening is when the blank book reveals the unwritten second letter, but she acquiesces with little resistance. This keeps the conflict framework functional and thematically apt but not gripping or sharply escalated.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central conflict—Elara’s dream versus the continuity of her father’s empire—is stated early and then tightened by the plants’ warnings and the apocalyptic coffee-stain vision. Her father’s arrival crystallizes external pressure, turning an internal dilemma into an immediate confrontation. Escalation is clear and linear: first note as test, then prophecy and accusation, then the irrevocable choice to play fully and “propagate the unraveling.” The cost is present but slightly abstracted; we feel the loss of the father and potential ruin more conceptually than viscerally on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.8)
    The core stake—can Liora briefly hold a life on the threshold—is clear, but pressure is gentle and escalation minimal. She senses a final spark slipping, performs the ritual, and it succeeds without setback or real risk that forces adaptation. The internal conflict between honoring death and preserving life is thematically present but not dramatized as a live dilemma in the scene. As a result, the piece reads more as a beautiful tableau than as a test of her resolve or methods.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—Mira’s need to move from mere forgiveness to contentment—is clear from early on and coherently pursued. There is a meaningful tightening as she moves from contemplating the hairpin in the tree to confronting the pool’s vision and choosing to give up the object. However, the internal conflict isn’t pressed as hard as it might be; the voice’s guidance and her acceptance come with minimal on-page struggle or cost beyond a gentle, lyrical surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central conflict—absolution versus understanding, guilt versus nuance—is clearly signaled and coherently pursued. There is a meaningful tightening when Elias shifts from silent assessment to the riskier, more intimate prompt, “Tell me what you’re afraid of,” and when he recognizes that Veyra wants complexity, not exoneration. However, escalation remains largely internal and low-key; no major option is dramatically foreclosed beyond a conceptual retreat from binary judgment. The felt price of adopting nuance is somewhat abstract, muting the sense of hard-won cost.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether she can step out of time and what that means for her identity—is clearly signaled early and coherently pursued. Pressure escalates via the grotto’s intensifying hum, her admission of fear, the trance deepening, and finally the frozen rings and blinding glow. Her agency is expressed through choosing to face fear and enter fully into the ritual rather than retreat into scientific distance. However, the sense of tangible risk or loss at the peak remains somewhat abstract, so the conflict feels profound but not sharply priced.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the navigators’ secret—is clear, and there is one meaningful escalation when the flock’s disruption yields the hidden door. However, Elias encounters almost no resistance: each step (reading the birds, opening the door, reading the chamber) proceeds smoothly, softening tension. The “price” of staying is conceptual rather than fought for on the page, so pressure never quite bites. As a result, conflict reads as contemplative discovery more than tested pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can access something sacred despite his perceived inadequacy—is legible early and carried through. There is a clear tightening when he obeys the “unstrap” command and again when he chooses to drink from the fountain, each narrowing his path. However, external risk feels muted: nothing truly threatens him in the spire, and the “tests” unfold without meaningful possibility of failure or damage beyond wounded pride. The ending choice (planting the drop instead of attempting a grand spell) has conceptual cost but could be sharpened with a clearer sense of what he’s relinquishing.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake is Elias confronting/accepting an inherited luminous vow, which is clear but largely abstract. Escalation is gentle: unease → descent into ship → confrontation with woman → sky revelation, with no real resistance or live alternative path pressed on him. “You’re late” implies urgency, yet nothing on the page truly narrows his options or exacts a visible price beyond a symbolic handover of the tag. The result is thematically charged but dramatically under-pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant conflict—how to respond to a universe whose rules and prophecy have inverted—is clear and tracks from the opening realization through the static’s crescendo. Pressure escalates primarily through internal deepening (reinterpretation of the prophecy, coins, and static) rather than new obstacles, culminating in his choice to stop chasing alignment and instead listen. Stakes are largely existential and internal; the hinted cosmological stakes (“after the universe contracts”) don’t get an on-page test. The result is a satisfying but relatively quiet turn rather than a sharply agonized one.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s need to honor the dead and relieve his burden by naming their fears—is clear, but pressure is low and largely unopposed. The escalation is more tonal than conflict-driven: monsters stir, the observatory trembles, light condenses, then resolves smoothly without credible risk that anything might go wrong. His agency matters (he chooses to perform the ritual and speak the names), yet he is never forced into a difficult trade-off or visible loss. As a result, the climax feels beautiful but safe.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—world sliding into silence, fish gone—is powerful, and Elias’s attempt to restore balance through the bell gives the piece a clear throughline. There is a discernible escalation from observation to painstaking repair to the test strike and its partial success (a few fish returning, not a full restoration). However, resistance is relatively soft: no serious failure, setback, or alternative tactic tests his resolve, and the process reads more contemplative than pressured. The ending earns a gentle, thoughtful tension rather than a truly sharpened sense of risk or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will suppress or reveal a painful, complicating truth about Hollow Bend and his father—is clear and sharpened by each new photograph. Pressure builds in a measured way up to the discovery of the final photo showing his father and Mira together. The decisive choice to keep and return with the photographs provides real, if quiet, conflict resolution, but the opposition remains primarily internal and thematic rather than dramatized through concrete risk or counterforce. The piece might benefit from one more tangible consequence or explicit risk tied to either choice to heighten the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Liora will keep trying to control magic or accept a more vulnerable, intuitive relationship to it—is clear but only mildly pressured. The “final transformation” operates as a loose deadline, yet no concrete consequence or opposing force forces a hard trade-off; she simply comes to a decision in relative safety. The one major tightening is her admission that “some things could not be measured,” which leads to burying the crystal, but this costs her mostly pride and worldview, not something palpably at risk in the moment. The conflict is thoughtful and coherent, but escalation is internal and gentle, never truly cornering her.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—surviving descent and reclaiming self-trust—is clear and escalates through the branch groaning, wind picking up, and the actual fall-caught-by-vine beat. The snap and suspension are a solid tightening that tests both his improvisation and resolve. However, the internal conflict between watcher and actor, or detached observer vs. embodied participant, is gestured at more than it is really sharpened into a dilemma with real trade-offs. The final image shows persistence under pressure but doesn’t significantly narrow his future options beyond “keep trying.”

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael will continue to live behind numbness or risk feeling—is signaled early and escalates coherently via the increasingly intense sparring and Veyra’s psychological pressure. The key tightening comes when she names his ego-armor (“I’m broken. I’m empty. I’m not enough.”) and slices through it, forcing him into a raw, unguarded attack that cracks his numbness. Stakes remain mostly internal; while effective, they never quite manifest as a difficult external trade-off or loss beyond emotional risk.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—protecting the seed/space for innovation from an unnamed “they”—is present from the first note and tightens with each new box and warning. Escalation is incremental: mysterious gift → implied threat → personal connection via photograph → explicit approach (“They’re coming”). However, conflict stays largely anticipatory and symbolic; Lena never has to sacrifice something concrete or make a painful trade-off on the page, and “they” never manifest as active opposition yet. The ending’s readiness is intriguing but stops short of a turn that visibly raises the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.9)
    The central stake—coaxing laughter back to a grief-stricken family—is clear and emotionally legible, and the escalation beat is the blower sputtering just as the girl appears, prompting Elias to force it back to life. Beyond that, pressure remains fairly gentle: there’s no serious possibility of failure or harmful consequence if he’s seen, and his choice to leave once laughter returns comes without visible dilemma. Internal conflict (desire to remain unseen vs. being confronted by the girl) isn’t pushed to a real trade-off. The piece succeeds as a quiet, situational pressure study, but lacks a sharper on-page cost or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.0)
    Conflict is primarily internal: Mara’s craving for answers versus her attempt to "make friends with uncertainty." Escalation is gentle but present—hearing the pages, facing the guardian, then confronting the blank book that writes her fears back at her. The pressure never becomes acute or truly risky, yet the final stance change (no longer waiting) is tied to that confrontation in a coherent way.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—what Elias will make of his life’s failure—is clear, and the pressure escalates from quiet despair over the ledger to a choice to risk obliteration of his work and relic. The explosions and destruction are an effective externalization of internal stakes. Still, the decision reads relatively unopposed; there’s little on-page wrestling with danger, so the escalation feels more like a symbolic flourish than a hard trade-off under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Mira’s pursuit of the “beginning in every ending”—is clear, and pressure escalates as the perigee intensifies, the anomaly appears, and the tower begins to fail. Her key turn is methodological, choosing to discard assumptions and tune to silence; that choice credibly enables her transcendence. However, the conflict is almost entirely internal and largely unopposed; there’s little sense that she might fail, turn back, or pay an unwanted price. The falling city and implied bodily loss function more as poetic contrast than as actively felt risk in her decision-making.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stakes—ferry vanishing, echoes lost between timelines—are conceptually high, and the radio call plus appearing commuters signal rising pressure. But the on-page escalation is gentle: there’s little sense of time running out or options narrowing beyond “this is happening now.” Elias’s solution (trust the patterns, speak reassurance) encounters no serious resistance, and the fix lands without a felt tradeoff. As a result, tension feels more like a beautifully described uncanny moment than a pressured crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake is Elias’s need to understand/experience connection as reality and memory destabilize, with the thread as both catalyst and guide. There is escalation—the illusions “erupt,” memories rewrite, the floor liquefies, and finally he passes through an impossible door into a different ontological space. But Elias encounters almost no resistance, internal or external; he consistently follows the thread’s pull without serious hesitation, so options never feel meaningfully contested. The conflict remains largely experiential and contemplative, limiting tension despite strong images.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether the deep-dwellers will cling to seabed navigation or embrace starlight—is clear but remains largely conceptual and low-risk. Conflict is mostly intellectual and lightly contested (Tael’s brief scoff) rather than escalating through tough choices or meaningful reversals. The alien ship’s descent functions as an external validation rather than a pressure test of Lirien’s commitment, so escalation feels modest. The final stance (“we will make [the stars] ours”) reads as a decision but without a sharply felt trade-off or foreclosed alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—finding and possibly saving Miriam while risking being “taken” herself—is clear and present early. Pressure escalates through the increasing intensity of the hearing-aid pulses, the thickening mist, and Elias’s explicit warning about “the ones who hear too much.” However, once Miriam’s voice calls, the path forward is relatively unopposed; Lena’s run into the mist feels brave but not sharply tested. The lack of a concrete loss or forced trade-off on the page keeps the conflict from fully biting.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can/should return the codex and what price he’ll pay—is legible early via the danger of the station and his time limit. Pressure escalates through the discovery that the researchers “aren’t dead,” the reality-fault revelation, and the choice to step through the membrane, culminating in his decision not to fight as the station floods. Internal and external conflicts dovetail in his final endurance/renunciation. The escalation is effective but relatively straightforward, with limited on-page struggle around his ultimate decision.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—what Elias will do with his sense of undeserved, “borrowed” time—is clear, but pressure remains mostly internal and contemplative. The ghost’s injunction to “Defragment” and the line “You are not the sum of your mistakes” constitute the main tightening, nudging him toward a different self-concept. Elias’s agency is quiet (choosing to engage, to reconsider his talismans, to resume heartbeat counting with a new frame) rather than decisively active. Because conflict never quite sharpens into a moment where a concrete option is foreclosed or a visible price is paid, escalation feels limited.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake is essentially: can she capture the echoes’ “texture language” in the diamond, with a faint shadow of danger from the curse rumor. Pressure rises somewhat as the diamond warms and the echoes “answer back,” but she never faces a serious risk, reversal, or dilemma that forces a costly choice. Escalation is more about intensifying pattern than narrowing options, and the rumored madness never concretely surfaces to test her resolve. The result is quietly engaging but low-tension, more demonstration than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will be changed/claimed by the phenomenon he studies—is legible early through the “missing return” and tightens steadily as the arrowhead heats, the phone speaks, and his body becomes translucent. The key pressure point is Maren’s “Let it go” versus his refusal, which functions as a real narrowing of options with ontological cost. Escalation is more internal and conceptual than action-driven, but it coheres under that lens and does not stall. A slightly clearer early articulation of what Elias fears losing (beyond generic selfhood) would heighten the felt cost of his final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.6)
    The core stake—maintaining the orchard versus Liora’s own freedom and the possibility of reanimating a dead world—is clear and present from early on. Escalation tracks: statue movement, the locust’s revelation, her decision to weaponize the music, the flight, and the leap into the harsher world all successively narrow safe options. The visible cost is credible but mostly conceptual: the orchard is likely doomed and the statues will pursue, yet we don’t viscerally feel loss in the moment beyond stated danger. Internal conflict could be tested a bit harder before she abandons her long-held duty.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stakes are mostly emotional and existential (erasure, abandonment, and the risk inherent in smuggling), and they’re signaled clearly but remain abstract on the page. The introduction of the drone patrols, the need to avoid them, and the observatory blind spot suggests real danger, yet no on-page confrontation or near-miss forces a concrete trade-off. The one tightening beat—Mira announcing the drop and activating the jammer—deepens mood more than it narrows options. Without a specific risked loss or pressured choice at the observatory itself, escalation feels under-realized.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.2)
    Conflict is largely internal and gentle: Elias’s quiet persistence meeting the dead circus’s latent magic, with no real resistance or jeopardy. The singing and halo placement function as escalations, but they don’t foreclose alternatives or demand sacrifice; each step just yields more wonder. Stakes are mostly existential/aesthetic (can this lost world live again?), yet the narrative never sharpens what he might lose by engaging, or what “home” costs him. As a result, tension is pleasant but muted.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.5)
    The primary stake—Elias’s search for the realm where stories live and the woman’s tether back—is clear but faces almost no resistance. Once he dons the scarf, reality obligingly reshapes; the threshold appears, the door opens, and the void poses no discernible danger or dilemma. The reunion and return are likewise untroubled, so escalation reads more as a graceful unfolding of wonder than as pressure that forces a trade-off. As a result, the ending, while pretty, lacks bite or a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s need to capture and reach the dream-presence—remains clear and drives his actions. There is escalation in method and intimacy (from dreams to painting light to photography to physical travel), but little real resistance or reversal; each new tactic works once he commits to it. Internal conflict (fear of leaving his life vs. longing) is more assumed than dramatized in specific pressured moments. As a result, tension is gentle and meditative rather than gripping, which limits the stakes’ felt sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the dangerous communal idea will be freed from fear—is clear and thematically rich. Yet the locksmith encounters no real resistance: the ritual proceeds smoothly, and his hesitation never rises to an agonizing choice. The village’s potential upheaval is gestured at but not directly pressed against him or Elara in scene, so escalation feels conceptual rather than lived. As a result, the piece reads more like a graceful unlocking of an already-made decision than a tightening conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—recovering both memory and, implicitly, Liora—is clear from early reflection and sharpened by the revelation of her abduction. Pressure escalates through the increasing intensity of the hum, the sensory flood of recovered memories, and the portal’s brief opening. However, Elias’s on-page agency is limited mainly to choosing to return, touch the earth, and reach; the crucial reversal (portal snapping shut) is largely imposed by the fairy ring and environment. The emotional cost is sharply felt, but the conflict could reach higher if more of the climax hinged on a difficult choice rather than pure bad timing.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.4)
    The core conflict—whether Elara will risk mentoring again despite past failure—is coherent and present from early reflection through her interactions with Mira. Pressure escalates modestly: Mira’s presence, the backward-walking lesson, and questions about the shadow and tea leaves progressively push Elara to articulate and then enact her philosophy. However, the stakes stay mostly interior and never quite sharpen into a moment where refusing Mira feels like a live, dangerous option; conflict remains gentle rather than truly testing her limits. The final choice carries cost, but the path there is relatively smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—saving the last heirloom seed and the “color of wonder”—is clearly signaled. There is some escalation as the ground trembles, the shoot explodes upward, and the echoes of the travelers appear, deepening what’s at stake conceptually. However, the conflict is almost entirely one-sided ritual rather than contested; nothing meaningfully resists Maren’s efforts, and no path is meaningfully foreclosed. As a result, tension feels muted and the resolution, while pretty, comes with little sense of risk or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—freeing the spirits versus respecting the dangerous containment of the mask—is legible early and tightens via the knot-unraveling sequence and the mask’s pulsing agitation. Each knot release adds a concrete beat of escalation (voices freed, silence deepening), and the Fisher King’s arrival reframes Elias’s goal as potentially catastrophic. Elias’s final act is a genuine, self-chosen escalation that forecloses the safer path of obedience. The on-page price is more conceptual than visceral, but the story clearly narrows options and raises risk toward the end.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—piercing a silence around vanished children and a forbidden place—is clear, but on-page resistance is minimal. The main tightening is Elias deciding to reopen the chapel despite communal silence; once he commits, the door yields without much struggle and the exploration proceeds smoothly. Internal and external pressures don’t significantly escalate or force a painful trade-off; cost is mostly implied future danger or emotional burden. As a result, tension is sustained but never truly bites.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake is conceptual and situational—whether to activate a dangerous, untested temporal mechanism and end the *Marigold*’s suspended state—and this is signaled once Liora appears and names the globe as the “last transmission.” Pressure coherently escalates from quiet exploration to the eerie intrusion of the past and the implicit risk of using the key. However, the emotional and practical costs of each option (keep, study, or break the globe) are underdeveloped, so the climax reads as graceful and inevitable rather than a hard trade-off. The conflict is more contemplative than tense, but it does resolve through his agency in a way that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—whether the ghost can articulate her need to be remembered and be answered—is clear and tightens as graffiti shifts and the storm approaches. Elias’s decision to engage, to interpret, and finally to offer the bolt plate constitutes meaningful agency. However, there is little real resistance or risk; once he understands, the path to success is fairly smooth and uncontested. The escalation is more a graceful swell than a test of commitment, which slightly blunts tension despite the satisfying peak.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Lira will honor or violate the captain’s private grief—is clear and coherently pressured from the moment the diary appears. Tension escalates from curiosity about the diary to the emotional shock of the sketches, then to the captain’s arrival and the forced ethical choice. The final choice to step back and leave the diary/goggles has a real, if quiet, price. The confrontation itself is relatively gentle and could bear sharper pressure or a more concrete risk to Lira’s status.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias continues to observe/memorialize from a distance or surrenders himself to the sky—is clear, and the Astraea’s appearance is a meaningful tightening that forces a new stance. Internal and external pressures cohere: grief, guilt, and the accusatory “memory” of the sky converge on the choice to jump. The cost (implicitly his life) is unmistakable and scaled appropriately to the length. Escalation is primarily internal and textural rather than driven by multiple turns, but the single decisive deepening is solid.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Liora will claim this impossible depiction of the sky or renounce it—emerges, but escalation is subtle and largely internal. The search itself is frictionless: the coin works as expected, the safe opens without complication, and no serious obstacles or reversals test her resolve. The only tightening is the moral realization that possessing the sketch would be a kind of violation, which is compelling but arrives smoothly rather than under palpable pressure. As a result, tension is present but relatively low-grade for a piece aiming at elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s desire to make a discovery and earn his sigil—is legible, but conflict remains largely soft and intellectual. The main escalation is his choice to investigate the hopscotch board and then to show his findings to Orlan, but these actions meet no real resistance and incur no palpable risk. The resolution (the ship following a new wind) is essentially a reward without a tested cost or narrowed options. As a result, tension feels pleasantly curious rather than truly pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—learning how to mend what is broken, potentially at the scale of the world’s mechanisms—is intriguing but stays abstract on the page. Pressure escalates only mildly: overcoming avoidance of the hall, then assembling gears until they “begin to turn,” without real risk of failure or visible consequence. There’s no meaningful trade-off or foreclosed path; success arrives almost as soon as he listens. The conflict is conceptually rich but dramatically undercooked for high-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the orchard and thus the community’s home will revive—is clear, as is Liora’s stake in orchestrating collective change before she fades. There is a meaningful deepening when the messages shift from cryptic kindness to concrete instructions about arches and nebula, prompting experiments that reconfigure behavior. However, opposition is soft: villagers are briefly skeptical but quickly cooperative; no choice feels genuinely risky or contested, and almost nothing is lost besides Liora herself. The emotional cost at the end is real but the escalation path is relatively low-friction, which keeps the conflict from feeling fully tested.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—how to meet the end of time: endlessly postponing it or allowing a charged, possibly final moment—emerges clearly and tightens as the “final ripple of time” arrives and the doomsday clock ticks once, then stops. Elias’s decision to stop turning the hands back and instead vouchsafe his secret through the pane is a meaningful escalation that trades control for uncertain solace. The conflict remains more contemplative than visceral, with little on-page resistance, which softens but does not erase the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—saving at least one traveler to satisfy the curse’s demand for balance—is established and returns concretely when the screaming man appears. Pressure escalates with the time limit and the birds’ attack, and Mira’s chosen method (indirect guidance) is a real, if low-risk, decision under that pressure. However, the on-page cost at the climax is mostly conceptual and long-term; in the moment, her choice doesn’t visibly endanger her or force a sharp trade-off. The conflict is coherent and tense, but not yet cutting enough for the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Lina will remain walled-off or choose a new, more flexible way of relating to work and people—is clear early via “atone” and her estrangement from Mara. Pressure deepens when the foam patterns crystallize her misalignment between engineered permanence and nature’s impermanence, forcing a reevaluation. The escalation is primarily conceptual and emotional; there’s little sense of external risk or sacrifice beyond pride and grief. The decision to return to the lab with a new philosophy functions as a gentle but credible narrowing of path rather than a sharp trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s quest to locate the origin of stories / his own ontological grounding—is clear but remains largely internal and contemplative. The arrival of the first customer and the uncorking of the moonlight constitute the main tightening, but Elias is more witness than active decision-maker at the crucial moment of transformation. The cost of losing the bottled moonlight is conceptually strong yet dramatized as a quiet acceptance rather than a pressured trade-off. Overall conflict is atmospheric and interesting, but escalation never quite feels urgent or constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—whether Kael remains entombed in grief or chooses to leave—is clearly established and escalates through the dangerous intimacy of touch. Maren’s willingness to expose herself to his contagious sorrow is the key tightening beat that raises cost. The resolution (walking out together) is earned and forecloses his previous path of self-burial, though the shift happens smoothly rather than under acute resistance. The tension is more emotional than dramatic, but it holds and deepens.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—turning isolated workers’ loneliness into communal connection—is legible, but on-page conflict is minimal. Posters work immediately; townspeople arrive without reluctance; the first gathering succeeds on cue and “weeks passed” confirms ongoing harmony without serious challenge. There’s a gentle escalation from solitary preparation to communal singing, yet no real narrowing of options or hard trade-offs. As a result, the piece reads more like a graceful vision than a pressured story.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Lena will attempt to rewrite the past or accept brokenness as integral—is established and deepened through the vision of the prior owner and the voiced injunction, “You don’t have to fix it.” The meaningful tightening comes when the mirror offers a concrete origin-memory and she realizes that “to erase them would be to erase the woman entirely,” forcing a moral choice. The price is internal and conceptual (relinquishing her new ambition to modify), which suits the length but keeps the tension relatively low-key. There’s little external or temporal pressure, so escalation is more contemplative intensification than real narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—uncovering and assuming stewardship of “forgotten combinations”—is clear but remains abstract and largely unthreatened. Threshold effects and the eerie chamber do intensify the mood, yet there is no true antagonist or dilemma, and Elara’s success never feels in doubt. The “hour” and the grotto’s instability imply danger, but they don’t force a hard trade-off or sacrifice on the page, keeping tension modest.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—can Elias coax any music from a broken relic in a silent world—is clear, and there is a modest escalation as he moves from touch to thumb-strum to knuckle-strike and then to pattern analysis. However, the opposition (silence, age, damage) never feels truly threatening or capable of meaningful failure; the experiment works on the first attempt with only minor adjustment. The result is a lovely mood piece with gentle tension rather than a story with sharply escalating pressure or visible trade-offs. The ending feels more like a quiet unfolding than a choice under genuine duress.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can decipher the eclipsed covenant and thus find meaning in his exile—is legible but remains abstract. Pressure modestly increases as twilight deepens and the stones begin to glow, but there is no clear consequence for failure or real resistance to success. The revelation arrives smoothly once Lysara hums and Elias correlates symbols; no meaningful option is foreclosed, and no visible price is paid. As a result, the story reads as contemplative discovery rather than genuine conflict with escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—unlocking the diary to recover the truth of Liora’s disappearance and, implicitly, their relationship—is clear from early on. Escalation is primarily textural (silence vs impending fireworks) rather than driven by harder and riskier choices, and the external problem is solved quickly once Liora appears with the tuning fork. Elias’s internal conflict (hurt vs empathy) never truly forces a trade-off or visibly costly decision, which keeps the emotional pressure modest. The story feels more like a poised reunion vignette than a conflict that tightens into an unavoidable price.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.5)
    The central tension—Mira’s drive to cultivate the corpse flower versus warnings from elders and her grandmother’s failed attempt—is clear, but it never tightens into a genuine dilemma. Nara’s arrival and the journal revelation are the one meaningful deepening, shifting the frame from “dangerous experiment” to “slow, contemplative project.” Yet Mira doesn’t have to sacrifice anything now; she keeps the seed and gains wisdom, with no immediate price or real narrowing of options. As a result, stakes remain largely conceptual and the conflict feels resolved without much abrasion.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—reach the source of resilience before inversion—is clearly signaled, and there is a meaningful deepening when Lira finds the anomalous grove and hears the echoes. However, pressure never tightens into a real dilemma: the inversion clock is invoked but doesn’t force a hard choice or sacrifice, and Lira largely receives insight rather than wrestles for it. The climax during inversion has beautiful imagery but low friction, leaving conflict effective but not fully exploited.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—understanding what happened before it kills or assimilates him, and escaping to warn others—is clear and sharpened by the realization that the city is “rapidly adapting.” Pressure escalates convincingly as the environment shifts from uncanny to actively antagonistic, culminating in the labyrinth reconfiguring as he runs. However, his agency is somewhat limited to investigate-then-run, with few concrete tactical choices or trade-offs on the page. The cost (being trapped, outpaced by a learning system) is conceptually strong but not deeply personalized beyond that final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—whether she can release the amber sheet’s music before the sculptor’s work destroys the necessary hush—is legible from early on. Escalation comes via repeated chisel strikes corrupting each emerging note, which tightens pressure and tests her resolve. However, the conflict never feels truly in doubt, and the resolution (one final pure bell, aurora flares, chisel falls silent) sidesteps any significant trade-off or lingering consequence. The interplay of internal commitment and external interruption is effective but could benefit from a sharper price or more difficult choice at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding and mending the torn boundary—is clearly stated, and there is a meaningful deepening when the figure reveals the boundary is a thread to weave rather than a wall to seal. However, pressure on Elias remains mostly conceptual; he faces little resistance once he arrives at the cavern and again once in the other world. The solution (play a melody to weave) works on the first attempt without visible risk, failure, or sacrifice, so escalation feels more like a guided revelation than a truly testing conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—can Elias quantify/employ emotion without destroying himself or the cosmos’ memory—is present but largely implicit, and pressure builds mainly via intensifying phenomena (louder hum, glowing ink, visitor, last star) rather than explicit dilemmas. The clearest turning point is when he weaponizes the woman’s voice and the workshop shudders, but this doesn’t lead to a sharply framed choice so much as an unavoidable unraveling. As a result, tension feels more like an inexorable slide into a prefigured outcome than a contest of competing values. The cost is real, yet the lack of clear agency undercuts the sense of hard-earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is existential—whether she remains a routine courier or accepts a role as threshold-crosser—which is signaled but never forced into a concrete dilemma. The encounter with the stranger is the primary tightening, deepening her knowledge of the pendant rather than narrowing external options. Her agency is mostly internal attention and acceptance; she doesn’t visibly sacrifice or risk much on the page. The result is thematically coherent but low in felt jeopardy or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central conflict—Elias’s need for proof vs the elusive, transformed nature of emotional residue—is clear but remains largely internal and contemplative. There is a meaningful deepening when he accesses the earlier man’s grief and realizes the quartz transforms rather than stores sorrow. However, pressure doesn’t significantly escalate; there’s little sense of a path being foreclosed or a choice carrying real risk. The resolution, while thematically apt, feels more like acquiescent understanding than a hard-won stance under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will succumb to raveling silence or re-enter the world’s demands—is clear and sharpened at the forest edge, where she must choose to leave the orchard to almost certainly forget her. Yet once she decides, external pressure is light: the “impossible distance” and “last light” function more as poetic abstractions than as sources of concrete jeopardy or reversals. Her main act of agency is the initial recommencement and eventual offering of the bead to Kael’s skeleton, which yields an internal resolution rather than an escalated conflict. The emotional conflict works, but the lack of tangible obstacles or losses along the journey keeps the pressure modest.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.8)
    The core stake (orchards dying vs. Elias’s attempt to save them) is clearly established and his decision to enter the mine with the silk is an earned tightening of pressure. Working through the night in a groaning, shifting mine suggests danger, and his stamina and focus are tested. Yet the conflict remains mostly one-sided: there are no real setbacks, reversals, or forced trade-offs once he begins; the silk cooperates, the fissure seals, and no alternative path is seriously considered. This keeps the piece from a stronger sense of jeopardy or cost at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—whether to uncover a crushing, multiversal truth or preserve ignorance—is stated clearly and sharpened by the arrival of the scarred Kael and the shard-console activation. There is one solid escalation beat when the other Kael physically forces the shard to the console, spiking the scanner and revealing the monument image. Still, the conflict remains largely conceptual; we don’t see concrete consequences or sacrifices tied to either option, and the protagonist’s agency at the end is muted by the off-page decision. That keeps the pressure from feeling fully tightened or costly.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias remains sealed in solitary ritual or opens to a living, ongoing chain of caretakers—is clear from early on and tightens as the stones elicit a response. The escalation is internal but distinct: discovery of deliberate signaling, the act of replying, the uncanny reciprocation, and then the choice to light the lamp and leave his talisman behind. That final renunciation carries a visible cost given how the glass has been framed. The conflict remains largely contemplative, so tension is present but quiet rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Veyra will use the lighthouse to midwife a future city—is clear but never sharply endangered. Pressure does increase slightly when the city appears and the ink-fingered woman looks back, culminating in the “We are ready” moment and Veyra’s mirrored gesture. However, there’s no serious threat, no real possibility of refusal, and no visible trade-off beyond an implied lifelong commitment to her role. As a result, the tension remains lyrical and conceptual rather than truly escalating under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—his need to understand why some lives and stories “glow”—is present from early on and does meaningfully tighten with the arrival of the traveler and her map. The key deepening is the recognition that her map’s story-gathering sites match his sun trails, culminating in the map’s shimmer and his reframed understanding. However, pressure remains mostly gentle and introspective, with little sense of a real alternative path or foreclosed option beyond continued not-knowing. The lack of a stronger felt price or explicit trade-off keeps tension from fully matching the sophistication of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is Elias’s relationship to the tower and the burden of accumulated sorrow, but pressure remains mostly atmospheric rather than sharply escalating. The pin’s click and the idea the tower is “hungry” suggest danger that never concretizes into a choice with visible risk. The meaningful “turn” is conceptual—reframing the tower and sorrow via the transformed sextant—rather than a hard trade-off. The piece sustains tension in tone, yet lacks a moment where a clear alternative path is foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—rekindling dawn for a dying realm—is stated early and threads through to the end, but on-page pressure remains gentle. Each step (finding the keeper, receiving the seed, planting, singing) succeeds without serious obstruction or reversal, so options never feel sharply narrowed. Elara’s doubt about remembering the songs is the closest thing to tightening, yet it’s immediately soothed by reassurance rather than tested. The result is emotionally pleasing but low-tension, more ritual fulfillment than escalating conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.2)
    The primary conflict—whether to maintain safe, rule-bound custodianship or risk action to address a past moral failure—is clear and coherent. Tension escalates in a measured way through the invitation’s provocation, the recalled woman, the paradox shelves, and the literal ticking toward midnight. Still, opposition is almost entirely internal, with minimal sense of concrete consequences from the society, the city, or the woman herself, which keeps the stakes a bit abstract. The final choice is earned but doesn’t feel as pressured or costly as it could in a piece aiming for elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s search for a response to erasure and the burden of unnoticed loss—is clear but remains relatively abstract and inward. Conflict is gentle: his skepticism (“That’s not absolution. That’s just… gardening.”) offers a brief, mild counterpressure before he fairly quickly assents to the woman’s frame. The escalation from noticing the missing bakery to planting seeds is thematically apt, yet there’s little genuine risk, dilemma, or sacrifice dramatized around the final act. As a result the story reads more as contemplative vignette than pressured scene.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether memory can be preserved against oblivion—is legible early and narrows toward the specific crisis of the fading illusion (“The image steadied, but the voice was weaker”). There is one meaningful tightening when the projection begins to fail and Elias must adjust the frequencies, which earns his closing resolve. However, the conflict remains largely internal and conceptual; there’s little sense of what failure would concretely cost him beyond regret. The tension is gently accumulating rather than sharply escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—preserving the hush and preventing a deal from exploding into violence—is clear and activated when the knife appears. Pressure escalates appropriately from watchful waiting to life-or-death confrontation. However, resolution comes a bit too easily: a short speech and the invocation of her father’s reputation de-escalate the situation with no real loss, injury, or burned bridge. The internal conflict between letting the betrayal expose itself and intervening is conceptually rich but under-exploited as a true, costly trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake is epistemic—will Elara understand what she and her grandfather are—and that is signaled early via her anomalies and skepticism. Pressure, however, remains low: the ring’s pull is never resisted, the man is non-threatening, and there are no competing goods or real risks to her following him. The main escalation is informational (learning about weather-carriers and the emergent compass), not a tightening of options or a trade-off. As a result, the story reads more as a graceful reveal than as conflict with felt consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant pressure is Elias’s compulsion to answer the laughter and rectify the broken lock, which does escalate through the dream and the discovery of the real door. However, there is little genuine resistance or risk: he never seriously considers not obeying the call, and no concrete danger or loss is foregrounded. As a result, the stakes feel more mystical than sharply dramatized, and the final act doesn’t clearly foreclose an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—uncovering a buried truth about lost conversations and Liora’s missing memory—remains mostly conceptual, with the on-page pressure operating as a puzzle-solving sequence. There is a clear tightening when the half-reassembled map reveals the Echo Vault and again when the “last bloom” clue forces her toward the archives, culminating in the discovery of the secret stair. However, Liora encounters minimal resistance (internal, environmental, or interpersonal), and no live option is meaningfully foreclosed or paid for yet. As a result, tension is present but not especially sharp or costly.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—preserving wonder/colors in an un-speaking world—is clear and the need for a new “source” (first iceberg, then toy orb) gives the middle some forward motion. However, opposition is mostly ambient (winter, fading color) rather than actively resisting, so pressure escalates gently rather than acutely. The act of taking and breaking the child’s toy could have been a sharper moral or emotional hinge, but it’s treated more as resource acquisition than fraught theft. As a result, the final note has poignancy but limited sense of paid price.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—whether Eli maintains the status quo of containment or risks destruction for inner quiet—comes through and tightens toward the box-burning decision. The escalation from background instability to alarms, fire, and cracking glass is clear and does raise pressure. However, external consequences (damage to the dome, potential loss of the farm) feel emotionally under-leveraged; Eli’s serenity flattens what could be a sharper sense of price. The conflict is strong but remains primarily internal and somewhat cushioned.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the locket/mailbox mystery resolves into some emotional truth—is clear but remains low-pressure throughout. Elara encounters no real opposition; her “investigation” unfolds smoothly, and the tension of whether Clara will appear is mild and foregone once the mailbox clicks. The dawn scene with Clara offers a touching emotional beat, yet it arrives without escalation or a real cost, more as fulfillment than as the endpoint of tested conflict. Overall, conflict is present but flat, with no meaningful foreclosed option or hard trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.2)
    Conflict is primarily internal and situational: Elara’s relationship to encoded vs. raw truth and the time-pressure of a failing lab, with Kael’s dance as a nonverbal demand to act. Escalation is evident—the dice go from uncanny relic to guiding key; water moves from background to active intrusion; the coordinates revelation tightens options. However, Elara rarely entertains not following the path, so the choice to open the hatch feels confident rather than contested, muting the sense of sacrifice or risk. Stakes are conceptually high (truth, “final experiment”) but could be made more viscerally costly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Marlowe will confront the source of the distortions and the possibility his sister still “echoes” there—is clear and ties internal grief to external strangeness. Pressure escalates through the recurring spiral motif, the journal’s revelations, and the literal intensification of gravity in the chamber. The main tightening comes when the journal reframes the “carcass” as a vessel and memories as echoes, forcing a decision to seek or continue suppressing. The choice is resolved in favor of pursuit, but the on-page cost (risk, potential shattering of denial) is more implied than sharply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether he clings to or releases a defining prophecy—is clear, but pressure remains low and mostly internal. Escalation is gentle: unfolding the wing, pressing it into water, and watching the ink dissolve mark a deepening rather than a tightening crisis. His agency at the end (choosing not to look back, accepting solitude as choice) earns resolution, yet there is little sense of a live alternative path being urgently foreclosed. The conflict reads as contemplative realignment rather than a genuine test of competing impulses.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central pressure—whether to maintain the comforting lie and private mourning or embrace the heavier truth of shared legacy—is coherent but gentle. The main tightening comes when Mira recognizes the seal and must choose whether to reveal her connection, which she does with little resistance. Stakes remain mostly emotional and conceptual, and while that’s fine, the trade-off and cost (risk to intimacy, responsibility of the legacy) are underplayed on the page. The scene reads as a well-crafted reveal and alignment rather than a genuine test of competing priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will continue to live in self-protective isolation or join/restore his sister’s archived presence—is legible and resolves clearly. There is a meaningful tightening when the hum in the air escalates to Liora’s appearance and the revelation of the true nature of the quarantine, forcing a stance. Yet most pressure is internal and remains fairly soft; external stakes (state power, weaponized memories) are gestured at but never bite concretely into the scene. The final choice carries implied risk and loss but could use one sharper on-page cost to deepen tension.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Lian will continue living under falsified history or expose the truth (and at what personal cost)—is evident and tightened when Vey arrives and confronts her. The key escalation is Lian choosing to activate the key/thorn mechanism in front of the man who killed her father, shifting from private resistance to open revelation. Yet the external danger feels oddly low: Vey does not meaningfully counter, threaten, or adapt once the scroll appears, so her risk reads more theoretical than viscerally pressured in the moment. Internal conflict between revenge and release is thematically asserted but could be more sharply contested through an on-page temptation to destroy him.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stakes—whether Liora will engage with the fractured voices and take on the risk of calling them back—are legible but play out at a gentle, contemplative register. Escalation exists (the hum intensifies, the shell whispers, Veyan appears with the missing half), yet the pressure never quite forces a sharp, costly dilemma; the nod to help feels almost inevitable rather than hard-won. As a result, conflict is coherent but subdued, more conceptual than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—whether Mara will use this window to drag buried truth into the open or respect the dead’s wish for silence—is clear and sharpened by the reveal that the red-coated woman is a saboteur, not a victim. There is one strong deepening turn when the investigation reframes the quartermaster and the ship’s sinking as deliberate harm, reweighting Mara’s ethical calculus. However, much of the conflict is off-page and reflective; interviews and dream-gathering are summarized, so escalation feels more intellectual than immediate. The final choice to “never tell” is a real foreclosure but lacks a concrete, external test in the scene itself.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake is emotional: whether Ren remains a solitary observer or risks connection with Mei, but the pressure on that decision remains very gentle throughout. The whistle and Mei’s arrival introduce a soft external disruption, and the sketch offers an interior deepening, yet neither is framed as a hard test that forecloses alternatives. His final “Stay” does constitute an agency moment, but it comes without visible struggle or meaningful trade-off beyond implied vulnerability. The escalation feels more like a smooth glide than a tightening, which is coherent for the piece’s mode but keeps stakes modest.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—the uncovering of a truth the government has violently buried—is established, and the letters plus the stranger’s arrival offer at least one turn in pressure. Yet the conflict remains mostly conceptual; on-page danger is implied (radiation, “they will come for it”) but never tests Elias directly. The stranger’s quick declaration of alliance dissipates the only interpersonal tension just as it appears, and Elias never faces a hard trade-off or visible loss in the scene. As a result, escalation feels more like steady revelation than tightening conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central conflict—who will lead the “new dawn” and by what authority—is clear and set up early through Elias vs. Kael. Pressure does escalate from private listening to public confrontation, and Elias’s decision to act is a meaningful turn. Yet the on-page struggle is undercut by how readily the crowd and Kael yield to a single visionary display, with no meaningful pushback, sacrifice, or real chance of failure. As a result, stakes feel more conceptual than viscerally contested in the crucial scene.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can transmute his obscurity and failure into a meaningful role—is clear but kept at a low simmer. There is one genuine tightening when the jars finally capture the melody, and another when the girl arrives and tests what he’s done, but neither is framed as a hard trade-off or high-risk decision. The story resolves by reinterpreting his life rather than confronting him with a moment where he might lose this new purpose. As a result, conflict feels more contemplative than pressured, effective but not especially tense.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.3)
    The central stake—whether the key becomes mercy or weapon, and whether Elias can survive contact with it—is established early and tightened effectively by the scavenger’s interference and the unstable ice. The key escalation beats (the humming marina, the scavenger’s harmony attempt, the lighthouse overdrive, the ice breaking) progressively narrow options. The moral/psychic risk (shattering under guilt) is clear, though the physical jeopardy could be palpably sharpened at the moment he hangs off the dock. Elias’s decision to touch the key despite that risk is a credible and consequential closure move.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—how to relate to a “patient revolution”—is present but remains abstract, with little sense of real jeopardy or trade-off. The only clear tightening is the viaduct’s deepening hum leading to the stranger’s arrival, after which Elias’s agreement is immediate and untroubled. Internal and external tensions (solitude vs. engagement, safety vs. joining a movement) are gestured at but not truly tested in scene. As a result, pressure grows in atmosphere more than in concrete risk or narrowed options.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—exposing/preventing engineered “accidents” that could devastate the city—is clear, and pressure escalates from personal escape to systemic conspiracy. However, much of the escalation is verbal, delivered via Voss’s speech, rather than dramatized resistance or risk; Elias’s personal jeopardy in the scene never quite tightens beyond “might be seen.” His key act—sending evidence—carries implied danger but no immediate on-page cost or forced trade-off, so the climax feels like a setup for a thriller rather than a fully stressed turning point. Internal and external conflicts do interweave, but without a hard choice that visibly forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will accept his complicity and act to redress it—is clear early and tightens once Kael confirms the heart’s post-mortem use. Conflict is primarily internal and ethical, with Kael as a light external pressure through questions like “What will you do now?”. The escalation from doubt to confirmation to decision is convincing but lacks a palpable external obstacle or trade-off beyond psychological cost. The final choice (“I need your help… To prove it.”) resolves cleanly, though the on-page struggle to reach it is relatively smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—ring the impossible bell before the dying workshop and acid sea foreclose the chance—is clear and escalates via the rising fumes and failing gears. Elias’s agency drives the climax: he finishes the bell and chooses to ring it despite Veyra’s skepticism and the workshop’s imminent demise. However, the pressure never quite crystallizes into a sharp trade-off or visible loss; there’s no moment where he must sacrifice something specific to act. The result is tense and engaging but stops short of a truly knife-edged, high-cost decision.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—uncovering a system that erases people from existence—is clear and high-concept, and it intensifies once Elias’s video reframes Nexis as an active threat. Most of the conflict is investigative and informational rather than interactive; opposition is entirely offstage, so tension sits more in what she learns than in what she risks moment to moment. The main tightening is the revelation of Project Echo and her realization of personal danger, followed by the choice to copy the video. That choice does narrow her options, but the price is only implied, not concretely pressed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—save the village from the ice-born creature—is legible early via the seer’s warning and mirrors, and tension escalates from eerie atmosphere to active attack. Elias’s agency drives the main turns (choosing to use the mirrors, to run the orchard path, to throw the fragment) and there is at least one meaningful tightening as the monster breaches. However, the conflict is somewhat straightforward hero-versus-monster; there is little sense of real sacrifice or loss beyond risking himself and destroying the fragment. The stakes are clear and functional but not yet complex or harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s relationship to death and whether he remains a detached tourist—emerges early and tightens as he moves from signing up to trawl, to seeking the tents, to witnessing a death up close. The key escalation is his unbidden act of giving the parasol tip and then, later, agreeing to stay and help, which forecloses the path of pure spectatorship. Stakes stay mostly internal and existential, with little external obstruction, so the pressure is more atmospheric than confrontational. That quietness is coherent with the piece’s mode but keeps escalation from feeling truly acute.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.8)
    The core stake—whether Liora will reopen herself to a man who hurt her—is clear from the outset and emotionally real. Pressure escalates somewhat when Elias arrives and she confronts him with the burned letter, forcing explicit acknowledgment of past harm. However, his contrition is immediate and unchallenged, so her shift from guarded anger to physical closeness encounters little resistance or reversal. The sense of cost and risk is present but underdeveloped relative to the setup’s gravity.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—what kind of wisdom will be preserved and how—is present but stays abstract rather than biting. Pressure escalates modestly: the prophet’s arrival, the challenge (“you must decide what to preserve”), and the conjured clearing deepen the moment. However, there is no real price or foreclosed option dramatized beyond accepting responsibility; nothing in the scene tests his honesty or forces a visible trade-off. The result is a thoughtful but relatively low-tension conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s need to make meaning and foster “collective healing” through his arrangement—is almost entirely internal and low-pressure, with no countervailing demand or risk of failure. The only discernible “tightening” is the addition of the new photograph as a focal point, but it doesn’t foreclose any option or force a trade-off; it merely completes an already unopposed intention. There is no external antagonist or internal resistance strong enough to create genuine tension, and the dove’s appearance is a gentle grace note rather than a pressure point. As a result, the story reads as a graceful meditation more than a conflict-driven narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—unlocking the crystal’s pattern of growth—is clear but fairly cerebral, with limited felt risk or consequence if he fails. Escalation exists in a gentle curve: word → louder word → humming levitation → mind-listening and final pattern recognition, so tension does increase, but never to a sense of risk, loss, or hard trade-off. His agency is constant but he is never forced to sacrifice anything or choose between competing goods. As a result the ending reads as an interesting discovery rather than a pressured, costly turn.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.7)
    The dominant stake—whether he can meaningfully apprehend and retain the truth about aging and his own future—is clear and threaded throughout. Pressure escalates modestly but effectively: from vague searching, to the sign he’s been waiting for (driftwood), to the conditional offer of the tape, to confronting his younger self’s warning. The woman’s “First, you have to finish” creating a contingent access to the tape is the clearest tightening, forcing him to complete the spiral before gaining knowledge. The conflict remains interior and conceptual, so the sense of price is more abstract than visceral, keeping this shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—capturing and preserving the impossible phenomenon before the station fails—is clearly signaled and sustains a gentle but real pressure. Escalation is present through the increasingly violent shaking and failing stabilizers, culminating in the observatory’s destruction and his pod ejection. However, the pressure rarely forces a painful trade-off; he completes the experiment, gets the photograph, and then leaves once that goal is safely achieved, so no option feels truly foreclosed at a cost he actively weighs. The conflict thus feels elegant but somewhat under-tested for this level of ambition.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—Lena’s need for a “flawless goodbye” and Elias’s choice to honor it—is clear from early on and coherently pursued. Pressure escalates quietly from arrival to singing to accepting the vinyl charge, narrowing his options to presence and promise rather than action that might save her. The emotional cost is visible in his bodily reactions and in the framing of broken music as what remains after loss. The main limitation is that he never faces a true on-page dilemma or reversal; his path, while moving, is almost entirely aligned with his desire.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—understanding where shadows go and what’s sealed beneath the isle—is signaled early and followed through. Yet escalation is relatively gentle: nothing meaningfully pushes back against Liora, and releasing the shadows carries no articulated danger or trade-off on the page. The guardian offers guidance rather than opposition, and the key works without complication. As a result, the decisive act of “closing the loop” feels more like completing a puzzle than a pressured choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—finding and/or reckoning with the real child/changeling, and setting the town’s “wound”—is clear and thematically apt. There is one meaningful deepening when the ritual produces a map and Lena must choose to follow it to the center. But opposition is almost entirely absent: the garden is cooperative, the maze unfolds easily, and Lena faces minimal risk, pushback, or moral dilemma beyond a generalized atmosphere of fear and secrecy. As a result, escalation feels more like a graceful unveiling than a tightening of pressure with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Liora can find a way to share light without repeating past harm—is clear, and the village’s darkness adds a quiet external pressure. There is one main tightening beat when she enters the water and advances toward the grotto’s heart, but the search and acquisition are almost frictionless. No real obstacle, moral dilemma, or risk complicates touching or taking the pearl, which diminishes suspense. The resolution reads more as a granted boon than something strained for and nearly lost, lowering the perceived cost of success.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether these siblings can move from viralized blame and silence toward a more honest, mutual tending of grief—is clear and present early. Pressure tightens intelligently when Mira has both his pendant and his surveillance notebook in hand, forcing a confrontation that could tip into rupture or understanding. The resolution is earned through their choice to share the object and space, but resistance is low: no sharp pushback, no substantial risk of failure once they share the scene. The conflict remains interior and gentle, effective but somewhat under‑pressurized for truly top-tier stakes work.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—how Elias will relate to hope and his unfinished novel—is clear, and tension builds through progressively more personal apparitions, culminating in his own protagonist confronting him. Escalation exists but remains muted: the river’s insistence and the protagonist’s accusation deepen pressure, yet Elias is never forced into a wrenching trade-off. His final act of turning back, reinterpreting his task, is a coherent resolution, but the visible price (what he loses by not clinging, by leaving the nexus) is largely conceptual. As a result, conflict is resonant but not sharply acute.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether the old, sacred reciprocity between people and land will be reawakened—is clear but lightly pressured. Once Liora chooses to sing, the magic responds with no resistance or complication, and villagers’ disbelief remains entirely anticipatory. Escalation is mostly a tonal intensification (hush, light, warmth) rather than a tightening of options or visible tradeoff. The result is lovely but low-conflict; nothing significant is truly at risk of being lost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—can he truly “seal” this pause rather than consume it—is clear, but the pressure is gentle and largely uncontested. Escalation occurs more as a deepening: from arranging objects, to tracing space around the plate, to igniting the folded jar, with no real risk of failure or meaningful alternative path. His final stance shift feels earned but not hard-won. The lack of external resistance or internal push-pull at the moment of ignition keeps the conflict from fully sharpening.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can make sense of and harness the “harvest of echoes”—is clear but mostly conceptual. There is escalation (from static study to forcing the mechanism, to apparition, to realization), yet the pressure remains gentle, with no strong alternative path or risk pressed on the page. His agency largely consists of persistence and attention rather than a difficult trade-off. As a result, the piece reads as a contemplative discovery rather than a truly pressurized conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Liora can manifest and comprehend her burdens without being claimed by the grotto—is well signaled and carries through the ritual. Escalation is primarily internal and textural, via increasingly complex and painful burdens (bone splinter, river stone, thorn tangle) and the deepening hush. Her agency is consistent (choosing to continue, accepting each new weight), but there’s no sharp turn where an option is truly foreclosed or she nearly fails. As a result, the tension is more meditative pressure than genuine crisis, effective but not maximized.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will continue to merely orbit her grief or engage it through making—is legible early and tightened when she finally picks up the knife. The ritual with the kettle provides an initial stasis that the decision to carve meaningfully breaks. Stakes escalate internally from contemplation to irreversible action: once the lion is carved, a path is foreclosed and her relationship to both Jarek and grief has changed. The conflict remains entirely interior and quiet, so while it’s well-executed, it never quite reaches a sharper sense of visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake is internal: whether she will continue clinging to eroded ambitions and avoidance or face her “ghost” and accept a new stance toward time and story. Pressure escalates modestly but clearly as she shifts from listening to others’ regrets, to noticing the unsettling shadow, to physically entering the lagoon’s surface. The camera wheel dropping functions as the key tightening beat, foreclosing a path of nostalgic stasis. Still, conflict remains largely contemplative; a slightly sharper on-page dilemma or visible trade-off would heighten the felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is largely internal—whether Mara will see the terminal as dead infrastructure or as a site for “new equations for hope”—and this is signaled and carried through. There is a gentle escalation as curiosity leads her deeper and the hidden caretaker is revealed, but there are no sharp reversals or pressured trade-offs; nothing actively resists her goal beyond decay. The resolution feels earned but low-cost, so tension never quite tightens into a decisive, pressured choice.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will continue burying his grief and abandoned dream or reengage with them—is clear, and the story does tighten from quiet routine to the charged encounter at the forecourt. The repair of the music box and the appearance of the bear both function as pressures nudging him toward a choice, and his decision to leave the Spire is a genuine, if subtle, act of agency. However, escalation is almost entirely internal and somewhat under-articulated; the fear and risk of following the bear and reopening grief are more implied than viscerally felt. As a result, the price of his choice is present but muted.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.8)
    The core conflict—his need to uncover hidden truths versus the possibility that the real lie is in his own orientation—is compelling but plays out mostly as smooth realization rather than pressured choice. There is one clear tightening when the sundial points toward the mirror and heats up, and another when the mirror figure speaks and he must physically take the mirror; after that, acceptance comes almost without resistance. Stakes remain largely internal and abstract, with little sense of a foreclosed alternative path or genuine risk in engaging the mirror. The result is thoughtful and coherent but not especially tense or costly at the moment of climax.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—recovering and preserving the weavers’ hidden knowledge—remains largely conceptual, with no external antagonist or tangible risk on the page. Pressure “escalates” mainly through discovery: from generic knots to a named locus of power (the Weeping Shoals) and a fleeting possible glimpse of something in the water. There is one meaningful deepening (realization that the Shoals are a threshold between worlds), but no option is truly foreclosed and Elias’s tactics never have to adapt under duress. The piece functions more as a mood-rich vignette than a conflict-driven story at elite-publication standards.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Lena can meaningfully respond to the kingdom’s wound and her own complicity through story—is clear but operates almost entirely on an interior, conceptual plane. There is one mild escalation as she moves from reflection to the concrete ritual of burying the thread, which tightens her commitment and cost. However, pressure does not markedly intensify; there’s no real narrowing of options or tested alternative beyond quiet endurance. The result is resonant but low-tension, which holds it below stronger conflict bands.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—whether Kaelen can awaken the egg and thereby reclaim a lost beauty and sense of self—remains coherent and focused. Escalation comes via successive failed attempts and the partial response on the third night, culminating in his renunciation of machinery for memory and song. Still, the pressure is mostly internal and technical; there is no ticking clock, visible threat, or serious alternative path, so the sense of real risk or trade-off is muted. The conflict is effective and thematically apt but not as sharp or costly as it could be for high-end publication.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal, and even there the pressure is gentle: Lena has already chosen her path before the story opens, and nothing truly threatens or tests it. The girl’s questions offer a mild probing of Lena’s history and fear, but they don’t force a painful trade-off or reversal. The main “turn” is Lena deciding to actively teach the child how to listen to scars, which is more an extension than an escalation of her initial motive. As a result, stakes feel relatively static and the ending, while lovely, doesn’t carry much dramatic cost.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will confront the submerged, dragging memories or continue to let absence rule—is clearly signaled via the box and the grandmother’s warning. Pressure escalates credibly from curiosity about the box to the uncanny meeting at the dead fountain to the irreversible act of unlocking an underground mechanism. However, the psychic and practical risks of this choice are more stated than felt; we’re told memories “drag you under,” but we don’t see a concrete alternative path she might take or a specific loss she risks. The conflict is effective and coherent but could stand one sharper, more costly dilemma at the threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will repeat generational patterns of destructive “fire” or enact a new, nonviolent approach—is intelligible and tied to his relationship with Kael. There is some escalation (sonar pings quicken, petals flare, Kael’s weapons flicker out), but resistance is fairly soft and the “solution” works on first try without real jeopardy, negotiation, or sacrifice. Kael’s accusation of repeating the same mistake hints at deeper conflict that never quite becomes a hard choice. As a result, tension feels more contemplative than pressured, and the price of Elias’s act is more implied than actively tested.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—how Elias will live with his grief and relationship to the dead/living community—is established and deepened through the ribbon’s appearance, the onset of spectral mentorship, and the eventual public act of hanging the ribbon. The pressure escalates texturally rather than through sharp reversals: repeated visits, the discovered poem, and the butterflies’ departure cumulatively tighten his need to reinterpret grief. However, opposition and risk remain soft; no real threat, conflict with others, or fraught trade-off complicates his path. The final choice carries emotional significance but relatively little on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—restoring temporal/moral balance—is clearly signaled and pursued. Pressure escalates in a gentle, internal way: from noticing the pendulum’s hesitation, to confronting the physical record of his sins, to committing fully by inscribing them onto the bob. The choice to relinquish the rake handle and trust the clock mechanism to carry his guilt provides a real, if understated, cost. The conflict remains largely contemplative and encounters little active resistance, so tension never quite tightens to a sharp edge.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is Elias’s need to decode the tapestry and, beneath that, to touch the lingering intentions of the dead; this is clear but fairly low-pressure. The conflict is primarily intellectual (a puzzle) and contemplative rather than opposed; there’s no real resistance to his investigation. Escalation exists—blue to red to gold threads, culminating in the initials and date—but turns don’t visibly foreclose options or demand sacrifice. The quiet, accumulative mode works, yet the emotional and tactical stakes could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.6)
    The central stake—whether Elara will dare to “write the future” and thereby influence a rigid scholarly culture—is well-signaled. Her hesitation “before the pen met the blank page” is the closest thing to a genuine pressure point, but it resolves quickly without complication or trade-off. Once she starts writing, events proceed smoothly; there’s no significant test of her model, the quill’s reliability, or institutional resistance. As a result, tension remains low and the outcome feels assured rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether any story can return to a famished world—is compelling in concept, but on the page the pressure remains mostly abstract. There’s no concrete opposition to Elias’s goal: the radio obligingly yields lyrics, the dust responds on first try, and no real option is foreclosed. Escalation is more a gentle deepening of insight than a tightening of stakes, so tension never quite sharpens into necessity. The result is a beautiful mood piece with underdeveloped conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will keep reenacting his mother’s unfinished escape from emotion or step out of it—is coherent and surfaces early through his relationship to the portrait and the gallery. Pressure escalates via the mask: first as a dangerous object, then as a conduit for a disorienting vision that reframes what he’s been chasing. His final actions (using the last ashes, recognizing his own face, discarding the mask and leaving) constitute a credible renunciation with implied cost (releasing his mother’s myth and his own role as curator of her absence). The conflict stays mostly internal and thematic, which works, but a bit more concrete sense of what he’s losing materially or socially would sharpen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant conflict—Elias’s refusal to accept sanitized history versus the world’s indifference—is clear and thematically apt. There is some tightening as his obsession with the cog coalesces into a plan to confront surface dwellers with his findings. Still, the stakes remain largely abstract and ideological, with no concrete risk or counterforce on the page to test that decision. As a result, the escalation feels more like a shift in intention than a pressured trade-off with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether this divided choir can be brought into true harmony—appears early and is maintained. Pressure escalates modestly through the progressive rehearsals and social friction between Maren and Liora, with Elara’s method acting as the main adaptive move. However, conflict remains relatively soft-focus: there’s little on-page confrontation, real risk of failure, or tangible cost beyond discomfort and effort. The resulting arc is satisfying but gentle, closer to a well-shaped vignette than a fully pressurized crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara can grow and use the knowledge fruit to heal memories—is clear, and her choice to eat the fruit provides a real, if gentle, turning point. Yet the story offers no real opposition: the seed takes, the plant grows quickly, and the fruit works as hoped. The celestial alignment is framed as a one-shot risk but never truly tightens pressure or forces compromise. Conflict thus feels largely conceptual and atmospheric rather than dramatized, which flattens escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—saving the drone hives and, by extension, the city’s capacity for wonder—is clearly articulated and tied to the blackout. There is a meaningful tightening when sabotage is revealed and access to the forbidden tower becomes necessary, with Elias’s rule-breaking as a minor cost. However, once inside, conflict resolves with minimal friction: no real opposition, danger, or ethical trade-off complicates the match strike, and the sabotage thread doesn’t exert on-page pressure beyond a line of dialogue. The result is engaging but feels more like uncovering and executing a puzzle solution than confronting escalating danger or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s attempt to neutralize or comprehend a living house—is legible, and the insertion of the shard under the door is a clear tightening move that leads to the house’s alarming “pause.” Internal and external tensions intersect in the moment he recognizes he has granted the house a different kind of agency than intended. However, the pressure remains more contemplative than fraught, and the cost of his choice to leave the paused-then-resuming house behind is implied rather than viscerally felt. A touch more sense of risk (ethical, existential, or physical) in that central experiment would heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether to unlock a buried, morally ambiguous “secret” that could reshape the world—is present early and tightens credibly once the statue reveals that the bloom is containment, not cure. The key escalation is the information turn: realizing the ampoule is a key, not a remedy, followed by her decision to use it anyway. However, the ethical and emotional wrestling around this decision is relatively brief; she hesitates, then complies, with only light dramatized struggle, so the sense of price is more conceptual than viscerally felt. The final spread of the tendrils raises stakes, but the cost to her or to specific others remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.8)
    The conflict is primarily conceptual: can Elias rupture an infinite, self-sustaining system, and what does that mean for missed opportunities. There is one clear escalation beat (the hundredth step pause and decision to roll) and one decisive event (the rupture and reconfiguration). However, pressure on Elias himself is quite low—no real danger, no alternative paths, no cost beyond not getting the exact result he imagined. The stakes therefore feel more intellectual than visceral, keeping tension in the competent-but-not-compelling range.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is internal: whether she can transform sleeplessness and a poisoned city into proof (for herself and others) that kindness persists. Pressure accrues through atmosphere and repetition rather than explicit obstacles; her agency manifests in choosing to keep painting and to release the faces into the world. There is a soft but real tightening when she shifts from private ritual to the decision to leave paintings for strangers, turning memory into risked contact. Still, conflict remains low-grade and largely unopposed—no concrete counter-force tests her commitment, so costs and trade-offs stay mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether traditions and “old songs” can be revived rather than lost—is clear early and remains coherent. Pressure does deepen as Liora moves from contemplation in the museum to risking an embodied attempt in the bakery, expecting some kind of revelation and facing the possibility that “the bread is just bread.” However, conflict is mostly internal and low-friction; external resistance is minimal and the bees’ return comes quickly, with no failed attempts or tangible sacrifice beyond effort and vulnerability. Escalation exists but never quite tightens into a truly testing or costly crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can/should use this device to transgress fate/time—is clear, and the experiments with the yoyo provide a nice escalation from curiosity to world-altering action. The decisive tightening is the last drop of the yoyo before the stone, which transforms localized weirdness into a global reversal. However, the pressure on Elias feels more intellectual than agonizing; he never has to trade off between competing harms or seriously weigh turning back. The cost (erased histories, altered time) lands, but his agency is exercised with relatively little resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—whether Elias is consumed by a hollow, fearful double or reclaims his selfhood—is signaled early and tightened effectively when the reflection detaches and attacks. The key turn is his shift from panic to deliberate observation and physical contact, starving fear instead of feeding it, which narrows his options to confrontation over flight. Internal and external conflict are well braided. The only shortfall is a slight softness in the felt risk of failure; we’re told it’s “worse than death,” but the on-page consequences of losing this struggle could be sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.2)
    Pressure here is almost entirely aesthetic and existential—will the sea’s chaos cohere into music and collaboration rather than remain mute or hostile. The escalation from low thrum to harmonics to glowing fractal clouds tracks clearly, but there is no real negative consequence in play if Leeward fails; fear or risk is barely gestured at. His agency (choosing to play, intensifying the performance) drives the deepening, yet it never forces a trade-off or closes off a painful option. The result is beautiful but relatively low-stakes tension.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—what lies beyond the sealed gate / watchers, and what it has already done to people—is legible, and pressure escalates via the physical descent and the eerie reveal of the altered expedition. Internal and external conflicts intertwine as her lifelong intellectual curiosity must face a concrete, unsettling answer. That said, the scene with the expedition is eerie rather than actively threatening; they “only watched,” so her flight feels precautionary more than forced by on-page danger. The final choice to run and hunt other cracks is a meaningful stance crystallization but could be sharpened by a more explicit trade-off or visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—how to handle a life-saving forgery in the historical record—is clear and morally charged from early on. Liora’s arrival usefully escalates pressure by embodying the opposing principle (truth over myth), forcing Elias to articulate and revise his plan. The negotiation resolves relatively smoothly, with limited sense that either option is truly dangerous to them in the present tense, which softens urgency. Still, the internal ethical calculus tightens enough to produce a real, if quiet, trade-off at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether and how the pavilion’s memory can be honored rather than erased—is clear but largely internal and conceptual. Pressure escalates through spatial deepening (shallows → heart of the pavilion) and emotional intensification in the caretaker’s notes, with the final, defeated line about love and the river prompting Elias’s most consequential stance. However, Elias never seriously considers alternative courses of action or encounters meaningful resistance; his “wrestling” is mostly interpretive, not decisional, so options never feel sharply foreclosed. The piece works well as an accumulative lyric but could gain in power if there were at least one concrete temptation to turn away, exploit, or “professionally” sanitize the site that he must explicitly reject.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.5)
    The core stake—whether Elias can uncover the truth of the stamp and what that truth implies about him—is clear, and the discovery of the ordinance ledger provides a genuine deepening. However, pressure remains mostly intellectual; there’s little sense that failure would exact a serious cost beyond continued curiosity. The surname reveal and his choice to remain in the library register as a shift, but they don’t force a hard trade-off or visible sacrifice in the moment. Overall, the conflict is engaging but low-temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Veyra’s attempt to harness others’ sorrow, and the risk of that sorrow turning on her—is present but kept mostly at an abstract, atmospheric level until the final beat. There is one meaningful tightening (the realization that the lanterns are feeding the dreams) leading directly to the shattering and possession, but we don’t see her adjust tactics or face a concrete decision point under that revelation. Internal and external pressures (priests, world after the shadow’s detachment, her brother’s memory) are evocative yet underexploited as active conflict. The result is haunting but less tense than it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Lena’s drive to weaponize or understand her grief via the geode—remains coherent, and pressure rises modestly through the time limit, the appearance of the shifting entity, and the system reboot. However, external danger is mostly implied; the ghost recoils but never truly threatens, and the alarms feel like a prompt to move on rather than a crucible demanding a difficult trade-off. The main beat of escalation is the geode forcing the unseen into form, but Lena’s agency in that moment is limited to saying “Show me” and then running. As a result, the story deepens atmosphere more than it tightens stakes into a hard, costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will continue to treat the sky as data or accept its invitation to “belong”—is clear and escalates through the discovery of the anomalous stars, the sound, and the hidden structure. The pressure is mostly internal and conceptual, so the tension feels gentle rather than gripping; there’s no concrete external risk or sacrifice foregrounded. Elias’s final nod is a credible crystallization, but the cost of going versus staying is only gestured at. Overall, conflict is present and progressive, but largely in a low-stakes, lyrical register.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will keep colluding with erasures or risk himself to uncover his own—is clear and present from early on. Pressure tightens from internal noise to concrete evidence (the carving) to an unavoidable confrontation with family complicity. His decision to pursue the boathouse and symbolically break with his old calibration of guilt gives the story an earned, if quiet, climax. The external danger remains mostly implied rather than felt on the page, keeping the stakes more psychological than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stakes—ensuring the safe exchange and, more deeply, how Elias relates to past mistakes—are signaled, but pressure remains largely anticipatory. There is one mild tightening when the locket appears and mirrors the moon phases he used, which deepens the sense of mirrored intentions rather than raising danger. No concrete threat tests Elias’s resolve or forces a painful trade-off in the moment; the prisoners themselves are abstract presences. The result is a credible but low-intensity conflict profile that never fully exploits the inherent volatility of a prisoner exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will keep navigating by his father’s expectations or choose his own course—is clear from early on. Pressure escalates through his confrontation with symbolic tools (compass vs. utility poles) and culminates in the island landfall and decision to throw away the compass, foreclosing the filial path. The cost (relinquishing his father’s tool and identity) is legible, though mostly internal and quietly handled. The conflict remains largely interior and could bear one more concrete external complication to sharpen stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will confront the man he was—is clear, and the labyrinth provides a situational pressure cooker. The left/right fork is the main explicit choice, leading to the mirrors that force him to face his past and his aborted empathy. However, escalation is relatively gentle: discomfort and recognition, not a stark trade-off or visible loss, so the felt cost remains modest. The conflict between his jaded stance and the labyrinth's demand to "look" is compelling but could use one more concrete test or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Liora can accept this fundamentally altered form of her beloved—is signaled early and pays off in the climactic transformation. Internal pressure does deepen from preparation to the moment he says “You’ll have to let me go,” which is the key tightening beat. Still, the conflict never seriously risks either failure or refusal; her assent feels emotionally plausible but dramatically under-contested. A moment of genuine temptation to abort or misdirect the metamorphosis would sharpen stakes and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—whether she can meaningfully engage with lost time and this new child’s unshaped future without collapsing under inherited emotional debt—is present and coherent. Pressure does deepen as the crack becomes a “map,” evokes the mother’s maxim about promises and debts, and culminates in her choice to align her hand and not flinch from the pulsing fissure. However, escalation is almost entirely internal and linear, without a strong sense of options narrowing or an on-page test that truly risks failure. The result is a beautifully sustained mood more than a sharply tightening conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Liora can and will open the locked dimension by confronting accumulated sorrow—is signaled early and pursued consistently. Escalation comes through successive confrontations with the photographs, culminating in the woman-and-child image where Liora finally trembles and the Tear activates. The decisive move (pressing the locket to the final photo, letting the ship go through instead of herself) is driven by her agency, but resistance remains soft and largely internal. Because her personal cost is muted—she ends “lighter” and smiling—the felt price of that choice is less intense than the premise would allow, slightly flattening the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—village survival vs. volcanic eruption—is clear, and there is a meaningful tightening when prophecy and vision collapse his abstract purpose into an urgent, concrete task. Internal conflict (self-effacing “I’m no one” vs. being named Stormbringer) brushes against the external crisis, and the tremor plus bug going dark sharpen his decision point. Yet the choice lacks a visible trade-off or lost option; once told “you will save us all,” he simply accepts and runs, with no competing good or meaningful renunciation dramatized. Coincidence and prophecy drive escalation more than his distinctive agency or costly missteps.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether the governor’s plan will burn the city or Mira’s counter-move will redirect that spark—is clear, and her theft plus torch-lighting are meaningful acts of agency. However, opposition is soft: the aide presents only a momentary stealth concern and then conveniently leaves a vital clue without contest. There’s no substantive reversal or escalation where her plan is truly endangered or a viable alternative tempts her away from risking treason. As a result, tension stays conceptual rather than visceral, limiting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—mending the unraveling patterns / preventing another collapse—is conceptually huge, and the initial disruption (frictionless world) is a strong inciting disturbance. However, once Elias begins the ritual, there is very little resistance or complication; each step works more or less as soon as he tries it, and the eels’ timely arrival with the shard feels convenient rather than pressured. The cost is mostly inherited dread rather than a contested choice or sacrifice in the moment. As a result, escalation reads smooth and inevitable rather than tense.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake is internal—how Elias will position himself ethically and artistically toward the scars/photo—and that is signaled early and followed through. Escalation is primarily tonal: the storm intensifies, timer beeps recur, and the lightning flash precipitates the realization that the scars form a map, which deepens rather than reverses the conflict. The final renunciation (accepting that some maps must be carried, not read) is a meaningful stance but the visible cost and narrowing of options are understated, in part because no external alternative path is dramatized. As a result, tension is finely sustained but rarely bites, keeping the conflict strong but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—a duel of questions that will either reinforce rivalry or expose a long-hidden overture—is clear but stays largely cerebral. Pressure rises modestly with the reveal of the cipher and Isolde’s “You’ve been studying me,” and the decisive turn is her quasi-surrender and choice to collaborate. However, there is little sense of genuine risk if she refuses or if he misplays; the conflict never quite bites hard enough to convey a substantial price beyond a graceful tonal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—whether Lumen will stay a drifting non-entity or commit to rebuilding and resistance—is clear but plays out with relatively low on-page pressure. The main turn is him finally using the key and beginning to shelve books, followed by Elias’s validation; there’s little sense of risk, opposition, or real alternative once he decides to go to the library. Internal fear (of identity, of commitment) is referenced more than dramatized in choices with visible cost. As a result, the ending feels hopeful and earned but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can use an impossible encore to take refuge from grief and tilt fate—is established early and tightened via the rule “until the horizon invites night.” Escalation is accumulative: his testing scales, arrival of increasingly desperate travelers, the twilight plunge, and then the abrupt launch into the discordant piece. The climax is clearly driven by his agency, with the world answering in storm and stilling compasses. The emotional and metaphysical cost (risking chaos and reentering time) is present but could be made slightly more viscerally conflicted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether to expose dangerous truths to protect fragile, culturally vital memory before the monsoon steals more—is well signaled. There is a meaningful escalation from avoidance to confrontation: Nani’s pressure and the urgent timeline push Liora into planting the seed and accepting guardianship. However, pressure stays mostly internal and abstract; no one else or no concrete circumstance forces a painful trade-off or visible sacrifice on the page. The decision to plant and later to “tell them, not all of it” is thematically apt but feels comparatively low-friction for the scale of the implied stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—how Elias will live with his accumulated regret post-severance—is clear and quietly sharpened by the compass and the lace-path through specific memories. Escalation is more deepening than tightening: we move from generalized sorrow to particular failures (the unsent letter, the student unpressed), culminating in a new tactic (mending/diffusing rather than erasing). The compass’s pulsing and the stilling needle provide a gentle but effective intensification before the final choice. The cost, though present, is understated; the story never forces him into a truly painful either/or, which keeps the conflict from the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pressure is minimal; the dominant stake is philosophical (drama vs. quiet) and the conflict is retrospective, lacking an immediate threat or time constraint in the scene. There is no visible cost to her decision to "keep watching," as the storm has passed and she is safe, leaving the stakes purely abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.8)
    Escalation is dampened by a compliant antagonist who surrenders the central secret ("burn the whole canyon") immediately upon seeing the ledger. Liora faces no significant resistance or dilemma to earn the information, leaving the stakes declared rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.5)
    The stakes are declared but never tested; the protagonist faces no significant obstacles or costs in the scene, succeeding on the first try of the climax. The resolution lacks a "felt price" or a foreclosure of options, reading as a frictionless victory.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=5.4)
    External opposition is minimal; the environment yields easily to the protagonist's "gift," removing potential tension. The conflict remains abstract ("distress signals") rather than immediate, resulting in a flat escalation curve without a moment where failure feels possible.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict and escalation are narrated in summary ("Patrols doubled, and the roads grew dangerous") rather than experienced through a specific scene of high-stakes obstruction. The antagonist (sanctions) remains abstract, and the "tightening" feels reported rather than felt through a forced trade-off or immediate physical danger.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes escalate abruptly with the child's appearance, but the absence of resistance or cost in Lien's decision flattens the dramatic peak. Because the "unused love" is a burden she wants to lose, giving the tear feels like a relief rather than a sacrifice, reducing the scene's tension.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are clearly signaled and escalate well through the reversal of the daughter’s photograph. The resolution is earned through a direct choice, and the physical cost—Elara aging rapidly—is a satisfying, tangible price for the magic used.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=4.8)
    Tension evaporates when the scavenger confrontation—a potential high-stakes moment—is resolved instantly by displaying an arrow. There is no felt cost or trade-off for the characters; obstacles are bypassed rather than overcome through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are clearly established as a race against the protagonist's mortality ("while his cells still divided"). The escalation is internal and textural, moving from the general atmosphere to the specific, painful memory of the wife's lie. While the external conflict is minimal, the internal pressure is coherent and leads to a decisive moment of action.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=2.9)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the protagonists share a worldview instantly, and the potential obstacle (the departing train) is discarded without struggle or visible trade-off. The narrative lacks a tightening of options, resulting in a flat trajectory devoid of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=4.1)
    Conflict is strictly internal and dissolves when the environment (the thaw) provides the answer. There is no escalation of pressure; the protagonist faces no resistance or meaningful trade-offs to achieve his renewal.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are declared but not tested; the confrontation with the caretaker dissolves instantly when the shell is revealed, bypassing genuine conflict. There is no escalation of pressure, as the antagonist creates no real obstacle, resulting in a resolution that feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=3.9)
    Stakes are theoretical and lack urgency; there is no tangible opposition or risk of failure, only a guaranteed mystical process. The conflict is resolved instantly via mental assertion ("she realized") without visible struggle or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.9)
    The conflict is entirely internal and philosophical; there is no external pressure or risk of failure (e.g., getting caught, freezing). While the internal stakes are clear, the lack of a "felt cost" or trade-off makes the resolution feel safe. The robot gains wisdom without losing anything tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.8)
    The conflict is low-stakes; the tension dissolves almost immediately upon confrontation. The risk of their secrets is implied but never truly felt, making the resolution feel convenient rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.1)
    The stakes are personal and existential, centered on Elias's relationship with his life's work. The escalation—from passive maintenance to active negotiation with the garden—is clear. The cost is subtle but felt: the surrender of the illusion of control, paid in the currency of his "masterpiece" crumbling to birth something new.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.4)
    Conflict is largely abstract; the opposition comes from off-screen colleagues and easily overridden AI protocols, lacking visceral on-page pressure. The escalation is linear and predictable, with the protagonist meeting little resistance until the climax, where the cost remains mostly intellectual ("weight of the truth") rather than immediate and tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain abstract and historical rather than immediate or personal; there is no active opposition or escalating pressure, leading to a climax that feels inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.4)
    Internal pressure is strong, rooted in the weight of the past mistake. However, the external obstacle is minimal; the search for the box faces no resistance, weather, or difficulty, making the resolution feel inevitable rather than fought for. The stakes are felt, but the test of agency is soft.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.0)
    Tension builds effectively through sound and shadow, but the conflict remains relatively low-stakes as the entity offers no direct threat. The resolution is thematic rather than a result of escalating pressure or a difficult tradeoff; the offering of the wheel is a relatively easy fix that dissolves the tension without a high cost.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.3)
    The dominant stake (silence vs. the imposing narrative of the new book) is established, but the pressure remains low. The protagonist's ability to resolve the conflict instantly and without hesitation ("unmoved") deflates the tension, making the stakes feel abstract rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is no meaningful conflict or escalation; the narrative follows a linear, frictionless path from mystery to resolution. The protagonist faces no difficult trade-offs, and the stakes—while stated—are never tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.0)
    Pressure escalates effectively from atmospheric unease to physical distortion, raising the stakes from historical curiosity to immediate reality-warping danger. While the external pressure is strong, the protagonist’s lack of resistance or agonizing trade-offs limits the complexity of the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.4)
    Escalation is mild; the arrival of the woman functions as a rendezvous rather than a confrontation, offering no genuine opposition. The stakes remain abstract, and the resolution lacks a "felt cost" on the page—Elias simply accepts the invitation to the game.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ticking clock ("before the possession completes") creates effective urgency and pressures the ritual actions. The conflict reconfigures from resisting an external threat to accepting an internal transformation, creating a solid escalation of stance.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is entirely internal and abstract ("weight of the world," "numbness"); there is no external opposition or concrete obstacle to overcome. The "exhaustion" mentioned is a condition, not an active pressure, resulting in a scene devoid of urgent escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes remain abstract and internal, with the antagonist (the older self) serving as a vehicle for advice rather than a source of active pressure. The central conflict is resolved through a verbal explanation that instantly fixes the protagonist's mindset, lacking visceral struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are internal and abstract, with no external pressure or visible cost to failure. The conflict is resolved by the mentor's demonstration rather than the protagonist's agency; Mira merely observes and accepts the breakthrough, resulting in a flat narrative drive without genuine escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.5)
    The stakes are stated ("the eastern quarter is no longer ours") but remain abstract and distant for most of the scene. The pressure is internal and low-voltage; the protagonist's decision to act feels like a natural next step rather than a hard-won choice under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.0)
    Pressure is low; the encounter is gentle and the conflict remains abstract, lacking interpersonal friction or opposing goals. The protagonist is given the answer rather than being forced to wrestle it from the scene through a costly decision or risky action.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the conceptual stakes are high ("unraveling time itself"), the actual conflict lacks a felt cost; the protagonist risks everything but faces no consequences, resulting in a low-tension resolution that feels safe rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is minimal and abstract; the "chronic hush" functions as a passive backdrop rather than an active opposition, resulting in negligible pressure and no meaningful tightening of options.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=3.8)
    There is no tangible conflict or escalation on the page; Darian wants the product, and Liora provides it immediately. The "pressure" is entirely retrospective or internal, resulting in a smooth transaction devoid of the friction required to generate narrative stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain low throughout; the "fragile" nature of the task is asserted but not tested by significant on-page obstacles or opposition. The resolution is swift and frictionless, lacking a visible or felt cost for Elias to maintain the cycle.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are present (isolation vs. belonging) but low-pressure; the external conflict is minimal as the travelers accept Liora immediately, and the internal conflict dissolves without a fight. The "cost" of the sculpture—described as a "hollow echo"—feels negligible, making the sacrifice at the climax feel more like a transaction than a painful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pressure is signaled via the "You're late" whisper but lacks concrete consequences; the protagonist faces no significant active opposition or difficult trade-off. The climax is a simple physical action (touching sand) without a felt price or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=3.8)
    There is a distinct lack of pressure or cost; Elias performs a ritual and it works immediately without resistance. The central conflict (grief) is resolved too easily by a magical presence, bypassing the necessary struggle to earn the peace at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.6)
    The external pressure (Mara's entrance) and internal stakes (reveal vs. hide) are tightly braided. The climax forces a clear choice, and the protagonist’s decision to remain hidden carries a legible cost in lost connection.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are primarily conceptual, centering on Mara's worldview rather than immediate physical peril. The escalation is linear and effective, culminating in a clear moment of surrender, though the "cost" is largely symbolic (kneeling in mud, accepting the unknown) rather than a tangible loss of resources or standing.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.0)
    Tension builds well with the rain but dissipates in the final scene as the antagonist verbally explains the stakes. The conflict remains abstract, and the "water wars" backdrop provides context without exerting immediate pressure on the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes escalate clearly from wonder to survival, but the conflict is driven entirely by the secondary character. Elias questions the Pilgrim ("At what cost?") but takes no active steps to alter the outcome until the catastrophe is inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=4.6)
    Escalation is negligible; the protagonist faces no meaningful opposition or difficult choices, as allies and coincidences resolve potential conflicts immediately. The stakes are declared ("sound the truth") but not tested by pressure within the scene, resulting in a flat narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=4.8)
    Tension is low throughout as the environment welcomes rather than resists the protagonist. The "escalation" consists merely of approaching the destination; without an antagonist, a ticking clock with consequences, or a difficult trade-off, the stakes remain abstract and the final choice lacks visceral weight.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=3.9)
    Stakes are purely internal and resolve with minimal pressure; the opposition (skepticism) offers no fight, rendering the conflict static. There is no visible cost to Elias’s transformation—he gains wisdom and comfort without sacrificing anything, making the "courage" mentioned in the text asserted rather than demonstrated.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=4.6)
    The stakes are high in theory ("spatial mutiny") but low in practice; the confrontation consists of a single lunge and an immediate counter-move. There is little back-and-forth pressure or escalation of tactics, resulting in a conflict that feels rushed and lacks visceral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes are clearly established: the woman’s brother’s freedom and Elias’s safety are on the line. The escalation is rapid but felt, driven by the woman's desperate physical state ("map of old bruises"). The cost—Elias losing the object and entering the "game"—is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=3.5)
    Escalation is negligible; the protagonist faces no opposition, deadline, or concrete threat, only a curiosity that he immediately engages with. The stakes remain purely philosophical, and the resolution requires no sacrifice, trade-off, or endurance of pain. The narrative lacks a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are existential and clear, but the conflict remains largely internal and atmospheric. The interaction with the clerk is low-friction, and the interaction with the woman, while pivotally placed, feels more like a thematic confirmation than a high-pressure test of the protagonist's goals.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.0)
    The central conflict is resolved largely through passive reception of information; the visions dictate the stakes and the solution. The "cost" of the transformation is stated as "sorrow" and "gloomy cheerfulness" but is not dramatized through a difficult trade-off or painful choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.2)
    Escalation is summarized ("She started small," "She convinced the cooks") rather than experienced through a specific high-pressure beat. There is no on-page moment where the antagonist presses Lan to the breaking point; the stakes are declared but not tested in a dramatized encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict is largely abstract; the threat of bulldozers is distant, resulting in low immediate pressure on the page. The story functions as a mood piece without a significant tightening of stakes or a pivotal turning point that forces a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=4.4)
    Stakes are abstract; the cost of failure is not dramatized, and success feels inevitable from the start. There is no "felt cost" or sacrifice required to fix the drone—Elias simply adjusts it and succeeds. The tension remains low throughout, with no meaningful tightening of options.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes remain largely abstract and intellectual; the "cost" of the final decision is theoretical rather than viscerally felt on the page. The conflict is low-pressure, lacking a palpable antagonist or urgency beyond the protagonist's internal drive, making the "worrying tranquility" feel like a descriptor rather than a tension.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.0)
    Escalation occurs via increasing density of sound, fitting the accumulative lens, but lacks opposing pressure or risk. The protagonist succeeds without facing a forcing move, setback, or trade-off, causing the tension to flatline early.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clear (survival vs. entrapment), and the cost of the resolution (the loss of the mother's vial) is felt. However, the escalation relies on a standard oxygen-ticker trope, and the resolution comes somewhat easily once the "magic potion" logic is revealed, reducing the sense of struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clear and escalate from atmospheric dread to a direct confrontation with the entity. The conflict is resolved effectively, though the antagonist remains somewhat abstract until the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.3)
    Liora lacks agency; the conflict is resolved by the antagonist (the ghost) providing the solution (the bead/memory). There is no escalation of pressure or narrowing of options, only a linear sequence of arrival, receipt, and realization.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is minimal; the environment yields to the protagonist without significant opposition. The "tightening" (the voice's challenge) is resolved immediately by compliance, and the stakes remain cerebral and low-pressure throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (restoring faith) is clear, but escalation occurs primarily through summarized montage ("Days bled into nights") rather than acute scene-level pressure. The climax resolves with immediate supernatural validation upon placing the artifact, missing a final spike in difficulty or a trade-off that would heighten the earned sense of victory.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.5)
    The stakes are low and the pressure is minimal. The central obstacle—the code—is resolved quickly with a simple substitution, offering little resistance to the protagonist. Because he is already at the destination, there is no risk of being late or wrong, neutralizing the tension of the "meet me" deadline.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=3.2)
    Antagonistic pressure is absent from the page; Liora faces no direct opposition, skepticism, or physical danger during her mission. She succeeds in her first attempt to spread the truth with a single whisper, and the revolution follows automatically. The declared stakes (a coup) are high, but the on-page conflict is virtually non-existent.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes are clearly established as emotional peace versus lingering regret. The escalation is subtle but effective, moving from written messages to a full manifestation of the sister. The cost—confronting the fear of speaking—is felt on the page, though the external pressure from the spirits is relatively benevolent.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is internal and static; the protagonist faces no active opposition, and the "boy" serves merely as a cooperative mirror rather than a complication. The escalation relies on magical intensity ("burned hotter") rather than rising narrative stakes or difficult trade-offs. The resolution requires no sacrifice, only the passive pressing of casts against stone.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=4.2)
    Pressure is low throughout; the conflict is purely internal and artistic, lacking an antagonist or time constraint that forces a trade-off. The climax—developing the film to find the problem solved by magic—removes the need for the protagonist to make a difficult decision or sacrifice, leaving the stakes abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from professional curiosity to ontological risk, with the garden's reaction providing tangible external pressure. The protagonist's agency is evident in the inciting experiment with the nickel, though the climax positions him as somewhat reactive—being "asked" to step through rather than seizing the door himself.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.5)
    The inspector's arrival provides a functional inciting incident and immediate pressure. However, the tension dissipates in the final paragraphs as the narrative switches to a summary of future successes, lowering the immediate stakes and cost of Elias's decision.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.0)
    The stakes (sanity/processing grief) are clear, and the "relentless hum" of the city provides good context for the pressure. However, the conflict is resolved somewhat too easily; the "armistice" is achieved through a moment of environmental grace rather than a difficult trade-off or escalation. The tension deflates rather than snapping, leading to a gentle but low-stakes resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is minimal; there is no antagonist, time pressure, or active obstacle opposing Liora's goal other than past failure. The stakes remain low and internal, and the climax resolves without a visible cost or difficult trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.1)
    Stakes are declared ("discovery and ruin") but the on-page cost is low—only a prop (the ink well) is destroyed. The "test" posed by the voice ("Will you listen?") is passed instantly without a visible trade-off or sacrifice, lowering the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are low and purely internal; the dormant volcano presents no immediate threat, and the "betrayal" is a philosophical worry resolved instantly by the letter. There is no on-page cost or sacrifice required to achieve the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.9)
    The conflict is primarily internal, externalized gently by Lena. While the stakes of losing the song are established, the immediate pressure of the scene is low until the reveal; the choice to stay is earned but the cost feels relatively low-impact on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.5)
    The stakes are clear (connection vs. loss), but the on-page pressure is relatively low; the conflict is resolved through internal reflection triggered by an object rather than an external force compelling a trade-off. The "necessary distances" concept appears as a realization rather than a constraint that forces a difficult tactical choice during the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=3.9)
    Stakes are low and theoretical; the "until sunrise" deadline feels imposed rather than organic to the conflict. Obstacles are nonexistent as the path to the center is unimpeded, resulting in a flat narrative arc with no escalation or necessary trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes remain abstract and philosophical (&quot;why do some paths disappear?&quot;) with no visceral danger or cost of failure established on the page. The moment of escalation—the red light—is brief and resolves immediately into acceptance, lacking sustained pressure or a meaningful dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=4.1)
    Conflict is minimal; the antagonist (monotony) offers no active resistance, and the secondary character enters and cooperates immediately without testing Lira's resolve. The stakes remain abstract, and the "cost" of the lost chess piece is negligible.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.8)
    The stakes (being skinned alive) are stated in exposition but do not exert immediate pressure on the scene; the antagonist is abstract. The central conflict is resolved too easily by the external prompt of the moonstone, bypassing the need for a difficult, character-defining struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story lacks meaningful conflict or pressure; Elias encounters no obstacles, risks nothing, and pays no price for the revelation. The stakes ("a reckoning coming") remain abstract and external, never forcing a trade-off or a tightening of options on the page. The encounter is a transaction of information rather than a dramatic test of the protagonist's values or stamina.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.2)
    Pressure is low throughout; the encounter is gentle, and the stranger accepts Elias's help without resistance or complication. The stakes are emotional but historical, and the protagonist faces no active opposition or dilemma that forces a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=3.4)
    Stakes remain abstract ("fading hope") without a visible trade-off or risk of loss. The narrative lacks escalation; the transition from observation to epiphany occurs without an intensification of pressure or a forced tactical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=4.6)
    Pressure is low throughout as the protagonist faces no active opposition or dilemma; the central tension is purely exploratory, and the "shadow" resolves into a helpful guide, removing any threat or need for a difficult decision.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative lacks significant opposition; the watchman validates Liora rather than challenging her, and the fading light functions as a passive clock rather than an active antagonist. The stakes remain abstract, as there is no visible consequence for failure or cost paid for success.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=4.9)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the adversary arrives essentially surrendered, turning the scene into a ceremony of agreement rather than a test of stakes. There is no meaningful tightening or escalation of pressure, resulting in a low-tension exchange where the outcome is never in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=5.5)
    While the internal conflict is clear, the external pressure is low; the antagonist is merely his own hesitation. The escalation consists of walking to a spot and thinking, lacking a concrete obstacle or forcing move that necessitates the choice at this specific moment beyond the atmospheric cue.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are purely metaphorical and lack urgency; the antagonist (the knot) provides no pushback, failing to escalate tension. The resolution comes without a visible or felt price, as the "chains" and "curses" unravel instantly upon touch.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=3.8)
    Pressure is virtually absent; Liora faces no external opposition, and the internal antagonist (the brother) exists only in memory without forcing a difficult trade-off in the present. The stakes remain theoretical ("if stories were weapons") rather than visceral; she risks nothing in this specific scene, making the "unsettling" power of her storytelling asserted rather than demonstrated.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict is low-pressure and stakes remain abstract; the monarchs' arrival feels inevitable rather than earned, and the protagonist faces no significant external resistance or hard trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=4.1)
    There is almost no conflict or escalation; the rope yields ("technically gentle"), the magic works instantly, and no external or internal force opposes the protagonist's goal during the scene. Without distinct pressure or the possibility of failure, the stakes remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=4.7)
    Conflict is minimal; the storm provides atmospheric pressure rather than a tactical constraint. The protagonist faces no genuine opposition or difficult choice; the answers are given freely by the spirit, and the key is acquired via a magical touch, lacking a visible cost or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.1)
    The external threat of the mercenaries creates a ticking clock that successfully escalates the internal conflict regarding the tile's purpose. The turning point—where the figure challenges Nabu-sharru's intent—reconfigures the stakes from personal survival to legacy, though the "spirit guide" interaction feels slightly less urgent than the physical threat outside.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.2)
    The dominant stake—the difficulty of forgiving a war criminal—collapses when the antagonist is revealed to be benevolent, removing the moral pressure. The resolution lacks a visible, felt cost; the "weight" simply lifts because the reason for carrying it is negated by the memory.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes remain somewhat abstract; while the climb presents physical danger ("thinner the air"), the resolution comes too easily through a change in mindset. The lack of a difficult trade-off or consequence lowers the tension, making the victory feel inevitable rather than fought for.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=5.4)
    Pressure is minimal. The central task—repairing the pendant—encounters no significant obstacle, and the girl's cooperation is immediate despite the "feisty" label. The stakes remain reflective and the cost is negligible, lacking a moment where Liora must trade one value for another.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes remain abstract and intellectual; the protagonist faces a puzzle rather than a true dilemma, and the resolution comes without a visible or felt cost. The tension is low throughout, as the "bafflement" is the only pressure applied before the solution arrives.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.1)
    Stakes are declared but rarely tested; the navigation of the labyrinth is frictionless, lacking near-misses or forced sacrifices on the page. The renegotiation beat offers a moment of agency, but the subsequent lack of obstacles makes the victory feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.0)
    Pressure is largely atmospheric and lacks a sharp, antagonistic force or a moment where the protagonist's goal is genuinely imperiled by anything other than his own walking speed. While the mirrors offer a glimpse of risk (the two-faced reflection), the climax resolves with acquiescence rather than a high-stakes decision between conflicting values.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=4.7)
    Conflict is negligible. The rope resists "at first" but yields immediately to Liora's touch, and the external threat (the voice) is ignored without consequence. There is no escalation of stakes on the page; the discovery is made too easily, and the moral weight of the erasure is observed rather than fought for. The protagonist faces no true opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.5)
    The arrival of the energy beings creates a clear, escalating pressure that forces a meaningful trade-off: Ryn must destroy the sanctuary location to save its essence. The cost is visible and felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.3)
    Escalation is weak; the protagonist faces no on-page obstacles or failures before his success. The stakes are abstract ("meaning"), and the victory is granted instantly upon testing the prism, lacking the necessary friction or cost to earn the emotional payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.9)
    Escalation relies on the pattern-break of the monuments. Stakes are primarily intellectual/abstract ("unravel a mind"), lacking immediate external pressure or visceral cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.2)
    Conflict is largely atmospheric and thematic rather than urgent or embodied; the "weight of the dark" presses but does not force a difficult trade-off or tactical pivot. Liora executes the ritual linearly without facing significant opposition or the risk of failure, resulting in low narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.2)
    The primary conflict—the brother's question—is off-stage, leaving the on-page action (observing the cicada) with lower immediate pressure. The stakes are handled metaphorically, which works for the genre, but the connection between the cicada and the "silence" feels intellectual rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ticking clock of the one-hour inversion provides effective structural pressure. Escalation is managed through Liora’s physical ascent and the increasing pull of the "righting" world. The stake—her survival and sanity—is tested in the encounter, though the boy's appearance is slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes are low and internal; the conflict is resolved by a simple pause in the journey rather than a costly choice. The tension feels asserted by the narrator’s reading of the passenger rather than dramatized through escalating obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.1)
    Pressure is virtually absent; the protagonist faces no active opposition, time crunch, or risk of failure within the scene. The "test" of the throne is a puzzle solved immediately without trial and error, stripping the climax of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.2)
    Tension is established through the knocking, but the stakes—the keeper's fear of the "cost of mercy"—evaporate the moment she sees the scar. The resolution provides immediate relief ("lungs expanding") without exacting the price the narrative spent the first half warning about.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.8)
    The internal conflict—regret versus acceptance—is well-escalated through the text messages and the physical journey into the tunnels. The stakes are clear (a new life vs. the current one), though the "antagonistic" force is somewhat abstract, functioning more as a test of character than a direct opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is no active opposition or cost; the Archives yield their secrets immediately upon the application of the magical tool. The escalation is linear and mechanical: Elias has an idea, turns a crank, and receives the answer without setback, trade-off, or risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.4)
    The stakes are high in concept (reality unraveling) but remain abstract until the end; we are told the world is ending rather than seeing it squeeze Aldric's immediate options. The conflict is primarily conversational until the final physical commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=3.0)
    There is no meaningful conflict or opposition. The investigation proceeds without obstacles; the landlady is helpful, and the answer is immediately available. The protagonist faces no risk and pays no price for the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.1)
    Stakes are clearly defined (truth vs. erasure), and the pressure escalates appropriately until the final beat. The tension deflates prematurely when the enforcers simply waver upon seeing the broadcast; a more costly or chaotic reaction would have maintained the scene's established pressure better.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=4.9)
    Stakes are abstract and external (the city drowning in noise) with no active antagonist or pressure force that adapts to the protagonist's actions. The climax lacks a moment of crisis or trade-off; the "burning lungs" are a physiological detail, not a dilemma, and the final cost is asserted ("lighter") rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; Liora encounters no external antagonists and faces no internal reluctance to pay the price of her transformation. The stakes are purely intellectual (decoding a pattern), and because the environment provides the answer through magic dust and dreams, there is no escalation of pressure or desperate tactical shifting required.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=4.4)
    Stakes remain abstract; the tension between precision and chaos is discussed but not tested by opposing pressures. The climax—stepping into a waterfall—is a surrender to magic rather than a difficult trade-off, and the resolution removes the conflict (the clock works) without exacting a price.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are personal and clear, escalating from the search for an object to a confrontation with the past. The resolution offers a legible emotional shift, though the cost feels somewhat low as the forgiveness is granted immediately upon seeing the carving.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are internal but lack external pressure; the protagonist faces no opposition or genuine risk in the encounter. The escalation is non-existent, as the interaction with the ghost is smooth and devoid of the friction required to generate narrative heat.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are intellectual rather than visceral; while the backstory suggests torture, the present-moment cost is negligible (a "gentle" fire). The conflict is resolved without significant resistance or sacrifice, as the protagonist simply accepts the stranger's gift to gain the insight he seeks.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes remain largely abstract; while there is a deepening of understanding, the protagonist faces no significant opposition or active antagonists. The "cost" is primarily physical (cramped fingers) or metaphorical (weight of stories) rather than a hard tactical trade-off or foreclosed option on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes are low and the conflict is resolved too easily; the "burning" of the mainspring is a momentary physical discomfort rather than a meaningful price. The pressure never truly escalates beyond a maintenance problem, and the "time leaking" stakes remain abstract without immediate threat to life or deep emotional value.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the external stakes are high (collapse of the system), the internal conflict is resolved too easily. Elias accepts the destruction of his work without resistance or attempted counter-move, reducing the dramatic tension to a sequence of inevitable events rather than a struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.2)
    The external pressure of the temporal storm effectively forces a deadline, and the ideological conflict with Liora sharpens the stakes. However, the conflict remains largely verbal until Elias initiates his ritual, and Liora functions more as an obstacle than a complex antagonist. The escalation is linear and competent.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=4.0)
    Stakes are abstract ("world is falling") and the protagonist's struggle faces no concrete opposition or felt price on the page. The resolution comes too easily to carry weight.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=5.0)
    Pressure is minimal; the protagonist faces no active opposition, physical danger, or difficult trade-offs, merely moving from point A to B to witness a phenomenon. The climax lacks a "must/cannot" choice, resulting in low narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=3.5)
    Pressure is negligible; the protagonist faces no antagonist, deadline, or difficult trade-off, simply accepting an invitation to join. The stakes are global and abstract ("keeping the world from unraveling") rather than personally tested or escalated on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are purely philosophical with no external pressure or risk of failure; the protagonist faces no active opposition, leading to a low-tension narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=4.0)
    Stakes are declared but resolved by environmental coincidence (the lagoon swallowing the truck) rather than Elara’s choices. The antagonists are faceless tropes who exert no specific, character-testing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=4.9)
    The conflict is primarily internal but lacks genuine opposition or escalation; Elias succeeds by "thinking harder" without facing setbacks or paying a price. The lack of a visible trade-off or sacrifice makes the high-stakes outcome (reviving a civilization) feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=5.4)
    Conflict is minimal and strictly internal, lacking a counter-pressure or deadline to force a difficult choice. The "stakes" of archiving emotional patterns remain abstract; there is no moment where Elias must risk something of value to achieve his realization, resulting in low narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is largely abstract (Liora vs. Entropy) and lacks immediate, on-page pressure. The protagonist faces no significant opposition or difficult trade-off; she activates the artifact, it works, and the "cost" (the vision fading) is negligible compared to the reward (hope/warmth), reducing tension.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are high and clearly defined; the "zero hour" pressure effectively forces the protagonist's hand. The conflict between the protagonist's intuition and the immediate threat escalates cleanly to a single decisive action.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.6)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no external opposition or difficult internal trade-off. The climax (holding the glass) is a gesture without risk or price. The "ache" mentioned is literary and abstract, failing to register as a genuine cost paid for the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.9)
    Pressure escalates coherently from the ghosts’ passive presence to their active insistence, forcing Elias to act. The climax narrows his options effectively, though the "cost" is largely internal and resolved quickly by the relief of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=4.7)
    Stakes remain abstract; the "weight of borrowed time" is declared but never forces a visible trade-off or loss on the page. The narrative lacks an antagonist or escalating pressure, allowing the protagonist to drift from discovery to resolution without confronting a significant obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.2)
    Escalation is minimal; the conflict is entirely internal and resolved immediately upon noticing a reflection. The "snapped kite string" attempts to introduce tension but functions only as an immediate metaphor, failing to create genuine obstacle or pressure on the protagonist's goal.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.1)
    Conflict is static and lacks escalation; the protagonist performs a single task without active opposition or evolving tactics. The antagonist (developers) remains an abstract, off-screen concept that fails to exert immediate pressure on the scene’s micro-choices or force a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.0)
    Tension is low; the protagonist faces no significant external obstacles or interpersonal friction, resulting in a flat pressure curve. The stakes remain purely intellectual, and the climax—dropping amber into a bowl—lacks the weight of a high-risk decision.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=4.5)
    Narrative tension is minimal; the environment offers no active resistance, and the heron serves as a permissive signal rather than a complication. The stakes remain abstract ("memory") without immediate, on-page pressure forcing a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are clearly raised by the recording, shifting the goal from memory to rescue, but the escalation lacks resistance; Elias accepts the call without a testing beat. The "shaking hands" are mentioned as a potential complication but do not force a trade-off or alter his method of preparation.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.2)
    Escalation is minimal; the protagonist moves from observation to observation with low resistance. The primary stake (isolation/purpose) is resolved by external opportunity rather than internal pressure or cost, resulting in a linear progression lacking a "no" or "but" reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.8)
    Tension evaporates at the peak; the antagonist voluntarily surrenders the object after the protagonist fails to pay the price. The resolution relies on benevolence rather than the protagonist's ingenuity or sacrifice, negating the established stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=4.1)
    Conflict is minimal as the antagonist is "benevolent" and the protagonist accepts his correction immediately; the lack of resistance or difficult trade-offs results in negligible narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.1)
    Conflict is primarily internal and environmental, lacking a sharp antagonist or distinct opposition that forces difficult trade-offs; the escalation is atmospheric rather than tactical. The stakes ("shape of home") remain abstract until the end, and the cost of the journey is symbolic (dissolving feather) rather than deeply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.4)
    The stakes are clearly defined as a conflict between the desire for redemption and the immutability of the past. The physical escalation of the labyrinth's heat tracks the rising tension well, culminating in a decisive emotional confrontation that forecloses the option of changing history.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.6)
    Conflict is mild; Echo serves more as a tutorial NPC than a genuine source of friction or opposition. The stakes ("unravel empires") are stated but not felt on the page; the immediate obstacle is simply Lira's hesitation to speak poetry, which she overcomes quickly. The "elders" provide only abstract background pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=4.0)
    Tension dissipates rather than escalates. The discovery of the "map" removes the threat immediately, leading to a frictionless resolution. There is no moment where the protagonist must choose between competing values or endure a loss to succeed.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.9)
    The central conflict—reclaiming the past vs. the impossibility of doing so—is dramatized well through the physical action of chasing the sinking shell. The escalation is sharp when the object of desire is lost, forcing a higher-order choice. The resolution feels like an earned reconfiguration of the stakes rather than a retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are theoretical/philosophical rather than visceral; the conflict with Maren is low-pressure verbal disagreement. The "cost" of the broken vial is minimal, and the validation comes too easily to generate high tension.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=3.9)
    Stakes are abstract and lack immediate physical or relational pressure; the protagonist faces no opposition, time limit, or difficult trade-off. The climax—answering a phone—is an act of passive compliance, devoid of the friction or visible cost required to generate narrative heat.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are legible and the pressure tightens when the eye amplifies rather than hides the truth. While the conflict is resolved effectively, the testing phase is brief, and the antagonist (the eye/truth) is overcome somewhat easily.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.0)
    Conflict is minimal; the stranger is dead upon arrival, removing external urgency, and Elias faces no internal obstacle to accepting the "borrowed memories." The story lacks a moment of escalation or tightening; it moves from observation to resolution without pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.1)
    The rising water creates tangible urgency that forces a choice, providing a clear external clock. However, the central conflict is resolved by a pre-existing "magic key" rather than character ingenuity or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake (identity/destiny) is signaled early, but escalation is mild as the protagonist faces no antagonist or significant obstacle. The tension deflates upon reaching the grotto, as the encounter is benevolent and confirming rather than challenging or costly.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.3)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces an ally who offers a gift, and she accepts it after a brief moment of internal doubt. There is no external pressure or escalating obstacle that forces the climax, making the stakes feel abstract rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation is present, moving from the scroll to the memory of the grave to the physical intrusion. However, the lack of a resolved beat at the end prevents the stakes from fully landing; the pressure builds but is not released or transformed into a final cost.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is minimal; Clara asks for a service, and Elias performs it without hesitation or internal struggle. There is no meaningful opposition or trade-off; the protagonist faces no risk of failure or loss. The stakes remain abstract ("meaning") rather than concrete, resulting in a gentle but low-pressure vignette.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.2)
    The conflict is entirely internal and resolves with a gain-only ending; Liora finds her voice without paying a tangible price. While the "breath between storms" provides pressure, the stakes remain low and personal, with no external friction to test her realization.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.2)
    The conflict is primarily internal (guilt), externalized through the ritual. While the stakes are clear, the escalation is somewhat gentle; the ritual proceeds without significant opposition or threat of failure until the momentary pause before the note sounds. A deeper sense of risk or a stronger counter-force would elevate the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.8)
    There is no escalation of pressure; Elara faces a broken universe, decides to fix it, and succeeds on the first attempt without complication or sacrifice. The "dark stone" obstacle is resolved instantly without a change in tactics, removing any sense of stakes despite the cosmic scale. The narrative lacks a pivotal moment where the protagonist must trade one value for another.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are immediately established (reality/horizon destabilizing) and pressure escalates through the counting sequence and mechanical failure. The resolution is decisive, though the transition from the "counting" beat to the "blood sacrifice" solution feels slightly rapid for the magnitude of the threat.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=3.0)
    Stakes are purely abstract and intellectual, with no immediate risk, time pressure, or active opposition to force a difficult choice. The lack of conflict turns the interaction into a low-tension lecture, resulting in a flat narrative arc without escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.5)
    The stakes of debt and legacy are clear, but the on-page conflict is low; the librarian acts as a passive gatekeeper rather than an obstacle. The scene lacks immediate external pressure, relying instead on the retrospective weight of the backstory.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.0)
    The stakes are intimate and deeply felt, but the conflict is primarily characterized by attrition and endurance rather than active on-page confrontation. The boy’s storyline resolves off-screen, which fits the tone but lowers the immediate dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.4)
    The stakes are clear but the escalation is weak; the conflict is entirely internal and resolves with little resistance. The protagonist reasons his way to the conclusion rather than being forced by a dilemma or external urgency. The cost is the loss of the photo, which is significant, but the decision process leading to it lacks tension.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are well-defined, and the logistician's refusal to trade on standard terms provides a solid reversal that deepens the conflict. The cost is visible and felt, though the interaction remains quiet and conversational rather than fiercely contested.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=4.4)
    Stakes are declared ("uncharted emotional depths") but not tested by genuine opposition; the forest's "hum just below pain" is bypassed without consequence. The narrative lacks escalation, as the compass and intuition function flawlessly to resolve the central tension.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—the integrity of the town's memory—is clear. However, the tension is dampened by the explicit statement that mistakes can be "erased tomorrow," which reduces the immediate cost of the decision. The resolution is an internal shift rather than a painful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=3.0)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent; the advisor figure offers immediate validation rather than opposition or complication. The stated stakes (grief, being forgotten) are handled in backstory summary rather than tested in the present scene. There is no escalation of pressure; the scene begins and ends in a similar state of gentle affirmation.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.6)
    The central conflict evaporates the moment the characters meet; the tension dissolves into cooperation without a testing beat or demand for proof. The stakes shift from a manhunt to a mystical unlocking too smoothly, lowering the felt cost of Elara's decision to abandon her original mission.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=5.8)
    Physical opposition is nearly non-existent; the scientists shout but offer no resistance, and the facility presents no locks or guards. The pressure relies entirely on the abstract "universe inhaling" clock, which, while poetic, fails to substitute for concrete, on-page conflict during the escape. The stakes are felt internally but lack external friction.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.6)
    Tension escalates appropriately with the storm's intensity mirroring Elias's internal drive. The stakes are primarily intellectual and spiritual—proving the whispers—which works for the length, though the physical threat of the storm remains largely atmospheric rather than forcing a hard tactical trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are nominal and the conflict evaporates instantly; the girl capitulates to the first gesture without escalation, leaving the tension resolved by easy understanding rather than struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.6)
    The stakes are high (saving the town) and personal (sister's memory), but the antagonist ("something hungry") remains abstract, lacking a concrete on-page manifestation to test Elias's resolve. The conflict is largely internal until the final gesture, and the "cost" of his rebellion is theoretical rather than visceral or immediately felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=4.1)
    Escalation is minimal; obstacles like cold water are trivial, and the conflict dissolves via explanation rather than being tested by a tightening of options. There is no moment where the protagonist must sacrifice something of value to proceed.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.2)
    The conflict is internal and quiet, pitting Elias’s need for the ritual against the encroachment of the void. The escalation is subtle—driven by the contrast of the dream—but the stakes remain personal and somewhat contained. The cost is felt in the morning’s "heavier" words, landing the accumulative pressure effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=3.9)
    Stakes are low; the "ban" is backstory and offers no active resistance, leaving the protagonist to succeed without genuine opposition. The central conflict is internal and abstract ("tremor"), lacking a moment where failure is a tangible risk.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are low; the antagonist (colorblindness) is bypassed by a helpful magical mentor who provides the answer. The escalation feels flat because the protagonist faces no difficult trade-offs, only a supportive environment.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes remain purely philosophical with no opposition, risk, or visible cost; the narrative lacks the pressure required to force a meaningful decision. The resolution arrives via a realization triggered by an external event, bypassing the need for the protagonist to overcome resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is minimal because the protagonist faces no active opposition; he simply obeys the coordinates provided by the origami. There is no moment where he must choose between two difficult paths or sacrifice something significant to proceed. The stakes remain abstract (emotional closure) and are resolved without a visible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from intellectual curiosity to personal risk via the text messages. The pressure forces a crystallization of stance—replying to the number—which carries the felt cost of losing objectivity and entering the "map."

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=4.1)
    Escalation is minimal; Elara enters, immediately finds the target, and the conflict dissolves through a magical interaction. The threat of the archive "twisting patterns" is stated but never enacted as a pressure on the page. The dominant stake (purification vs. entrapment) evaporates rather than tightening into a dilemma requiring a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=4.4)
    Tension is minimal; the "shadow unbound" is described as skittish rather than threatening, acting more as scenery than an antagonist. The protagonist controls the pacing entirely, and the climax requires no escalation of effort or painful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=5.0)
    Conflict is entirely retrospective and internal; the antagonist is absent, and the central action (repairing the tail) encounters no resistance or risk. The stakes are abstract (worldview adjustment) rather than immediate, resulting in a flat narrative arc without escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is minimal; Elias faces no active opposition or significant difficult choices, merely following a path laid out for him. The "cost" of the anesthesia wearing off provides physical texture but does not force a trade-off or alter his tactics in a meaningful way. The resolution—relief from pain—feels unearned because the protagonist did not have to struggle or sacrifice to achieve it.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=4.9)
    Escalation is linear and lacks genuine opposition; Mira touches the object, sees the vision, and retrieves the prize without facing a meaningful obstacle or making a difficult trade-off. The stakes remain abstract ("unused love") rather than dangerously immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=3.9)
    Stakes remain abstract and strictly internal; the creative block is declared but never tested against a concrete, on-page obstacle or antagonist. The climax lacks escalation, resolving the central tension through a convenient magical intervention that removes the need for a trade-off or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the protagonist faces no opposition, external antagonist, or difficult trade-off. The stakes are abstract ("world is burning") and resolved by a Deus Ex Machina explanation, allowing the protagonist to accept a monumental task without a moment of doubt or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes are purely abstract, with no opposing force or obstacle to generate tension; the protagonist wants to find the frontier and simply does so. The journey proceeds without setbacks or risks, resulting in a linear path devoid of the friction required for a compelling narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=4.8)
    Tension is minimal; the protagonist faces no active opposition, and the ferryman facilitates her journey without challenge. The conflict is internal and retrospective (her past job) rather than immediate; the stakes remain metaphorical ("finding courage") and lack immediate physical or relational consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.2)
    Tension dissipates rapidly during the climax because the antagonist is helpful rather than obstructive. The stakes are discussed philosophically rather than dramatized through a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.5)
    Immediate pressure is negligible; the protagonist faces no active antagonist or obstacle in the scene other than a loose stone. The central conflict is resolved by a static character trait ("unbroken") rather than an escalated struggle or tactical adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are intellectual rather than visceral; the personal cost of the investigation is low. The narrative relies on unearned intensifiers like “pulse quickening” and “breath hitched” to simulate tension that isn’t structurally present.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.0)
    The story lacks immediate active opposition; the conflict is primarily historical (the failed rebellion) rather than present in the bay. The escalation consists of Lira walking closer to the stones as the hum gets louder, which is a progression of intensity but not complexity or risk. Without an obstacle or a moment where she almost turns back, the stakes feel low.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.0)
    Immediate pressure is low; the antagonist (the Council) is abstract and off-page, making the stakes theoretical rather than viscerally felt in the moment. The conflict resolves through destined ability rather than a desperate trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.8)
    The external pressure of the drone flyover effectively forces Lena’s internal reaction, crystallizing her stance on endurance. The stakes are clear, though the resolution feels slightly dampened by the convenient explanation found in the ledger rather than a raw confrontation with ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.8)
    External pressure is metaphorical and resolved by a state change (waking) rather than a decisive action with irreversible consequences. The conflict remains internal and abstract, lacking a concrete antagonist or obstacle that cannot be simply thought away by the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=4.8)
    The immediate pressure (the dying child) resolves too easily when the ink moves on its own, deflating tension before Elias makes a significant choice. The antagonist is abstract and distant, resulting in a conflict that lacks direct opposition or escalation on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes are clear (personal risk vs. revealing truth), and the pressure of the "stirring networks" adds necessary tension. The climax forces a distinct action, though the opposition remains largely environmental and atmospheric rather than active.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=4.4)
    High stakes (life/death bounty) are declared but effectively vanish at the climax, as the antagonist provides no resistance after the initial confrontation. The conflict deflates rather than escalates, resulting in a scene devoid of the friction required to test the protagonist's resolve. There is no visible price paid for the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=5.0)
    Escalation is external and atmospheric ("sky unraveled") rather than driven by protagonist agency or difficult choices. The climax is a ritual enactment that succeeds smoothly; without a visible forfeiture, risk, or trade-off, the stakes feel abstract despite their declared scale.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes are clearly established (erasure of truth, danger to self) and escalate appropriately through the journalist's warnings. The conflict is primarily external/institutional ("They"), which works for the genre, though the opposition remains somewhat abstract. The final choice carries a felt cost—leaving her sanctuary to face danger.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.7)
    The escalation is coherent, moving from ambient dissonance to specific, translated accusations that force the protagonist's hand. The stakes are intensely personal, though the resolution—tattooing as a method to quell the external noise—feels slightly convenient, resolving the external pressure (the machine's cries) somewhat too neatly through an internal act.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.3)
    The central conflict is internal and environmental; the friction with Maren is brief and resolves without significant tactical struggle. While the stakes of "finding meaning" are abstract, the pressure of the shifting mandala provides a concrete focus, though the final breakthrough feels relatively low-resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.6)
    The internal stakes are well-defined, pitting personal trauma against a philosophical commitment to mercy. The pressure escalates appropriately as she physically engages with the stone, turning the abstract conflict into a concrete choice.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.7)
    The narrative lacks significant immediate pressure; Elias waits for tourists to leave and performs a ritual he seems to have mastered, removing the sense of risk or urgency. The conflict relies entirely on Liora's hesitation, but since Elias never wavers or faces a genuine obstacle to his goal, the stakes feel theoretical ("fragile thing") rather than immediate. A "meaningful tightening" occurs, but the cost is not deeply felt by the protagonist on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.0)
    The stakes remain largely internal and low-pressure; Mara’s struggle is one of curiosity rather than urgent necessity or survival. While the realization changes her worldview, the lack of external opposition or a tangible cost for her transformation limits the dramatic tension. The conflict resolves too smoothly, with acceptance coming as a relief rather than a hard-won conceptual repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.0)
    Escalation is driven almost entirely by the external entity, leaving the protagonist with little agency beyond submission. The climax lacks a moment where Eira must foreclose a viable path or make a difficult trade-off; she simply accepts the inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.0)
    The stakes are low and primarily abstract; the conflict is man-versus-task rather than a pressure cooker of opposing forces. While the reversal of sand is a clear turn, the lack of a visible cost or deeper obstacle makes the victory feel inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.2)
    External conflict is virtually absent; the door opens "without resistance," and the mission file is waiting conveniently. The stakes are internal but are resolved too easily by the prop (the pillbox/key) rather than a hard choice or sacrifice. There is no escalation of pressure; the path to resolution is linear and unobstructed.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.7)
    The conflict (Nature/Time vs. Duty) is functional, but the escalation is mild; the solution (sewing the rope) proceeds without a significant complication or sacrifice. The tension is palpable but resolves too neatly into "serenity" without a felt cost paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the protagonist and the environment share the same goal, and no antagonist or obstacle creates friction. There is no escalation of stakes; the "thrumming" increases, but Ren never faces a moment where he must risk something valuable to succeed. The ending is a symmetrical satisfaction that requires no sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are primarily emotional and low-pressure; there is no resistance to the exchange, making the climax feel inevitable rather than earned. The cost is paid (loss of the relic), but the lack of friction or hesitation reduces the dramatic weight of the decision.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are low and abstract; the protagonist faces no active opposition, and the only potential conflict (the curator’s warning) is dismissed immediately without testing her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.1)
    Stakes remain largely abstract and intellectual (understanding the pattern). The conflict is gentle, and the resolution comes without significant pressure or the foreclosure of a meaningful alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=4.0)
    There is negligible escalation; Mara possesses the solution from the start and implements it with no effective resistance. The stakes are declared ("reality itself unraveled") but remain abstract, and Voss’s skepticism folds immediately, robbing the scene of genuine pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.5)
    Pressure builds well via the environment, but the climax lacks a visible, felt cost; Elias accepts the "burden" of truth without meaningful hesitation or sacrifice, making the victory feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=4.2)
    There is virtually no conflict or pressure; the antagonist is abstract and off-page, and the "stranger" offers no resistance, providing the weapon, motive, and backstory immediately. The protagonist faces no difficult choices or trade-offs, making the escalation flat. The stake of "solving the case" is resolved by convenience rather than struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake of uncovering the truth is established early, but the escalation is dampened because the environment solves the primary physical barrier for the protagonist. The final decision to "finish what he started" reads as a stated resolution rather than a dramatized struggle with a visible, paid cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.2)
    There is almost zero on-page pressure or opposition. The hitchhiker is absent, the rain is ambient ("applause"), and the protagonist's only action is to play music and leave. Without a dominant stake or a moment where options narrow, the story drifts in a "safe middle" where nothing is risked and consequently nothing is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.9)
    The internal conflict is clear, but the stakes remain abstract and low-pressure; the "tightening" comes from rain and a fox rather than a forcing antagonist or urgent constraint. The cost is carried rather than paid, leaving the resolution feeling safe.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.9)
    The stakes are largely abstract and internal, centering on a puzzle and emotional weight without immediate, tangible consequences on the page. The conflict lacks a sharp escalation point; the pressure is described ("weight pressing down") rather than dramatized through an urgent obstacle that forces a trade-off or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are established early and escalate viscerally through the physical pain of the plant and the psychological deepening of the memories. The cost is palpable on the page—both the physical toll and the social/emotional price of the revealed truth.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; Elias wants to go to the glade, the glade welcomes him, and the woman accepts him without friction. There is no active antagonist, no internal reluctance, and no mutually exclusive goal to force a hard choice; the stakes of the "eclipsed covenant" remain abstract concepts rather than felt pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are high and clearly defined: the brother’s return versus the memory of him. The stranger’s refusal of the initial offer (the tarot card) escalates the pressure naturally, forcing Liora to pay a more personal price.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.2)
    The internal stakes are clear, but the external escalation is weak. The pressure comes from a sudden, unearned encounter rather than a tightening of options. Jake’s decision to give up the cloth is a renunciation, but because it is prompted by a friendly face rather than forced by circumstance, the cost feels diminished.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; Elara faces no antagonist, no time limit, no physical danger, and no agonizing trade-off. The stakes (understanding the spirit) are intellectual and abstract, and the resolution requires no payment—she simply succeeds because the plot demands it. The narrative lacks the escalation required to make the ending feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are low and purely internal; there is no external pressure or obstacle to the ritual. The resolution (release) feels inevitable, and the potential conflict between his duty as a librarian and his urge to release is not developed into a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.7)
    Stakes are low and primarily internal, with the external inspection offering little resistance. The resolution comes too easily; the "weight" of the task is described but not felt through pressure or difficult trade-offs, making the final release feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.0)
    Internal pressure is high, fueled by the guilt of the drowning and the physical withdrawal symptoms. The map serves as a tangible focus for the conflict, and the decision to abandon the search for forgiveness acts as a meaningful tightening of stakes. External pressure is minimal but sufficient for this introspective scope.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.1)
    Stakes are declared ("seal her fate") but never tested by genuine opposition; the library functions as a helper, removing conflict. The narrative lacks a moment of true pressure where the protagonist must choose between two exclusive values; consequently, the ending feels like a gift rather than an earned victory.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are high and effectively escalated by the plants' warning and the father's arrival. The pivot in the plants' pressure—from accusation to urging—forces the climax, though their sudden alliance feels slightly convenient to facilitate the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is minimal; the opposition (Death) is abstract and immediately mitigated by the functioning emerald chip. The stakes are theoretical ("hold back the dark") rather than visceral, as the ritual proceeds without error, resource scarcity, or personal sacrifice. The lack of opposition turns the scene into a demonstration rather than a story.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=4.7)
    The stakes are purely internal and abstract ("contentment") with no external pressure to force a timeline or trade-off. The conflict resolves without a difficult choice; Mira simply receives an answer and accepts it, resulting in low narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are stated ("razor’s edge between truth and deception") but feel abstract and low-pressure on the page. The escalation relies on external signals (chimes clattering, mirror pulsing) rather than character agency or rising interpersonal friction. The resolution lacks a "felt price"; Elias simply accepts the nuance, making the outcome feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.0)
    External pressure is minimal; the environment is benevolent and compliant, offering only a "subtle pull." The conflict is entirely internal and resolved relatively easily through the trance, lacking a moment where Elara is forced to make a difficult trade-off or face a genuine risk of failure. The stakes feel theoretical rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=2.8)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; there is no antagonist, ticking clock, or immediate physical danger to force a hard choice. The "stakes" remain abstract intellectual concepts ("understanding the pulse") without any potential for loss or failure on the page. Elias observes and executes a procedure without facing opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake (self-worth) is clear, but the cost paid (the satchel of books) is symbolic and relatively low-stakes in the moment. The conflict resolves through an external figure explaining the solution, which dampens the sense of earned escalation or genuine risk.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=3.8)
    Pressure is minimal; the protagonist faces no significant opposition or difficult choices. The "countdown" is internal and abstract, and the encounter with the woman lacks friction as she immediately explains the mystery. The stakes remain theoretical rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain largely philosophical and abstract, lacking immediate consequence or pressure. The primary conflict is internal confusion, which resolves instantly upon the character's change of mindset, making the victory feel unearned and the cost negligible.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=4.2)
    There is no meaningful opposition; the "nameless fears" are passive and wait to be dismissed. The stakes are theoretical ("the dead had no need of memory"), and Elias faces no risk of failure or demand for sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.1)
    The conflict is internalized within the mending process, with the "perfect rhythm" acting as the pressure point. While external opposition is passive (entropy), the tension of the ritual ("Too fast... too slow") effectively escalates the stakes on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=5.0)
    The stakes remain largely internal and abstract ("rising tide of forgetting") until the final paragraph. The scavenger hunt structure dissipates tension, as the clues are presented sequentially without active struggle or obstruction. The "mystery" resolves too easily with the final photo providing a neat answer rather than a complicating dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.9)
    Escalation is mostly reflective; the dominant stake ("final transformation") is declared but lacks immediate on-page pressure or opposition to force the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.3)
    Pressure is coherent and escalates effectively through the environment (wind, snapping branch). The physical stakes are immediate and high, and the protagonist’s agency (making the harness) directly impacts the outcome of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.8)
    The stakes (emotional vitality) are clear and the sparring provides a physical manifestation of the conflict. The escalation is linear, though the resolution feels slightly unearned due to the speed of Kael's acceptance after the mentor's lecture.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.0)
    The antagonist ("They") remains generic and undefined, creating abstract rather than visceral pressure. The escalation depends on the arrival of boxes in summary rather than active confrontation, making the "reckoning" feel manufactured.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is largely retrospective (past police calls) or abstract (grief). The on-page obstacle (sputtering engine) creates only momentary, mechanical pressure that is easily overcome. The stakes are high in theory (a child's voice) but the lack of active opposition or difficult trade-offs renders the tension low.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is minimal; the guardian acts as a facilitator rather than an obstacle, offering immediate passage without testing Mara's resolve. The stakes are purely internal and abstract ("seeking answers"), and the lack of external pressure or a difficult trade-off leaves the narrative tension flat.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are clear—his life's work versus the crushing weight of failure—and the choice to destroy the mentor's relic is a meaningful escalation. The pressure builds coherently, though the "penny drop" moment acts as a slightly convenient switch for the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.2)
    External stakes (the tower collapsing) provide good pressure, but the resolution creates a disconnect; the protagonist transcends the physical danger via a magical exit, muting the cost. The internal conflict is resolved too easily by the external voice's instruction.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are declared ("ferry was vanishing") but never viscerally felt; the protagonist faces no real opposition and pays no price for success. The resolution is instant and frictionless, devoid of the necessary tightening or sacrifice required for effective conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=4.2)
    Tension is undermined by the protagonist's lack of resistance ("Elias didn't panic") and the abstract nature of the threat; the stakes of leaving reality are not dramatized as a loss or difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are declared ("old ways felt like whispers") but never truly threatened; the opposition is mild and quickly resolved without sacrifice. The escalation happens largely off-page in summary, robbing the climax of tension. The resolution feels like a foregone conclusion rather than a choice made under pressure with a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.4)
    Opposition is present via Elias and the environment, but the escalation is somewhat linear (warning -> ignore -> consequence). The stakes are high, but the protagonist's agency consists mostly of ignoring a warning rather than active tactical shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.5)
    The ticking clock of the incoming tide creates effective situational pressure that forces the protagonist's pace and narrows his options. The stakes escalate naturally from physical survival to a metaphysical trade-off, ensuring the final renunciation of the "real" world is a high-cost decision.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes remain abstract and internal without a moment of "tightening" where Elias faces a genuine trade-off or risk. The interaction with the ghost is low-pressure; he receives reassurance without paying a price, resulting in a flat dramatic arc where the resolution feels inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=3.4)
    Escalation is absent; Elara enters, attempts her method, and immediately succeeds. The narrative dismisses the potential antagonist (the curse/madness) before it can apply pressure, leaving the victory unearned by sacrifice or adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.8)
    Escalation is present via the heating arrowhead and the ringing phone, creating a clear path to the climax. However, the protagonist's resistance is minimal; Maren's warning is quickly bypassed, making the final surrender feel slightly inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=3.7)
    Conflict dissolves immediately upon contact; the statues offer only a single lunge before being left behind, and the mechanical world resists the music only momentarily. There is no meaningful escalation or tightening of options, as every obstacle is overcome by the protagonist's first attempt.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are legible but largely thematic; the threat of the drone and the "erasure" are atmospheric pressures rather than acute forces testing Jace in this specific scene. The conflict remains static (Man vs. System/Time), and while the endurance is noble, the lack of a sharp, immediate escalation or trade-off limits the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the world cooperates with Elias at every turn, from the wind bells chiming in sympathy to the train waking upon command. There is no antagonist, internal doubt, or physical limitation to overcome. The escalation is purely atmospheric, lacking the tightening of options or the raising of stakes required for narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=3.9)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; Elias faces no antagonist, internal doubt, or significant obstacle in achieving his goal. The transition to the other world is effortless, resulting in a discovery narrative devoid of dramatic tension or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are purely theoretical; Elias faces no genuine opposition, failure, or sacrifice in his pursuit. The progression from blurry photos to clear ones is a linear montage of patience without setbacks, rendering the climax inevitable and tension-free.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.3)
    Pressure is negligible as the protagonist faces no active opposition, time constraint, or dilemma; the act of untying the ribbon is mechanical. The stakes regarding the village's history are declared in exposition but never tested on the page, resulting in a flat narrative arc without escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are clear and high: sanity and family against oblivion. The pressure escalates naturally from intellectual research to physical danger (tide/cold) to psychological confrontation. The cost of failure is palpably felt in the final line, with the permanent loss of Liora reweighting the protagonist's future.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.5)
    The internal stakes are clear (exile vs. connection), but the external conflict is low-pressure, relying on a child's gentle curiosity which lacks significant resistance. The "combative tenderness" suggested by the prompt is not fully dramatized in the interaction, which remains largely soft and didactic.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent; there is no antagonist, internal doubt, or environmental obstacle to test Maren’s goal. The stakes ("preserving the color of wonder") remain abstract and theoretical because the success is immediate and effortless. Without a "try/fail" cycle or a moment where the outcome is in doubt, there is no true escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.6)
    The stakes are clear and escalate naturally from a technical restoration challenge to a moral confrontation. The appearance of the Fisher King serves as an effective threshold guardian, crystallizing Elias's commitment to the cost of his action.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.9)
    The stakes remain largely internal and abstract (curiosity, historical truth) with low immediate opposition; the rusted lock yields easily, and the cost of the action is minimal on the page. The tension relies more on atmospheric dread than active pressure or difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=5.9)
    The stakes shift from salvage to metaphysical release, but the cost remains abstract; the weight of the globe is "negligible," and the protagonist's sacrifice is a low-friction compliance with a request. The conflict lacks a moment of genuine resistance or dilemma where the protagonist must weigh the value of the artifact against the moral imperative.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.2)
    The stakes are relatively low; the opposition is primarily the passive "fading" of the ghost rather than active resistance. The approaching storm provides a framing device for urgency but does not exert sufficient pressure on Elias's choices until the very end. The resolution comes too easily—music and a touch solve the problem immediately—resulting in a lack of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.2)
    The central conflict lacks visceral pressure; the captain’s reaction to a servant breaking in and using her personal items is implausibly mild. The stakes feel low because the threat of punishment is quickly dismissed in favor of a philosophical exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are largely internal and static until the climax. The escalation relies entirely on the *Astraea* appearing; without this coincidence, the narrative lacks a mechanism to force the protagonist's hand, making the pressure feel situational rather than driven by agency.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.0)
    External pressure is low; while the demolition provides a ticking clock, Liora moves with a calm that deflates urgency. The primary conflict is internal, but the resolution—abandoning the quest's object—lacks a visceral sense of loss or consequence, making the stakes feel abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=3.8)
    There is virtually no conflict or pressure; Elias wants to find a path and immediately finds it with no obstacles, setbacks, or risks. The stakes (earning a sigil) are stated but never tested, resulting in a low-tension narrative. Success comes too easily to generate narrative drive or emotional investment.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=3.2)
    Tension collapses when the protagonist’s actions are described as "effortless" at the pivotal moment; the gears fit together without trial or error. There is no active antagonist, environmental hazard, or internal inhibitor to force a difficult trade-off, leaving the stakes purely theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is negligible; the "opposition" (adult skepticism) dissolves in a single sentence, and the stakes—while stated—are never felt because the solution requires no sacrifice or difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are conceptually high (end of the world) but the on-page conflict lacks friction; Elias's decision is relatively smooth. The cost is abstract—the end of existence—and while thematic, it lacks a visceral, immediate price paid by the character in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dual pressure of the approaching frost and the patrolling birds creates effective urgency. The stakes are clear—a life for a life—and the climax delivers a tangible resolution that respects the established rules of the curse.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is entirely internal and retrospective; there is no active opposition or external stakes in the present moment to force a difficult decision. The resolution comes too easily through a moment of reflection, lacking the "meaningful tightening" or trade-off required for higher tension.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal and philosophical, lacking urgent pressure or risk; the "lull" described in the text pervades the dramatic arc. While the transaction represents a tightening of sorts, the cost (losing an unpriced bottle, gaining a sigh) is symbolic and does not force a difficult trade-off or tangible sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=3.3)
    Conflict is static and lacks escalation; Maren encounters no meaningful resistance or setbacks. The "struggle" consists of a single exchange of dialogue, failing to generate the pressure or cost required for a 600–800 word narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=2.0)
    Dominant stakes (loneliness) are declared but never tested; the protagonist faces zero opposition from the clock, the town, or herself. The resolution is immediate and total, lacking the requisite tightening or necessary trade-offs for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.5)
    The central conflict (fixing vs. witnessing) is established, but the resolution lacks high-stakes agency; the opposition (the memory) explicitly tells Lena what to do ("You don't have to fix it"), resolving the tension for her. The cost—abandoning her "period of profound transformation"—is stated but felt less viscerally than the relief.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=3.6)
    Stakes remain abstract ("unravel the present") and theoretical, never grounding in a specific, immediate threat to the protagonist's safety or identity. There is no active opposition or escalation; Elara simply walks in, takes the object, and leaves, resulting in a flat narrative arc devoid of genuine pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=4.0)
    Tension is minimal; the primary obstacle (silence) yields immediately to the protagonist's first attempts without escalation. There is no moment where failure creates a consequence, resulting in a flat narrative arc devoid of meaningful stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are abstract; while the "next phase" is mentioned, there is no felt urgency or ticking clock driving the scene. The conflict is minimal as the protagonist and the newcomer align instantly without opposition or misunderstanding. The resolution comes without a significant sacrifice or loss, keeping the narrative tension low.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the external pressure of the fireworks is well-established, the central conflict dissolves too easily. Liora’s immediate cooperation removes the need for Elias to make a difficult trade-off or navigate a true interpersonal struggle, resulting in low emotional stakes at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=4.1)
    Conflict is minimal; the confrontation with Nara lacks genuine pressure as the antagonist immediately capitulates and provides the solution. The stakes (madness vs. serenity) are high in exposition but absent in the scene, which plays out as a polite conversation rather than a crucible of conflicting values.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=4.6)
    While the ticking clock provides surface tension, the protagonist faces no meaningful trade-offs or hard choices. The climax involves listening to voices rather than a decision that forces a sacrifice or creates significant consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.9)
    Escalation is steady and clear, moving from observation to survival stakes effectively. The pressure tightens through distinct sensory beats, though the antagonist's capabilities are revealed somewhat conveniently to force the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.4)
    Escalation works through the rhythmic interruption of the chisel, but the climax lacks a felt cost; the protagonist wins by trying harder, and the external pressure evaporates instantly upon success without exacting a price.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.5)
    The stakes are declared but the resolution lacks a visible, felt cost on the page; the protagonist solves the problem by following instructions without a meaningful trade-off or sacrifice. The tension resolves into a "soft reset" where the world is fixed simply by playing the right tune.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.5)
    Pressure escalates adequately through the intensifying voices and the arrival of the antagonist, leading to a single meaningful tightening (the theft of the voice). While the stakes are ostensibly cosmic, the conflict resolves somewhat abruptly with the woman's arrival and the fragment's dissolution. The cost is visible (hollowness, loss of the artifact), fulfilling the requirement for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=4.2)
    The conflict lacks genuine pressure; the "antagonist" serves as a helpful guide who resolves the tension immediately via explanation. The stakes remain abstract, and the protagonist’s immediate compliance removes the potential for escalating drama or hard choices.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=4.7)
    Stakes remain abstract and intellectual; Elias faces no opposition, risks nothing, and succeeds in his ritual on the first try. The "weight of doubt" is mentioned but not demonstrated as a pressure that forces a hard choice or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.1)
    Escalation is dampened by the summary of the journey; the stakes remain theoretical until the final tableau. The obstacle of "impossible distance" is resolved via narration rather than dramatized choice or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=4.2)
    Escalation is virtually absent; the protagonist identifies a problem and solves it with a magical tool without facing resistance, setbacks, or conflicting needs. The absence of obstacles or secondary stakes prevents any meaningful tension from accumulating.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are clear—truth versus safety—and escalation is handled efficiently through the appearance of the double. The pressure crystallizes in the forced physical contact, narrowing the protagonist's options to a binary choice. The cost of "unraveling everything" is abstract but sufficiently weighted by the doppelganger's warning.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.6)
    The emotional stakes are clear, and the cost paid—leaving the daughter's sea glass—is substantial and felt. This sacrifice effectively resolves the internal conflict of isolation, creating a meaningful tightening despite the murkier external mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.6)
    Stakes are declared but not tested; there is no active opposition, risk of failure, or difficult trade-off on the page. The "accidental" nature of the prophecy is immediately smoothed over by Veyra's skill, deflating potential tension.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no opposition, time pressure, or mutually exclusive options. The epiphany is achieved through passive observation of a visitor's gift, lacking a moment of tightening where a high-stakes decision is forced.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=4.2)
    Escalation is weak because the central conflict (grief/hunger of the tower) dissolves upon the climax. The trees' message ("We remember so you don't have to") explicitly removes the burden from the protagonist, negating the potential for a felt cost or trade-off. The pressure evaporates rather than resolving.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=3.7)
    Conflict is theoretical rather than dramatized; the antagonist is a passive state (darkness) that offers no active opposition. Escalation is missing, as the protagonist faces no significant obstacles between receiving the seed and succeeding. The stakes are high in concept ("dying realm") but lack felt, on-page weight.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are primarily internal and abstract; the ticking clock adds mechanical urgency but doesn't fundamentally alter the cost of the decision. The conflict is resolved too easily by the magical discovery of the map, robbing the protagonist of the need to search or sacrifice to find his destination.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.2)
    Pressure is low and largely internal; the stakes rely on Elias's vague sense of unsettledness rather than a forced trade-off or urgent threat. While the planting is a decisive act, the "absolution" frame feels inflated for the scale of the inciting incident.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=5.1)
    Stakes are high in the abstract (oblivion) but low in the scene; the conflict is resolved by a gentle adjustment of a machine. The narrative lacks a meaningful tightening where Elias must sacrifice something personal or tangible to succeed; the "fight" is described but not dramatized through escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.6)
    The conflict escalates to a knife-point crisis but deflates instantly upon Lena's interference. The antagonists offer no meaningful resistance to her claim, resulting in a resolution with low felt cost and minimal tension.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes are purely abstract (curiosity) and face no concrete opposition; the "storm man" is immediately helpful rather than antagonistic or complicating. The narrative lacks a meaningful tightening or reversal, resulting in a flat trajectory without earned escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=4.1)
    Conflict is negligible; the protagonist faces no active opposition, time pressure, or dilemma, merely following a trail of clues. The stakes remain abstract ("rectify what had been broken") with no visible cost or risk of failure on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the protagonist encounters no obstacles, resistance, or hard choices while following the map. The narrative is a linear sequence of tasks rather than an escalation of pressure or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.5)
    The conflict is Man vs. Entropy/Silence, which risks abstraction, but the physical degradation of the ice grounds it. The escalation from using a found natural object to taking a human artifact (the toy) marks a clear intensification of tactics. The cost is legible—the sacrifice of a preserved memory for a broadcast signal.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure escalates coherently from the environmental trigger to the internal breaking point. The decision to trigger the burn forces a meaningful trade-off between his sanctuary/duty and his sanity, resulting in an irreversible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.1)
    Stakes are low and external to the protagonist, who risks nothing personal in the pursuit. The narrative lacks escalation, proceeding smoothly from discovery to resolution without obstacles, reversals, or a moment where the outcome is in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.7)
    External pressure (the sinking lab) is established, but the protagonist faces no difficult trade-offs or active opposition. She follows a path laid out by the ghost and the dice, resulting in low on-page conflict and a cost that feels abstract rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—the choice between oblivion and a dangerous truth—is signaled early and escalates clearly. The external pressure of the gravity shifts creates a tangible cost that forces the final decision.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=3.4)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent, as the protagonist's struggle is resolved internally before the scene begins. There are no competing stakes, obstacles, or visible costs to the decision; the "release" is a net-positive transaction that lacks the friction required to generate narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=5.5)
    Tension is low; the characters align almost immediately, dissolving potential conflict into mutual exposition. There is no moment where Elara must choose between protecting her secret or connecting with Mira; the lack of friction or trade-off flattens the dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=4.0)
    External antagonism (the government/officials) is abstract and absent from the scene, resulting in low tension. The resolution offers a "symmetric satisfaction" where Elias gains everything (his sister, freedom) without paying a visible or felt cost; the conflict simply evaporates upon his assent.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.0)
    Pressure evaporates instantly at the climax when the antagonist ceases to act, resolving a life-or-death confrontation with a document reveal that lacks coercive power. The stakes are high in theory but low in practice, as the opponent offers no meaningful resistance in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=3.6)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent; no force opposes the protagonist, and the resolution requires no sacrifice. The "wound" of the shell implies cost, but the climax is a frictionless agreement.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake (Truth vs. Silence) is clear, but the climax relies on a brief, somewhat cliché exchange ("Ask the ones who lived") that deflates the tension. The ghost’s appearance functions more as a post-script confirmation than a pressure point forcing the protagonist's hand. The cost of silence is present but feels like a standard genre resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; there is no obstacle to Ren's desire or Mei's arrival, and the stakes of solitude vs. connection are never tested. The narrative lacks escalation, resulting in a flat trajectory where the protagonist faces no true dilemma or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=3.6)
    Tension evaporates the moment the stranger appears, as the potential threat immediately de-escalates into an alliance without testing the protagonist. There is no sustained pressure or escalation; the obstacles (letters, guard) are removed by "intuition" and benevolence respectively.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=3.9)
    The antagonist provides zero effective pressure; Kael’s immediate capitulation renders the conflict theoretical and the victory unearned. The stakes of "variant allegiance" are resolved too easily by the light show, bypassing the need for a struggle that would force Elias to pay a price for leadership.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pressure is low throughout; the transition from failure to success with the jars occurs in summary without visible cost or failure analysis. The conflict is entirely internal until the girl arrives, and her immediate acceptance resolves the tension without testing Elias's commitment or forcing a sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are clear and escalation is present, moving from stealth to sonic combat. The cost is visible (risk of shattering), though the antagonist's defeat is swift and the physical struggle is relatively brief.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the protagonist faces no obstacles, and the stranger arrives and is accepted without friction or risk. The stakes of the revolution remain abstract declarations ("a whisper," "a vibration") rather than immediate, felt pressures with visible costs.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=3.8)
    The conflict is deflated by the villain explicitly monologuing his plan to subordinates, removing the need for the protagonist to deduce it. The climax lacks a true trade-off; Elias acts (sends the text) without facing a dilemma or paying a price for his safety.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes are legible and escalate from a request for information to a moral imperative for justice. The cost is felt in the weight of the protagonist's realization, though the shift relies heavily on the off-page backstory of the surgeon.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are clear and escalated effectively by the physical threat of the dissolving workshop. The conflict between survival (Veyra’s pragmatism) and meaning (Elias’s obsession) is well-balanced. The climax delivers a tangible shift in pressure, transitioning from the threat of destruction to a moment of communication.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are declared ("erasing existence") but not felt as immediate pressure in the scene; the antagonist is an abstract system that does not push back on the page. The danger is theoretical ("She knew she should stop") rather than visceral (e.g., a supervisor watching, access logs flagging), making the final choice feel weightless.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=3.8)
    While the threat escalates, the protagonist overcomes the climax with unearned ease, paying no visible or felt price. The victory is absolute and immediate, lacking the trade-off or struggle required for high-stakes tension.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    Conflict is internal but externalized effectively through the interaction with the dying man. The stakes escalate from passive observation to active engagement, and the cost of the transition is paid on the page via the heirloom object.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=4.2)
    Tension evaporates immediately; Elias apologizes and Liora accepts with minimal resistance. The stakes of "destined mismatches" are raised but never tested in the scene, resulting in a flat trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=3.6)
    Conflict is negligible; there is no antagonist, internal doubt, or environmental obstacle that genuinely threatens the protagonist's goal. The stakes ("echo of wisdom") remain abstract, and the resolution comes through instruction rather than a pressure-driven decision or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent; there is no opposition (internal or external) preventing Elias from achieving his goal. The stakes remain abstract ("honor their lives") and are never tested by failure or distinct trade-offs on the page. The escalation is merely chronological (light appearing) rather than a tightening of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are intellectual—decoding a pattern—which fits the scholar archetype but lacks immediate on-page pressure or resistance. The escalation is a smooth ramp of successful tests rather than a struggle against constraints or antagonism, limiting the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.0)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no active opposition or trade-offs, merely the task of completing a ritual. The stakes are theoretical (hearing a sound) rather than visceral, and the escalation relies on the procedural placing of sticks rather than rising interpersonal or internal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.4)
    The external pressure is effectively managed; the failing stabilizers and shaking foundations create a tangible ticking clock that forces the protagonist's hand. The stakes are clear and high (survival vs. art), and the escalation tracks well with the text's brevity, leading to a decisive, if abstract, victory.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent; there is no resistance, internal doubt, or external barrier to the protagonist's goal. The interaction is frictionless—Lena asks, and Elias provides—which flattens the dramatic stakes despite the gravity of the deathbed scenario.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=3.9)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the protagonist faces no antagonism, and obstacles yield immediately to the key she already possesses. The stakes remain abstract ("where do shadows go?") and fail to escalate, as the guardian functions as a guide rather than an opposing force. The resolution lacks a felt price, rendering the climax purely mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=4.9)
    Tension is low as the protagonist faces no active opposition, time pressure, or significant obstacles; the solution is achieved through a magical transaction rather than a high-stakes struggle. The lack of a moment where the outcome is in doubt or a sacrifice is required flattens the dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=4.4)
    Stakes are declared (the village's need for light) but are not tested by genuine opposition in the scene; the protagonist overcomes the barrier by simply walking forward and touching the object. There is no moment where failure feels plausible, and the lack of escalation results in a flat dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.5)
    Escalation is muted; Mira is already waiting for him, and her immediate acceptance of the notebook dissolves potential tension before it can peak. The stakes are intelligible, but the lack of opposition or difficult trade-offs results in a scene that feels pre-resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.4)
    The escalation is well-managed, moving from a visual cameo to an interactive one, culminating in a direct confrontation with the core conflict (the unfinished character). The stakes are personal and internal, raising the pressure effectively within the short scope.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are abstract and the opposition is non-existent within the scene; the villagers' disbelief is off-page and hypothetical. The protagonist encounters no resistance from the magic or the environment, resulting in a flat escalation curve where success is immediate and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.0)
    Pressure is maintained through atmospheric tension ("the world held its breath"), fitting the lyric mode. However, the stakes are purely internal and thematic; with no external antagonism or sharp resource trade-off beyond the materials used, the escalation feels gentle rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.1)
    The conflict is primarily internal and abstract (fixing the machine vs. the silence). While the appearance of the "echo" provides a moment of escalation, the stakes remain low and the resolution comes without a significant palpable cost to the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.6)
    Stakes are declared ("calcified air would claim her") but never felt; the protagonist controls the pacing perfectly and exits the ritual before the cost becomes unavoidable. The burden's "sharp pain" is mentioned but does not force a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes are purely internal, and the conflict resolves too smoothly through an artistic flow state without a visible trade-off or escalated struggle. The ease with which the wood "yields" lowers the felt cost of the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.8)
    External pressure is low, leaving the conflict almost entirely internal. While the confrontation with the ghost attempts to raise stakes, the dialogue ("Time doesn't care") resolves the tension through platitude rather than a difficult trade-off. The final release is a valid cost, but the path to it feels frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent; Mara faces no external danger, time pressure, or opposing force to test her resolve. The stakes remain purely abstract, resulting in a flat narrative trajectory where the climax is a polite exchange of ideas rather than a decisive, cost-laden choice.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.0)
    Conflict is mild; the music box repair succeeds without setback, and the "massive" bear offers no resistance, danger, or trade-off. The narrative lacks a meaningful tightening of stakes, as the protagonist moves from one success to another without facing a genuine dilemma or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes remain abstract ("forgotten truths") and the pressure is low; the protagonist faces no significant opposition or difficult choice beyond opening a crate. The resolution is passive—the reflection speaks the answer—rather than driven by protagonist agency or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=4.4)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the pressure comes only from the weather (fog/snow), which functions as scenery rather than a true obstacle forcing a hard choice. The stakes are abstract and historical ("preserve ancient methods") with no immediate consequence for failure in this specific scene. The protagonist faces no active opposition or dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.8)
    External pressure is minimal; the stakes are theoretical (the kingdom's healing) rather than immediate to the protagonist in the moment. The escalation is purely internal, lacking a tightening of options or a forced trade-off with tangible on-page consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are clear and escalate from the risk of breaking the egg to the realization of a wasted methodology. The protagonist's renunciation of his mechanical skills represents a valid conceptual cost, though the physical stakes of the environment (the groaning palace) remain largely atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=2.5)
    There is virtually no conflict or pressure; the child offers no resistance and serves only as a prompt for the protagonist's wisdom. The stakes remain abstract and untested, with no escalation or difficult choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is low-stakes and lacks active opposition; the primary obstacle is a lack of information, which is resolved conveniently by an expository figure (the grandmother) rather than protagonist agency. There is no visible or felt cost paid on the page for the revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=4.2)
    The conflict is introduced via Kael but deflates immediately; there is no escalation or back-and-forth struggle, only a brief exchange of dialogue before Kael submits. The stakes ("breaking the pattern") are high in concept but low on the page, as Elias pays no visible price—emotional, physical, or tactical—to achieve his goal.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; the protagonist faces no active opposition, internal resistance, or cost in his pursuit of understanding. The "opposing force" of grief is dissolved instantly by a convenient ghost who provides the answer in a note. There is no escalation of stakes; Elias simply goes to a place, waits, and receives the solution.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are clear but the external pressure is low; the conflict is primarily internal and resolved through a symbolic transaction. The escalation is linear—he retrieves the handle and climbs—lacking a moment where the cost of the transfer is deeply felt or resisted.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=3.7)
    Pressure is virtually absent; Elias faces no antagonist, time constraint, or risk of failure, resulting in a narrative flatline. The stakes are purely curiosity-based, and the "cost" at the end is an emotional realization that is stated rather than paid for in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is almost entirely abstract, centered on the off-stage stagnation of scholars. The protagonist encounters no active opposition, risk of failure, or need to sacrifice something to achieve her goal, leaving the scene devoid of dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=3.6)
    Conflict is negligible; the "mist" and "silence" are indifferent backdrops rather than active opposition. Elias succeeds on his first attempt without escalation, risk of failure, or necessary trade-offs, leaving the stakes abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are largely internal and retrospective until the final beat. The conflict is resolved by the external agency of the mask's vision rather than the protagonist forcing a change in the status quo through pressure. The cost paid is conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=4.2)
    Escalation is minimal; the narrative relies on summary of "days hunched over" rather than active struggle. The external pressure ("footsteps") is a weak trigger for a life-altering decision, leaving the stakes feeling abstract rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=4.2)
    Escalation is weak; the initial friction is established but dissolves almost immediately upon the introduction of the zither. The lack of on-page resistance or failed attempts makes the resolution feel inevitable and low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=4.0)
    Stakes are declared ("only chance") but not tested; the process of growth is passive, and the success is inevitable. There is no visible cost or difficult trade-off; the fruit "absorbed her pain," framing the consequence as a benefit rather than a price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=4.5)
    The stakes are declared but not felt; the conflict resolves with virtually no resistance. There is no antagonist on page, no physical barrier to the tower, and the solution requires only a simple action (striking a match) with no cost or trade-off for the characters.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.3)
    The conflict is subtle but coherent, focused on the tension between the protagonist's desire for stasis and the house's inherent life. The escalation works through the success of the ritual (the house stopping), which ironically deepens the mystery rather than solving it. A more visceral consequence for the "inadvertently profound" mistake would heighten the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the stakes are high (release a monster or leave a secret buried), the conflict dissolves too easily. The protagonist offers minimal resistance to the antagonist/guide's worldview, reducing the tension of the climax to a transaction rather than a hard-won choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes remain conceptual ("proof of limits") without immediate physical or emotional peril to the protagonist. The escalation provides a functional beat of pressure (the quake), but the cost is purely environmental rather than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the antagonist is the ambient environment, which exerts no active pressure during the scene. The protagonist encounters no meaningful resistance to her goal, resulting in a lack of narrative tension or escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=4.0)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the baker is helpful, the dough cooperates, and the solution is handed to the protagonist in a dream. There is no moment of genuine risk, failure, or trade-off, leaving the stakes high in concept but flat in execution.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict is muted by the lack of active opposition; the yoyo functions perfectly on the first significant attempt, and the storm provides atmosphere rather than an obstacle that forces a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=4.0)
    While the external threat (the reflection) is active, the conflict is resolved instantly by following an instruction, bypassing genuine struggle or tactical adaptation. There is no escalation of cost; Elias does not lose anything (sanity, physical capacity, a tool) to gain his victory. The stakes feel abstract ("soul") while the physical danger is negated too easily to generate tension.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=4.0)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the potential antagonist (the sea/storm) is explicitly dismissed as a "collaborator" early on ("tonight they were not omens"). Leeward faces no meaningful resistance, risk of failure, or need to adapt his tactics, resulting in a linear progression of success rather than an escalation of pressure. The stakes remain abstract ("resonance") without a concrete threat to the character.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are clear—stagnation versus the dangerous truth—and escalation occurs on the page when the crack is breached. The tension with the watchers works well as a background threat. However, the final beat reconfigures the stakes (finding all cracks) without fully acknowledging the cost of the first encounter, reducing the felt weight of the decision.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.0)
    The conflict remains largely intellectual; Liora's opposition serves as a debate prompt rather than a visceral threat, and she folds too quickly. The stakes are lowered by the compromise ending, which avoids a genuine sacrifice or trade-off regarding the "noble lie," leaving the tension resolved by logistics rather than character choice.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes are clear but low-pressure, centered on a quiet internal struggle against oblivion. The escalation works via the water level, but the conflict remains largely thematic; the "cost" is philosophical rather than an urgent, irreversible trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.0)
    The stakes remain largely internal and low-pressure, centering on curiosity rather than an urgent threat. The "blackout" provides atmospheric tension but does not force immediate tactical trade-offs until the final decision to stay.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=5.5)
    Escalation is largely summarized rather than dramatized; the threat grows in the background while Veyra repeats her routine. The climax is triggered by a mechanical failure (lantern shattering) rather than a character-driven confrontation or mistake in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.2)
    Pressure is minimal; the antagonist (the ghost) capitulates immediately to Lena's command ("Show me"), removing necessary friction from the climax. The external clock (cooling breakers) provides artificial urgency but does not force a tradeoff or alter the outcome of the central interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the universe reveals its secrets immediately upon request, and the protagonist faces no opposition, doubt, or external threat. There is no escalation of stakes, only a linear progression of affirmations that removes the potential for dramatic tension or earned payout.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake (truth vs. lies) is clear, but the scene lacks sufficient resistance; the uncle’s immediate confession dissipates potential conflict rather than escalating it. The cost paid at the end (breaking the watch hand) is symbolic and felt, but the lack of an antagonist or difficult obstacle prior to that moment limits the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.4)
    The stakes (war/peace) are high in concept but low in immediate scene pressure; the interaction is cooperative rather than conflicted. The deepening comes from Seris's "thoughtful" gesture (the locket), which is a valid micro-turn, but the lack of active opposition or difficult trade-offs keeps the tension simmering rather than boiling.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant internal stake—autonomy vs. legacy—is clear, and the cost of the compass is paid on the page. Escalation is mild; the conflict resolves quickly through internal monologue rather than external pressure forcing the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are clear (psychic survival/redemption), and the mirror room provides a classic confrontation. However, the escalation is low-friction; the externalized internal conflict via magical mirrors is a convenient device that resolves the tension without requiring a costly active decision from the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are intimate but high, centered on the irreversible transformation of a loved one. The cost is clearly articulated on the page—she gains his presence but loses his humanity. The pressure remains consistent, escalating from the uncertainty of the summons to the painful reality of the metamorphosis.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.3)
    Conflict is strictly internal and somewhat abstract ("weight of a name," "lost time"). While there is a shift in stance, the pressure feels low because the stakes (the debt/memory) are handled philosophically rather than through urgent, constrained choices.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.3)
    Conflict is present but lacks genuine pressure; Liora succeeds in every confrontation with the ghosts immediately, offering the perfect affirmation without facing resistance or the risk of failure. The escalation is thematic rather than causal, leading to a climax resolved by the locket’s activation rather than a protagonist's difficult choice or sacrifice. The stakes are declared but not viscerally felt in the moment-to-moment action.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is minimal because the protagonist offers almost no resistance to the prophecy. The stakes are theoretically high (saving a village), but the tension is deflated by the magic mirror which provides certainty rather than forcing a risky trade-off. There is no visible cost to his decision to act; he gains purpose immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake (revolution/city burning) is clear, but the on-page conflict is low; Mira overcomes every obstacle (the lock, the aide, the signal) instantly and without cost. There is no moment where she is forced to trade one value for another, resulting in flat tension.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=4.8)
    Escalation is absent; the story moves from problem identification to resolution without deepening the threat or forcing a difficult trade-off. There is no on-page cost; the protagonist consumes a resource (dust) he was meant to use anyway, and the "weight" in his chest simply lifts, resulting in a friction-free victory.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.1)
    Stakes are purely intellectual, pitting the protagonist against an abstract desire for understanding without immediate consequence. The tension feels artificial, driven by the mechanical timer and the storm rather than urgent personal cost or opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.3)
    Stakes remain abstract and philosophical; the conflict dissolves readily into cooperation without forcing a difficult trade-off or painful choice. The "duel" lacks genuine antagonism or pressure, feeling more like a pre-arranged ritual than a struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.0)
    The stakes remain abstract; while the concept of "resistance" is stated, there is no immediate antagonistic pressure or risk of failure in the scene to test Lumen’s resolve. The conflict is resolved through a supportive reunion rather than a high-stakes confrontation or a difficult trade-off, leaving the tension flat.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.6)
    Escalation is well-paced, built around the specific constraint of waiting for the sun to set. The conflict between the safety of the status quo and the need for chaotic release is resolved through a decisive action that visibly shakes the world and the travelers.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.2)
    The stakes are clearly defined and high: the survival of cultural identity against the erasing force of the storm. The conflict escalates cleanly from Liora's hesitation to the darker realization of the "bargain," complicating the initial premise of preservation. The resolution—accepting the storm as a thief and partner—reconfigures the conflict rather than simply solving it, offering a mature and costly closure.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are purely internal and lack escalation; Elias seeks an answer, performs a ritual, and succeeds on the first attempt without opposition or deepening of the dilemma. The narrative lacks a moment where the outcome is in doubt or where the protagonist must sacrifice something of value to proceed.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stake—learning humility through minutiae—is signaled early; pressure deepens once as she sees “constellations” in decay, but no option is foreclosed and the cost is conceptual rather than tactical, keeping escalation moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—truth versus safety—tightens when the frost patterns confirm the ledger’s code, forcing a face-to-face with Jaren. Agency is hers: she holds up the strip, demands why, then folds it into her pocket, foreclosing denial. The escalation is single-curve but effective; the off-stage threat (“burn the whole canyon”) stays abstract, capping the felt price just short of the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“translate silence into music”—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens once: the fork-strike must produce readable color or doom him to wordlessness. Escalation is Accumulative: each mapping session adds density until the single chromatic explosion reweights the stake—silence is no longer absence but palette. Cost is visible: the city’s roar stays lost; he gains a new language yet remains exiled from sound. No reversal, but the deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.4)

Escalation is a single deepening: the stranger’s arrival forces the stakes from metaphysical quest to immediate life-or-death test. Agency is renunciation with visible price. No reversal, but the tightening forecloses hoarding as an option; coincidence complicates, not resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can she resurrect the lost without erasing herself—signaled by curling photographs. One meaningful tightening: the shard’s reversal shows the scream, forcing the choice to enter the maze. Price is immediate: mother’s disintegration and Elara’s accelerated aging visibly foreclose retry. Pressure stays causal; garden’s sentience complicates but does not rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—live to plant—signaled early and sharpened by “not too much” sack limit. Mid-story scavenger encounter raises cost of failure; wall-collapse clock tightens final descent. Agency sits with Mira’s seed-cupping gesture that accepts finite load. Escalation is single-cycle but sufficient for 700-word span; visible price is the locked vault itself—future access foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—capture the absent sound of betrayal—tightens once: from abstract quest to the material imprint he can actually hold. The cancer deadline and rising tide externalize cost, forcing the final compromise. Agency is interior yet decisive; the choice to accept “something” forecloses perfection. Escalation is single-curve but sufficient for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—steal vs. create light—surfaces early and tightens once: Lira shifts from hoarding to co-creating. The reversal is entirely internal, lacking external friction or forfeiture; cost is aesthetic, not tactical. Situational lens: coherent pressure of the departing train forces stance crystallization, but coincidence (meeting Kael) supplies the pivot rather than prior agency.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“craft safe zones for inquiry without shattering”—is signaled early and revisited in the unfinished orb. Pressure tightens once: abandoning the passive journal to active switch-flip narrows options from reflection to live consequence. Cost is visible: the awakening machines now demand stewardship. No reversal or external antagonist is needed under Accumulative lens; the escalation is a density shift from silence to full chorus that forces stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—identity survival—tightens when the shell’s whispers force her to confront the caretaker and pry up the floorboard; each step forecloses retreat. The photograph raises the cost: her entire heroic self-narrative was built on theft, not talent. Pressure escalates under causal lens; no coincidence solves the problem, and the final alliance is earned, not gifted.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—translate the booklet or remain haunted—arrives early. Pressure tightens once: booklet dissolves, forcing her to internalize the map. Cost is conceptual (loss of star, loss of need to speak) rather than viscerally felt; escalation is single-step, adequate for lyric mode but not high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“where do thoughts come from?”—is signaled early and tightens through each loop: every repetition adds tactile density (crack of ice, reflection with stitched mouth) that raises the cost of ignorance. One meaningful deepening suffices: the whisper in the gap between thoughts reconfigures the quest from acquisition to listening. Agency is present—he chooses to pick up the mop, to press forehead to ice—but the price (eternal pursuit) is conceptual rather than viscerally felt, keeping the score just below the 8.2 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake: mutual trust. Escalation: each withheld artifact (lens, tickets) tightens suspicion until joint exposure narrows options to either joint confession or permanent rift. Cost is the emotional nakedness of admitting surveillance; however, no external consequence (job loss, security) is activated, keeping pressure intimate but limited.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—garden’s recognition—signals early and tightens through each marble exchange; the final seedling forecloses the option to keep controlling the maze. Escalation is textural: each new bloom or shifted hedge increases the density of reciprocity until the map marble crystallizes the last move. Cost is visible: Elias relinquishes the marbles and abandons ownership. No reversal, but one meaningful deepening satisfies short-form requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—prove lateral time—is signaled early and tightened once: the lever appears as the single live option, foreclosing retreat. Escalation is linear but coherent under Causal lens: each calibration raises stakes until the station shudders. Cost is visible (alarms, collapsing nexus, possible future abandonment). A second reversal or external antagonist would deepen pressure, but the length supports one decisive turn.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—“unravel the code or let the symphony die”—is signaled early and tightens once: the program dissolves, forcing immediate performance. Pressure grows causally; water rises because she plays, not by coincidence. Visible price: antique program lost, eternal custodianship gained. Stakes stay personal and legible; no abstract world-saving clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—guilt over the needless evacuation—is signaled early and sharpened by each artifact (illustration, photograph). The mid-story tightening occurs when he realizes the flower marks disturbed earth, forcing the dig that forecloses his exile. Cost is visible in the rusted photograph and the note’s admission, satisfying the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—reckless curiosity versus swallowed guilt—tightens once when Elias chooses to watch instead of flee; the cessation of clanking forecloses escape and leaves him in charged silence. Escalation is textural: each metallic echo increases density until the final quiet reweights the stake with felt cost. No reversal, but the single deepening is sufficient for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake: preserve witness stance vs. intervene with the new book. Pressure escalates only once—book appears→she releases it—without a mid-scene trial that would sharpen cost. Agency is present but solitary; tension is atmospheric, not tactical. Sufficient for short-form but stays in mid-band because the book never endangers her silence or forces adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—turning anonymous guardianship into lived responsibility—emerges late, signaled only when Liora speaks. Pressure is ambient (eclipse awe) rather than tactical; Elias never faces a narrowing choice or forfeiture. The tightening is lyrical, not causal, sufficient for the textural lens but below the 8.2 gate for high-band conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.1)
    Pressure escalates through pattern intensification: silence thickens, shadows pool longer, books slide; the tightening is not a causal chain but a density swell that forces her stance crystallization—she must abandon archival passivity and step through the woven door, paying the cost of certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—will Elias keep decoding or torch the past?—is signaled by cookie line #1 and tightens when the stranger demands “the originals.” One meaningful escalation: the microdot proves his father lied, stripping Elias’s safe nostalgia; option space shrinks to collaborate or resist. Cost is visible: he forfeits the story he told himself about Linus the harmless fisherman. Agency drives the turn—he chooses to “play it,” not merely witness—so pressure coheres under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“will he survive possession?”—is signaled early and tightens through each added layer of sound. The heartbeat loop acts as irreversible escalation, foreclosing silence as refuge. Agency remains active: he chooses to add the heartbeat, inviting the mirror. Cost is visible when violet stains spread, marking bodily surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—can memory crack the mirrored trap?—is signaled early; pressure deepens via each recovered memory until the horizon fissures. Escalation is textural, not causal, but the tightening is unmistakable: silence becomes unbearable, then breaks. A visible price (exhaustion, shell relinquished to cold glass) is present but could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—self-definition versus multiplicity—tightens when the older self demands Elias choose who walks out. Escalation is one deepening, not reversal, but it meaningfully narrows options: kill, merge, or relinquish. Agency sits in relinquishment, priced by the infinite selves he abandons. Cost is legible in the rain-soaked silence that replaces prior noise.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—defeat emotional numbness—signals on arrival and tightens once: from resisting silence to wielding it. The tap that makes no audible sound is the single deepening that forecloses Mira’s old tactic of noise-filled escape. Cost is legible—she must now live inside the hush she once fled—yet the external stakes (what she forfeits next, how this changes her life beyond the cavern) remain unspoken, capping entry into the 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—can Elias remain a passive observer?—is signaled early and tightens when the gear-sound collapses neutrality. One meaningful deepening: lateral listening replaces frontal confrontation, foreclosing the safe option. Cost is conceptual (loss of observer immunity) rather than tangible; a lost tool or social credit would make the trade-off concrete. Sufficient for this length under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will he keep or discard the scent-key—signaled in paragraph 3. Mid-story tightening: gardener’s line “scent is the last sense to fade” deepens knowledge, narrows options to endurance only. No reversal, but deepening sufficient for 700-word scope. Cost visible in on-page tear and resolved stance; closure not diluted by coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“discover the texture of time”—is signaled early and narrows to a single irrevocable tug. Pressure escalates by accretion: rope weight, wall pulse, star blink pattern each intensify until the tapestry threatens unraveling; the final pull is the first and only decisive turn. Cost is conceptual (time now breathes and remembers) rather than personal loss, slightly softening visceral stakes. Still, the protagonist’s agency drives the irreversible change, satisfying the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake: wrest song from post-catastrophe silence. Pressure intensifies once via the underwater hum, but escalation is observational, not tactical; no trade-off or resource lost. Stakes remain aesthetic, felt but not tested against a counter-want. Sufficient for short-form but thin.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure tightens once: the petal’s charge forces Darian’s surrender and Liora’s recognition that she, too, is consuming the product; the cost is legible, but the escalation is single-note—no further narrowing of options—so it peaks just below the 8.2 high-band line.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—honor unseen labor—signaled early; pressure tightens once when Elias decides to act before Mara’s shift ends. Agency is present but low-risk: no personal loss, deadline, or pushback. Coincidence (envelope found tonight) complicates, does not resolve, so allowed. Cost is social/forward-looking (future fund work), not felt on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“to graft onto community”—is signaled early and tightens once: the arbor’s acceptance costs the reed child. Under Accumulative lens, density of mirrored surfaces and charcoal pulse reweights the stake rather than chaining causal reversals. No antagonist or second reversal is required at this length; the single deepening suffices. Cost is visible (loss of sculpture) but not persistent; no later tactic is altered, capping entry to 8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are signaled early—find the echo-door or the Giant wakes—but the only tightening is the pendant burning; no option is foreclosed, no price paid before the climax, so escalation stays atmospheric rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stake—recover sister’s trace—is signaled early; pressure escalates via sensory accretion rather than option narrowing. The orchard’s “answer” is a permission, not a foreclosure; no live path is sacrificed. Cost is aesthetic communion, not tactical loss, so escalation feels gentle, not decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes (stay hidden vs. risk exposure for Voss truth) are signaled early and tighten when Mara enters, but escalation plateaus: no new obstacle, loss, or trade-off occurs on this page. The protagonist’s agency is arrested at crouch-and-wait; therefore pressure neither deepens nor forecloses options before the cut-off.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—control vs. surrender—tightens once when bark yields under her fingers, forcing the renunciation. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens: each sensory anomaly (leaf pulse, bark iridescence) increases density until the single option—let go—becomes undeniable. Cost is legible in the final image; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—will he trade his own agency to exhume drowned stories?—is signaled in the first paragraph and tightens once: the brooch’s warmth escalates from dream-cue to skin-brand, turning abstract guilt into physical price. The rain-trail choice and the cave entry are sequential escalations under Accumulative pressure; each new amber surface increases the density of trapped memory. The final hand-clasp forecloses retreat with visible geographic cost (incoming tide). No coincidence resolves; the woman’s appearance is the culmination of the trail he chose to follow.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—Elias’s desire to witness magic without paying its price—tightens when the pearl’s magnification turns the cave hostile. Escalation is causal: each contact with the pearl increases volume, then shadow agency, then irreversible loss. The pilgrim’s disappearance is the visible price that forecloses the path of safe wonder. Because Elias’s final stance is observational rather than a decision that could alter odds, the pressure plate feels complete but not personally decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“stitch the city’s absences”—is signaled early and tightens when the third valve reveals the pre-exile map. One meaningful deepening: the map proves erasure, not mere absence, narrowing options from recovery to exposure. Cost is felt in Liora’s tremor, but the beat is internal; no external resource or relationship is visibly forfeited. Escalation is coherent under causal lens, yet pressure plateaus once the map is seen.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—map the unmappable—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the arrows force a single path and the punch heats, foreclosing retreat. Agency is present: he lifts the cover, descends, accepts the hand. Cost is visible (burning palm, swallowed streetlights), but the middle beat plateaus—no new obstacle or trade-off between beats—so escalation is present but not yet piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—will he listen or walk away?—is signaled early, but pressure plateaus: the tile simply activates, no escalation or trade-off complicates the choice. The whales’ crescendo is atmospheric, not tactical, so the tightening is emotional, not optional.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“see after goodbye”—tightens when the only means (storm + fragment) demands a sacrifice Veyra hesitates to pay. Her refusal to let Kael seize it escalates via because/therefore: each magnetic surge narrows options until she pays with flesh. Cost is legible in the scorched hand, but the beat is compressed; a sharper sensory spike at the burn would have lifted this to 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single dominant stake—control of the ink pot as lever against bureaucratic math—tightens once: from passive possession to active gamble. Escalation is causal under lens: because the ink rewrites equations, therefore the woman comes; because Elias demands proof, he jeopardises the funeral-home cover. Price is visible: he forfeits anonymity and assumes the diplomat’s hunted position. No coincidence resolves; pressure crystallises into stance rather than explosion, fitting short-form economy.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade>
    <comment>Theme emerges as “every ledger can be hacked, but someone must hold the eraser” without sloganising. Subtext resides in gesture: the woman’s split lip and the ink’s fractal patterns silently equate state violence with numerical fictions. The final image reframes the mother’s aphorism—“fair trade is just math”—into a moral dare, reweighting prior material. No explicit moralising; complexity and ambiguity remain alive.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—recover the town’s lost voices via hum-texture—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: the unexplained page appears, narrowing his project from solitary authorship to collaborative medium. Cost is implied (shared custody of stories) but not viscerally paid on the page. Escalation is a single deepening under Accumulative lens; sufficient for length, yet the price feels conceptual rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—recovering a verifiable self—surfaces early and deepens through each found fragment. However, escalation is atmospheric, not tactical: no beat narrows his options or exacts an on-page forfeiture until the final stasis, and even that is a shift in attitude rather than a concrete loss. The woman’s vanishing adds mystery but no extra pressure. Cost is conceptual, not viscerally felt, keeping the score below the 8.0 threshold where price must alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“disprove or accept the Compass”—tightens when the shell’s first vision proves the device real, forcing Elias either to abandon his life’s work or keep listening. Playing the cello is the visible, irreversible act that escalates commitment and carries the price of professional self-nullification. Pressure is coherent under causal lens; no off-stage rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—keep the deeds—tightens once via Lan’s escalating sabotage; options narrow as surveyors are blocked and investors stalled. Pressure is coherent under situational lens, but the absence of a live ticking clock or tangible forfeiture keeps cost legible yet not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—preserve the last untouched place via photograph—tightens when he realizes the photo must substitute for the crater itself. One meaningful deepening: the chemical strip externalizes time’s passage and the inevitability of loss. Cost is legible in the final darkened walk-back.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—decode the drone’s broken feedback before the ship sails—is signaled early and tightens once: still water → ripples → launch. The pressure is situational but coherent: the literal rising anchor sets an external clock that cannot be negotiated. Elias’s agency is expressed through patient patching and the final refraction test; the cost is the unspoken possibility that the drone never returns and the mapping dies with him. A slightly higher pulse of jeopardy—one dropped tool, one snapped filament—would have nudged this into the 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—locate origin where maps collapse—tightens when condensation reveals a temporal map, foreclosing desk-bound safety; escalation is textural (pattern density) rather than causal reversal, but cost is legible: she risks the unseen blank labeled “nothing.”

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—restore the town’s lost resonance—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens through each calibrated footstep; the risk is over-tuning and shattering the ghosts. Escalation is textural: day-3 click, day-5 murmur, day-7 golden light, each layer foreclosing silence forever. The price (irreversible awakening that still leaves the town empty) is legible but lightly felt; a sharper personal cost would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—retrieve sender before O₂ expires—is signaled early and tightens as the needle flirts with red. The temple’s memory-current externalizes internal stakes: surrender mother-scent or die. Agency crystallizes in the uncorking, foreclosing retrieval and motherhood alike. Cost is visible (diver dissolves, vial empty), though escalation is single-step rather than iterative.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“break the hush or be swallowed by it”—is signaled early and tightens when the shape appears; speaking his name forecloses retreat. Escalation is causal: each discovery (ledger name scratched out, lattice burning) narrows options toward the final utterance. One meaningful turn suffices at this length; cost is visible in the shattered lattice and the now-inescapable pursuit that follows.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—repay the unnamed debt—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the bead’s warmth forces memory; options narrow to acceptance. The single meaningful turn (gripping the bead) escalates under causal lens with visible price: the wound stays “forever open.” No coincidence resolves; pressure coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—“carve a path from ruin to reverence”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the voice declares “You’ve been sewing the wrong things,” forcing a shift from escape to participation. The escalation is a single deepening rather than a reversal, sufficient for lyric mode, but the cost (loss of autonomy?) is only gestured at, not viscerally felt. Agency is present but low-stakes: she sits and sews without risking a visible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“restore lost faith”—is signaled early and deepens through each unearthed relic. The seventh-day tightening (placing relic triggers bloom) is a single decisive intensification; no second reversal is needed. Cost is conceptual but visible in the blooming bone mosaic.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—Elias decoding the chalk summons—tightens once when the letters’ postmarks confirm local stalker-knowledge, narrowing his safety. Escalation is modest: no external jeopardy beyond existential recognition, but the “truth hides in margins” line raises conceptual stakes. Cost is legible: his satchel strap digs, clipboard grows heavy, identity vocation reframed. Could use one more tangible forfeiture for 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—prevent the hidden coup—surfaces once the stellar code is cracked; pressure tightens when the equinox becomes a live countdown. The meaningful turn is her choice to seed the truth via embroidered scraps, narrowing her options from private study to public endangerment. Cost is conceptual but legible: her sanctuary is forfeited, the candle’s eternal flame now witness to irrevocable exposure. Escalation is linear rather than iterative, yet sufficient for the compressed arc.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—liberation from unsent regret—signals early and intensifies via spirit chorus and droplet warnings tightening the noose. One decisive deepening: speaking fear aloud shifts song to “relief,” reconfiguring value of letter. Pressure coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves conflict. Visible price: apparition’s touch leaves cooling trace, marking irrevocable exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—graft new meaning onto old wounds—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when decryption reveals Voss coordinates, foreclosing the option to remain a detached observer. The coral’s pulse escalates stakes from personal talisman to shared transmitter, forcing a public gesture that could expose her to militia. One meaningful turn: boy’s matching fragment converts parallel anxiety into joint agency, price = loss of anonymity. Cost is visible: she ignores medical exile and accepts permanent displacement for the word “Home.”

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—recover lost joy—signals early and tightens once: the exposure must seize the transient fog-gold or forfeit the chance. The deepening occurs when the developed negative reveals the apple already grasped, foreclosing the option to merely mourn loss; the cost is the artist surrendering private ownership of the image. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict. One meaningful intensification suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—preserve professional certainty vs. surrender to unknown—tightens at each awakening; the fourth turns the screw by weaponizing the very tool (nickel) he fondles for reassurance. Escalation is causal under the Causal lens: each brushstroke removal narrows options until only the doorway remains. Price is legible (burning palm, cracking scaffold), though the garden’s agency could carry a sharper cost cue.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—silent rebellion versus thought-tax regime—tightens when Elias takes the map, trading safety for possibility of exposure. Escalation is single-cycle but sufficient: inspector visit raises concrete threat, map hand-off forecloses retreat. Cost is visible: Elias’s forced smile and sagging relief show bodily price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—convert pain into beauty—escalates as the shell’s projections narrow to his fractured face, forcing the choice: turn away again or write. The single meaningful tightening lands when the off-key breeze carries the lullaby fragment; it triggers the spiral of words, foreclosing the option of continued silence. Cost is visible (tears wet the ink) and persistent (no sleep, no reply possible), satisfying the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is declared early: keep names from vanishing. Pressure escalates by accretion—each failed chime attempt adds weight rather than narrows options. The single meaningful tightening occurs when accidental breath through the tube produces a note; that surprise forces her to recognize that preservation is not reconstruction but reception. Cost is visible: the orchid’s hum names a stranger she will never know, confirming her eternal anonymity.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—restore trust by reviving truth-language—tightens when each spoken fragment visibly escalates ink reactivity, narrowing options to the final promise. Cost is legible (archive tremors, glass rupture), yet the external voice absolves some protagonist accountability, keeping escalation strong but not irreversibly personal.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—valley safety vs. cultural memory—tightens when letter rewrites floodgates from betrayal to dialogue. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversals needed. Cost visible: she abandons failsafe control and accepts shared risk. Agency drives turn; coincidence only complicates (warm chain hints prior visitor).

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—recover or relinquish the lost song—surfaces early and re-weights at the lyric-sheet reveal. Pressure tightens once: the prior collector’s note proves Elias is not alone, forcing stay-or-flee. Cost is conceptual (identity exposure) rather than visceral; no concrete loss (money, safety) is risked, capping intensity below 8.8. Still, agency is his: the final hand closing on the meteorite is the decision to endure reconstruction.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—father’s need to locate daughter—signals early and tightens through each failed sensory clue. Pressure grows accumulatively: every refracted rainbow and splintered footprint intensifies the impossibility of crossing back. No reversal, but a meaningful deepening when the prism hits the floor and he chooses retreat. Cost is legible in the pocketed logbook’s dead weight.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“to understand the rhythm of belonging”—is signaled early and tested by the city’s invitation. The sunrise deadline supplies escalating pressure; Elias’s agency turns on whether to stay or leave. The choice to surface costs him immediate communion, a price legible in the final beat. One meaningful tightening suffices; no reversal is required. Slightly more bodily jeopardy or irretrievable loss would push it into the 8.5+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—“why do some paths disappear?”—signaled early. Single meaningful deepening: glass shifts blue→red, forcing confrontation with unrecognizable emotion; this tightens her stance toward acceptance. Pressure is situational/accumulative rather than adversarial; no external antagonist. Cost is conceptual (abandoning the quest) but not viscerally felt on page; keeps score sub-8.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stake—break personal monotony through creative risk—is signaled early and sharpened when she sacrifices her talisman. Escalation is textural: water stilled, lantern arcs, stranger enters; pressure mounts but options widen rather than narrow. No reversal or trade-off forecloses a path; the climax is additive joy, not costly choice. Cost is aesthetic, not tactical, keeping the beat below high tension.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“dance the tides in silence or be heard”—is signaled early. Escalation tightens once: the moonstone’s spontaneous anchor converts passive memory into active criminal tool, foreclosing retreat. Cost is visible: shared outlawry, “nailed to the city gates” risk. Agency is micro but decisive: finger-dance transfers sea-myth onto skin, crystallizing exile dyad.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—will Elias heed the omen and discover what the world is telling him?—is signaled early but pressure plateaus: no time limit, no social risk, no competing obligation. The stone-throw produces a vision, yet Elias never faces a fork that could fail; escalation is atmospheric, not tactical, so the cost feels prospective, not paid.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—can the stolen voice be given back—signals early and tightens once: from solitary burden to shared testimony. The pen hand-off is the single meaningful narrowing; it forecloses silence and costs Elias his protective detachment. Pressure is coherent under Causal lens; no coincidence resolves. Cost is felt but not yet material (no lost tool or time), so stays south of 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“puzzle out new equations for hope”—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each decorative spiral tightens the density until the gauge’s vibration forces a stance crystallization. Cost is conceptual (acceptance of infinite parallel work), but because no live option is foreclosed on-page, pressure plateaus rather than spikes. Meets 8-band; misses 8.8+ because price is felt but not visibly paid.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—uncover what walls dream—tightens when the woman reframes legacy as warning, narrowing Elias’s options from discovery to stewardship. Pressure escalates through because/therefore: negative find → wall vibration → shadow → map reveal. One visible cost: the walls’ hum demands remembrance, implicitly conscripting Elias. Could use a sharper tactical forfeiture (e.g., diary consumed) to enter 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—coax the mirage into permanence—signals early and tightens through sensory narrowing: light fading, bells impending, paint running out. The watchman’s skepticism supplies external pressure, but the escalation is accumulative density, not option-closing reversal; no tactical loss or tool break alters her method. The climax is a cognitive flip, not a blocked path, so cost is conceptual rather than visceral. Still, the single deepening is meaningful under the lyric lens.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“will these two actually sign/stand together?”—is signaled early and tightens when Kessar asks what peace leaves her; the question forces Liora to confront obsolescence and risk trust. The coin beat is a small but visible price: Kessar gives up a piece of personal history, Liora accepts vulnerability. No external coincidence rescues them; pressure stays internal and coherent. Escalation is modest—one meaningful deepening, sufficient for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“defy the lullaby of conformity”—is signaled early and tightens through each thread-loosening beat. The prism’s echo-harvest functions as the single deepening that reweights options: once voices are gathered, silence is no longer viable. Cost is legible in the black-thread inhale and the sanctuary’s dimming light. No external antagonist needed; internal pressure escalates under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—can stories be ethically reversed?—is signaled early. Pressure escalates by density: each puppet anecdote tightens the thematic screw until the echo-collector tale forces the recognition that every retelling is theft. No external antagonist is needed; the tightening is cognitive, internal, and sufficient for 700 words. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, but the candle’s extinction/re-light makes it legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stake: witness and honor the last monarch passage; pressure tightens from solitary arrival to final lift-off. No external antagonist—escalation is Accumulative: each fragile signal heightens the stakes of impermanence. The protagonist’s agency is observational, not interventionist, which caps intensity yet fits the elegiac lens. Cost is conceptual—the signal will dissolve and memory will fade—visible in the final image, satisfying the 8-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve forgotten names—signaled early; pressure tightens when each braid refusal/acceptance micro-choice narrows options under “technically gentle” constraint. No external antagonist needed; escalation is accumulative density. Cost legible in final rope-hum. Could edge higher if one intermediate obstacle (e.g., fiber snap) had forced a trade-off on page.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—why paths choose walkers—is signaled early and re-stated in dream. Pressure escalates through accumulative imagery: decayed directive, broken seal, storm’s approach, final key; each layer reweights the same question rather than narrowing tactical options. Elias’s agency is largely receptive—he follows vines, accepts key—so the tightening is tonal, not decisional. Cost is atmospheric (storm, exile) rather than a concrete forfeiture, capping the score short of 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserve knowledge beyond empire—tightens when the figure reveals the tile’s true covenant is with the future, foreclosing personal mastery. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversals required. Cost is legible: he surrenders the relic and accepts anonymity. Pressure escalates under Causal lens because each beat narrows his options from theft → negotiation → relinquishment.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—will she exact revenge or release it—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when she presses the pin into Veyra’s palm, foreclosing the revenge option. Pressure escalates via Accumulative pattern: broken pin → whole pin → memory flood → pity; cost is the forfeiture of her long-schemed vengeance, visible in the final invitation to dance. No external antagonist beyond memory itself, sufficient for this length. Coincidence (pin reappears) complicates rather than resolves, so lens integrity holds.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—capture the dream—tightens once via the climb; the cost is the dissolution of the mountain and the implicit burden of carrying another’s dream. Escalation is singular but sufficient; no reversal, yet agency (stepping onto the path) is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—how to keep a child safe after vows fail—tightens when the girl presents the cracked pendant; the micro-choice to use iron-smelling resin and silver wire forecloses the option of perfect restoration, making safety a matter of persistence, not magic. Cost is visible in the scarred quartz and the juice that replaces blood-iron taste. One beat suffices for this length; no coincidence intrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes—possession of forbidden knowledge—are signaled early; pressure tightens once when the orchard “shifts” in response to her touch. Cost is conceptual (lifelong pursuit) rather than tangible; still, the single deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—find sister / recover key—tightens once: renegotiation turns helper into co-victim, foreclosing solo escape. Pressure escalates through shelf movement and ink-fade, costs ink, map, certainty. The sister’s sudden presence supplies the reversal, but the price (lost return route? aging?) is implied rather than felt on-page, capping intensity. Still, agency remains Elara’s; coincidence complicates but does not save.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—recover sister vs. lose self—tightens when mirrors show Elias his own two-faced future. Each artifact ups ante: ledger proves Liora stayed, garden offers fusion at cost of identity. Agency is present but abstract; he never actively refuses escape—fog simply absorbs. Escalation is textural, not tactical, sufficient for 600-word lyric mode yet short of visible price that would push 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—will Liora expose or bury the erased history—tightens once: the rope’s re-braiding literally narrows her options to “see truth” or “stay blind.” The vision of obliteration raises the cost from academic curiosity to moral complicity, a clear deepening. Agency is present (she chooses to keep braiding despite the warning voice), but no external obstacle or institutional pushback surfaces on the page, so the price feels prospective rather than immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—secure silence—signals early and tightens when beings press against the bloom. One meaningful turn: binding the bloom forecloses personal refuge to create portable refuge; price is the bloom’s loss. Escalation is causal under the lens; no reversal overload. Cost is legible but brief, keeping the beat just shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—“rekindle the idea of light”—is signaled early; the horizon flicker supplies one decisive intensification that reweights options from futility to possibility. Pressure is largely atmospheric rather than tactical; no credible loss (time, blood, shelter) alters his method. The prism’s hush complicates interiority but never blocks or enables a specific action that forecloses a path. Escalation is present but gentle; cost is conceptual, not viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“salvage the past before it dissolves into nostalgia that hasn’t happened yet”—is signaled early and escalates as each monument’s shadow refuses measurable truth. The third monument’s shadowless glare forces a final tightening: abandon measurement and walk the bridge. Cost is conceptual but legible: she forsakes the archivist’s taxonomic safety. One causal beat could be sharper—why the bridge appears now remains slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—“bring light where none is left”—tightens when she realizes the light’s purpose is remembrance, not rescue, forcing renunciation of her rag. One meaningful turn suffices at this length; the escalation is the ignition sequence that reveals the waiting figures and reframes the cost. Pressure is coherent under Causal lens; no coincidence resolves anything. The price—loss of her crafted fire-tool and the emotional weight of summoned memory—is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: whether to remain in protective observation or step into the temporal demand of family/leaving. Pressure tightens when the cicada sinks through the veil—her refuge literally dissolves, foreclosing stasis. No antagonist is needed; the conflict is situational-accumulative, crystallized by the vanishing object. Cost is legible: she loses both talisman and excuse, yet the beat could be sharpened by one sentence of explicit tactical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can she claim breathable space without being crushed—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is situational: each vine creak heightens the price of exposure; the boy’s recognition tightens the stakes from solitary risk to shared covenant. One meaningful deepening suffices: gravity’s re-inversion clocks their parting. Cost is legible—she will descend back into ribs of stone carrying the sky’s taste.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—can silence be taught to comfort?—is signaled early; pressure escalates once when the glass darkens and Elias halts the boat, forcing the passenger to endure stillness. The tightening is textural, not causal, fitting the lens; cost is the shared vulnerability of remaining un-filled, not an irreversible loss, so intensity plateaus just shy of high band.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—“world unraveling without steward”—is declared, never dramatized; no on-page symptom escalates. Pressure plate is the mural test; it deepens knowledge but costs her nothing tangible (time, blood, ally, tool). The sunrise deadline appears only in the final paragraph, too late to tighten tactics. Escalation is intellectual, not consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“will she re-engage mercy?”—tightens once, via the child’s suffocation; the scar bridge escalates pressure under Accumulative logic, forcing a single stance crystallization with visible physiological cost, meeting the 8.8+ price test.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—repair the self-scam damage—surfaces early and escalates from curiosity to existential swap. The bolt’s warming/cooling provides a tactile meter of rising cost. One meaningful tightening: the porthole offers literal self-replacement, narrowing options to stay or vanish. The refusal costs the alternate life, paid on-page; pressure plateaus rather than spikes, keeping this just below the 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—uncover why the dynasty vanished—tightens into the sharper threat: “they took our voice.” One meaningful escalation: the crank transforms from curiosity to conduit, flipping archival silence into audible evidence. Pressure is accumulative/textural: each quarter-turn thickens the shadow ripples and spectral whispers, reweighting the cost of knowing. No external antagonist on stage, but the Council signature supplies sufficient off-stage menace.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“capture the shape of possibility”—is signaled early and tightens once: the woman’s offer forces Aldric to trade autonomy for agency over fate. The price (loss of bodily control) is visible on the page, but the escalation is single-note; no secondary reversal deepens the cost beyond the initial surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—recover Daniel’s erased humanity—signals early. Pressure escalates only once: button → boarding-house → postcard; each step is luck, not Elias’s active trade-off. No option narrows; cost is retrospective sentiment, not a foreclosed path, keeping entry mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—expose erased history—surfaces early and tightens once: the upload narrows options to “press ENTER or fail.” Cost is legible: exposure guarantees capture. Pressure is coherent under causal lens; no coincidence rescues. Escalation is single but sufficient for 700 words; the enforcers’ hesitation shows the reversal lands. Could use one earlier micro-loss (tool, time) to sharpen tactics, but the beat still bites.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“hush the prophecy”—is signaled in paragraph four and tightened once when music must absorb the words. Agency is clear: only Elias’s playing can avert the city’s sonic drowning. Cost is legible in fatigue and the case’s lighter weight, meeting the 8.2 bar for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—decode or surrender to randomness—tightens when the spiral monument crumbles and moon-dust settles, forcing the choice to build the larger circle. Escalation is textural: dust multiplication and leaf-light shower intensify pattern density rather than external danger. The cost is conceptual but legible: Liora forfeits ordinary life, becoming folklore herself. One beat more showing what she loses (village conversation, seed jars abandoned) would push pressure into the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: can Elias trade certainty for agency? Pressure escalates imagistically—compass spins, waterfall roars, city ticks—rather than through reversible choices. The decisive tightening occurs when he steps into the fall, reweighting the stake from “find meaning” to “disrupt imposed order.” Because the cost is borne by the city, not the protagonist, the beat is resonant but not viscerally paid; hence shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will she keep the coin or return it with understanding—tightens once: discovery of her name carved converts retrieval into confrontation. The deepening is sufficient for 750-word scope; options narrow from “find truth” to “deliver forgiveness,” a trade-off that costs her the relic’s sole possession. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens; each echo (warm coin, chisel scratches, *Forgive*) intensifies the same fracture. Cost visible: relinquishing the coin in the final beat forecloses future solitary work.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes—recover authentic laughter or stay haunted—are signaled early and tighten when the collector must ask the ghost how to leave. No visible price is exacted from him, only bestowed, so the escalation registers as atmospheric deepening rather than irreversible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—can mercy be calculated?—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tested by the vial offer. Escalation is singular but sufficient: the geometric grid moment reweights all prior suffering into a usable formula. Agency is present—he drinks, he deciphers, he decides to stop—yet the stranger’s off-stage origin blunts the pressure gradient slightly. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, acceptable under the Accumulative lens but keeping the score just shy of the 8.2 gate for high-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—recover stories the fragment holds—tightens when the painting reveals the lighthouse was pulled under by the very tales she seeks. Escalation is textural: each encounter (alchemist, artist, empty stall) increases density rather than external threat, fitting the Accumulative lens. Cost is visible: she accepts an unending quest, forfeiting closure. No coincidence resolves; coincidence merely complicates by removing the alchemist.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“ghosts bleeding through time”—is signaled early; pressure escalates via sensory intensification rather than causal turns, narrowing to the fracture moment. The tightening is meaningful but the price (lifted weight) is more atmospheric than tactical, keeping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“preserve or surrender perfect order”—is signaled early and tightens once: the frost cracks, books scream, and Elias must feed the silver pool his compressed eternity-page. The act narrows options to one irreversible path and carries visible cost (library gone, centuries of work erased). Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens via sensory density increase rather than causal reversals; a second tightening beat would have pushed it into 8.8+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—save the civilization’s poetic memory—signaled early. Escalation: academic erasure → mirror ritual → voiced verse; each step narrows Elias’s physical stamina and Liora’s options. Cost is cumulative and visible (shaking hands, shallow breath). No coincidence resolves; the storm complicates but the ritual converts it into resource.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—reclaim the stolen light via accepting inner fracture—signals early. Pressure tightens when the chip surfaces the accusatory memory, foreclosing the option to keep mending only external brokenness. The escalation is single but meaningful: from denial to insertion. Cost is conceptual (he must own the grief he avoided), yet no tangible price (tool, relationship, bodily harm) is exacted on-page, capping the upper band.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake: will Eli surrender to the lagoon’s memory-call or keep safe distance? Pressure tightens once: compass stills, water pulses, grandfather rises—each intensification reweights the petrichor’s meaning from quaint hobby to contagious legacy. The final sealing is an active narrowing of options; he can no longer merely observe. Cost is visible in the humming glass.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—whether Elias will step into stewardship of the world’s hidden seams—tightens once: the slide’s reassembly forces the choice to follow Mara. Pressure is textural rather than causal, but the deepening hum and collective labor inside the cavern make refusal unimaginable. A visible price is missing; we aren’t shown what Elias forfeits by staying, only that the option of leaving narrows. Sufficient for this length, but not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—need to grasp nocturnal blooming—signaled in paragraph 2; pressure intensifies via accumulating postcard evidence + glass revelation, narrowing options from search to acceptance. No external antagonist; escalation is accretive pattern-break, valid under Accumulative lens. One credible tightening: realization that darkness is its own light forecloses further inquiry with felt conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—surface the buried voter-suppression evidence—signals early and tightens when headlights appear. One meaningful tightening: the key/crevice beat converts abstract cipher into physical evidence, narrowing options to “grab and run.” Cost is legible—lagoon devours pursuers, Elara forfeits any return to the dunes. Pressure escalates under causal lens; coincidence (key fit) slightly tempers the climb.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—can Elias birth a living future without recourse to miracles—tightens once: the memory experiment forecloses his nihilism. Escalation is single-crystal but sufficient for 700 words; cost is conceptual (he pays with his ideological purity). Pressure is coherent under causal lens; no fake reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—can the city’s post-foghorn grief be archived?—is signaled early. Pressure tightens when each new language recording risks incomprehensibility; the final playback chorus narrows his options to perpetual listener. Cost is legible: stained fingers, warm wax, and the implicit forfeiture of returning to mere transcription. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversals are needed under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—can she re-open the past without shattering present or self—tightens when the vortex actually melts frost and shows the lost greenhouse, forcing her to decide whether to persist. The beat is single but meaningful; cost is legible in the frost reasserting itself and the cap’s residual warmth. One tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—village safety vs. her epistemic ethic—tightens when the storm’s voice flips from “weeping” to “world splitting open,” forcing a costly reversal. Agency drives escalation: her earlier sabotage narrows options, then her re-pull pays the price. Coincidence (storm’s sudden turn) complicates, not resolves. Cost is legible: wrong call almost kills, bell’s toll becomes audible price.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: to extract meaning from overlooked stillness. Pressure escalates via pattern-break—the star’s slow arc versus expected streak—forcing Elias to literalize his lifelong tracing into one charged gesture. Cost is legible in trembling fingers and the glass’s retained warmth. No visible tactical forfeiture beyond emotional stakes, keeping the score just shy of the 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve silence vs. need to release the unspoken—surfaces early and tightens as ghosts mass at the box. The single deepening occurs when the beekeeper-ghost delivers the flower, forcing the box opening; this narrows Elias’s options from passive witness to active reader. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral—his covenant breaks—but felt in the scattering dust. Pressure is coherent under the accumulative lens; no false escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“rediscover what had been lost” before backward clocks erase personal continuity—tightens when the urn reknits itself after the dream, forcing Elias from observer to donor. The escalation is textural rather than causal: each garage-sale artifact thickens the pattern but never threatens failure or resource loss; the cost is atmospheric, not tactical, keeping pressure just below the 8.8 threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—transform grief into usable beauty—is signaled early and deepens through tactile micro-choices (wading, pressing feather to palm). The kite-crack supplies a single tightening beat; options narrow to “write or retreat,” but the cost, though felt, is more conceptual than tactical, keeping pressure just shy of the 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve orchard vs. bulldozers—is signaled early and tightens through the single escalating act of covert shaping. No reversal, but one meaningful deepening: the first arch takes visible form, foreclosing surrender. Cost is present-tense in his aching knees and dusk deadline. Pressure stays coherent under situational lens; developers remain off-stage threat, sufficient at this scale.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—does chemistry replace belief?—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened once when the amber is sacrificed. Pressure is textural: each sensory layer (rain, dust, copper glow) adds density until the option of remaining a skeptic is foreclosed. No coin-flip resolution; the protagonist’s hand opens the satchel. Cost is present but abstract (loss of worldview), not visceral; hence shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—reclaim lost life—signals early via seed scattering. Pressure escalates texturally: color-drained sea → heron inquiry → seeds swallowed by cracks; each beat thickens the elegiac density rather than narrowing options. No active opposition or visible price (lost pods, snapped plank, rejected call) is dramatized; escalation is atmospheric, not tactical. Sufficient for short lyric mode but keeps cost conceptual rather than felt, holding the score mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—map or be swallowed by temporal isolation—tightens once: the flicker/anomaly forces him from observation to active drawing, trading stasis for risk. Cost is conceptual but legible: he forfeits the safety of mere recording to engage the living sky. Under Accumulative lens the deepening pattern suffices; no further reversal needed at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—wonder vs. safety—tightens when each chess piece physically leaves her belt, narrowing future options. The guardian’s riddle escalates from trade to existential warning, forcing her to shoulder conceptual cost. Agency sits entirely with Lirien: she initiates every bargain and accepts the final price. One beat more of physical jeopardy could have pushed the score higher.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—will she keep performing or witness truth?—is signaled in paragraph 2. One tightening: footsteps shift from encoded names to interstitial listening, foreclosing anonymity. The gallery’s echo intensifies pressure under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves. Price is felt when she abandons the board and accepts the risk of echo-witness that “would outlast them.”

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—recover the buried language of self/home—tightens when the journal reveals intentional burial, narrowing options to descent or perpetual exile. One meaningful escalation: feather-map proves the stone is hidden by design, forcing Elias into the descent where reality frays. Cost is legible: feather lost, identity diffused into collective talents. Pressure stays coherent under Causal lens; no reversal, but deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—signaled in paragraph four and tightens when black thread yanks open mirror-door, risking permanent entrapment. One meaningful escalation: memory corridor offers alternate victory, but labyrinth burn imposes physical price, forcing renunciation. Cost is legible on skin and in re-woven tapestry. No external antagonist needed; regret suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—“refract a single truth into many before elders’ ritual”—is signaled early; escalation occurs via each spoken poem that amplifies echo-feedback and narrows her option to remain silent. Agency sits in the spoken word; cost accrues acoustically and visually (spire glow, towers groan). The final refusal to proceed with the ritual crystallizes stance under pressure. Could wish for one tangible loss (a cut hand, a stolen memory) to sharpen price.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—conjure meaning before dissolution—signals early and tightens when scar-to-pockmark mapping becomes the last viable method. One meaningful deepening: realization that patterns are a map narrows options from blind groping to singular act of “narration.” Cost is conceptual—the irreversible knowledge that memory can be gilded yet still cracked—but not viscerally re-staged in final beat; hence stops short of 8.8. Pressure is coherent, acid sea always audible, gears always threatening collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—keep vs. relinquish the promise—tightens when the shell drifts away, forcing a decisive stance shift. Pressure escalates via accumulative echo: each artifact (shell, paintings, blank canvas) deepens the cost of return. No external antagonist needed; the cave’s gravity suffices. The price is visible in soaked sleeve and blank canvas, though the tightening is single rather than compounded.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—prove whispers trump shouts—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightened when Elias risks the only evidence (cork + vial) to the storm; the stakes move from abstract theory to irreversible loss. Escalation is textural: each sensory layer (heat, rain, scent, returning note) increases pressure until the single decisive release. Cost is visible—vial shattered, garden scent freed but unattributable—foreclosing the option to replicate the demonstration.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—find meaning in the dried seabed loss—signaled early. Pressure rises only atmospherically; no concrete trade-off or narrowing option inside the scene. The midnight call promises next coordinates but doesn’t test Elias’s commitment here; escalation is accretive, not decisive. Cost is lyrical, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“can I regain safety by hiding truth?”—is signaled early and tightened in one decisive cycle: eye promises occlusion → delivers unbearable amplification → refusal. Escalation is causal and visible; each wearing of the eye raises psychic cost until burial becomes the only remaining tactic. No external antagonist is needed; internal conflict suffices. Price is felt (“she woke gasping”) and persists, meeting the 8+ bar for visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—whether Elias will remain a passive observer or accept custodianship of another’s grief—tightens once, signaled early by the empty bench. Pressure accumulates via sensory intrusion: each ghost-sound narrows his options until refusal becomes impossible. Cost is felt in the final beam-sweep that now includes “those who still wandered in the dark,” expanding his vigil. No reversal, but the single deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—inheritance vs. self-chosen path—signaled early; pressure tightens when water reaches ankles and the chip slots home. Agency is present (he pries the board, inserts the chip), with visible forfeiture of the shop-bound life. Escalation is single-cycle but sufficient for 700-word scope; cost is more conceptual than visceral, capping the upper band.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will she answer the summons or cling to terrestrial rule?—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens once: the climb forecloses retreat, the mirror forecloses her former identity. Under Accumulative lens the pressure intensifies through sensory density rather than causal reversals; the cost is the loss of her star-marked skin and former sovereignty. A second reversal or higher-stakes trade-off would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—can presence be shared without being consumed?—tightens once: from solo capture to joint guardianship. The vial’s appearance forces the choice; curl’s glow forecloses hoarding. Cost is legible: Elias’s “time you feel” is spent; Liora forfeits sole authorship. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens; no reversal, but deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—will Elias outwrite his own burial—is signaled early and tightens through scroll rereads and grave vision. One meaningful deepening: realizing the handwriting is his own escalates jealousy to existential choke. No visible price paid yet—he hasn’t burned or surrendered the scroll—so cost is still prospective. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens; final image narrows options to two: face or flee.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—can discarded relics be re-humanised?—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: Clara’s request forces Elias to test whether mapping absence can create presence. Agency is his decision to engrave; the reversible micro-turn narrows his stance from observer to co-author of memory. Cost is visible in the irrevocable marks on the screw and the exposed name-link he must carry.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—transform silence into story or remain muted by grief—is signaled in paragraph four. One meaningful tightening: when she chooses to let ink crystallize instead of fighting it, the option space narrows from “write perfect rune” to “write with failure”; this irreversible tactic enables the closure image. Cost is legible: physical burn + exposure to coming storm. Pressure is coherent under causal lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—deliver overdue apology—tightens when the bottle’s crack makes the apology audible yet unreceivable, forcing acceptance of imperfection. Pressure escalates via sensory density: scent strengthens, light pulses, note trembles, drop burns—textural intensification that reweights the stake from ‘save’ to ‘witness’. No external antagonist needed; internal guilt and time-bound orchard felling supply coherent pressure. Cost is on-page: the fractured bottle and lost chance for fuller restitution.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—prevent universal forgetting—is declared early; pressure escalates as ink visibly bleeds and the stone darkens. The tightening moment (dictionary pressed to stone) is singular and decisive, but no intermediate reversals or trade-offs complicate the ascent; the cost is retrospective rather than experienced as a forked choice. Escalation is atmospheric, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“will the line hold?”—tightens once: the horizon’s waver narrows options to blood sacrifice; pressure is coherent but single-cycle; cost is legible (blood, pain), yet no secondary loss compounds the tactic shift.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—“understand letting go”—is declared early but never tested by a visible forfeiture; pressure stays intellectual. Only one meaningful tightening: accepting the vial, yet no tactic is foreclosed afterward. Cost is aesthetic (farm pulse) not personal; stakes never pierce the skin.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—whether the father’s curse can be broken—tightens when the lantern reveals “the house doesn’t always win,” a meaningful reversal that forecloses the poker-table path. Pressure is coherent but carried more by image density than by external opposition; the cost is conceptual, not viscerally paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—whether Mara will keep absorbing others’ grief or let an ending arrive—tightens once: the woman’s wordless inhale followed by “I’m ready” forces Mara to assent, foreclosing the weekly loop. Pressure is textural: repeated calls accumulate until one caller reclaims agency; Mara’s cost is the loss of her necessary fiction. No reversal originates from her choice, so escalation is mild, but the silence that follows is a felt forfeiture under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—keeping Liora present—tightens through sensory accumulation until the final forfeiture. No external antagonist; pressure is situational and emotional. The single meaningful turn is the locket release, which forecloses all future tactile memory; cost is legible in the glowing water. Escalation is gradual but coherent under Accumulative lens; a sharper mid-scene micro-reversal could push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—“cure the hollow ache”—is signaled in paragraph four and tightened once: the logistician refuses a direct trade, forcing Elias to accept an intangible debt instead. That single deepening narrows options under the Causal lens and carries visible price (loss of the rock). No reversals are needed at this length; the pressure coheres through his escalating need versus the shrinking possibility of payoff. Coincidence is absent; the encounter is motivated by three years of agency.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“finally understand herself”—is signaled early and deepens through each sensory layer. The stillpoint encounter forces a single, irreversible trade: external map for internal song; options narrow to zero once the ring turns inward. No coincidence; escalation is pure Accumulative density until pattern break. Cost is legible on-page (“she would never find the stillpoint again”), satisfying the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether to re-edit communal memory—faces one visible tightening beat when Elias nudges Liora to “grow” truth rather than carve it. Cost is implied (another possible history-warp), but not yet felt on-page; the anomaly’s pulse supplies atmospheric, not mechanical, pressure. Agency is present (she pockets the pen and stands), but the beat is more stance-crystallization than option-foreclosure. Sufficient for this length, yet short of the visible price that would push the score higher.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—uncover the arsonist’s truth—tightens when the promise is revealed as a seal. One meaningful deepening: fire as revelation, not destruction, narrows Elara’s moral options and forces alliance. Cost is conceptual (world-abandonment guilt) rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—recover Liora—tightens once: lab containment vs. lagoon reach. The drumming beat escalates from memory cue to escape actuator, narrowing options under causal lens; cost is legible (restraints snap, serum overdose). One meaningful turn suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“prove whispers travel farther than shouts”—is signaled early and tested by the spiral walk audition. One meaningful tightening: key must be offered to a stranger whose gait fits the lock; stakes escalate from puzzle to social risk, cost legible in storm-hush.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“teach darkness the value of stars”—is signaled early; pressure escalates by pattern intensification: daylight ribbons → vanishing glow → mica spark. Girl’s accusation supplies external pressure, but Maris’s silence never wavers; absence of personal risk keeps cost aesthetic. The tightening is lovely yet safe; one failed pattern or a slipped mirror that cuts her finger would sharpen price.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—will the town heed the silent warning before the shadows return?—tightens as the window code goes live. Pressure escalates by accretion: whispers thicken, clocks swallow their own chimes, magnets clink in the bag. One concrete loss is implied: Elias forfeits the safety of anonymity the moment he steps outside, light announcing his complicity. The cost is felt but not yet paid in blood, satisfying the 600-word bandwidth.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—belonging vs. erasure—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when the island solidifies only if she wades unarmed. The decisive deepening is the moment she presses the scrimshaw into the whalebone lock: a non-violent key that forecloses force forever. Cost is the map’s blankness and the mother’s permanent detachment. Pressure is coherent; no reversal is needed beyond this single, narrowing threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—will he keep speaking or surrender to silence—tightens once, via the dream that reopens grief, but no new tactic or risk is attempted. Pressure is coherent yet static; the ritual’s repetition deepens texture without narrowing options. Cost is felt only in the final cadence, not dramatized through a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—can language survive beauty without shattering?—is signaled early and deepened by each sensory pulse. Pressure escalates via accretion: aurora-veins brighten, ice cracks, quartz hum swells, forcing the kneel/paraphrase. Yet the tightening is atmospheric; no option is foreclosed and no price is exacted from the poet. The climax reweights meaning but not consequence, keeping escalation within lyric rather than dramatic range.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—can Elias transmute chromatic absence into artistic presence—tightens once: the reed demo converts possibility into obligation, and the final stroke forecloses the old goal of accurate color. Pressure is accumulative/textural: each failed pigment layer adds weight until the storm-cloud canvas becomes the acceptable answer. Cost is visible: he abandons the hope of “correct” hue and accepts tactile truth. No external antagonist needed; the conflict is purely stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—will the pilgrimage yield connection?—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once the lens vibrates independently, forcing Elias to revise the pilgrimage’s purpose. Cost is conceptual (the wait must continue), not tactile; a sharper forfeiture would deepen the turn. Still, the single deepening satisfies the 600-word bandwidth.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—will he stay frozen or re-enter the living—tightens through each origami waypoint, narrowing options from workshop to dome. The “Illuminate” lotus forces the decisive look skyward, costing him the illusion that Liora can return. Pressure accumulates via pattern density, not external antagonist; coincidence (girl vanishing) complicates rather than resolves. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—will she enter the map or remain outside—is signaled early and tightens when the text arrives. However, the tightening is purely cognitive: no concrete resource (time, safety, reputation) is risked on-page, so the price stays abstract. Agency is present—she sends the text—but the external pressure never physically or socially impedes her, keeping escalation in the mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—can Elara purge the archive’s lethal order without being consumed—tightens when Kael’s touch proves the archive feeds on her own nostalgia, forcing a single renunciation. Escalation is linear but effective: each forbidden step deepens entanglement until the only remaining option is release; cost is legible in the dissolution of both child and texts.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—prove the river’s ghost to keep hope alive—tightens when footage overlap makes the shadow almost solid, foreclosing easier doubt. Agency is intellectual and tactile (terminal choices, releasing the stone), with visible price: he gives up possessing the last river fragment. One meaningful deepening satisfies the short-form lens.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—protective compassion vs. self-protection—tightens when Elias abandons adhesive for the trim, a visible trade-off. Pressure escalates via pattern-break: gentle reconstruction turns to controlled amputation, reweighting the stake under Accumulative lens. Cost is legible on-page (shorter tail, new notebook). The off-stage poacher prevents a final external confrontation, keeping escalation just shy of the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—“will he keep listening or seal the wounds?”—is signaled early and tightens when the tunnel mouth appears. The shattering hourglasses provide one clear escalation that reweights options under the Accumulative lens. No visible price is extracted on-page (no wound reopened, no voice lost), so the beat falls short of 8.8 territory, but pressure coheres throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—“retrieve the lost tune or surrender the letters to oblivion”—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens once: the strip blackens, forcing her spoken promise. Pressure is accumulative-textural; no external antagonist, but the stakes become visceral when the film begins to burn. The price (she may destroy the last carrier) is legible on the page. One beat shy of 8.8: we don’t feel the cost translate back to her body or future options.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—unblock creativity—is signaled early; pressure escalates via sensory accumulation rather than narrowing options. No reversal or trade-off occurs; the aurora simply returns what was lost. Agency is receptive, not active, so escalation is atmospheric, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—“guard cargo” reframed to “guard sparks”—is signaled early and tightened once. Pressure is atmospheric, not tactical; no visible price paid on-page. Escalation is a single cadence shift (dawn approaching). Sufficient for short-form, but lacks felt cost that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes—“rediscover the wild frontier of mind”—are declared early but remain abstract; no concrete option is foreclosed mid-text. The gear’s pulse intensifies the hum, yet the protagonist remains passive recipient of guardian exposition. Escalation is tonal, not tactical; cost is paid only in the final dissolve, too late to shape tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—“find unused courage”—is signaled early and tightens once when the star stamp glows, forcing the final stance crystallization. No reversal or external antagonist is needed under Accumulative lens; the deepening of ambient light and lantern chorus suffices to raise cost. Price is legible but intellectual (she “doesn’t feel like a passenger”), not a tangible forfeiture, keeping it below the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“will he reopen the silenced truth?”—is signaled early and tightens when the bolt vanishes. Mid-scene reversal: Madame Veyra admits to systematic forgetting, raising the cost of pursuit from job-loss to existential erasure. Escalation is single-cycle but sufficient for 750 words; the refusal crystallizes stance without safety net, satisfying the lens. Could use one more tangible forfeiture (e.g., surrender of rehab-approved quiet) to push into 8.5+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (unmask pretender) is signaled early; pressure tightens when the rune’s criterion threatens her own identity, but the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page, keeping escalation just shy of the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“why do some paths disappear?”—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when she uncovers the deliberate purge; the escalation is one steady ramp rather than a reversal, but the final image narrows her options to perpetual vigilance, so cost is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—“find meaning in the mess”—is signaled early; escalation is atmospheric (hum grows to ache) rather than causal, adequate for Accumulative track. One visible tightening: stones’ pulse forces the palm contact that forecloses isolation; price is the bodily ache, but no option is explicitly closed off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—release or preserve the embryo—tightens once: symbols decoded → unseal → world reborn. Escalation is accumulative: plant hum thickens, water churns, air smells of lightning. Cost is legible in the vanished amber and the Council wrath now inevitable. No second reversal, but one decisive intensification suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—enduring memory of massacre—tightens once: drone-hum triggers freeze, orchid vibration reframes threat into fragile attention, narrowing options from flight to stewardship. Cost is legible (photo buried, refusal of celebration), though escalation is single-note; no secondary reversal or resource loss beyond emotional stance.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can he reassemble meaning after abandonment—tightens when the room literally shrinks, forcing either surrender or re-creation. The midpoint reversal: erasing the portrait face narrows options from recovery to reinvention. Escalation is accumulative/textural: density of decay, claustrophobia, and charcoal dust layer until acquiescence feels inevitable. Price is the forfeiture of representational art itself, legible on the final canvas.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—“will Elias intervene?”—is signaled by the scream at word ~200; the tightening beat is the ink-message that reframes child-poisoning as time-theft. Agency is present: he lunges, grabs, and vows pursuit. Cost is conceptual (time itself is stolen) yet viscerally felt in the boy’s blue breath; however, no personal price (tool lost, social credit burned) is shown. Escalation is single-step, adequate for 700-word scope; coincidence (drone lands exactly here) complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—control of historical memory—tightens when the letter’s placement makes discovery inevitable; escalation is causal under lens. One meaningful turn: planting the letter narrows his options to fugitive status. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable in final image.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—continuity vs. bounty—tightens once: sheathe gesture forecloses lethal option, forces father to decide. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves. Visible price: rose wilts, bounty unclaimed, both lose cash and certainty. Could edge higher if father’s refusal cost were sharpened on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—capture the goddess’s echo—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: sky chaos → garden shriek → void silence, forcing zigzag stance. Cost is conceptual (he becomes vessel) but only lightly felt. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversal, yet option space narrows to silence or failure.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—truth versus erasure—signals in paragraph 1 and tightens when the archive footnote appears. Agency drives escalation: each letter narrows her tactical space and raises social/existential cost. The midnight wax seal is the visible price that forecloses anonymity. No coincidence resolves; journalist warning complicates rather than saves. Pressure coheres under causal lens without slack loops.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—silence the accusatory cries—signals in paragraph four and tightens when the translator spits the exact sentence he fears. The tattoo gun becomes the last viable tactic; each constellation narrows escape routes until the firmware dims, a visible price. No external antagonist is needed; internal pressure escalates under causal lens. One deepening beat suffices at this length, and it delivers.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—can art trap what the town refuses to speak?—tightens when the mandala turns from cage to mirror. One meaningful deepening: the hush reveals itself as fullness, forcing her choice to embed the flake. Cost is legible; Maren’s antagonism could sharpen earlier to hit 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—whether the plaza will be allowed to forget *Amira*—is signaled by word three and tightens when the name is uncovered. One meaningful turn: instead of erasing, she inlays the shard, foreclosing vengeance without sentimentality; the price is blood on the stone and the permanent visibility of the name. Pressure is coherent under Causal lens; no coincidence intrudes. Could use one more intermediate obstacle (physical or social) to push the score higher.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—Liora’s hunger for one more dance—tightens when Elias offers the fractured timeline instead of a literal stage. Escalation is accumulative: each echo (young Liora laughing, older Elias watching) deepens the cost of indulging nostalgia. The final hand-take narrows options: she chooses to live inside possibility rather than rest in oblivion. A sharper external obstacle (garden resisting?) could have pushed the peak higher, but pressure remains coherent under the lyric lens.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“how to live with the pill’s rewiring”—tightens once: accidental shock forces her from denial to experimentation, then to acceptance. The shared-memory thread raises cost (someone else’s joy invades her), foreclosing the option of total reversal. Agency stays hers: she swallows placebo, paints pathways, chooses collaboration with Eli. No external antagonist needed; internal/external pressures braid cleanly under 800 words.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—becoming the cave’s voice—tightens once: from mapping the unknown to being possessed by it. The device shattering is a visible price, but escalation is single-note; no secondary reversal or tactical loss beyond the fusion itself. Sufficient for this length, yet the cost could have bitten earlier to shape tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will the prophecy compel her or will she master it?—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when the sand reverses. One meaningful deepening: the realization that buttons “were waiting” reweights her task from archival to creative. Cost is legible in the slowed sand and the echo’s expended note. Under Accumulative lens the escalation is sufficient, though a second tightening beat could have pushed it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“find where unused courage waits”—is signaled early and tightens when the key forces a binary: open the door or remain in erasure. The act of leaving the pillbox behind pays the visible price of accepting perpetual responsibility. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversal overload. Cost is legible: he exchanges oblivion for the weight of abandoned agents.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stake is atmospheric survival—keep the ferry intact until crossing—yet the storm’s escalation is external, not tightened by Elias’s prior choices; the single beat of mending rope deepens texture but does not narrow future options or force a trade-off. Because the storm parts by narrative grace rather than by an irreversible action that costs him, pressure accumulates but never pivots, leaving the conflict vivid yet static.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—why the oasis resists change—escalates through sensory echoes (honey scent, bee hum) that intensify density rather than causal turns; a single deepening at the hive base reweights options, but the tightening is more atmospheric than tactical, keeping pressure coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—whether beauty can survive decay—tightens once: the rose is gone, the girl arrives, the tool must pass on. Pressure is coherent but singular; no secondary reversal complicates the transfer. The cost is felt, yet the escalation is more cadence shift than option foreclosure.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“translate isolation into independence”—is signaled early and tightens once: the library’s rearrangement forecloses the option of remaining a passive archivist. No external antagonist is needed; pressure is the hum that forces her to speak the lost words. Cost is legible: she gains agency but remains alone under the crystalline dome. A second reversal or higher bodily price would push this into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“find the thread that connects all things”—is signaled early and tightens through each reflective encounter; the mirror labyrinth deepens pattern rather than widens conflict. Escalation is textural: each surface (water, mirror) fragments and reassembles her image, reweighting the stake without external antagonism. The final twig gift forecloses the search path with quiet conceptual cost, meeting the 8.0+ bar. Pressure is coherent but gentle; a sharper external consequence or irreversible forfeiture would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—community cohesion vs cosmic deception—is signaled in paragraph three and tightens when Mara realizes silence is the only remaining tactic. One meaningful escalation: the shift from “theory” to actionable subsonic pulse forecloses loud resistance. Cost is legible—she risks permanent trickster attention and professional ridicule if wrong. Pressure stays coherent under causal lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—‘find the key or stay caged’—tightens when the figure offers the compass and warns of irreversible sight. One meaningful escalation: acceptance dissolves the literal cage into a navigable map. Cost is legible: the city he knew is now a mobile ship, stranding him in uncharted dimension-space; option set is permanently widened and destabilized.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—awaken empathy for a forgotten woman—tightens when the lance converts abstract injustice to concrete artifact. One meaningful deepening occurs: Elara shifts from observer to bearer of evidence, foreclosing the option to remain merely an archivist; cost is legible in her sweat-slick grip on the ribbon.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—honor ancestor vs. survive coming storm—tightens when the nail’s key-shape is revealed, collapsing safety and legacy into one choice. Escalation is causal: each decoded stanza narrows options until only the furnace passage remains. Price is legible: she forfeits the shelter she sought. No coincidence resolves; the storm complicates, not saves.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“will the world finish rendering?”—is signaled early; escalation is textural: each sensory coat thickens the question until rain “loads” the valley. No reversible turn or external opposition narrows options; tension is accretive, not adversarial. Cost is aesthetic/epistemic rather than visceral, adequate for length but below 8.8 threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—break the family cycle—signals early and tightens once when Elias re-pockets the foreign bills, renouncing the collector’s inertia. No external antagonist; pressure is situational-memory, coherent under Accumulative lens. Rain arrival supplies the single cadence shift that forecloses lingering. Cost is implied (he walks away from nostalgic refuge), but page doesn’t make him sacrifice anything tangible beyond proximity to ruins.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stake—"decode or be crushed by the burden"—is clear early; pressure intensifies once when dreams converge on the temple, but the escalation is informational rather than tactical; no visible resource is lost or risked, so the tightening is conceptual, not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“what mirrors do not show”—tightens when the plant demands the unspoken truth; options narrow to confess or be consumed. Escalation is causal: each memory she feeds increases physical pain and social exposure. Cost is visible—blood, trembling hands, and the child’s future revenge—so pressure peaks at the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—remake the eclipsed covenant—is signaled early and tightened when the clipping pulses against his scar. Escalation is lyrical, not causal: atmosphere thickens, woman appears, plane shifts; options narrow only metaphorically. No tangible price is exacted from Elias before the threshold crossing, so pressure feels aesthetic rather than jeopardy-driven. Sufficient for short-form lyric escalation, but lacks a tactic-altering reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—retrieve brother—narrows to “keep his voice or save him”; the tightening is the stranger’s price. One decisive reversal: she yields the memory, options foreclose instantly. Pressure is causal, personal, final. A visible price (card → dust, memory → void) alters tactics on the spot.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—purpose vs. self-erasure—tightens when cloth exchange forces decision: keep relic of past or risk new chord. Micro-turn at cloth hand-off narrows options; cost is loss of talismanic shield. Pressure coherent under Accumulative lens: each echo (wind, memory, voice) layers density until silence becomes future. Escalation stays internal; no external irreversible loss beyond symbolic forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reestablish connection—signals early and tightens once: the seed insertion irrevocably commits her to translator-bridge duty. Pressure is accumulative; each pulse raises the psychic temperature until the script flips. Cost is legible—she will spend her life translating—but not yet visceral (no cramp in her hand, no blood on the bark). Sufficient for 8.4; 8.8 would need a sharper physical price.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—safeguard migrating identities—tightens via each book placed in the creel, a visible accumulation that narrows Elias’s stance toward release; pressure is coherent but external (moon, tide) rather than antagonistic, so escalation is atmospheric, not adversarial, keeping cost legible yet diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“dissolve the walls between hearts”—is signaled early and escalates through each confession she liquifies; the tightening is the pattern itself. One meaningful reversal: the moment she realizes the last wall is her own fear. Cost is legible: the pearl exhausts its glow, the bunker empties, she exits lighter but stripped of her talisman.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—living with unforgiven guilt—is signaled early and intensifies through each graffiti revelation. The meaningful tightening occurs when she accepts the map’s uselessness yet keeps drawing; this renunciation narrows her option set from escape to endurance. Cost is legible: the accordion’s weight and the unanswered family letters persist. Pressure is accumulative rather than causal, appropriate to the lens; the river remains off-stage, so external escalation is modest but sufficient for the word count.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—access the unspoken—signals early and tightens when the library demands she write, not merely observe. One meaningful deepening occurs: blank pages fill only after she commits to authorship, shifting the task from discovery to creation. Cost is conceptual (she loses the library itself) but felt on the page. Under Accumulative/Textural lens the escalation is sufficient; no secondary reversal is needed at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“weigh dream against empire”—is signaled in paragraph 5 and tightened when the note becomes a force that annihilates the empire’s proxy (father). One visible price: stained-glass map flips from ruin to open road, foreclosing imperial safety. Pressure escalates causally under the Causal lens; no coincidence resolves. Could use one more intermediate cost (e.g., physical injury) to hit 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“capture one last spark”—is signaled early and escalates as the emerald’s pulse fades. Pressure tightens when the chip dims at revival; the cost is the irreversible drain of the only tool. Agency is ritual attention rather than brute action, fitting the lens. A sharper external jeopardy or irreversible bodily price would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—find the source of contentment—is signaled early and narrows to one decisive act: relinquishing the hairpin. Pressure is lyrical-accumulative; tension tightens through recurring scallop/ shell imagery rather than external opposition. Cost is conceptual (loss of relic) rather than visceral; felt price is present but muted. No reversal complicates her path; escalation is a single deepening beat at the pool.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—Elias deciding whether to “unhook” Veyra—surfaces late and remains conversational; no visible tactic narrows. Pressure is ambient (guilt, chimes, mirror) rather than actionable; Elias’s single prompt is not tested by resistance. No option is foreclosed, no price shown. Ambiguity is thematic, not procedural, so escalation stays flat under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—prove vanishing—signaled early; pressure is textural (hum intensifies, rings freeze) rather than causal. One deepening: rings stop, forcing recognition. No visible price or option foreclosure; success feels predestined. Escalation is atmospheric, not tactical, keeping tension flat.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—learn to navigate without moving—is signaled early and tightened once: the birds’ ruptured pattern forces Elias to stand and act. The price is conceptual rather than visceral—he forfeits normal locomotion—but the cost is legible in the final “spaces between steps.” No external antagonist is needed; pressure is situational-coherent. A second tightening beat would have pushed this into the 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—prove worth to himself—is signaled early and tightened once: the fountain forces him to swallow every memory of failure before the label “slow learner” arrives. The mist dissolution is the single meaningful escalation; options narrow to “accept dispersal or turn back,” and agency is expressed by the kneel-and-plant act that spends the drop. Cost is legible yet singular; a secondary obstacle or forfeiture could have sharpened the trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“see the color of sound”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the open book redefines perception and the woman demands stance. One visible trade-off: he forfeits the Lumen key, foreclosing his old anonymity. Cost is present but light; still, escalation coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—will he keep forcing meaning or accept uncertainty—signaled early. Tightening occurs when he flips the prophecy logic: coins become questions, foreclosing his former distillation project. Pressure is internal-static, coherent under Accumulative lens; cost is the surrendered epistemic control. No external antagonist or resource loss keeps escalation cerebral rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—“to give names to nameless fears”—is signaled in paragraph four and tested when Elias must spend his stolen names to quiet the monsters. Pressure tightens through each whispered label; the atlas loses ink, foreclosing retreat. Cost is visible: the page ends blank, the beam consumes the light he had gathered. Under the Accumulative lens the deepening is sufficient, yet the external risk never escalates beyond the observatory walls, keeping the score below the 8.8 tier.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—restore fish/sea-song—signaled early; pressure tightens when drip rhythm must match world-pulse, foreclosing faster or slower options. Protagonist agency drives escalation: each micro-tilt of bell alters possibility; final strike is deliberate, not luck. Cost visible: cracks remain, world still tilting, fish few. Under causal lens, because/therefore chain is clean. One meaningful tightening sufficient for length; no reversal required. Meets 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“drowned stories resurfacing”—tightens once: the fourth photo collapses Elias’s inherited myth. Price is legible: he must now publicly bear witness, forfeiting the warden’s quiet authority. Could use one earlier micro-loss to push into 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—will she master or release wonder?—tightens once: pressing the crystal into earth forfeits the old methodology. Under Accumulative lens, the escalating density of sensory images (ripe apple, bee hum, starling choreography) reweights the cost of surrender; no reversals needed. Price is legible in the shatter.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—prove patterns matter by surviving—tightens when the branch snaps and forecloses the option to wait; the vine-buckle improvisation is an on-page trade-off that escalates physical cost. Pressure is coherent but single-cycle; no second reversal keeps it from 8.8+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—defeat emotional numbness—tightens when sparring failure forces the insight that numbness is canvas, not enemy. Escalation is one meaningful shift: Veyra’s blade slices the pretense armor, narrowing Kael’s options to stay (duplicate fate) or leap (unknown feeling). Cost is the dojo’s safety forever forfeited. Agency remains Kael’s; coincidence absent.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—safeguard innovation—emerges on day 7 and sharpens with each boxed threat. One meaningful tightening: the pinned warning relocates the plant indoors, turning her design studio into fortress. Cost is legible—she forfeits the solitude she bought—but the external antagonists remain unnamed, so pressure is atmospheric rather than interpersonal. Sufficient for this length, yet not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—restore laughter—tightens once: silence → off-key song → girl steps → laugh bubbles; each escalation is legible under causal lens. No reversals needed; one meaningful tightening suffices. Agency is Elias’s angle-tweak and final relinquishment; cost is the empty tank and exposed identity. Pressure stays coherent; coincidence (girl appears) complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: will Mara obtain the knowledge that will cure her metaphysical homesickness? Pressure tightens once: the book offers to write her fear into reality, forcing a tacit choice—risk definition or retreat. The refusal to keep waiting is a stance crystallization, but because the guardian never threatens or bargains, the stakes feel abstract; the cost is conceptual, not dramatized on her body, options, or future.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“transmute or break”—is signaled early and tightens when he chooses destruction over refinement. One meaningful deepening: realization that failure itself is the path. Cost is legible in the relic’s loss and the risk of self-immolation. Agency drives every escalation; coincidence absent. Sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“find the beginning in every ending”—is signaled in para 1 and escalates through texture: static thickens, tower bolts scream, gravity spikes. One meaningful deepening occurs when she pivots from capturing first signal to listening “for the silence between them,” narrowing options to a single irrevocable frequency. Cost is legible: bodily obliteration and the fragment’s dissolution. Under Accumulative lens that deepening is sufficient; no extra reversal required.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—“keep the ferry from vanishing”—is declared early; pressure escalates when echoes board. Yet Elias faces no trade-off; the merge succeeds without forfeiture, so cost remains conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—discovering the texture of connection—tightens when the thread begins rewriting his memories, foreclosing safe observation. One visible price: the gallery door disappears, stranding him in the dream-interstice; escalation is steady under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—claim the stars for the deep—is signaled early and escalates through prototype failures and the night sighting that proves the method. Agency stays with Lirien: each lens iteration narrows options, materials dwindle, reputational risk grows. The tightening turn is the successful alignment of alien trajectory with her star chart; thereafter the city’s stance pivots. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral—acceptable under hybrid lens, but a tangible forfeiture (lost tenure, exile threat) would have sharpened the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—find Miriam/protect unheard voices—tightens when Elias warns “they’ll take you,” foreclosing retreat. Hearing-aid pulse accelerates from faint to frantic drumbeat, a causal meter of rising cost. Agency is active: Lena runs toward the chorus; no coincidence resolves. Price is implicit in irreversible merger with the dead.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“return what was taken before tide crushes”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the codex path fades and the wall-route appears, forcing renunciation; cost is legible in Elias’s blank codex and swallowed stars, though escalation is single-arc rather than compounded.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—legitimacy of his own existence—tightens once: ghost’s command “Defragment” forces him to decide whether to keep counting or relinquish the ritual. Cost is legible: he pockets the shard and stops at 103, trading control for acceptance. Pressure is coherent under situational lens; no external antagonist needed. Could use one earlier micro-cost (dropped shard, cracked skin) to push score higher.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—trap texture of a dying language—signalled early; tightening occurs when diamond warms and canyon answers, foreclosing the option to keep listening. Price is off-loaded onto the landscape (silence) rather than the agent, so escalation is legible but not viscerally paid.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—survive the garden’s rewrite—tightens when the phone’s invitation turns his body translucent. One meaningful escalation suffices, yet the cost is more shown than felt; a sharper forfeiture (voice? memory?) would have lifted the beat into the 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—keep beauty alive vs. be eaten by silence—signals early. One meaningful tightening: shell rhythm converts her passive vigil into an active breakout that narrows options to jump. Cost is visible: bruised knees, perpetual exile, bow never silent. Escalation is causal under the chosen lens; no coincidence rescues her.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—deliver the undeliverable—tightens when the jammer activation makes complicity irreversible. Pressure escalates via accretion: each named absence (watchmaker, vanished parent, deportee) adds weight until the final refusal carries collective cost. No reversal, but one meaningful deepening suffices for 600-word scope. Cost is legible in the shared silence and the bottle’s transferred weight.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: can silence re-summon a lost world? Pressure tightens once—song activates halo, halo activates train, train restores circus—each increment forecloses retreat. No antagonist needed; the pressure is ontological. Cost is legible: Elias pays with permanent displacement into memory-made-real. A second tightening beat (doubt, resistance) would push higher, but the single crescendo satisfies short-form economy.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—access to the story-realm—signaled early. One meaningful tightening: the scarf becomes portal key, forcing Elias to choose abandonment of his known post. Cost is poetic (loss of certainty) rather than concrete; escalation is lyric, not tactical, fitting Accumulative lens but capping entry into 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—capture the runaway dream—escalates through each failed photograph; the tightening beat is the sharp image that proves reciprocity, foreclosing solitary obsession and forcing the sea-crossing with on-page effort visible.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—will the silenced founding truth be released?—tightens once when the braid ignites with ancestral voices, foreclosing the option to re-bury the secret. Pressure is coherent but single-stage; the locksmith meets no external resistance or internal trade-off, so the escalation feels more illumination than collision.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—recover stolen memory—tightens when star-map proves the ring is active; escalation is one-way but coherent. Cost is felt in sister’s translucent accusation; options narrow to “too late,” satisfying lens. No second beat, so stays below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—whether Elara will re-enter the world or keep annotating emptiness—is signaled early, but pressure plateaus; Mira’s presence is curiosity, not threat. The meaningful tightening (handing over the teacup) reweights mentorship yet does not foreclose Elara’s own exile, so cost feels prospective, not paid. Escalation is atmospheric, not tactical; agency is observational rather than irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—“preserve the color of wonder”—is signaled early and tightens through the seed’s sprouting and the travelers’ return, a single deepening rather than reversal. Pressure is lyrical, not causal: each leaf adds chromatic density until the world’s palette is irreversibly repopulated; the cost is the exhaustion visible in Maren’s tremble. No antagonist or trade-off narrows options; the risk is failure of imagination, not external opposition. Escalation stays within Accumulative bounds and reaches legible intensity, but the absence of a foreclosed option keeps it just below the 7.0 threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—free the grounded spirits—tightens through each unraveled knot; the option space narrows from restoration to butchery. The middle reversal (spirits are part of the mask) escalates under protagonist agency and forces the knife decision. Cost is legible: sanctuary silence thickens audibly, the King’s grip literalizes opposition, and the scream marks irreversible damage. One tightening suffices for 600-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—will Elias break the village’s suffocating silence?—is signaled early and tightens once: the footage comparison forces the decision to reopen. The escalation is single-cycle but legible; the price (he now hears whispers) is on-page. Could use one intermediate obstacle to deepen cost, but sufficient for 800-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—possession of forbidden knowledge vs. letting it vanish—is signaled when Elias pockets the globe. Pressure escalates causally: each new piece of information (ledger, apparition, spinning biplane) narrows his options toward release. No coincidence resolves; the ghost’s beckoning is the final squeeze that forces the shatter. Cost is visible—the dissolving plume—so the tightening carries weight under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“to give the ghost voice”—tightens once: graffiti plea → music → iron key. Pressure is textural, accumulating luminescence and sound rather than narrowing options; the final chord simply completes the ritual without new jeopardy, so escalation is present but modest.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—whether to violate or respect the captain’s grief—tightens once when Lira deciphers the sketches and again when she renounces further intrusion. Pressure is coherent under situational lens; no coincidence resolves anything. Cost is legible in the relinquished goggles and the ache she carries back downstairs.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—can the sky be forced to return what it took?—is signaled in paragraph one and sharpened by the telescope’s apparition. One meaningful tightening: stratus of “unspoken apologies” condense into the recognizable hull, forcing the leap. Cost is conceptual (the sky shows but does not forgive) and visceral (the void below). Agency resides in the decision to jump; no external coincidence rescues him.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“mirror the sky without caging it”—tightens once: the sketch’s perfection forces renunciation. Pressure is textural, not causal, but the inferred lens (Accumulative) legitimizes density increase over reversal. Cost is legible: she forfeits the artifact and accepts ephemerality just as demolition clock hits zero. No escalation curve, yet the single deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—earn the sigil by finding an unmapped route—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: the hopscotch cipher becomes the only live option and forecloses safer study. Cost is conceptual but legible: mastery now depends on decoding living shadows. No reversal or antagonist is required under Accumulative lens; one meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—restore temporal engine or leave world gearless—is signaled early and tightens when mirrors reveal the clockmaker’s entrapment. One meaningful deepening: the gears’ hum shifts from curiosity to custodial burden. Cost is present (Elias forfeits ordinary life-path shown in child-reflection), but pressure plateaus after the kneel; no second fork where failure feels imminent. Sufficient for length, yet short of the visceral price that would punch 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—orchard survival—signals early via dwindling blossoms. Escalation is textural: each chalked message deepens communal attention, narrowing options from exploitation to partnership. The seventh message (“You were always the gardeners”) forces a public stance with visible cost—shared fruit, repaired wings. No coincidence resolves; the reversal is earned by collective micro-acts triggered by Liora’s prompts.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“stretch the moment before the end”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when Elias pivots from delay to release. One meaningful deepening: the puppet recognition turns his vocation from resistance to lullaby. Cost is visible (clock dissolves) and forecloses further rewinding. Under Accumulative lens the cadence shift suffices; no extra reversals needed.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—spare one life before frost—signals early and tightens with each patrol pass. The meaningful turn is Mira’s shift from direct intervention to trace-less guidance, narrowing her future options (she can no longer claim ignorance). Cost is legible: another stranger lives, but the orchard’s hunger and her guilt remain, guaranteeing tomorrow’s repeat. Escalation is single-cycle but sufficient for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—redeem her life’s work and reconnect—surfaces early. Pressure tightens once: foam insight reframes her rigid polymer dogma, foreclosing the old research path. The beat is intellectual, not externalized; no tangible resource or relationship is risked on the page, so the cost is felt but not dramatized. Sufficient for a single meaningful tightening at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“find where stories begin”—tightens when Elias relinquishes the only item he couldn’t price; this single meaningful deepening forecloses the option of ever owning that certainty. Agency is present but gentle: the sale is voluntary, the cost is the absence that follows. No reversal, yet the accumulative pattern reweights the stake under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is legible on-page: “its absence felt heavier than its presence ever had.”

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: will shared grief drown or be carried? Pressure tightens once—hand-clasp forces Maren to ingest Kael’s loss, narrowing options to “carry together or die alone.” No reversals, but the single deepening is sufficient under Accumulative lens and the cost is legible in the warmed coral beat. Coincidence is absent; escalation is emotional density, not plot twists.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—can isolation be turned into chorus?—is signaled early and tightens once: the first collective hum either fractures or fuses. Escalation is textural rather than causal; density rises as languages layer into a single melody. Cost is audible (tower groan) but not personal to Mara; she risks no visible loss. Sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—whether to resurrect or preserve the broken dream—tightens once the woman’s face appears; refusal forecloses the restoration path. Escalation is textural: fracture-glow intensifies, canyon whisper deepens, risk of possession grows. Cost is legible in the mirror’s chill and her wavering breath.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—“find forgotten combinations”—is declared early; pressure tightens when symbols rearrange and the blank book demands transfer of her marginalia, foreclosing the option to remain mere observer. The transfer itself is passive (book does the writing), so agency is observational rather than decisive. Cost is conceptual but present: she exits transformed, sworn to secrecy. One clear tightening beat satisfies short-form requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“create music in a silent world”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened when the first gasp of sound escapes; option space narrows from “can anything sing?” to “this broken thing can, but only once.” The hedgehog’s uncurling supplies a soft clock, not a threat, so pressure is accumulative rather than adversarial; still, the protagonist’s agency drives every escalation beat.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“find meaning in exile through silence”—is signaled early and tightens once the symbols cohere, foreclosing the option to leave empty-handed. Cost is present but soft: the foregone life is implied, not dramatized. Agency is mostly attention and correlation, yet that suffices under the Accumulative lens. A sharper forfeiture (time, bodily risk, or social capital) would push the band higher.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“hear Liora’s voice in silence”—tightens when each failed frequency narrows options; the oscillator’s rising pitch is a visible proxy for escalating pressure. The meaningful turn is Liora’s fork gift: it forecloses the path of solitary deciphering and makes the reunion the price of success. Cost is felt but modest; fireworks thunder exteriorizes the achieved silence yet doesn’t exact a tangible loss, capping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—can she cultivate serenity for her people—gets signaled early and re-anchored by Nara’s warning. Pressure escalates texturally: each sensory note, elder caution, and grandmother’s frantic line thickens the cost of being wrong. Yet Mira never faces an on-page trade-off; she never has to choose between planting the seed tonight or surrendering it, so the tightening is intellectual, not tactical. The final acceptance is resonant but not a reversal—no option is foreclosed—so escalation stays modest.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are legible early—one hour until inversion—and tighten when the arrow tip warms, signaling the grove’s anomaly. The single meaningful deepening occurs as she kneels, letting gravity reverse rather than fleeing, trading safety for communion with the echoes; the cost is the risk of being crushed, felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“map the anomaly before it maps you”—tightens when the wind vectors invert and the labyrinth rearranges, forcing a single option: run. The cost is legible (sealed fate), but because the city’s adaptation is off-stage and Elias’s final sprint is reactive, the tightening feels situational rather than a trade-off he actively authors.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“will the song escape before the chisel kills the hush?”—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens with each clink that shatters color. Escalation is accumulative: three strikes progressively fragment the melody, forcing Eira to risk the largest bell. The final white-note forecloses the option to retry; the sculptor’s silence is the visible price. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length, and it carries unmistakable cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—mend the tear before reality bleeds—signals early and tightens when the figure declares the boundary a thread. Single meaningful deepening: failure-to-seal becomes opportunity-to-weave, foreclosing the wall-building option. Cost is conceptual (paradigm shift) rather than visceral; no tangible price is risked or lost on the page. Sufficient for this length, but the absence of a personal trade-off caps the band below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—can emotion be mathematized without self-erasure?—is signaled early. Pressure tightens when borrowed voices accelerate and the fragment’s hum invades bone; options narrow to endure or be hollowed. The woman’s warning complicates but does not resolve, satisfying coincidence guardrail. Cost is felt in the final quiet, yet the beat is more atmospheric than tactical; a hair below the 8.2 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—carry vs. become—is signaled early and tightens once: “germinate wonder” forces her inward renunciation. Pressure is coherent, not escalating in causal leaps but accumulating texture until the ridgeway breathes. Cost is legible: magic spent, path foreclosed. Sufficient for 600-word scope; lacks persistent constraint but lands the required deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—prove/disprove emotional absorption—signaled early. Pressure tightens once: frost face reveals prior mourner, forcing Elias to confront transformed grief rather than raw emotion. Accumulative deepening (density of mirrored sorrow) reweights the stake, but no visible price is exacted from him—no tool cracks, no belief forfeited, no external consequence—so escalation is intellectual, not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“stay swallowed by silence or re-enter the world”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens once: the bead’s hum makes refusal impossible. No reversals needed under Accumulative lens; density of forgetting increases until silence flips from refuge to prison. Cost is visible when she abandons the loom and orchard without guarantee of return.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—save the orchards—signaled by paragraph 5 and tightened when the fissure’s blue bleed is discovered. One meaningful escalation: the silk’s self-weaving reaction raises the cost of error (botched seal could fracture the arch). Protagonist agency drives every beat; no coincidence rescues him. Price is visible—night of labor, sweat, risk of collapse—yet the orchard’s revival is reported, not witnessed, slightly muting the payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—“what truth is withheld”—is signaled early and tightens when the double appears, forcing a single irrevocable choice. Escalation is one-step but sufficient: the bay’s walls thin, the gate activates, options narrow to redirect or retreat. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; the image of the scale holding the shard makes the price legible.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: can Elias re-engage with the living world instead of merely servicing its dead beacons? Pressure tightens when the stone syntax demands an answer; his three-plus-two reply forecloses the option of passive reception. Cost is visible—he sacrifices the relic that insulated him from grief. Escalation is accumulative rather than causal-turn, but the final lamp-lighting crystallizes stakes with undeniable price.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—will she birth the city at personal cost?—is signaled early and tightens once: the accidental prophecy narrows options from “tend the beacon” to “become its seed.” Agency is visible when she angles the lantern to sharpen the vision, accepting the price off-stage. A clearer on-page forfeiture (loss of her own solidity, laughter dimming) would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes—“why some lives shimmer”—stay dominant and deepen when the traveler links sun trails to story-symbols, tightening the textural pattern. No reversal or option is foreclosed; pressure accumulates through luminous recognition rather than a choice that costs. The final shimmer is a deepening, not a narrowing, satisfying the Accumulative lens but keeping tension lyric, not acute.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—“measure what remains of sorrow”—is signaled early; pressure deepens via tower whispers, offerings, then sextant re-forging that forecloses escape. One meaningful tightening: map shifts from sky to earth, crystallizing his endurance. Cost visible in numb-hand reversal and lifelong caretaker burden accepted.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stakes are declared early—realm dying, nights endless—but the only escalation is the keeper handing over a seed and saying “sing.” No obstacle, failed attempt, or rising cost narrows options; the song works on first try. Pressure remains atmospheric rather than tactical, satisfying the Accumulative lens yet lacking a visible trade-off that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—will he break the rule of retreat?—is signaled by the singed invitation and tightens when the paradox shelf delivers the map. One meaningful escalation: the clock striking midnight collapses deliberation into action, foreclosing the option to hide. Cost is visible: he steps into “empty streets,” forfeiting sanctuary. Pressure is coherent but single-note; a second obstacle (locked door, guardian, weather) would have raised the band.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—can memory-loss be resisted?—is signaled early. Pressure escalates only once: when Elias realizes no one else remembers the bakery. The seed-planting is acceptance, not a tightening that narrows options; no visible price is paid on the page after the choice. Under Accumulative lens the single deepening is sufficient, but the lack of live cost caps the upper band.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“save the library from oblivion”—is signaled early and tightened when the illusion begins to fade; Elias’s agency (frequency adjustment) directly forecloses the option of walking away. Cost is visible: perpetual vigilance implied by “locked the frequencies in place.” Pressure escalates under causal lens, but only one beat of real endangerment (flicker) occurs; a second constriction would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“capture the sound of trust breaking”—is declared early; escalation tightens when the knife appears and Lena’s interference risks her father’s name. The reversal (delay, not prevent) narrows her options and keeps the truce intact, paying a social cost of future exposure. Stakes stay personal; no larger systemic loss is risked, capping intensity just below exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—will she confront the unexplained or keep safe distance—tightens when the ring locks onto a person, foreclosing retreat. One meaningful escalation: electoral hum → silence after decision, price is the irreversible sight of migrating forest and her own complicity. Agency sits with her descent and grip on the ring.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes—“uncork suppressed creativity” and “bring them home”—are declared early; pressure tightens when the dream reveals the door. Yet the escalation is atmospheric, not tactical: no choice narrows options until the turnkey moment, so the cost feels conceptual rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—find lost conversations—signalled early; pressure tightens when map half-assembled forces the archive trespass. One visible cost: she risks damaging the last bloom’s case to access the stair, but escalation still feels single-note; no secondary obstacle raises the ante further.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve wonder’s colors—is signaled early and tightens when the iceberg shrinks. Agency: Elias steals the orb, trades a child’s wonder for the sculpture’s song; the price (theft, faster melt) is visible. One meaningful intensification suffices for 700-word span; coincidence (storm-delivered ice) complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“contain chaos or be erased by it”—tightens when the gear vial accelerates, forcing the burn that forecloses retreat. Escalation is textural: each magnetic flutter thickens static, deepens rose blackening, and increases gear speed, reweighting cost without external antagonist. Protagonist agency drives the final ignition; price is the dome itself.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—“can listening heal absence?”—is signaled early and deepens once when Clara’s trembling read becomes legible to Elara, tightening the emotional aperture. Pressure is observational, not tactical; the curator risks nothing tangible and loses no option, so cost is vicarious. Sufficient for a quiet 600-word piece but not urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—liberate the final experiment—tightens when the dice roll narrows her options to one rusted hatch; escalating water and ghost-dance pressure force the decisive six-one throw whose cost (owning the eerie vials) is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—recover lost sister/self—surfaces early and tightens when the spiral reappears in coffee and journal. The gravity fluctuation is the single meaningful escalation that forecloses retreat; cost is visible as boots slide and wildflowers scatter. Pressure is coherent, but a second micro-cost (physical strain, social risk) would have sharpened the trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—quiet the prophecy—signals early; pressure is the fear that words still echo. Escalation is textural: silence deepens, paper darkens, but no new external or internal obstacle complicates the choice; options do not visibly narrow. Cost is present yet diffuse—loss of the parchment—rather than a tactical forfeiture that alters next moves. Sufficient for short lyric mode but not sharpened to a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—whether to keep the language private—is signaled early via hidden seal. Mid-story tightening occurs when Mira spots the seal, forcing exposure; options narrow from solitary remembrance to collaborative legacy. Cost is present but light: the shared secret ends Elara’s monopoly on grief, yet no tangible loss (time, safety, object) is dramatized. Pressure is coherent under causal lens; coincidence of twin seals is allowed to complicate, not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—free Liora or remain quarantined—is signaled early via the warm seashell cue. Pressure tightens when the whisper becomes a machine pulse and Liora’s form materializes, forcing Elias to decide: archive together or stay isolated. Cost is legible: the quarantine breaks, but only by surrendering singular selfhood to shared resonance. One minor slack: the external antagonist (government) is off-page, so the final risk feels conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—restoration of her father’s name—tightens when the scroll’s exposure becomes possible. Pressure escalates because Vey physically enters, narrowing options to one decisive beat. The cost is conceptual but legible: she forfeits the sanctuary and her forged-anonymity to free herself. No persistent physical price is dramatized, keeping it just shy of the 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—“will the lost be called back?”—is signaled once the shell whispers a face. Pressure tightens when Veyan reveals the fragments’ nature, forcing Liora to decide whether to surrender her solitary voice. The cost is conceptual but legible: she and Veyan permanently trade their future songs for the chorus of others, a narrowing of option that satisfies the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—whether to unmask the quartermaster—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens when each dreamer’s fragment forecloses the accident theory. The single meaningful deepening occurs when Mara realizes the woman is not victim but perpetrator; this reweights all prior evidence and narrows her options to silence or public accusation. Cost is visible: the shrine’s hush after she decides to “never tell” is the forfeiture of moral clarity she sought. Agency remains hers throughout—she collects, synthesizes, and finally withholds.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stake—Ren’s desire to share his hidden-pattern world—only surfaces once Mei appears; pressure is gentle and one-directional (she arrives, he asks her to stay) without a narrowing choice or trade-off, so escalation is atmospheric rather than consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.6)
    Single tightening beat: Elias decides to descend and publicly contest Kael. Stakes (reclaim prophecy-leadership) are declared early, but pressure escalates only through the radio’s disembodied prompts rather than tangible obstacles; no resource or risk is visibly lost, so the price remains conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—rescue ephemeral sound from erasure—surfaces early; escalation is textural (each new jar thickens the archive) rather than a tightening that forecloses an option, so pressure plateaus until the girl’s arrival supplies external recognition; cost is present but diffused across summary.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—key must not reach scavenger—tightens when Elias risks drowning to seize it. One meaningful reversal: scavenger’s harmonic match collapses under lighthouse flood, forcing Elias’s hand-into-water gambit. Cost is immediate: frozen burn, audible scream, dock-edge suspension. Guilt-as-weapon concept amplifies personal stake without diffusing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—whether to act or keep waiting—tightens once: the viaduct’s pulse forces acknowledgment of the revolution’s immediacy. Yet Elias neither jeopardizes his twelve-winter vigil nor stakes tangible capital (tools, safety, reputation); the handshake registers as recognition, not escalation with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—stop Voss’s engineered disasters—surfaces by paragraph 4 and tightens when Elias overhears “next phase at dawn,” a concrete clock. One meaningful deepening: lantern’s flame flares in response to fear, fusing supernatural hint with mortal risk, narrowing options to act now. Protagonist agency drives every beat: trace pattern, pick lock, transmit data, re-ignite light. Cost is visible—once email is sent, anonymity is forfeited—though price could be sharper if we sensed immediate bodily jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—Elias’s complicity in a wrongful execution—tightens when Kael confirms the heart was post-mortem. One meaningful reversal: “It’s not meant for the living” collapses Elias’s self-absolution and forces active restitution. Cost is legible: he exchanges clerical safety for public accusation.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—ring the unheard bell before the workshop dissolves—is signaled in first paragraph and escalates because acid literally climbs the walls. One meaningful tightening: final gear scrape silences every other option. Protagonist agency drives the turn; coincidence merely hastens corrosion. Cost is immediate and visible—workshop dies, sea hushes, echo answers—foreclosing retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—uncovering deletion—tightens when the 4-7-11 folder surfaces, forcing a go/no-go copy decision. Pressure is coherent but single-stage; the risk never escalates within the scene (no countdown, no ping from IT), so the tightening feels one-note.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—“ice will claim us all”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the path opens and the beast breaches. Escalation is linear, not recursive; no option is foreclosed on-page, so cost feels prospective rather than paid. Still, agency drives every beat under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—will Elias keep consuming death or step into agency?—tightens once: the dying man’s rattle forces the parasol transfer, after which Elias accepts the clipboard, narrowing future options. Pressure is textural, not causal, fitting the accumulative lens; cost is felt in the silence after the last breath. A second tightening beat would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—will she reopen her heart—is signaled early and tightens once: the burned letter forces her to stay after the bus leaves, narrowing exit options. The hand-brush costs her the shelter of old grievance; price is legible. Escalation is single-cycle but sufficient for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—preserve or corrupt the echo—is signaled early and tightens once: the walker must decide whether to clutch or release the golden thread. The tightening is textural, not causal, but valid under the Accumulative lens; cost is legible in the mask’s flare and the pavilion’s settling sigh. One meaningful intensification suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—transmute collective pain into art—remains abstract; pressure escalates only as accretion of images rather than a narrowing option set. No concrete obstacle or trade-off threatens the project; the only “tightening” is the self-placement of his own photo, which feels inevitable, not risky. Cost is conceptual (he must join the collective he curates) but not viscerally tested on page.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—decode the growth pattern—tightens through each crystal trial; options narrow from observation to bodily risk (pressing shard to temple). Escalation is textural: density of sound, light, and botanical impossibility increases until the silence-beneath-noise reconfiguration. Cost is legible as forfeiture of scholarly distance. Could use one tangible external consequence (library lock-in, institutional censure) to raise pressure past the intellectual plane.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“capture the sound of growing older before it slips away”—is signaled early and tightens through each failed recording. The spiral’s completion plus the revealed sentence constitute a meaningful deepening that reweights options under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible: he confronts the self-authored proof of irreversible forgetting. No visible price is extracted after the reveal, keeping it just shy of the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“trap the fleeting light before it vanishes”—is signaled early and tightens when the station itself begins to die. Escalation is causal: each repair choice (harvest clock hand, load last film) shortens his temporal runway. The final pod eject is irreversible, paid for with the observatory’s collapse; cost is legible. No off-stage rescue; coincidence (leaf-fall cue) complicates rather than resolves. One tightening suffices; pressure peaks at shutter press.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—execute a flawless goodbye—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens once: the song must be right, then the shards must be joined. Agency is Elias’s at both turns; options narrow from “what to sing” to “how to hold the broken whole.” Cost is legible in the final hush and the physical edges of vinyl against his thigh. Pressure is coherent but single-cycle; a second tightening would have pushed this into the 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—“where do shadows go?”—is signaled early. Escalation is single-cycle: mirrors reveal personal shadow fragments, forcing recognition. The tightening narrows options from investigation to reclamation, but the price is off-loaded onto the world, not the protagonist, limiting felt cost. Agency is present but low-stakes for Liora herself.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—find the real child or lay the stories to rest—tightens once: the second tooth becomes the map, collapsing search into encounter. Lena’s agency drives every turn (dig, whisper, follow, accept hand), and the price is legible: she accepts guardianship of an uncanny being the town will always fear. No reversal or antagonist is needed; the single deepening suffices under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“share light without fire”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the grotto’s cold and silence force her to choose stillness over spectacle. One meaningful deepening: the pearl’s glow demands passive transmission, foreclosing her old pyrotechnic tactics. Cost is legible in the hush, though external consequence remains conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—can the siblings renegotiate their shared silence—surfaces early and tightens once when Elias proffers the notebook, forcing Mira to stay. The beat narrows options: flee or co-create a new ritual. Cost is present (the pendant is surrendered), though modest in scale for 700 words. Pressure is coherent under the accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stake—“collect shapes of hopes before they dissolve”—is signaled early and tightens when the protagonist accuses Elias of withholding life, forcing the meta-recognition that he must let hopes flow rather than hoard them. Pressure is Accumulative: each ephemeral cameo adds weight until the pattern ruptures; no single reversal narrows options. Cost is conceptual (his novel remains unwritten), but because Elias makes no observable decision in the river beyond turning back, the price feels intellectual rather than tactical, capping the score just under the 7.0 threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stake—revive sacred song—is signaled early; escalation is the arbor’s incremental illumination that forces her cracked-voice public performance, a visible price. Pressure tightens once, sufficiently for 800 words, but no second option is foreclosed; villagers’ scoffing remains off-stage threat rather than lived obstacle, keeping cost poetic rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“preserve the pause, not the heartbeat”—is signaled early; escalation is textural: density of silence, pattern completion, then the ignition that reweights his art. No external antagonist needed; pressure is situational and accumulative. One visible price: he relinquishes the flash-paper craft’s destructive identity to earn the sealed starlight. Under Accumulative lens, the deepening of quiet and the final charged image suffice for 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is legible early: can Elias cage wonder without killing it? Pressure mounts accumulatively—each failed dismantling thickens the air—until the boy-echo forces the recognition that possession must be relinquished. The tightening is single but meaningful: the moment he tilts the quartz to sharpen the reflection, the option to keep the echoes is foreclosed; release is the only way to restart time. Cost is present yet gentle—loss of curated control—so the beat satisfies the lens but lacks a visceral price that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—will she let the burdens bronze her or release them—tightens once when the third thorn-tangle coils around her wrist and the grotto itself groans; the price (possible ossification) is legible, but because the dissolution happens in the same beat the escalation plateaus rather than deepens further.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—how to live with uncontainable loss—is signaled in paragraph 2. Single meaningful tightening: the blade’s first cut narrows infinite options to one line; each stroke forecloses revision. Cost is legible in the lion’s quiet stance and the kettle gone cold. No escalation loop; pressure accretes under Accumulative lens until stance crystallizes.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—will she keep collecting fragments or relinquish the past?—tightens once: the ghost’s appearance collapses the distance between collector and collected. Pressure escalates by accretion of overheard regrets until the camera wheel’s loss forecloses her compulsive archive. Cost is legible in the wheel’s silent sink; no coincidence resolves the tension. One meaningful deepening suffices, but a second micro-turn (e.g., failed attempt to retrieve the wheel) could have pushed higher.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—whether abandoned structures can still nurture life—tightens once: assessment shifts to participation. The deepening is textural (pattern of redirected flows) rather than a reversible causal turn, but caretaker’s revealed garden forecloses the option of pure detachment; cost is felt in Mara's silent pocketing of the sextant and implied future labor.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—avoidance vs. return to the forecourt—is signaled early and tightens once: the repaired music box + bear sighting foreclose continued refusal. Cost is visible—he physically leaves the sanctuary and kneels where he swore never to return—but escalation is single-step, not iterative. Agency is present but gentle; luck (bear arrival) nudges more than forces. Sufficient for 600-word scale, yet lacks a second pressure twist that would push into 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—will he confront the actual source of the lies—surfaces early and tightens when the mirror reflection multiplies crates into a labyrinth, foreclosing retreat. Escalation is causal: because he opens the crate, the reflection confronts him; because the needle swings, he must re-evaluate every prior chase. No coincidence resolves; the pressure coils inward. The price—his directional certainty—lands on the page the instant the sundial stills on the mirror.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve vanishing knowledge—tightens when the rope reveals a perilous place. One meaningful deepening occurs: the shift from generic archive to named, possibly supernatural site. Cost is conceptual (knowledge may outlive the keeper) rather than tangible, keeping pressure solid but not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—can she mend the kingdom’s wound—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through sensory density rather than narrowing options; no second beat complicates her tactics. The final poise reweights absence as eternal labor, but the price is abstract; no concrete choice is foreclosed on the page. Sufficient for short-form textural escalation, but lacks a visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—reawaken beauty—tightens via two causal reversals: contraption screech (failure) → lullaby (success). Each attempt exacts visible price: wound gears, cracked shell, his broken voice. Escalation is accumulative: density of loss (flowers pressed, lute broken) heightens cost of final soft emergence. No coincidence; agency drives shift from assembly to memory.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—proving scars can sing—tightens once: Lena shifts from solitary listening to mentoring a witness, trading exposure for possible rejection. No external opposition or resource loss escalates the risk; pressure is purely ethical-aesthetic. Sufficient for sub-800-word lyric mode, but the cost is conceptual, not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—liberate trapped memories—signals early and escalates through each breadcrumb. Apparition forces a crystallized stance: descend or remain anchored. One meaningful tightening suffices; cost is legible as irreversible step into dark. Could use one tangible forfeiture (time, safety) to punch past 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—break the generational cycle of fire—is signaled early and tightened when Kael’s weapons flicker out; the price is Elias’s vulnerability (unarmed, drifting). One meaningful reversal: hostile ship → neutralized witness. Escalation is causal under the lens: each gear rotation increases petal response and narrows Kael’s options until fire is foreclosed. Cost is visible on-page: Kael’s ship dark, Elias’s gear still.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—discovering grief’s shape—signals early and tightens when the ribbon glows and whispers Keats, forcing Elias to stay. No external antagonist; pressure is accumulative: each return visit layers sensory evidence until the poem’s line bridges living and dead. The “smile and recitation” is the visible price—public vulnerability—but because we skip the private beat of decision, the foreclosed option (silent withdrawal) is only implied, not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“balance was sacred”—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens when the pendulum’s pause threatens communal time. The single meaningful turn (transfer of inscriptions) narrows Elias’s options from concealment to exposure and exacts a visible price (smooth handle stripped, names fused to brass). Pressure escalates under causal lens; no coincidence resolves the breach. Cost is legible but not persistently constraining after the swing resumes, keeping it just shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will Elias let the dead speak through him?—tightens when gold threads force him to confront Margaret’s unresolved love. One meaningful deepening: the scratched initials reweight his custodial role into surrogate lover. Cost is felt in the midnight rose-planting vow; pressure accumulates rather than reverses, fitting the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—jolting scholars out of complacency—is signaled early; the single deepening occurs when the ink bleeds into shifting shapes, narrowing options from abstraction to concrete city. Cost is legible: the chamber warms, ink remains wet—possibility spent. Agency is authorial rather than antagonistic, fitting the accumulative/textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—break the silence by teaching dust to speak—tightens once, when the lyric reveals dust as story-remnants and Elias begins the incantation. Agency is clear: he tunes, hums, gathers, and the dust finally forms a word. Cost is legible—the radio’s silence afterward signals a permanent shift in his tactics. A second tightening or external obstacle would have pushed higher, but the single escalation satisfies the 600-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—can Elias finish the portrait and thereby “keep” his mother—tightens when the mask vision reveals his own face, collapsing pursuit into self-recognition; this single deepening satisfies the length requirement. Pressure is textural, not causal, but remains coherent. A sharper tangible cost (cut palm, ash cloud inhalation) would have pushed higher.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the “whispered” plague narrative—remains stable. Pressure builds only intellectually: sediment rings equal lies, but no external force (scholar patrols, rival historians, sewer collapse) complicates the excavation. The one meaningful tightening is internal; options narrow only in Elias’s mind, so escalation is textual rather than dramatic. Cost is present as future social risk, not on-page forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—braiding voices by subtracting hatred—signals early and tightens through each rehearsal shard. Pressure escalates by accumulation: dissonant glares → tentative humming → unified chord, with the zither’s fragile sustain acting as physical constraint. Cost is visible when Maren’s hand finds Liora’s, trading prior contempt for vulnerable contact. No reversal reverses the trend; coincidence is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—heal city’s collective memory—tightens when the single fruit ripens and she must decide to consume or share; the bite forecloses immediate reuse, a visible price, though escalation is more lyrical deepening than rising external threat.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve wonder via restored hives—is signaled early and tightens when the core is revealed “dimmed to a sickly pulse.” The midpoint reversal (Maren seizes the matchbox) raises the cost of trespass and narrows options to one lawful act: strike the tower’s memory. Price is visible—the tower’s remaining charge is spent—yet the off-stage saboteur lessens the final pressure; confrontation stays technical rather than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single stake—will Elias silence the living house?—tightens when insertion “pauses” rather than purifies, foreclosing retreat. Cost is conceptual (he’s released a slower, heavier awareness) but not viscerally paid by Elias; pressure plateaus rather than escalates after the pause.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—recover the secret—flips when she learns the bloom is a jail, not a cure. Pressure tightens once: insert or refuse; she inserts, loosing the imprisoned shame. Cost is visible on-page: animate lifeless tendrils lash outward, foreclosing her prior goal. Agency is hers; coincidence plays no role. One tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single stake—prove limits—is signaled early and tightened once: the dice roll forecloses the “break” option and replaces it with perpetual adaptation. Pressure is coherent but brief; the shudder is the only on-page cost. Escalation is a single beat, sufficient at this length, yet the price (tilt) feels conceptual rather than visceral, keeping the score below 8.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—proving strangers remember kindness—is signaled early and deepens via each painted face; the meaningful tightening occurs when she rolls the portraits for anonymous dispersal, foreclosing personal recognition. Pressure is accumulative: every stroke intensifies the wager that empathy can survive anonymity. Cost is visible in bodily exhaustion and the relinquishing of the portraits. Agency remains steady; no external reversal, but the final act narrows options under the Accumulative lens. Sufficient for high band; lacks a sharper external complication to breach 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stake—“rescue dying arts”—is clear early; pressure tightens when last tapestry is unreadable and bees vanish. But escalation is atmospheric, not tactical: no irreversible choice or forfeiture narrows options; success arrives as gentle restoration rather than costly trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—seize authorship of time—signals early and tightens when the stone’s names vanish, foreclosing return to the original world. The single meaningful turn (yoyo ascends instead of falling) narrows options under causal pressure. Cost is legible—stone blanks, beam reverses—but the price lands more on the world than on Elias’s future tactics, capping entry to the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“am I already hollow?”—is signaled early and tightened when reflection refuses to mimic him. Single meaningful escalation: mirror-lunge → palm-press that collapses the doppelgänger; options narrow from flight to confrontation. Agency is present but cost is primarily conceptual (loss of fear’s image) rather than tangible, capping the band. Coincidence absent; resolution stems from Elias’s counter-intuitive curiosity.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—turn the sea’s chaos into music—tightens through density and cadence shift; no option is foreclosed, but the stakes ascend from solo to duet with the ocean. Cost is aesthetic exposure, felt but not materially limiting; one meaningful deepening satisfies short-form bar.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“map the cracks / find a door”—is signaled in first 120 words and escalates from cartographic curiosity to survival reflex. The midpoint reversal (expedition still “alive” but wrong) narrows her options to flee or become them; flight is a visible price. Pressure is coherent under Causal lens; however, the watchers’ threat remains abstract, muting the final tick of cost compared to bodily injury or social loss.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—whether the forged letter survives as truth or is exposed—tightens once Liora steps out; the option set narrows to three publicly visible outcomes (auction secrecy, joint revelation, or curated display). The tightening is driven by protagonist agency rather than coincidence. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable: the village’s heroic myth is preserved yet permanently asterisked. A slightly higher score is barred because the external jeopardy (legal, career) is named but never activated on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can the pavilion’s memory be kept alive—tightens with each note: first recognition, then moral obligation, finally existential surrender. Agency is accumulative/textural: inscription choices incrementally drain the inkwell, reweighting the cost of preservation. One meaningful deepening when water reaches knees and last shaky note is found; options narrow to letting go. Cost visible in empty inkwell and footprints swallowed.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—trace the stamp—signaled early. Pressure escalates only once: ledger reveals crest + name. No narrowing options or trade-off; discovery is happenstance, not agency. Cost is absent; blackout neither complicates nor prices the reveal. Single tightening satisfies short-form minimum but stays modest.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can she contain other people’s sorrow without being consumed—tightens with each lantern; the pattern break when one lantern feeds back is the single required intensification. Agency stays hers: she chooses which dreams to harvest and keeps building despite priestly signals. Cost is legible: body possession, loss of artisan control. No external antagonist needed; the pressure is the accretive weight of polished grief.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“find where unused potential pools” to weaponize grief—tightens when the ghost’s appearance proves the geode can manifest the intangible, forcing an immediate choice: flee or seize the power. The cooling-breaker clock escalates pressure mechanically and credibly. One meaningful turn suffices: she demands “Show me,” narrowing her path from stealth to confrontation. Cost is legible—burnt palm, reboot alarms, return to fire—though the ghost dissolves rather than counter-escalates, capping intensity just below the 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—“will he heed the call of belonging?”—is signaled early and tightens once when the chip pulses in sync with the unknown star. Escalation is a single smooth ramp rather than a reversal; no visible price is exacted from Elias except the abstract forfeiture of staying. Pressure is situational and coherent but never narrows his options to a painful fork.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—uncover whether Liora lives—signaled by paragraph four. Mid-story tightening occurs when the spiral carving is found, converting suspicion into certainty and forcing the uncle’s confrontation. Cost is legible: Elias forfeits the comforting lie of 3:17. Escalation is linear but sufficient for 700-word frame; no reversal, yet option set narrows decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—personal absolution versus perpetual entanglement—is signaled early via the drawer-pull. The single meaningful tightening occurs when Elias decides to keep both relics, narrowing his future to continued brokerage of old wounds; cost is the literal added weight in-pocket. Pressure is textural, not causal, but the lens allows it; no reversal is required.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—self-authorship vs. inherited map—surfaces early; escalation is a single deepening as the poles and compass swap valence. The tightening is textural, not causal, but narrows options: once the compass is dead weight, inaction becomes impossible. Cost is legible in the silent swallow of the heirloom, foreclosing retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—can empathy re-enter a wiped mind?—is signaled early and tightens when the mirrors force literal confrontation. One meaningful deepening: choosing the left tunnel because it is harder, leading directly to the memory assault. Cost is legible in the final image (“the only way out was to look”), but the beat could sharpen if an external consequence (time, Mara’s reaction, ball cracking) registered on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—can she reforge the bond without clinging to the lost human form?—is signaled in the fortune and sharpened by each pinch of spice that burns her skin. Mid-scene escalation occurs when her fingers pass through his chest: the option of full restoration is foreclosed, forcing the metamorphosis acceptance. The cost is visceral (spice burn, tears “cutting silver paths”), persistent (he remains a bird), and legible on the final image. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes—no external antagonist or ticking clock—so the tightening is emotional, not tactical, keeping it just below the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost time—tightens when the saucer crack becomes the map she physically follows; the ink’s irreversible absorption forecloses the option to remain merely observer. Cost is felt, but escalation is single-note without external opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—open the locked dimension—signaled in line 9 and tightened with each stitched photograph. Pressure escalates accumulatively: every suture thins the air and deepens shadows, a visible price that forecloses retreat. The final turn—she must become the wound—forces stance crystallization and costs her the locket and the ship itself. No reversal is needed; the deepening pattern suffices under the lyric lens.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“keep giving vs. accept destiny”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the bug darkens and the woman forecloses denial. One meaningful turn: mirror vision forces the choice to run, trading anonymity for village salvation. Cost is legible (loss of quiet rebellion, exposure as “Stormbringer”). Escalation is singular but sufficient for 700-word scope; prophecy convenience keeps it from 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—prevent the governor’s city-burning plot—tightens once: intercepted parchment forecloses Mira’s neutrality. Escalation is causal: each beat (aide’s drop, her theft, torch signal) narrows her options and raises exposure. Visible price: abandonment of her post, torch left as evidence. No coincidence resolves; the aide merely complicates. One meaningful turn suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“keep the world from unraveling”—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens once: friction vanishes → pattern must be rewoven. The painted-rock sequence is the single meaningful narrowing; each placement forecloses error and raises cosmic cost. Agency is high; coincidence complicates (eels return) but does not resolve. Price is legible (father’s promise paid with lifelong burden), yet the escalation is singular rather than layered, capping it just below the 8.8 threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—will he decipher or accept the map of scars?—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: lightning flash reveals the pattern, foreclosing the need to decode and shifting him to carrier stance. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, sufficient for this length but not multi-beat.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“first fatal question”—tightens when card converts sundial angles into a route, forcing Isolde to cede control. One visible price: her surrender of the next question. Escalation is intellectual, not visceral, but agency and cost are legible on the page under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—belonging to the word-resistance—tightens once: the click of the padlock forecloses the safety of anonymity; cost is the exposure of staying inside the ruin, but escalation is single-thread, not compounded.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—will Elias risk the safe repetition that keeps grief frozen—is signaled early and tightened once: the horizon rule postpones the encore, compressing choice into a single twilight beat. Agency drives escalation; the discordant piece is his decision, not luck, and it visibly forecloses the sanctuary of silence when the ocean answers.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—protect cultural memory—is signaled in paragraph two and escalates as the monsoon clock shrinks options. The dream tightens pressure by revealing the storm’s sentient bargain, forcing Liora’s agency: plant or lose everything. One clear reversal: seed planted → pages accuse → options narrow; she can no longer remain silent. Cost is legible: the vine’s grip and the knowledge that future storms will demand new stories.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—diffuse the weight of severance—signals early and tightens once: the lace path forces him to re-touch each memory knot, deepening rather than reversing options. No external antagonist or reversal; pressure is accumulative-textural, not causal escalation. Cost is conceptual (he gives up the fantasy of erasure) but not viscerally felt on the page; hence stays below 8.0.


== Grader: Qwen 3 Max ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—stripping “needless drama” to see “what remained”—tightens when flood damage forces Elara to reinterpret decay as data. Her agency lies in sustained attention: sketching patterns despite rain’s return forecloses escape. Cost is visible in latex gloves sticking to fingers, warped notebook, bent metal ribs—tangible losses that alter tactics from experimentation to documentation. Pressure accumulates texturally, not causally, per the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—uncovering why her studio was burned—is signaled early and deepens when Jaren reveals the canyon-wide arson plot. Escalation is driven by Liora’s agency: her retracing and pattern-reading force the confrontation. Cost is unmistakable: innocence lost, safety forfeited. Under Accumulative lens, pressure tightens via converging data (frost + ledger), not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—rectifying silence—is signaled early and deepens when Elias shifts from passive tracing of books to active experimentation with the fork and machine. The meaningful tightening occurs at the climax: choosing to strike the glass, risking nothingness or revelation. Cost is felt in his breath hitching, trembling fingers—proof this act matters. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens; no false resolutions or coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—giving rest a permanent address—is signaled by the lens’s distress hum and deepened when the logbook reveals centuries of failed keepers. The undertaker’s agency drives escalation: his stubborn walk to shore, wading deeper despite cold, choosing to read aloud. Cost is legible in his “heavy legs” and the irreversible commitment implied by entering the library again. Coincidence (the package’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems solely from his choice to revitalize through ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—intergenerational survival under siege—is signaled early and tightens through escalating sanctions and patrols. Liora’s agency drives escalation: her shift from desperate deliveries to deliberate midnight runs alters tactics and deepens communal bonds. Cost is felt (danger, exhaustion, fear) but not always visible in concrete loss; the second bell’s note (“Ring it when they forget”) implies future stakes rather than immediate sacrifice. Coincidence (anonymous gifts) complicates but doesn’t resolve—pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—where unused love goes—is signaled early and deepens when the grieving father appears, forcing Lien to act. The meaningful tightening occurs in her decision to give away the tear, which forecloses hoarding compassion. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens: breath alters reality, leading to the charged final exchange. Cost is felt in her surrender and the father’s transformed posture.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—recovering stolen time—is signaled early via fading photos and deepens when the halo reveals the daughter’s pre-birth erasure. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to reverse the photo, enter the willow, and sacrifice the fragment. The tightening forecloses her prior existence (“older now, but not in the way of years”) with visible cost. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens—each layer of memory intensifies the moral calculus until action becomes inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—securing seeds before scavengers or regime collapse—is signaled early and tightens via the arrow’s warning and wall’s fall. Mira’s agency crystallizes in her understanding of the keys’ melody, enabling escape. The scavenger confrontation tests commitment without resorting to violence, and the final choice to plant—not hoard—carries moral weight. Cost is unmistakable: they lock themselves out of the vault forever to spread its contents.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—capturing the sound of trust breaking—is signaled early and deepens when Elias recalls his wife’s lie. Protagonist agency drives escalation: he chooses to return, to feed foil, to remember. The tightening forecloses hope of full resolution (“It wasn’t the answer… But it was something”), with cost felt in his terminal timeline and emotional resignation. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—whether to keep stealing moments or co-create them—is signaled early and tightens when Kael reframes illumination as reinterpretation. The meaningful deepening occurs when Lira realizes “destiny wasn’t something you eavesdropped on.” Cost is legible: she abandons her thief identity and the train’s escape route. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (choosing dialogue, then staying), not coincidence, under an Accumulative lens where density reweights meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—crafting safe zones for inquiry—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when Elias realizes the control room itself is such a zone. The deepening occurs during calibration: “Too much pressure, and the whole thing collapses. Too little, and it never takes shape”—a direct parallel to his emotional state. Cost is felt in the renunciation of perfectionism and the acceptance of fragility. Agency is internal but active; however, escalation leans slightly more on reflection than external pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—identity truth—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the cast’s notes reveal “They’re coming.” Mira’s agency drives escalation: she doesn’t flee but presses the shell into the caretaker’s palm, forcing confrontation. The cost is felt in the caretaker’s paralysis and Mira’s forfeited illusion of solitary strength. Under the Causal lens, each turn narrows options: the box’s discovery eliminates denial, making reconciliation the only viable path forward.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—giving shape to silence—is signaled early and tightens when the oracle realizes the booklet is a map, not a text. Her agency drives escalation: kneeling, climbing, tracing, speaking-through-silence. The cost (physical dissolution of the artifact, emotional surrender of interpretive control) is unmistakable in the dust on her palms and lightened body. One meaningful deepening suffices; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without false resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“Where do thoughts come from?”—is signaled early and deepens via looped timelines, narrowing options from cleaning to existential pursuit. Agency drives escalation: E-7X chooses interaction despite risk, each loop adding sensory data. Cost is conceptual (endless cycling) and physical (glitches implied), culminating in earned poise. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the violin is a test, not a gift.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—trust in intimacy—is signaled early (“silence felt heavier”) and deepens when Elias reveals his eavesdropping. The tightening occurs when Mira calls him out (“You’re lying”), forcing a trade-off: secrecy vs. vulnerability. Cost is felt (“needed to know who I could trust”) and crystallizes in the final stance. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (Mira’s confrontation, Elias’s confession), though the pressure peak leans slightly more on revelation than active choice.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the garden judges and forgives him—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s agency: he places marbles as questions, and the garden answers with altered paths and blooms. The escalation culminates in the seedling, which demands renunciation of control. Cost is unmistakable: forty years of labor reduced to tending a single fragile shoot, with no guarantee of return—yet he chooses understanding over dominance.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—proving lateral time—is signaled early and tightens when Elara overrides AI protocols, narrowing options irreversibly. Escalation is driven by her agency: syncing holograms to xeno hum triggers the lever’s appearance. Cost is unmistakable: the station destabilizes, alarms blare, and she gains unbearable knowledge. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via sensory and textual density rather than causal reversals, which fits the design.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to the lost symphony—is signaled early via the program’s instruction and deepens when Lena recognizes the notes. The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses to play, transforming passive investigation into active disruption. Cost is felt: solitude in the dark, the spent program, and the irreversible awakening of ghosts. Agency drives escalation; coincidence (the found program) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the violin must be played by her hand.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—relieving the weight of a swallowed truth—is signaled early and deepens when the illustration appears. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he researches, descends, unearths the box. The tightening occurs when he realizes the flower grows where something was buried, narrowing his focus to excavation. Cost is felt in the photograph’s ambiguity and the note’s moral complexity—no easy absolution, only shared error.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—confronting the truth behind the ghost shift—is signaled early and tightens when Elias recognizes the figure isn’t a ghost but a remnant of labor. His agency drives escalation: he chooses to follow, watch, and finally offer the wheel. Cost is unmistakable: his worldview collapses, replaced by silent acknowledgment. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the deepening isn’t causal but textural—the clanking intensifies, then ceases—and the price (loss of certainty) charges the final image without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving regenerative silence through non-interference—is signaled early and deepens when the mutable book appears. The tightening occurs in her decision to surrender it, narrowing her path from observer to deliberate releaser. Agency is clear: she carries the book to the refuge and places it deliberately. Cost is felt in the dissolution of potential knowledge, reweighted by her acceptance that some stories must flow away. Coincidence never resolves; pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—resolving the mystery of the curl—tightens meaningfully when Liora appears, forcing Elias to choose between passive wonder and active kinship. The eclipse event escalates pressure by imposing a deadline, and his decision to play music publicly reconfigures his role in the town. Cost is felt as the quiet surrender of solitude, though not dramatized through tangible sacrifice beyond emotional risk.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—deciphering what the walls remember—is signaled early and deepens when diaries reveal dragons in stone and a slipping axis. Pressure escalates texturally: from passive observation to probing half-burned pages to the final reach that risks unraveling reality. The cost is conceptual but legible: accepting that stories aren’t behind but ahead demands surrendering linear history. One tightening suffices, though agency leans interpretive rather than decisive until the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—uncovering what his father left behind—is signaled early and tightens when the woman arrives demanding “the originals,” raising personal risk. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he decodes the clue, retrieves the microdot, and chooses engagement over retreat. The cost is conceptual (inheriting a dangerous legacy) and felt (“stomach dropped,” “hands shook”). Coincidence complicates (the boat’s arrival) but doesn’t resolve; the climax hinges on Elias’s stance.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—whether to resist or understand possession—is signaled early and deepens when Elias questions if stillness is a mirror. The tightening occurs when he adds his heartbeat, accepting vulnerability as necessary for revelation. Cost is felt in the irreversible staining and the anchor’s tremor, though the escalation leans slightly more on texture than causal narrowing of options. Still, under an Accumulative lens, the cadence shift from fear to invitation reweights the entire premise with undeniable emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming agency over time—is signaled early (“chronologically homesick”) and tightens when memory-mapping becomes rebellion against the mirrored horizon. Escalation occurs via protagonist-driven deepening: each recalled memory raises emotional stakes until the school-play memory crystallizes her choice to “conduct” silence. Cost is felt (squandered possibilities, numbness) but could be more viscerally tied to a present forfeiture. Coincidence (fortune cookie) complicates but doesn’t resolve—pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—conquering the self—is signaled early and deepens when the scarred self reveals conquest is impossible; only selection remains. Elias’s agency drives escalation: touching runes, pressing palm, stepping into the maze, then choosing non-violence. The cost—losing all other selves, accepting incompleteness—is felt in the silence of rain. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens via sensory and temporal thickening.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—converting numbness into playable feeling—is signaled early and deepens when Mira realizes silence isn’t absence but “the space between beats.” The escalation is protagonist-driven: Mira’s shift from frustration (“hands twitching”) to stillness (“breath shaky”) constitutes agency via attention, foreclosing her noise-filling habit with felt cost (vulnerability to inner ache). However, the “backward recorded songs” concept remains speculative, slightly diluting pressure; the true tightening comes from drum-making, not phonograph mechanics. Still, the single deepening suffices for this length under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—truth versus safety—is signaled early and tightens when Elias hears the hidden mechanical rhythm, narrowing his options from observation to engagement. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: his choice to listen laterally leads to discovery. The cost (abandoning solitude) is felt in the final beat. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length, and it’s executed with atmospheric precision under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding why smell unravels him—is signaled early and deepens when the vial becomes a key to boarded-shut doors. Pressure tightens through protagonist agency: he chooses to enter, uncork, kneel, speak, and finally stand. The woman’s presence complicates but doesn’t resolve; Elias’s realization is self-earned. Cost is visible in his tear and the irreversible opening of grief—but escalation leans slightly more on atmosphere than decisive tactical narrowing under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—discovering time’s texture—is signaled early and intensifies into an impossible choice: pull and unravel, or walk away from truth. The tightening occurs when the rope transforms from relic to key, forcing Lirien to confront what she’ll risk. Cost is legible: stars blink out, the rope goes limp, and she alone carries its whispers—a Charged Poise where knowledge isolates. Escalation stems from her agency (tying, listening, pulling), not coincidence, though the energy beings’ backstory slightly softens the pressure source.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—coaxing song from silence—is signaled early and deepens when the hum answers, transforming passive listening into dialogue. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: Liora chooses to play louder, then to improvise, each act narrowing her focus to communion with the drowned. Cost is conceptual (she bears witness alone) and tactile (her feet vibrate with the earth’s bones), but lacks a visible forfeiture or irreversible loss. Still, under an Accumulative lens, the cadence shift—from scale to lullaby to improvisation—reweights the stake sufficiently for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—authentic vs. counterfeit emotion—is signaled early and tightens through the petal’s application, which forces Darian to accept a curated grief and Liora to perform empathy she cannot afford. The meaningful deepening occurs when Liora imagines believing her own wares—a live option foreclosed by her professional rigor. Cost is felt in her isolation and the petal’s spent magic, though escalation leans more on atmosphere than causal agency.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—acknowledging invisible labor—is signaled early and deepens when the locket personalizes abstraction. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to trespass, then act. Mara crystallizes stance by converting gratitude into structural care (“fund for dockworkers’ families”). Cost is felt: her emotional tremor, his redirected evening. Coincidence (misdelivery) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from character choices under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—belonging versus isolation—is signaled early and tightens when Liora joins the search, narrowing her options from solitary ritual to communal risk. The escalation is driven by her agency: she initiates contact, then dedicates her sculpture. Cost is felt in the loss of her creation and the vulnerability of exposure. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through intensifying imagery (webs thickening, light pulsing) rather than causal turns, which is appropriate and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—borrowing time from the Giant’s Nap to reach the echo-source—is signaled early and tightens at the spiral fork: upward = safety, downward = risk. Liora’s agency drives escalation; she chooses the darker path, endures physical cost (burning pendant), and acts decisively at the hourglass. The whispered warning (“You’re late… before the Giant wakes”) raises urgency, though the “Giant” remains abstract. Cost is felt (pendant sears, chamber groans) but not fully consequentialized beyond atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—resolving ambiguous loss—is signaled early and deepens when Elias shifts from seeking answers to accepting presence. The tightening occurs at the mosaic stones: his decision to place the eyes there forecloses investigative searching and commits to intuitive communion. Cost is felt in the warmth spreading through his ribs—a bittersweet fusion of pain and beauty—and crystallized in the eyes’ color shift. Though no antagonist exists, internal pressure (grief vs. hope) escalates coherently under the Accumulative lens, with agency fully in Elias’s hands.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—uncovering Voss’s truth to justify his own invisibility—is signaled early and deepens when the tape fragment implies she was hiding, not lost. The power outage raises urgency, and Mara’s entrance forces a live trade-off: reveal or remain ghost. Though escalation is clear, the tightening hinges on external coincidence (Mara’s timing) rather than Elias’s agency alone.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether to control or surrender to organic transformation—is signaled early and tightens when the sapling actively reaches for Mara, forcing her choice. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her decision to release tension directly triggers the sapling’s stilled branches and silver sheen. Cost is felt (abandoning her life’s methodology) but not deeply explored beyond posture; the “price” remains conceptual rather than tangible (e.g., lost research, reputation). Still, pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—threshing meaning from traumatic memory—is signaled early and tightens when the brooch appears in his pocket. The painter’s agency drives escalation: he follows rain trails, enters the cave, chooses to touch the amber. Cost is legible in his hollowed body, undried canvases, and now the irreversible step into the tide with a stranger.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding magic’s true nature—is signaled early and deepens when the pilgrim magnifies it “everywhere.” The tightening occurs at the pearl: Elias’s passivity becomes catastrophic when he fails to intervene. Cost is unmistakable—the pilgrim’s consumption, the cave’s mourning—but Elias’s agency remains limited; he witnesses rather than chooses, slightly muting escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—recovering erased truth—is signaled early and deepens when the valves reveal a map. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: Liora seeks, interprets, and unites the valves. The tightening occurs in the alley and watchtower, narrowing options to a single path. Cost is felt in secrecy, risk, and the emotional weight of confronting systemic erasure, though physical danger remains muted.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—accessing the fortress of unspoken truths—is signaled early and deepens when the punch warms and the cover lifts. Pressure escalates texturally: arrows → courtyard → humming metal → jars → voice. Elias’s agency drives each turn; coincidence (the mailed punch) complicates but doesn’t resolve. Cost is felt in his irreversible step downward, though not yet paid—sufficient for Charged Poise under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—whether to listen to the past—is signaled early and deepens when whale songs trigger hesitation. Pressure escalates through accumulation: memories flood in, demanding response, culminating in the costly choice to transcribe. This act narrows options: he can no longer dismiss the tower’s power. Cost is legible—not physical loss, but the irreversible surrender of his skeptical armor, charged by the whales’ crescendo.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—answering the afterlife of goodbye—is signaled by line 3 and deepens when Kael reveals shared motive, forcing Veyra to choose between reckless pursuit or protective renunciation. Escalation is causal: storm weakens barriers → Kael appears → demands fragment → reveals need for catalyst → lunges → Veyra reacts. The meaningful tightening occurs when Veyra slams her palm on the amulet, sacrificing potential knowledge to banish Kael. Cost is legible: solitude confirmed, but fear dissolved—a trade-off earned through agency.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether to use the ink pot to challenge systemic cruelty—is signaled early and tightens when the woman arrives. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his “Prove it” forces a trade-off between trust and control. Cost is visible (her bruises, his exposure) and conceptual (rewriting ledgers = rewriting power). However, the system being opposed remains abstract; the “three countries away” cell lacks on-page tactical consequence, slightly blurring the pressure’s edge.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—capturing time’s echoes—is signaled early and deepens when the found note refracts his mission from recording to receiving. The tightening occurs when he shifts from observer to participant by writing the vanished stationer’s story, narrowing his path to communal continuity. Cost is felt in his surrender of authorial control: stories are “no longer just his own.” Agency drives escalation; coincidence (the note) complicates but doesn’t resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—recovering mislaid identity through erased histories—is signaled early and deepens when Elias meets the woman who shares his quest, raising emotional stakes. His agency drives escalation: he chooses not to correct the clerk, collects fragments, and ultimately stays as the tide rises. Cost is legible: he relinquishes the hope of recovering a singular truth. Under the Accumulative lens, this single meaningful deepening suffices, though the woman’s role borders on coincidental without clearer tactical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—decoding the universal riddle before history’s echoes fade—is signaled early and tightens through Elias’s agency: each note he plays deepens his understanding and narrows his path from debunker to listener. The “whisper of closing pages” acts as a live clock, raising urgency without melodrama. Cost is unmistakable: he forfeits his identity as a myth buster, embracing uncertainty. Escalation is driven entirely by his choices under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving Carnivale’s autonomy—tightens via Lan’s escalating sabotage (blocking paths, spicing food), each act narrowing investor access with plausible cost (social risk, time). The privatization vote creates a live clock, and the warning graffiti (“They’re coming for the heart”) deepens stakes by personalizing threat to Old Man Vey. Agency remains Lan’s throughout; coincidence complicates (investors circling) but never resolves. Final stance crystallization carries conceptual cost: enduring duality without immediate victory.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving the last untouched crater—is signaled early and tightens when Elias realizes his work matters only as “beauty as a kind of proof.” The meaningful deepening occurs at the climax: he understands the geologist’s gift wasn’t about purpose, but acceptance of impermanence. Cost is legible: he foregoes protest, endures erasure, and leaves only a photograph. Agency is quiet but decisive—attention as resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—decoding erratic feedback before the ship departs—is signaled by Mara’s first line and tightens immediately: the anchor lifts *now*, making time scarce. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he doesn’t wait for help but uses his unique method (water refraction) to validate the drone’s final calibration. The cost is felt—three months of solitary repair, the risk of misreading—but the deepening hinges on his interpretation, not external luck. Coincidence (storm damage) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution comes from his persistent, tactile listening.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding the convergence where maps collapse—is signaled early and deepens when the condensation reveals itself as a temporal map. Pressure tightens via protagonist agency: Mira interprets clues (falcon, phrasebook, window), culminating in her decisive request. Cost is felt in the keeper’s reluctance and the falcon’s ominous circling—choices foreclose safe retreat. Coincidence (falcon’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Mira earns her stance through observation and synthesis.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—rebalancing Hollow’s End through resonance—is signaled early and tightens via the tuner’s calibrated pacing and risk of shattering ghosts. Agency is expressed through attention and endurance, not force; cost is felt in his solitude and the fragility of success. Escalation follows Accumulative logic: sound layers deepen until light emerges. No false resolution—balance is delicate, not permanent.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—answer the signal before oxygen runs out—is signaled early and deepens into thematic conflict: can ephemeral memory be harnessed or only offered? Pressure escalates via oxygen gauge, temple’s memory-drain, and the dying diver’s warning. Lira’s agency drives the turn: she chooses instinct over force, paying the cost of surrendering her last tether to home. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the solution arises from established rules and character choice.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—breaking generational silence—is signaled early and tightens when Elias sees his father’s scratched-out name, forcing confrontation. His choice to speak (not scream) is a deepening that narrows options: he trades safety for truth, triggering the hush’s recoil. The cost is felt—the lattice shatters, the labyrinth pursues him—but the escalation stems from his agency, not coincidence. One tightening suffices at this length, and it’s decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—repaying a karmic debt—is signaled early and tightens when the bead pulses, forcing Liora to confront her violent past. The deepening (“hands stained with something dark”) raises cost: memory itself becomes the price. Agency is clear—Liora chooses remembrance over escape—but the ghost bride’s passivity slightly softens opposition; she enables rather than pressures. Still, the “lovingly venomous” wound crystallizes stakes with moral complexity: love and betrayal fused inseparably.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming ruin into reverence—is signaled early and deepens when the needle whispers “You’ve been sewing the wrong things,” forcing tactical shift from walking to weaving. Pressure escalates via the overlapping footprints, which narrow options until only the loom remains. Agency is maintained: Liora chooses to sit and sew, accepting integration as cost. The unseen walker complicates but doesn’t resolve; the climax stems from Liora’s decision to reimagine, not repair.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—faith as living continuity, not dogma—is signaled early and tightens when the shrine fresco mirrors his relic, raising emotional stakes. Protagonist agency drives escalation: he chooses to dig, follow roots, place the relic. Cost is felt physically (blistered hands, aching back) and socially (elders’ scorn), culminating in the quiet cost of lifelong solitude now lifted. One tightening suffices, but the piece offers layered pressure without overreach.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—discovering who left the coded message—is signaled early and deepens into the existential question of selfhood. Pressure escalates causally: empty PO box → cryptic letter → sidewalk code → decoded instruction → maternal confrontation. The tightening occurs when Elias transcribes the numbers onto the floor, committing to vulnerability. Cost is felt: his professional detachment shatters as he stands exposed in the golden light, no longer just a creator of names but a son seeking his own.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—exposing a celestial conspiracy before a coup—is signaled early and tightens via the discovered date, forcing Liora’s shift from observer to actor. Escalation is driven by her agency: tracing discrepancies, recognizing synchronization, choosing dissemination. Cost is felt in her vulnerability (disguise, isolation) and the city’s palpable tension. Though the coup’s mechanics remain off-page, the personal price of speaking truth in silence is credibly dramatized. Coincidence never resolves; revelation arises from sustained attention.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—confronting unsent regret—is signaled early and tightens when condensation spells “too late” and the apparition appears. Protagonist agency drives escalation: Liora chooses to speak aloud despite fear, altering the spiritual stakes. Cost is visible in the shard’s growing weight and the sister’s sad wisdom (“You still don’t”). One meaningful deepening suffices for this length, though the spirits’ shift from judgment to relief slightly softens tension at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming trauma into connection—is signaled early and deepens when Lena sees the boy’s identical cast. The tightening occurs when she deciphers coordinates beneath her own notes, raising narrative tension, but the true escalation is emotional: choosing to reveal the coral despite risk. Agency is clear—she initiates the alignment—and cost is felt in her physical vulnerability (“ignoring the protest of her healing bone”). Coincidence (boy having coral) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from her active choice to press casts together.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recovering joy before it’s lost forever—is signaled by the fresco’s child reaching for an apple. Pressure escalates when Liora’s film development reveals not just the artifact but the *moment before loss*, deepening her goal from preservation to resurrection. Agency is clear: her exposure adjustments and decision to display the print narrow options (she can’t unsee the recovered joy). Cost is felt: years of carrying absence now replaced by fragile, earned hope.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—certainty vs. mystery—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the nickel’s reflection reveals Gabriel’s grin, foreclosing restoration-as-usual. Escalation is driven by Elias’s agency: his touch on the nickel triggers the garden’s chorus, which bewitches the stone. Cost is legible in the cracking glass and groaning scaffold—a physical manifestation of his worldview fracturing. Coincidence (street performer’s toss) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the climax hinges on Elias’s choice to press the nickel to the glass.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving covert communication under thought-taxation—tightens when the inspector enters, forcing immediate concealment. The meaningful deepening occurs when Quill reveals the citywide garden network, escalating from personal risk to collective action. Cost is legible: Elias abandons his “invisible” entomologist persona, accepting surveillance peril. Escalation stems from protagonist agency (Elias choosing to join), not luck, under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming grief into art—is signaled early and tightens when projections reflect only Elias’s face, forcing him to choose between self-absorption and creation. The deepening occurs when the shell “leans in” and the breeze carries half-recognized melody, narrowing options to write or remain paralyzed. Agency is clear: his spiral writing directly alters the postcard’s state (singed edges soften) and releases lullabies into the world. Cost is felt in 73 sleepless nights and the vulnerability of “true” words, though the resolution leans slightly toward wish-fulfillment without material consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—saving forgotten names from oblivion—is signaled early and tightened when the bamboo tube resists replication, raising emotional cost. The escalation is protagonist-driven: Liora’s choice to blow into the tube (not magic or coincidence) yields the pivotal note. While pressure accumulates texturally rather than causally, the deepening—from collecting names to realizing she grants them life—narrows her emotional isolation into purpose. Cost is felt in the “dull ache” of extinct feelings and her softened regret, though the stakes remain internal without external opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—restoring truth through language—is signaled early and deepens when Elara learns the Velyrians chose silence due to their language’s dangerous power. Pressure escalates causally: deciphering → speaking → invoking → shattering, each step narrowing escape. The cost is unmistakable: the ink well’s destruction, the archive’s violent awakening, and the burden of being the first listener in centuries. Agency drives every turn; coincidence never resolves—only complicates (e.g., words rearranging themselves).

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—harmonizing protection and preservation—is signaled early and tightens when the envelope reveals the surveyors’ wisdom, forcing Mira to reinterpret her floodgates. The deepening isn’t causal but accumulative: each sensory cue (warm chain, strained breath) heightens tension until the textual discovery shifts her stance. Cost is felt in her relinquished narrative of control, though not dramatized as tangible loss (e.g., broken gear, flooded field). Coincidence (finding the envelope) complicates but doesn’t resolve; agency lies in her choice to heed it.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recovering the Lament’s echo—is signaled early and deepens when Lena produces the lyric sheet, forcing Elias to choose between escape and engagement. Pressure tightens coherently: isolation → discovery → invitation → decision. The cost is felt (his tremor, the weight of past failure) though not yet fully paid; staying risks reopening wounds. Luck (winning the meteorite, finding the ledger) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the real turn comes from Lena’s deliberate act and Elias’s choice, satisfying agency under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding why Mira left—is signaled early via the logbook code and deepened through Elias’s futile analysis. The meaningful tightening occurs when he realizes intuition fails where “necessary distances” exist; this forecloses his investigative path. Cost is unmistakable: the logbook’s weight becomes proof of loss, not a tool for recovery. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates through density (prisms, grain, weather codes) rather than external obstacles, culminating in a stance crystallization that accepts absence as truth.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—belonging versus isolation—is signaled early and deepens via the feather’s transformation. The “until sunrise” deadline forces meaningful trade-offs: Elias must choose between staying (belonging) or leaving (survival). Agency is maintained throughout; no coincidental resolutions. Cost is felt in his final glance back—a quiet but legible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—“why do some paths disappear?”—tightens when the glass shifts to “unsettling red,” forcing Liora to confront a raw, unfamiliar emotion. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses to enter the tunnel despite dread, then renounces pursuit upon seeing the seed. Cost is felt in her “aching heart” and the glass’s “flickering” light—a visceral trade-off between knowledge and peace. Coincidence (bird’s seeds) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the seed’s presence deepens thematic stakes without solving her core dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—escaping performative monotony—is signaled early and deepens when Lira trades solitary fire-eating for collaborative improvisation. The tightening occurs when she tosses the bishop: a renunciation that narrows options (no more relying on found objects) and forces invention. Cost is felt in the hollow applause she abandons and the vulnerability of dancing unscripted. Coincidence (violinist’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve—Lira initiates the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving memory against erasure—is signaled early and tightened when the stranger requests the forbidden sea-ink. Liora’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to use contraband materials (tears, pearl, moonstone dust), knowingly doubling their criminality. Cost is unmistakable: “skinned alive… tattoos nailed to city gates” establishes mortal stakes, and their final vow (“exiles together”) crystallizes relational and existential forfeiture. One deduction: the ban’s mechanics remain slightly abstract, though sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—perceiving hidden patterns in the mundane—intensifies coherently from dream to dock to atrium. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to enter, to throw the stone, to interpret. The tightening occurs when the second stone reveals “unmistakable” patterns, narrowing ambiguity into obligation. Cost remains conceptual (a lifetime of blindness) rather than visceral, slightly muting the pressure peak, but the old woman’s urgency and the “reckoning” frame sustain credible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—recovering stolen voice/innocence—is signaled early and deepens when the stranger reveals their scar. Elias’s agency lies not in action but in attention: by offering the notebook, he forgoes detachment for witness, foreclosing his own isolation at emotional cost. The escalation is quiet but decisive under the Accumulative lens; however, the “bargain” remains conceptually vague, slightly softening the price’s immediacy despite its thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—validating hope as a cosmic pattern—is signaled early and deepens when the gauge’s needle moves “with something deeper.” Elara’s agency drives escalation: arranging shells as “trial balloons” is a meaningful tightening that forecloses passive observation. Cost is legible (“fading hope” revitalized at emotional expense), though the parallel-timeline pressure remains abstract rather than viscerally threatening. Coincidence (gauge washing ashore) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the turn stems from her interpretive choice.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—unraveling the walls’ secret before being consumed—tightens decisively when Elias chooses to enter the door despite fear. Agency is maintained through diary use and tactile investigation; coincidence (finding the negative) complicates but doesn’t resolve. The cost—bearing legacy’s weight—is felt in his shaking hands and breath hitching. Escalation follows Accumulative logic: each sensory detail increases pressure until the woman’s arrival crystallizes stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—coaxing the unseen into being through memory and art—is signaled early and deepens when the mirage pulses with a “borrowed heartbeat,” raising emotional stakes from observation to communion. The tightening occurs at the bells’ chime: time runs out, forcing Liora to paint faster, transforming passive witnessing into active invocation. The cost is felt in her solitude (“the last who remembered”) and the watchman’s exclusion—he hears bells; she hears what comes before. Though pressure remains internal, it’s coherent under an Accumulative lens, where density itself escalates consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether peace can be anchored in practice—is signaled early and deepens when Kessar questions Liora’s postwar purpose. The meaningful tightening occurs when he offers the coin, forcing her to choose between cynical detachment and shared burden. Cost is felt in her exhaustion and the treaty’s singed edges, though escalation relies slightly more on dialogue than protagonist-driven action. Still, the trade-off (carrying hope vs. walking away) is viscerally rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving the echo—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes containment kills what it seeks to save. The tightening occurs in his climactic choice: opening the dams forecloses his control-fueled legacy, trading permanence for possibility. Cost is unmistakable: he abandons the artifact he risked reputation to obtain, accepting obscurity so the echo may live in wetlands, not salt. Escalation is driven entirely by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens—each sensory beat intensifies the moral weight until release becomes necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—defying conformity through reclaiming voice—is signaled early and deepens via the three threads, each narrowing emotional options. Agency is clear: Liora chooses understanding over force. Cost is felt (years of silence, unspoken truths), but escalation leans textual rather than causal; the tightening is thematic, not tactical. Still, the black thread’s unraveling delivers a credible, earned intensification under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—ethical responsibility in storytelling—is signaled early and deepened through Liora’s confrontation with her brother’s dismissal. The tightening occurs not through external opposition but internal crystallization: choosing the dome over port-town bars marks a shift from provocation to introspection. Cost is conceptual (fractured kinship) and tactical (abandoning audience feedback for solitary reckoning). While pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, the escalation lacks a concrete on-page trade-off; the brother’s critique remains abstract, reducing visceral stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—honoring what’s overlooked amid irreversible loss—is signaled early and deepens when monarchs arrive against all odds. Escalation is driven by Liora’s agency: building two distinct signals, each more fragile than the last. The meaningful tightening occurs when she witnesses their arrival, forcing her to confront hope versus acceptance. Cost is unmistakable: she gains proof of persistence but loses any illusion of permanence; the final image conveys opportunity cost (“they would not return”).

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving forgotten names—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s renunciation of passive grief for active ritual. The meaningful tightening occurs when he chooses to weave the card’s pattern into the rope, accepting that sound must be encoded, not replayed. Cost is palpable: he gains no audience, no resurrection, only the burden of being the sole keeper—but this very limitation crystallizes his stance. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with each sensory beat intensifying the weight of remembrance.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding the path’s agency—is signaled early and deepens when the dream figure reframes the quest (“the path seeks you back”). Pressure escalates texturally: the approaching storm tightens time, the dissolving seal raises conceptual stakes, and the hidden door presents a final threshold. Elias’s agency is clear—he chooses to follow, to ask, to touch—and the cost is implicit in the storm’s fury and the burden of the key. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; insight arises from his method (dreams) and persistence.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving knowledge across regime collapse—is signaled early and deepens when the tile dissolves, revealing its true purpose. Pressure escalates via proximity (mercenaries approaching) and conceptual shift (divination → preservation), narrowing options until only symbolic endurance remains. The tightening is meaningful: Nabu-sharru abandons decoding stars for seeding the future. Cost is felt in his isolation and the loss of the tile, though the mercenaries’ arrival slightly softens physical peril—still, the conceptual price (sacrificing empirical proof for faith in legacy) is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—releasing inherited resentment—is signaled early and deepens when Veyra appears. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses confrontation, offers the pin, and models release. Cost is legible: her lifelong scheming collapses into pity, and Veyra confronts buried guilt. However, the sanctuary’s magic slightly undercuts tension—objects reappear whole, reality bends conveniently—making the emotional stakes feel partially scaffolded by world mechanics rather than purely human friction.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—connection across boundaries—is signaled early and deepens when the dream’s loneliness mirrors the maker’s. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he chooses to climb, to breathe in sync, to hold rather than seize. Cost is felt in his lifelong solitude and the risk of dissolution (“boundary between skin and air dissolve”). Under an Accumulative lens, pressure tightens via sensory density, not plot turns, yet remains coherent and consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving generational wisdom against entropy—is signaled early (“bridge generational wisdom”) and deepens when the girl’s broken pendant mirrors Liora’s ribbon. Pressure tightens organically: the fracture isn’t just physical but temporal (“vows turned deciduous”), and Liora’s method (silver wire, resin) embodies persistence over restoration. Cost is felt in shared silence and deferred answers (“It’ll remind you that you already are”). No coincidence resolves tension; agency lies entirely in small, resonant acts of attention.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the shell’s purpose—is signaled early and tightens when the bath epiphany reframes it as a vessel for nonlinear inheritance. The deepening (“emptiness was the point”) narrows options: she can no longer catalog passively but must *live* the knowledge. Cost is felt in the predecessor’s silence and the curator’s surrender to ambiguity. Escalation stems from protagonist agency (her inquiry), not coincidence, under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—finding the sister—is signaled early and deepens when Elara leverages the time traveler’s need to pursue her own goal. The renegotiation beat meaningfully tightens pressure: cooperation becomes conditional, raising emotional and tactical stakes. Cost is felt in the time traveler’s crumbling map (lost autonomy) and Elara’s vulnerability in revealing her sister’s drawing. Escalation stems from protagonist agency under a Causal lens, though the sister’s resolution leans slightly on revelation over earned confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—recapturing truth, not just Liora—is signaled early and deepens when Elias corrects “to recapture me” with “to understand.” The tightening occurs at the Two of Cups card and the ledger, narrowing his goal from retrieval to comprehension. Cost is unmistakable: he forfeits tangible reunion for ambiguous solace. Agency drives escalation; coincidence never resolves. Only slight deduction for the chimera twins’ mechanics remaining abstract rather than dramatized through choice.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—confronting historical erasure—is signaled early via the impossible door and deepened when the rope reveals obliteration, not exile. Liora’s agency drives escalation: her reconfiguration of braids forces the past to manifest, narrowing options to complicity or truth. Cost is unmistakable: she inherits the Vaelis burden, trading archival neutrality for dangerous witness. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; coincidence (the door’s appearance) complicates but doesn’t resolve—Liora’s hands do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving silence against invasive noise—is signaled early and tightens when the bloom’s fragility forces Ryn to choose between observation and action. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she weaves light, touches the bloom, binds it to the stone. Cost is visible: the bloom collapses, the caves destabilize further, and she flees under renewed threat. One tightening suffices, though a second deepening (e.g., physical toll) would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—validating meaning in a dead world—tightens decisively when the prism reveals the beacon’s pulse, transforming passive watching into active pursuit. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: tracking stars, testing the prism, climbing the tower. Coincidence (prism’s discovery, grandmother’s death night) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Elias’s choice to walk creates irreversible cost (abandonment). The deepening—“the last beacon-tower wasn’t dead”—narrows all future options to one path.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—salvaging a self before it dissolves into false nostalgia—is signaled early and deepens through each monument encounter. The tightening occurs at the third stone: its lack of shadow forces Elara to confront the observatory as echo-chamber, not archive. Her agency drives this revelation (“What if the fog didn’t solidify on its own?”), and the cost—abandoning elder-sanctioned methods for solitary backward-walking—is palpable in the closing lines. Coincidence never resolves; pressure accrues texturally.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—bringing light where none is left—is signaled early and deepens into remembering the forgotten. The meaningful tightening occurs when Liora realizes the fortress doesn’t need defiance but witness; this crystallizes her stance and forecloses escape. Agency drives escalation: her chant, her match-strike, her release of the rag all narrow options toward irrevocable remembrance. Cost is felt in the warmth of the dais and the weight of hundreds of silent gazes.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—whether to stay or leave—is signaled early and tightened when the cicada vanishes, transforming abstract indecision into mystical obligation. Pressure escalates via Liora’s agency: she places the cicada back, triggering the vision’s payoff. Cost is felt in the climb back up—she must now face her brother with new silence, not escape. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the artifact’s magic complicates but doesn’t absolve her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—breathing in spaces that crush vs. spaces that lift—is signaled early and tightens when Liora steps onto the trellis against her father’s warning. Escalation is protagonist-driven: her method (“one step at a time”) shapes tactics under inverted physics. Cost is felt in the doll’s growing weight and gravity’s imminent return, though the hour’s limit isn’t actively tracked as a ticking clock. Coincidence (the boy’s appearance) complicates but doesn’t resolve; closure stems from her choice to believe in recurrence.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether silence can hold grief—is signaled early and deepens when Elias names her attempt to “catalyze” it. The meaningful tightening occurs when he stops poling, forcing stillness as method, not avoidance. Cost is felt in her prior tension and the storm glass darkening, though not paid in tangible loss (time, tool, social risk). Agency lies in attention and endurance, fitting the Accumulative lens, but the absence of a concrete forfeiture (e.g., missed train, abandoned notebook) keeps escalation just shy of 9+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—claiming the throne to halt the world’s unraveling—is signaled early and deepens when the throne is revealed as test, not seat. Veyra’s agency drives escalation: her scraping uncovers the mural, which reframes the quest and raises the conceptual cost (only those who see beyond surface may claim it). The tightening occurs when she chooses to descend despite trickster warnings. Cost is legible: she inherits burden, not power, with only until sunrise to act.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether to remain isolated or reconnect—is signaled early (“she had not answered in years”) and tightens decisively when the child appears with the shared scar, transforming abstract guilt into immediate, embodied demand. Escalation follows Accumulative logic: dreams → knocking → child, each layer increasing sensory and emotional density until the threshold “fading” becomes a live choice. Cost is felt in the keeper’s physical reaction (scar burning, breath catching), though the child’s “suffocating” condition resolves too cleanly, slightly undercutting lasting consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transforming regret into agency—is signaled early and tightens when the porthole offers literal escape. Elias’s choice to turn the bolt counterclockwise forecloses that path with tangible cost: he keeps the diamond but must live with his original failures. Pressure escalates causally through texts and spatial descent, though the “quantum promise” concept slightly softens the logic of the glitch. Still, the moral calculus—self-forgiveness vs. fantasy replacement—is sharp and protagonist-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—uncovering erased truth—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes knowledge was weaponized against his lineage. The tightening occurs when the bridge hums underfoot, narrowing options to action or surrender. Cost is felt: voice stolen, legacy scrubbed. Escalation is driven by Elias’s agency (turning the handle twice), not coincidence, though the specter’s appearance borders on convenient without clearer foreshadowing of spectral mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—capturing “the shape of possibility”—is signaled early and deepens when the woman reveals the world is “unsnapping.” Pressure escalates texturally: from silent observation to program dissolution to marionette invasion. Aldric’s agency drives escalation—he kneels, grips the program, unsnaps his belt—and each choice forecloses return (sword abandoned = knight identity shed). Cost is unmistakable: he trades autonomy for cosmic responsibility, with the chilling ambiguity of whether he’ll “weave [the world] back together / Or unravel it entirely.”

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recovering erased dignity through small relics—is signaled early and deepens when the landlady reveals Daniel’s nightly ritual. The meaningful tightening occurs when Elias chooses to inscribe his own note, accepting vulnerability as cost. Agency is present: he follows clues, asks questions, acts on hope. However, escalation relies on convenient discovery (the postcard appears without struggle), slightly softening pressure; luck complicates but doesn’t resolve, yet the lack of tangible obstacle keeps this just below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—resisting historical erasure—is signaled early and deepens when the console reveals systemic revision. Lira’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to upload despite betrayal, knowing it may be futile. The meaningful tightening occurs when the screens declare *YOU WERE NEVER HERE*, raising the cost from physical danger to ontological annihilation. Her final act forecloses survival but broadcasts truth—a trade-off with visceral stakes, though the enforcers’ arrival leans slightly on coincidence rather than causal buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—silencing a prophecy before the city drowns in noise—is signaled early and tightens when dew forms on the reeds, marking a live clock. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to play not for audience but for “vested hush,” using “negative space” as method. The cost is legible: lungs burn, weight lifts from the case, and the prophecy remains but is “quiet.” One meaningful deepening occurs—the realization that music must “absorb the words before they could take root”—which narrows his tactic to pure sonic negation, foreclosing any verbal or physical intervention.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the leaves’ message—tightens when the moonstone speck multiplies, forcing Liora to shift from passive observation to active arrangement. The spiral monument’s collapse deepens stakes by revealing silver dust as key, narrowing her tactics to ritual construction. Cost is legible: her human identity erodes (moss-stained hands, villagers’ alienation). Though escalation relies on magical discovery, it’s protagonist-driven—she prods the monument, triggering the cascade.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reconciling precision with uncertainty—is signaled early and deepens when the compass defies logic. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to follow, descend, and step into the mist. The tightening occurs at the waterfall: the needle points not north but *into* the churning water, forcing a binary choice. Cost is felt in his relinquishment of control, though the story avoids showing tangible consequence beyond thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding why Elias vanished—is signaled early and tightens when Liora finds her name carved, shifting from factual inquiry to emotional reckoning. The deepening occurs via protagonist agency: she follows sound, observes silently, and chooses to offer the coin instead of demanding answers. Cost is unmistakable: Liora abandons her identity as “Veyne,” the balanced alchemist, embracing vulnerability implied by her given name. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens—each sensory detail narrows emotional options until only forgiveness remains viable.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding authentic laughter to heal himself—is signaled early and deepens when the woman’s presence tests his resolve. Pressure coheres under Accumulative logic: spectral fragments → harp music → broken humming → pure laugh. The tightening occurs when he chooses to sit, risking re-immersion in sorrow, and pays the cost of vulnerability. Though coincidence (the harp’s presence) complicates, resolution stems from his openness, not luck—yet the escalation lacks a second tangible trade-off beyond emotional exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—quantifying the threshold of cruelty—is signaled early and deepened via the vial’s revelation. Pressure escalates through sensory and cognitive immersion, not external threat; the stranger applies minimal but precise opposition (“Drink this”). The meaningful tightening occurs when Elias chooses to ingest despite aversion, narrowing his path to revelation. Cost is conceptual but legible: he must bear the burden of knowing mercy’s instability. Agency drives escalation, though the turn leans slightly on received wisdom rather than hard-won trial.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—retrieving lost stories—is signaled early and tightens when the painting reveals the drowned lighthouse, narrowing Liora’s quest from abstract history to tangible map. Agency drives escalation: her choice to trace lines alters tactics, leading to nocturnal writing and locket-binding. Cost is felt: the alchemist vanishes, implying the search consumes its guides. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the empty stall confirms the path’s solitude, not convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—containing temporal wounds before they split reality—is signaled early and tightened when Mira recognizes the “wound” isn’t just a ghost. Her agency drives escalation: observation → interpretation → intervention. Cost is unmistakable: she bears eternal watchfulness (“keep watching the ceilings”) even as relief arrives. Under Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via pattern disruption (dust circles, silent laughter), not external force.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving the library’s perfect order—is signaled early and deepens when the whisper ruptures it. Elias’s agency drives escalation: uncorking, reading frost, placing the page. The meaningful tightening occurs in the chamber, where his choice to deploy the singed page forecloses preservation, accepting collapse as necessary. Cost is unmistakable: the library’s destruction. However, the messenger’s role edges toward coincidence, slightly diluting pressure cohesion under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving poetic truth against reductive archaeology—is signaled early and deepens when Elias chooses ritual over resistance. The tightening occurs when he abandons argument for invocation, foreclosing reconciliation with the Core. Cost is felt in his exhaustion and isolation, and the escalation is driven by his agency under Accumulative pressure. Though coincidence (storm timing) aids him, it complicates rather than resolves—his plan requires precise action within it.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming stolen light through truth-tethering—is signaled early and deepens when Elias recognizes his self-deception as the true fracture. The tightening occurs at the memory beat, narrowing options to either flee or integrate pain. Cost is legible in his ragged breaths and recoiling body, crystallizing in the final choice to insert the chip. Coincidence (weeping woman’s box) complicates but doesn’t resolve; agency drives escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding the silence after industrial collapse—tightens when Elias chooses to descend, then deepens when he confronts his grandfather’s transformation. The escalation is driven by his agency (delving, uncorking the vial), not coincidence. Cost is conceptual: he surrenders the collector’s impulse for containment, accepting instead that some truths must be held, not explained. The lagoon’s call reweights all prior silence into sacred summons.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reimagining broken paths when maps fail—is signaled early and deepens when Elias must choose whether to rebuild or merely observe. His agency drives escalation: he doesn’t wait for permission but carves the bridge, narrowing his future to timewoven labor. Cost is legible: he may never leave, and his art is no longer personal but communal infrastructure. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; coincidence (GPS failure) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the real work is his hands’ decision.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—understanding why night-blooming flowers exist—is signaled early and deepens through Liora’s pilgrimage to the cathedral. The meaningful tightening occurs when the stained-glass flowers “pulse” and the postcards align with the thaw, forcing her conceptual shift. Agency is internal but credible: her attention and interpretation drive the turn. Cost is conceptual (years of searching resolved in solitude) and felt in the heaviness of the postcards, though not a tangible forfeiture. Coincidence (snow melting as she arrives) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the insight arises from her accumulated observation.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—unearthing suppressed truth—is signaled early and tightens when Elara deciphers the cipher as a map. The meaningful deepening occurs at the lagoon: knowledge isn’t enough; one must retrieve physical proof while risking entrapment. Protagonist agency drives escalation—Elara chooses to parley, wade in, flee—and cost is visible: Miriam’s eternal imprisonment, Lila’s decades of waiting. Coincidence (storm unearthing box) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from Elara’s archival skill and courage.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming agency from passive wishing—is signaled early and deepens when Elias shifts from physical to mental methods. The meaningful tightening occurs when he abandons tools for memory, narrowing options to pure cognition. Cost is felt (isolation, ridicule) but not dramatized in a concrete loss during escalation; pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; change arises from Elias’s sustained attention.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—deciphering whether silence is void or vessel—is signaled early and deepens when the phonograph captures not voice but “orchard’s breath.” Elias’s agency drives escalation: each language recited tightens pressure, culminating in the nameless tongue that strains the machine. Cost is unmistakable in the chorus of whispers and stained hands, foreclosing his former archival detachment. One meaningful deepening suffices; no false resolutions or coincidences undercut causality.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—discovering time’s texture to reopen the past—is signaled early and deepens when Liora realizes it’s “alive.” Escalation is driven by her agency: pressing the acorn cap initiates unmaking, narrowing options to either retreat or embrace the vortex’s cost. The price is visible: the hatchling’s exhaustion, the fragility of regained memory. One tightening suffices, though the “how” of decreasing entropy remains abstract—minor softness in mechanics slightly dilutes pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—listening vs. noise—is signaled early and tightens at zero hour when Liora’s switch forces a binary choice. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her swap creates the pressure point, and the storm’s shift tests her judgment. Cost is unmistakable: her error nearly dooms villagers, and her correction exacts emotional toll. Coincidence (storm changing) complicates but doesn’t resolve—she acts decisively under revised knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—being seen by the cosmos—is signaled early (“stars had grown quiet… world stopped listening”) and deepens when the star’s fall validates Elias’s lifelong attention. The meaningful tightening occurs when alarms blare and he *chooses* the lantern over protocol, narrowing options to a single act of faith. Cost is legible: decades of invisibility crystallize into one trembling moment where vulnerability becomes strength. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens—density increases until the pattern breaks with the star’s arc.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving unspoken words—is signaled early and deepens when ghosts fixate on the box. The meaningful tightening occurs when the solid ghost appears, raising emotional stakes and forcing Elias to choose between covenant and witness. His agency drives escalation: he opens the box, altering the world’s rules (ghosts dissolve). Cost is felt in the weight lifting from silence and the flower’s dust—concrete, irreversible, and thematically charged.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding time’s fracture—is signaled early and tightens when the urn glows with the key, narrowing options to active stewardship. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he seeks sales, interprets tags, presses key to fragment. The cost is felt in irreversible transformation—he becomes the keeper, bearing time’s weight. Coincidence (dream woman) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from his choice to write, not external aid.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—tending grief through beauty in incompleteness—is signaled early and tightens when the snapped kite string reframes loss as invitation. Mira’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to wade in, reach for light, and write, each act narrowing retreat into pure sorrow. Cost is visible in enduring grief now harmonized, not resolved, and the feather’s physical imperfection mirrors emotional reality. Coincidence (snapped string) complicates but doesn’t resolve; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens via sensory intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving interspecies wisdom against commodification—is signaled early and deepens when Elias chooses active defiance over passive witness. His agency drives escalation: wiring branches redefines the space as labyrinth, raising stakes by complicating future destruction. Cost is felt in bodily strain and temporal scarcity (“six months” made urgent), though the tightening lacks a second tactical consequence beyond symbolic resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—validating homecoming as chemistry—tightens when Elias enters the tower, foreclosing retreat into pure skepticism. His agency drives escalation: choosing to follow footprints, then surrendering amber. Cost is visible: intellectual identity sacrificed for belief. Coincidence (Liora’s presence) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the reaction requires his active participation.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming loss through symbolic renewal—is signaled early and deepens via Elias’s scattering of seeds, a quiet act that forecloses grand restoration in favor of patient witness. Pressure coheres texturally: each sensory beat tightens the emotional aperture until the heron’s flight becomes an “invitation” answered by release. Cost is felt (lighter pods, heavier heart), though escalation leans on lyric accumulation over tactical narrowing; still, protagonist agency drives every meaningful turn.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding the disappeared to collapse emotional distance—is signaled early and deepens when Liora’s voice claims survivors are being “changed.” The tightening occurs when Elias realizes the war continues underground, forcing a trade-off: safety vs. moral duty. Cost is legible in his trembling hands and the leaf’s darkening veins—a physical toll that alters tactics (packing courage like a tool). Coincidence complicates (mysterious riddle) but doesn’t resolve; agency drives escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s search for orientation in a disordered timeline—is signaled early and deepens when the anomaly appears. The meaningful tightening occurs when the compass needle spins and settles beyond the glass, forcing a shift from passive observation to active creation (drawing possibility). This escalation is driven by protagonist agency (his choice to sketch), not coincidence. The cost is legible: he accepts irreversible solitude and the burden of being the sole witness/crosser. Under the Accumulative lens, the cadence shift—from stillness to trembling pencil—reweights the entire premise with emotional and existential price.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—embracing the unknown—is signaled early and deepens when the guardian reveals time seeks her, not vice versa. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: Lirien initiates trades, misjudges, and ultimately accepts the lid. The cost—living with unanswerable wonder—is felt in her trembling fingers and reinterpreted wind. One tightening suffices at this length, though the guardian’s “not clever enough” momentarily risks deflation before repricing the victory.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—escaping scripted identity to author one’s history—is signaled early and tightens when the man challenges her method (“History isn’t written in words”). Liora’s agency drives escalation: she shifts from tracing names to weaving absences, foreclosing passive grief with the cost of abandoning the chessboard. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; however, the man’s arrival borders on convenient catalyst rather than organic complication, slightly softening the tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (“understand the shape of home”) tightens meaningfully when the journal reveals “buried talents,” raising emotional stakes beyond personal memory to collective loss. Protagonist agency drives escalation: Elias chooses to descend despite fraying reality, clutching the feather as divining rod. Cost is felt in bodily strain (“mercury in his blood surging”) and the feather’s dissolution. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; all pressure stems from his decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—forgiving oneself—is signaled early and escalates through Elias’s thread-decoding, which narrows his options from avoidance to confrontation. The black thread’s pull is a decisive tightening: it triggers the memory-replay where agency shifts from passive regret to active refusal (“You don’t get to change it”). Cost is felt in the searing labyrinth and coiling threads, making the final stillness a hard-won trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—forgiveness as voiced truth vs. enforced silence—is signaled early and deepens through Lira’s poetic refracting, which narrows her path from defiance to revelation. Agency drives escalation: each poem tightens the hush until the spire glows. Cost is unmistakable: emotional exposure (“worse—alive”) and the foreclosed safety of penance. Coincidence never resolves; Echo complicates but doesn’t solve—Lira’s voice alone breaks the silence.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—conjure meaning from oblivion—is signaled early and tightens when Elias realizes pockmarks are a map, foreclosing passive waiting. Escalation is driven by his agency: matching scars to stone forces confrontation with repressed failures. Cost is unmistakable: recalling the mentor’s disappearance and near-suicidal moments exacts emotional toll, paid before the workshop steadies. Coincidence never resolves; insight arises solely from embodied pattern recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—keeping a buried promise—is signaled early and deepens when the shell sinks, forcing Elias to choose between retrieval and surrender. The meaningful tightening occurs when he abandons grasping the shell and instead enters the tunnel, narrowing his path from recovery to reckoning. Cost is felt in his coughing ascent and trembling hands, but the escalation leans slightly on environmental coincidence (the conveniently placed ledge) rather than pure agency, softening the pressure just below 8.8+ threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—whether quiet intent can move the world—is signaled early and deepens when the vial’s note echoes. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses timing, whisper, and release, narrowing options to one irreversible act. Cost is conceptual but palpable: if wrong, he remains a fool; if right, reality bends, yet the victory is fragile, swallowed by storm. Coincidence (finding the vial) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the echo’s return hinges on his precise, vulnerable action.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—navigating loss via cryptic guidance—is signaled early and deepens when the censer’s symbols shift post-call, sharpening their edges “pointing toward the horizon.” This constitutes a meaningful tightening: the abstract quest becomes directional. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with each symbol-trace and notebook sketch accumulating weight. However, the phone call introduces coincidence rather than protagonist-driven escalation; Elias reacts rather than acts to alter his trajectory, slightly muting agency at the critical turn.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—psychological safety versus truth—is signaled early and deepens when the eye amplifies rather than occludes. Mira’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to wear it, then to bury it, each act narrowing options. Cost is felt (shaking hands, nightmares) and shapes tactics. However, the fox interruption slightly diffuses pressure at a critical juncture, softening the turn just before climax—minor but noticeable under elite scrutiny.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the stranger’s unspoken burden—is signaled early and tightens when Elias chooses observation over intrusion, narrowing his path to understanding. The escalation is protagonist-driven: his decision to “observe the gaps” leads directly to receiving the memories. Cost is felt: he assumes emotional weight that disrupts his hollow routine. Under an Accumulative lens, this deepening reweights the stake without false resolution or coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—honoring a hollow promise vs. seeking unknown truth—is signaled early and deepens when the chip warms and the door appears. The creek’s rise creates a live clock that tightens tactics, forcing action before submersion. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he pries the board, follows the ants, inserts the chip. Cost is felt (abandoning the shop’s weight) but not fully rendered as loss—what he sacrifices remains abstract, slightly muting the trade-off’s visceral stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming lost cosmic kinship—is signaled early and tightens when the raven’s scroll arrives, forcing a choice between throne and truth. The climb escalates pressure physically (thinning air) and existentially (shrinking city = fading earthly authority). Cost is legible: she surrenders her gilded cage, her known self. Agency drives every turn; coincidence (raven) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the queen chooses to enter, to touch, to return.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—whether the past can be revalued without losing oneself—is signaled early via Elias’s note and deepens when Liora realizes the curl is a “key.” The tightening occurs when she chooses to trust Elias’s changed self, risking her solitary craft for shared understanding. Cost is legible: Elias sacrificed felt time; Liora risks her foundational belief in fixed moments. Though the escalation is subtle, it’s driven by Liora’s agency—her decision to uncork the vial—not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding his temporal dislocation—is signaled early and deepens when Elias finds his own handwriting predicting his grave visit. The tightening occurs when he realizes he’s “competing with time,” raising the cost from confusion to existential jealousy. Agency is present in his choice not to burn the scroll, preserving the past’s message at the price of ongoing torment. The escalation is driven by protagonist insight, not coincidence, though the external threat (door opening) arrives without his direct causation—still valid under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—making memory mean something again—is signaled early and deepens when Clara reveals the boy named Elias. The tightening occurs in Elias’s decision to etch rather than repair, foreclosing mechanical restoration in favor of emotional cartography. Cost is visible: generations of silenced midwifery, wartime loss, and Elias’s own sensory void. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves tension—only human attention under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transforming grief into voice—is signaled early and deepens when ink crystallizes, forcing Liora to reinterpret failure. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she deliberately hardens ink, triggering the rune’s rearrangement. Cost is unmistakable (scars as permanent yet revalued), though pressure tightens only once—sufficient for length. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the rune’s aliveness emerges from her choice to engage superstition.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—delivering an overdue apology—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s ritual. Pressure escalates via the ticking orchard deadline and the bottle’s fragility. His agency drives the climax: he chooses metaphor over prayer, listening over banishment. Cost is felt in the cracked vessel and the irreversible fall of trees—coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving truth before universal amnesia—is signaled early and deepens when words fade and the stone darkens. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to press the dictionary to the stone, triggering the journey. Cost is felt in the loss of the physical anchor and the burden of becoming the sole weaver. However, the “hiccup” remains abstract; tighter temporal pressure (e.g., countdown of fading definitions) would heighten urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—restoring temporal integrity—is signaled early and tightens when the key fails and horizon wavers. Elias’s agency drives escalation: counting backward, testing the lock, then offering blood. The cost (pain, epistemic rupture) is unmistakable and alters his understanding irreversibly. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure builds through textural intensification (pipes shudder, pendulum stills) until the decisive act reweights reality itself.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—transcending boundaries—is signaled early and deepens when Mara reveals she’s seeded Elias’s life with spores. The tightening occurs in her question: “Why?” forcing Elias to confront passive observation versus active participation. His agency emerges in accepting the vial and pressing the laser one last time, a renunciation that forecloses his old identity. Cost is felt in the weight of years missed and the vulnerability of “now, we let go”—a stance crystallized under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—paying debts while escaping her father’s fatal pattern—is signaled early and tightens when the lantern’s burn reveals the system’s illusion. Protagonist agency drives escalation: she chooses to enter, request archives, and ignite the match. Cost is unmistakable: she rejects his losing games but inherits his wariness, crystallizing a new tactic with emotional weight. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—Mara’s role as keeper of unfinished endings—is signaled early and tightens when the Tuesday caller shifts from monologue to declaration (“I think I’m ready”). This deepening, driven by Mara’s consistent tactic of listening without fixing, forecloses her path of passive endurance: she must now confront whether she’s “done enough.” Cost is legible in her final doubt, charged by the disc’s mute resonance. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens—no false resolutions, just a quiet recalibration of burden.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving Liora’s memory—is clear early and deepens when town forgetfulness raises stakes. The meaningful tightening occurs when Elias realizes ink and lockets fail, forcing the climactic choice to release. Cost is felt: surrendering the locket means relinquishing his last tangible link. Escalation is protagonist-driven (his dawning insight), though external pressure (fading town memory) could be more concretely dramatized beyond summary.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—cure for loneliness—is signaled early and deepens when the logistician reframes it as “debt.” The meaningful tightening occurs at the trade: Elias offers his most precious object, expecting relief, but receives instead a conceptual shift that forecloses his path of passive waiting. Agency lies in his acceptance—he doesn’t chase or argue, just stands transformed. Cost is felt: he loses the rock and his myth of rescue, gaining only uncertain hope. Coincidence (rumor chains) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the turn stems from Elias’s choice to believe and offer.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—navigating uncharted emotional depths—is signaled early and deepens when the forest’s melody reveals Liora’s unnamed grief. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: she chooses to follow chimes, trust the ring, and press her palm to the tree, each act narrowing options until only surrender remains. Cost is unmistakable: her cartographic identity dissolves (“edges blur”), yet this loss enables homecoming. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure tightens via sensory saturation, not external opposition, fulfilling Track A expectations.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—repairing warped collective memory—is signaled early and deepens through Liora’s dream revelation. The meaningful tightening occurs in dialogue: Elias’s “plant new seeds” reframes failure as iterative growth, narrowing Liora’s binary (fix or ruin) into a sustainable practice. Agency is clear: her final stance crystallizes not through external force but internal recalibration under coherent pressure from the anomaly and relationship. Conceptual cost is legible—the truth remains fluid, demanding ongoing labor—but the escalation stems from protagonist insight, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—translating silence into music—is signaled early and deepens when Elias names it “joyful sorrow,” forcing Lena to confront its duality. The tightening occurs when she signs “You don’t have to stay,” risking abandonment; his refusal (“I want to”) raises emotional stakes. Agency is clear: her signing composes meaning, not just expresses it. Cost is felt (vulnerability after grief-isolation) but not visibly paid beyond emotional exposure—no material forfeiture or irreversible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the truth behind the “promise”—is signaled early and deepens when the Scribe reveals the key locks rather than opens. This single, meaningful intensification reframes every prior ruin as complicit concealment, raising the cost from historical curiosity to moral imperative. Elara’s agency drives the climax: she offers the fragment, choosing liberation over preservation. The cost—breaking a seal meant to protect—is legible in the final line: “the archway’s lock began to turn.”

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reconnecting with Liora—is clear from paragraph one and tightens when the serum triggers her memories. The meaningful deepening occurs at the climax: Elias doesn’t just find her; he becomes her, foreclosing his solitary existence. Cost is felt (“restraints snapped,” running into the night) and conceptual (loss of individual identity). Pressure escalates via sensory overload and rhythmic urgency, not coincidence, aligning perfectly with the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—proving whispers travel—is signaled early and tested at climax. Pressure escalates via storm intensification and map discovery, narrowing Elias’s options to one precise action: intercepting the spiral walker. The tightening occurs when he realizes the “lock” is a person’s path, not a physical mechanism—a deepening that shifts tactics. Cost is felt in his vulnerability when offering the key, though the storm’s role borders on convenient complication.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether silence can convey empathy—is signaled early and tested by the girl’s intrusion. Pressure tightens when the child accuses her of witchcraft, forcing Maris to respond nonverbally. The deepening occurs through the mirror exchange and pebble gift, narrowing options to only silent teaching. Cost is felt: Maris risks misunderstanding yet chooses vulnerability, and the girl leaves changed—but the escalation leans slightly on coincidence (child’s sudden appearance) rather than fully earned protagonist-driven pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preventing another disappearance like his sister’s—is signaled early and deepens when Elias activates the window displays, narrowing options from passive mourning to active, vulnerable defiance. The cost is felt: he leaves the frozen chessboard (symbol of control) for uncertain action. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; escalation isn’t causal but textural—whispers intensify, lights shift, magnets are gathered. Minor deduction: the “hungry” entity remains abstract, slightly weakening tangible opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—freedom through self-acceptance—is signaled early (“make herself small”) and deepens when the scrimshaw vibrates, implying ancestral belonging. The tightening occurs at the temple: the mother’s line “violence became impossible here” reframes Lirien’s lifelong strategy as obsolete, forcing renunciation of struggle. Cost is felt in the scrimshaw’s dust—irreplaceable knowledge sacrificed for insight. Minor deduction: the whale’s call resolves access too conveniently, though it’s seeded early enough to avoid deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—resisting compulsory joy through private grief—is signaled early and deepens via ritual repetition. The tightening occurs not through external conflict but internal endurance: each narration becomes heavier, the flowers more fragile. Cost is felt in Elias’s wet face upon waking and the “heavier” words at dawn. Though agency is limited to attention and speech, it’s credible within the dystopian frame; escalation is textural, not causal, fitting the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transcending forbidden beauty to become vessel for the world’s voice—is signaled early and tightens when the ice cracks, forcing vocalization. Agency is clear: she chooses to write with breath, not ink. Cost is felt in bodily weight and identity loss. Escalation is protagonist-driven under Accumulative lens: each sensory immersion deepens her surrender. One tightening suffices, though a second micro-turn (e.g., hesitation before kneeling) could heighten tension.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—capturing twilight’s essence—is signaled early and deepens when Liora offers an alternative mode of sight. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he arranges plants, accepts Mara’s shard, chooses feeling over precision. Cost is legible in relinquished control and redefined success. No false resolution; the “awakening” carries conceptual price—abandoning old metrics of accuracy.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding why connection dissolves—is signaled early and deepens when Elias shifts from control to listening. The meaningful tightening occurs when he realizes the pilgrimage isn’t about fixing but attending to cracks. Cost is conceptual: abandoning the goal of reconstruction for receptive waiting. Though the hum’s origin remains mysterious, it arises from environmental resonance (walls, not deus ex machina), preserving agency—Elias chooses to interpret it as connection, crystallizing his stance.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether to let grief calcify or transform—is signaled early via the mourning ring and half-finished pieces, then tightened by each origami clue that narrows his path back toward engagement. Protagonist agency drives escalation: he chooses to follow coordinates despite fear, culminating in the decisive act of marking his own skin. Cost is felt in the “weight pressed into every facet” of the ring and the years of solitude now relinquished. Coincidence (the girl’s appearance) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Liora’s voice merely echoes what Elias must choose himself.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—decoding the anonymous deck’s cultural blueprint—is signaled early and deepens when cards reveal post-crash trauma. Lira’s agency drives escalation: she multiplies paths per instruction, arranges cards, and replies, each act narrowing her retreat. The cost is conceptual but palpable—she accepts being “mapped” in return for mapping. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via symbolic density (The Fool’s dissolving coins, The Hermit’s static lantern), not external force, yet the stakes feel urgent and personal.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—confronting the Veythi’s fatal obsession with order—is signaled early and deepens when Kael’s presence forces Elara to choose between extraction and surrender. The tightening occurs at the pagoda: her decision to interlock hands forecloses her archival mission with felt cost (abandoning purification). Escalation stems from protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, though the child’s origin leans slightly on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving the shape of hope against erasure—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s archival labor. Pressure escalates accumulatively: the shadow unbound grows more present, the footage contrast sharpens, and the stone warms, culminating in the decisive act of merging timelines. Cost is legible: the valley remains scarred; hope is redefined as process, not restoration. Though no external antagonist exists, the conflict is coherent under an Accumulative lens, with each beat narrowing emotional options until only patient listening remains.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserving integrity amid betrayal—is signaled early and deepens when Elias chooses adaptation over restoration. The meaningful tightening occurs when he sets down the brush: a renunciation that narrows his moral options (no more naive trust) with felt cost (abandoning his former idealism). Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens; the poacher’s absence heightens internal conflict without resolving it externally. Minor deduction: the chameleon’s vulnerability slightly overshadows Elias’s personal stakes until the midpoint, delaying full escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—deciphering scars as maps or warnings—tightens when the hourglass cracks and the garden speaks, forcing Elias into the tunnel despite risk. His agency drives escalation: he chooses to listen, to enter, to touch the cup. Cost is felt in the tower’s groan and the irreversible shattering of timepieces. Coincidence (finding the tunnel) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the miracle’s displacement was always the real puzzle.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding where unused love is stored—is signaled early and deepens into recovering its voice. Pressure escalates texturally: from waiting, to touching, to vision, to theft. The meaningful tightening occurs when the film curls and blackens—foreclosing passive observation and forcing Mira into active recovery (“I’ll bring the tune back”). Cost is legible: she risks psychic burn (singed film) and moral trespass (stealing the pen), though the latter’s emotional weight could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity—is signaled early and deepens when Liora realizes rest isn’t enough; she needs release. The meaningful turn occurs when she shifts from active searching (tracing stars) to passive reception (closing eyes, listening), narrowing her tactic from control to surrender. Cost is felt in months of withered stories and physical exhaustion, though not visibly paid in the climax—inspiration returns almost magically. Under Accumulative logic, this suffices, but agency in the escalation is borderline passive.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—protecting the cargo—deepens into cultivating “sparks in unlit corners,” narrowing Elias’s path from passive duty to active stewardship. The tightening occurs when the clock’s backward spin forces entry into the archive, foreclosing his old role. Cost is felt in the irreversible exposure to divergent time and the burden of choice. Though agency drives the turn (touching the clock), the voice’s directive borders on external imposition, slightly softening protagonist-driven escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—accessing untamed thought—is signaled early and tightens when the gear’s frequency becomes painful, forcing engagement. The philosopher’s agency drives escalation: picking up the gear, dreaming, stepping forward. Cost is felt in the irreversible translocation and abandonment of the mechanical order. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via sensory saturation and symbolic weight, not causal turns, yet the deepening reweights the entire premise with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding unused courage—is signaled early and deepens when Mira realizes courage isn’t found but traversed. The tightening occurs when she steps ashore, foreclosing the passenger role with visible cost: isolation, uncertainty, irreversible departure from routine. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens—each sensory and symbolic layer (star stamp, twilight, reeds) intensifies the moral weight. Agency is internal but decisive: her attention and endurance become acts of renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding the cost of safety—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s confrontation with erasure. The tightening occurs when the bolt vanishes, foreclosing passive observation and forcing direct challenge. Madame Veyra’s off-key humming and blank score raise emotional stakes without resolving them. Cost is felt in Elias’s silent departure: knowledge gained, voice still absent, truth still buried.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—unmasking the pretender through archival truth—is signaled early and tightens when Liora deciphers the rune’s condition (“unbroken”). Her agency drives escalation: each breadcrumb (ink pellet, marginalia) narrows options until the rune’s recovery forecloses deception. Cost is felt in the library’s decay and her sacrificed anonymity, but the pretender’s absence slightly softens opposition pressure. Still, the deepening—from tracing lies to wielding time-bending truth—earns high marks under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recovering erased ecological memory—is signaled early and tightens when Elara finds the torn atlas page. The meaningful deepening occurs on day four: recognizing deletions as intentional, tidal erasure. This forces her descent to the lowest level, foreclosing passive observation for active resistance. Cost is felt in solitude, trembling hands, and the weight of being the sole rememberer—but stakes remain internalized, slightly limiting visceral escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming lost magic vs. accepting rebellion’s failure—is signaled early and deepens when Lira connects the stones to her grandmother’s lore. The tightening occurs at the monolith: touching it transforms passive observation into active rekindling. Yet the escalation hinges on revelation, not protagonist-driven agency; the hum *draws* her, rather than her overcoming resistance to approach.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming organic destiny from sterile Reconstruction—is signaled early and deepens when the kite arrives. Mira’s agency drives escalation: she deciphers, disobeys, unseals. Cost is felt (embryo dissolved, inevitable Council wrath), though the “unpredictable danger” of the springs isn’t tested beyond atmosphere, slightly softening external pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—endurance vs. annihilation—is signaled early (“didn’t believe in healing”) and deepens when drones return, forcing Lena to choose paralysis or anchoring. The meaningful tightening occurs in the freeze: her body locks, but Mira’s cue (“look at the orchid”) shifts agency to observation-as-resistance. Cost is felt—Lena’s pulse slows only after acknowledging the flower’s defiance, proving stillness requires active will, not passive hope.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming agency after abandonment—is signaled early and deepens when Elias chooses to erase and rebuild rather than dwell. The tightening occurs when the library walls press close, forcing a trade-off: resist and suffocate or surrender and transform. Cost is visible in the destroyed portrait and warped tarot cards, which he must painstakingly reassemble. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, though the “drowning in slow motion” metaphor slightly abstracts the physical stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—time being stolen—is signaled early via the drone and confirmed by the child’s affliction. Pressure tightens decisively when the ink forms a humanoid shape, forcing Elias’s lunge. Cost is conceptual (time itself is currency) and personal (his lifelong obsession now has a target). Escalation is protagonist-driven, though the child’s spontaneous recovery slightly deflates the crisis before Elias acts.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—truth versus sanctioned silence—is signaled early and deepens when Elias chooses to weaponize preservation. The tightening occurs at the chamber entrance: he hesitates, weighs consequences, then acts, foreclosing compliance. Agency is clear (planting the letter), and cost is felt (“he feared the silence more”). Escalation is driven by protagonist choice under Accumulative pressure, though the Order’s off-stage presence slightly softens opposition—still, stakes remain viscerally high due to embodied risk.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—survival through continuity vs. chaos—is signaled early and tightens when the father appears, forcing Liora to choose between resistance and reconciliation. The escalation is driven by her agency: offering the sandbag, then the rose, reconfiguring confrontation into communion. Cost is felt in his unreadable pause and the wilting bloom—proof the bounty is relinquished at personal price. One meaningful deepening suffices: the shift from potential violence to shared silence reframes survival as coexistence, not escape.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—catching the goddess’s echo—is signaled early and deepens when the sky’s chaos fractures the garden’s song, raising emotional and metaphysical stakes. Kael’s agency drives escalation: he chooses zigzagging over straight paths, ear-to-ground listening over passive waiting. Cost is felt in the garden’s sorrow he must reject and the solitude that persists post-miracle. The rail spike’s offering isn’t transactional—it’s a renunciation of control, paid with vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—truth versus erasure—is signaled early and deepens when archives vanish. Elara’s agency drives escalation: writing letters, demanding autopsy notes, calling for a shovel. Cost is felt: social vulnerability, physical risk. The tightening (“They’re watching the printworks”) narrows options, forcing alliance. Coincidence complicates (radio warning) but doesn’t resolve; closure stems from her choice to act.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—silencing guilt through erasure vs. listening through inscription—is signaled early and deepens when the translator reveals “You left us behind.” The meaningful tightening occurs when Elias chooses not to flee but to tattoo, narrowing options to permanent endurance. Cost is felt: he absorbs centuries of unsent letters into his skin. Agency drives escalation; coincidence (finding amber) complicates but doesn’t resolve—resolution comes through his ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the grotto’s meaning—is signaled early and deepens when Maren’s interjection reframes Liora’s approach from “arranging colors” to “listening.” This escalation, driven by protagonist agency (Liora choosing to lean closer), narrows options: she abandons control for receptivity. Cost is felt in her “throat tight” and the town’s unsaid regrets now made visible. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens via sensory and textual density.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether to erase or redeem Amira’s act—is signaled early and deepens when Liora uncovers the name. The tightening occurs in her choice to retain “Amira” but redefine it, foreclosing vengeance with tangible cost (blood, emotional exposure). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each tessera placed increases density until the final reconfiguration. Agency is clear—Liora’s micro-choices (turning stone, pressing lapis) drive escalation without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—Liora’s longing for an encore—is signaled early and deepens when Elias fractures time to manifest her potential selves. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: Elias spins the coin, knowingly risking cruelty for hope. The cost is felt in Liora’s conflicted reaction (“This is cruel…”) and visible in her blurring form, though the story stops short of showing irreversible consequence, slightly softening the price.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—understanding vs. surrendering to telepathic residue—is signaled early and deepens when Mara shifts from reversal to coexistence. Agency drives escalation: she chooses placebo, paints air, initiates contact with foreign memory. Cost is felt in the lost child-memory and irreversible neural openness. Under Accumulative lens, pressure tightens via density increase (paint layers → light threads), though the pill’s mechanics remain slightly under-pressured as external force.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—becoming the voice of the unknown—is signaled early via Eira’s vocation and fossil. Pressure tightens when the caves “feel her back,” forcing a trade-off: preserve self or embrace translation. The entity’s arrival deepens stakes by redefining “carrying” as embodiment, not documentation. Cost is visible (shattered device, swallowed identity), though escalation leans slightly on revelation over active choice—Eira reacts more than acts until the final acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—spinning brittle prophecy into breathable possibility—is signaled early and deepened through Mira’s relentless cataloging. The tightening occurs when she realizes buttons are “waiting,” transforming passive sorting into active reassembly. Cost is unmistakable: she foregoes fulfilling the prophecy to instead reinterpret it, sacrificing certainty for generative ambiguity. Agency drives escalation; coincidence (the sack’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve—Mira’s labor earns the reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—confronting the cost of survival—is signaled early and deepens when the file reveals abandoned agents. Elias’s agency drives escalation: reading codes → opening pillbox → using key → accepting file. The tightening forecloses his path of isolation; cost is felt in his scars ceasing to ache—a physical release earned by moral burden-taking. Coincidence is avoided; every turn stems from his decisions under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—maintaining the ferry against time and decay—is signaled early and deepens as the storm accelerates rope unraveling. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his attentive stitching is the only barrier between order and collapse. The cost is felt in physical strain (“knees popping”) and temporal pressure (“rain gutters stop ticking”), though the storm’s arrival slightly edges into environmental coincidence rather than pure protagonist-driven turn.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding why some places remember—is signaled early and deepens when Ren realizes the oasis holds all its timelines at once. Pressure escalates texturally: from dry clay to humming ghosts to tangible honey. The tightening occurs when he lights the fire, an act of ritual attention that triggers the lantern’s thrum and auditory past. Though Ren doesn’t “choose” in a causal sense, his sustained attention crystallizes stance under Accumulative pressure, with conceptual cost: he can no longer see time as singular.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserving fragile beauty against entropy—is signaled early via the rosebush and deepened when Lila arrives with her father’s key. The tightening occurs when Elias relinquishes the gauge, foreclosing his role as sole keeper. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens; cost is felt in shared silence and the “heavier” hush. Agency is subtle but present: unlocking the escape, choosing to pass on the tool. Coincidence doesn’t resolve—Lila’s arrival complicates, not solves.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—translating isolation into independence—is signaled early and deepens when the sundial actively guides her to lost-script books. The tightening occurs when the library physically responds to her voice, proving coexistence is possible, but only if she engages the past on its terms. Agency is clear: Lira turns the dial, reads aloud, accepts the weight. Cost is felt in her trembling hands and years of brittle solitude, now transformed but not erased.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding the thread connecting human secrets—is signaled early and tightens when Mira shifts from observing patterns to writing her own letter, foreclosing her ghostwriter anonymity. Cost is felt in her vulnerability (“mine remains unspooled”) and visible in the keeper holding her returned confession. Though escalation leans on dialogue rather than physical action, protagonist agency drives every turn under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving communal coherence against cosmic deception—is signaled early and tightens when Mara risks everything on an untested counter-signal. The meaningful deepening occurs when Voss’s doubt forces her to articulate her plan (“I’ll give them silence”), raising emotional and existential cost. Agency is clear: Mara’s choice drives the climax, not coincidence. The price—potential annihilation if wrong—is felt in her steady exhale before activation.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—unlocking the Nexus’s secret—is signaled early and tightens when the organ’s hum pulls Elias toward irreversible knowledge. His agency drives escalation: he chooses to approach, to speak, to reach. The cost is conceptual but undeniable: loss of ordinary perception, symbolized by the compass’s warning. One weakness: the figure’s sudden appearance borders on deus ex machina, though their dialogue reframes it as inevitable revelation rather than rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—making Liora seen—is signaled early and tightens when the lance reframes violence as precision, not passion. Elara’s agency lies in attention: choosing to draw the weapon alongside the smile forecloses passive remembrance. Cost is felt in her pulse quickening, sweat on satin, and the weight of inherited testimony. Escalation stems from protagonist choice (accepting the lance), not coincidence, though the sister’s arrival leans slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—uncovering Elias’s truth—is signaled early and deepens into Mira’s own confrontation with legacy and risk. Pressure escalates causally: decoding stanzas → discovering the nail’s dual use → furnace revelation. The tightening forecloses passive scholarship; she must now act. Cost is legible in her trembling hands and the station’s collapse around her—a physical and existential price for knowledge. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from her active pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—trusting ephemeral traces as meaningful—tightens when Lena chooses to preserve the glass flake rather than dismiss it as debris. Escalation occurs through accumulation: hitchhiker’s vanishing → discovery of flake → replaying his words → deciding to keep playing. Under Accumulative lens, pressure grows via density of resonant details, not causal turns. Cost is visible: she accepts perpetual uncertainty (“not-knowing was where the music lived”) as the price for continued belief.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—breaking generational cycles—is signaled early and deepens when Elias recognizes his father’s calm as a weapon versus his own as receptivity. The meaningful tightening occurs when he spreads the bills: each currency becomes a testament to failed escapes, forcing him to confront his own mimicry. Cost is felt in his relinquishment of the illusion of linear escape, though the escalation leans more on reflection than external pressure. Still, under an Accumulative lens, the cadence shift at “Some paths circled back...” delivers sufficient deepening with legible conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—decoding inscriptions to relieve collective burden—tightens when dreams shift from fragmented to urgent, forcing Elias to choose between solitary analysis or communal sharing. His agency drives escalation: transcribing → witnessing → resolving to speak aloud. Cost is felt in his physical tension and the “hollow” inadequacy of prior words. Coincidence (unsigned telegram) complicates but doesn’t resolve; insight emerges from accumulated dream-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—truth versus survival—is signaled early and deepens when the seed demands Veyra’s core lie. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: she chooses to plant the seed knowing its cost, then endures the unraveling. The tightening forecloses denial permanently, with visible price in the child’s reappearance and the Circle’s failed hope. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens; coincidence doesn’t resolve—Veyra’s past actions directly generate the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—remaking the eclipsed covenant—is signaled early and tightens when the woman appears, forcing Elias from solitary vigil to shared action. The meaningful deepening occurs at the scar-touch: knowledge shifts (he’s not alone), narrowing his path to partnership. Cost is felt in relinquishing self-reliance. Agency drives escalation: his choice to step forward triggers the climax, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming her brother—is signaled early and deepens when the stranger demands the memory that haunts her. The tightening is meaningful: Liora must sacrifice the very recollection that fuels her quest, narrowing options to an unbearable trade-off. Cost is unmistakable (“forget the sound of his voice”) and arises from her agency, not coincidence. Though pressure coheres, the escalation hinges on one major turn rather than layered intensifications, slightly limiting scope.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming purpose after public failure—is signaled early and deepens when Lena appears, forcing Jake to choose between isolation and re-engagement. The tightening occurs in his decision to show her the cloth, a vulnerability that forecloses his “facts-only” armor. Agency is quiet but present: he drives to the pit, holds out the cloth, listens. Cost is felt—not lost opportunity, but the risk of being known again.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reestablishing connection with the departed spirit—is signaled early and tightens when Elara inserts the seed, narrowing options to passive waiting. Escalation is driven by her agency (not coincidence), and the deepening comes via the arbor’s response. Cost is felt (emotional distance, irrevocable loss) though not physical; under Accumulative lens, this suffices. One meaningful intensification (seed insertion → light figure) meets length expectations.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving migrating identities against time’s collapse—is signaled early and deepens when Elias chooses to release rather than retain. The tightening occurs when he fills the creel: each book accepted narrows the path back to mere curation. Cost is conceptual but legible: surrendering stewardship risks oblivion, yet he acts. Coincidence (“tomorrow disappeared”) complicates but doesn’t resolve; agency lies entirely in Elias’s ritual. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—dissolving emotional walls—is signaled early and deepens when the inspector realizes the task is self-directed. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: each confession dissolved raises emotional stakes until the child’s crown forces confrontation with her own fear. Cost is unmistakable: the pearl’s luster dies, the bunker empties, and she leaves lighter but permanently altered. Under an Accumulative lens, the cadence shift from accumulation to release reweights hope as something that “can find its way home.”

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—living with guilt after causing a death through misreading the river—is signaled early and deepens through Lena’s ritualized error-mapping. The meaningful tightening occurs when she abandons the quest for forgiveness (“I wasn’t looking for forgiveness anymore”) and commits to truth as endurance. Agency is clear: her choice to stop medication, to play discordant notes, to keep drawing the map despite its futility. Cost is felt—the drowned man’s family, her isolation—but the escalation leans slightly more on accumulation than protagonist-driven reversal; the wind-triggered accordion wheeze introduces external pressure rather than internal pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—accessing the unspoken—is signaled early and deepens when the library demands participation over observation. The tightening occurs when the blank book forces her to write the second letter, narrowing options from seeking to creating. Cost is visible: she loses the safety of documentation-only engagement, risking self-exposure through the unsent letter. Escalation is driven by her agency (tracing symbols, reading aloud), though the “propagation delays” mechanic could exert sharper tactical pressure earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—weighing dream against empire—is signaled early and tightens when the plants scream she is “the fracture,” forcing a trade-off: obey legacy or propagate unraveling. Escalation is driven by Elara’s agency (she chooses to play again after the first note), not coincidence. Cost is unmistakable: her father vanishes, the city may fall, her hands go numb. One meaningful deepening suffices—the coffee stains’ transformation proves stakes evolved from personal dilemma to world-altering rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving the spark at life’s edge—is signaled early and tightens when the emerald dims post-ritual, foreclosing permanence. Pressure escalates texturally: aurora deepens, ice hums, breath stirs linen—each intensification narrows options to mere pause, not salvation. Cost is felt in Liora’s “shaky” relief and the chip’s irreversible dimming. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; agency lies in her whispered words and placement of the emerald.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—finding contentment’s source—is signaled early and deepens when the hairpin’s scallop engraving reframes rebirth as shedding skin. Mira’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to descend, touch the water, and release the pin. Cost is unmistakable: relinquishing the artifact forecloses clinging to symbolic closure, enabling forward motion. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each sensory detail (moss, fungi, mist) tightens thematic focus without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. nuance—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes Veyra seeks understanding, not absolution. The tightening occurs in Elias’s question (“Tell me what you’re afraid of”), which narrows options from judgment to witness. Cost is felt in the loosened “cloak of doubt,” though the escalation leans more on atmosphere than protagonist-driven agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—proving vanishing as reappearance—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s confrontation with buried truth. The tightening occurs when she admits fear, triggering the grotto’s intensifying hum and the trance. Cost is felt conceptually: she surrenders control over linear causality, accepting ambiguity over scientific proof. Though pressure is internal and accumulative rather than causal, it coheres under the chosen lens and culminates in a stance shift with irreversible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—deciphering the canyon’s hidden path through non-movement—is signaled early and deepens when the flock’s formation splits, forcing Elias to act. Escalation is driven by his agency: interpreting bird patterns, pressing the arrowhead, striking the skimmer. The cost is conceptual but undeniable: he gains the navigators’ art but surrenders linear time, becoming part of the canyon’s echo-system. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with each sensory beat tightening the thematic coil.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding the sacred in the simple—is signaled early and tightens when Elias unstraps his satchel, foreclosing reliance on failed knowledge. Pressure escalates via the spire’s demands: physical hardship, surrender of baggage, dissolution into mist. The cost is felt in his translucent hands and abandoned spellbooks. Though the figure delivers insight, Elias’s agency drives the climax—his choice to drink and later plant the light.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—understanding why the lamps matter—intensifies through the key tag and book, culminating in the revelation of inherited vows. The tightening occurs when Elias chooses to descend into the *Marigold*, narrowing his path from ritual observer to active participant. Cost is felt in his lifelong ignorance and the surrender of the key, though the woman’s sudden authority slightly softens the protagonist’s sole agency. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with each image reweighting the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reconciling purpose in a reversed universe—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes the prophecy is backwards. His agency drives escalation: casting lots, reinterpreting coins, choosing to listen rather than decode. Cost is felt in the quieting of his “roaring fire” into embers, a visible forfeiture of old certainty. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure tightens via sensory overload (static crescendo) culminating in Charged Poise—fist closed around coins, ready to listen.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—naming the nameless—is signaled early (“to give names to nameless fears”) and tightens when sea monsters stir under his palm, demanding immediate action. Escalation is protagonist-driven: replaying recordings → touching light → whispering names. Each choice narrows options (once named, monsters bow, still, dissolve); cost is felt in “shards of glass” carried in his chest. The final silence isn’t victory but earned quiet—a resonant reconfiguration under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—mending cosmic imbalance through ritual attention—is signaled early and deepens via Elias’s shift from seeking perfection (“perfect rhythm”) to accepting broken resonance (“rebuilding wasn’t about perfection”). Agency manifests in renunciation: he abandons fire-magic norms for water-based patience, paying the cost of prolonged futility. The escalation is textural, not causal: each drip tightens focus until the bell’s raw ring reweights absence as presence. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the fish return only because Elias’s flawed act creates space for possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—confronting vs. burying collective memory—is signaled early and tightens decisively at the distillery table. Elias’s agency drives escalation: each photograph is sought, not stumbled upon. The deepening (father’s hidden love) forces a moral trade-off: town’s “healing” vs. truth’s pain. Cost is palpable in his physical reaction and implied social fallout. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; choice does.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—harmonizing logic and intuition—is signaled early and deepens when Liora admits some things can’t be measured. The meaningful tightening occurs when she kneels to bury the crystal, foreclosing her old path of control. Cost is felt (abandoning lifelong methodology) but slightly abstract; lacks concrete tactical consequence beyond internal stance. Agency drives escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming self-trust through survival—is signaled early and deepens when the branch snaps, forcing Elias to rely on his makeshift system. This tightening forecloses retreat and demands endurance with visible cost (suspended mid-air, breath shallow). Agency is maintained throughout: he revises his plan, tests materials, and chooses to keep climbing despite terror. The escalation is driven by protagonist action under situational pressure, not coincidence, and the price—physical vulnerability, psychological weight—is unmistakable in the harness bite and trembling grip.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—defeating emotional numbness—is signaled early and deepens when Kael realizes numbness isn’t the enemy but the canvas. The tightening occurs when Veyra forces him to fight, foreclosing passive despair. Protagonist agency drives escalation: his clumsy, need-driven attack cracks the void. Cost is felt in the burned sword arm and shattered pretense (“I’m broken”), though the war “below” remains abstract. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; all pressure stems from Kael’s choices under Veyra’s crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—protecting fragile innovation—is signaled early and deepens with each box. Lena’s agency drives escalation: she plants, waits, redesigns, moves the pot. The note “They will try to take it” raises personal and conceptual stakes. Cost is felt in lost peace, resurfaced trauma, and tactical shifts. Coincidence (courier appearances) complicates but doesn’t resolve; climax hinges on Lena’s preparedness. Tightening occurs at the seventh night, foreclosing passive observation.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—restoring lost laughter—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s escalating commitment: from unseen conductor to witnessed presence. Pressure tightens when the girl appears, forcing him to sustain the song despite failing fuel—a visible cost (yanking the cord harder). The stakes shift from abstract tending to direct witness, raising emotional risk. Agency is clear: Elias chooses to continue, and that choice enables the mother’s laugh. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the household’s response is earned by his persistent, imperfect offering.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—resolving existential homesickness—is signaled early and tightens when the guardian declares the pendant “not yours,” forcing Mara to confront borrowed purpose. The deepening occurs at the blank book: writing what she fears becomes a live test of agency. Cost is visible (pendant’s sharpness, loss of waiting as identity), though escalation leans more on revelation than active choice. Under Accumulative lens, this suffices, but protagonist agency slightly recedes during the guardian’s exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—transcending alchemical failure—is signaled early and deepens when Elias reinterprets his mentor’s cryptic gift. The tightening occurs at “the penny dropped”: he shifts from refining to destroying, narrowing options to one violent path. Cost is unmistakable: twenty years of work, the crozier’s legacy, and his identity as a perfectionist are sacrificed in the explosions. Agency drives escalation—his deliberate mixing of reagents, refusal to duck—and the final shard embodies irreversible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—finding the origin—is signaled early and deepens when Mira realizes beginnings are “endings in disguise.” The meaningful tightening occurs when she shifts from searching signals to listening to silence, a tactical pivot driven by agency. Cost is unmistakable: the city falls, and she vanishes. Pressure escalates coherently under the Accumulative lens, with lunar perigee acting as both timer and amplifier, though the antagonist remains abstract, limiting interpersonal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preventing the ferry’s dissolution by guiding lost echoes home—is signaled early and tightens when commuters appear. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he interprets the radio’s warning, trusts the hourglass’s hum over tech, and speaks directly to the echoes. Cost is visible in the ferry’s groaning timbers and the irreversible departure of the commuters—once merged, they’re gone. Coincidence (radio message) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from Elias’s attuned listening.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—discovering authentic connection—is signaled early and deepens when the thread begins rewriting reality. Escalation is driven by Elias’s agency: he touches the thread, follows its lead, steps through the mirror, and enters the door. Each choice narrows options (gallery becomes dream-space) and incurs cost (eroded memories, lost footing). The tightening is meaningful: rational enchantment gives way to surrender, and the final image crystallizes stakes without resolving them neatly. Coincidence never solves; the thread’s power is activated by Elias’s touch.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—whether the deep can reach the stars—is signaled early and tightens when Lirien risks ridicule to pursue alien knowledge. The meaningful deepening occurs when she deciphers stellar trajectories as language, narrowing options from imitation to innovation. Cost is visible: social skepticism, nights in lethal cold, and the implicit loss of Veyth’s insular identity. Agency drives escalation; coincidence (the descending ship) complicates but doesn’t resolve—Lirien *interprets* its path, earning the insight.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—protecting those who “hear too much”—tightens when Elias warns “they’re coming for the new ones,” forcing Lena to choose between retreat or pursuit. Her agency drives escalation: each pulse tracked via the hearing aid narrows options until she runs into the mist. Cost is visible in her physical vulnerability (cold seeping bones, frantic heartbeat) and implied forfeiture of safety. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the dead’s call is a constant pressure she leans into.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—returning the codex to restore the lost—is signaled early and tightens as the tide rises and the path fades. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses descent despite terror, interprets the codex, and steps through the wall. The phase transition deepens stakes by revealing the researchers aren’t dead but trapped, raising the moral cost of inaction. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; pressure crystallizes his stance.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—Elias’s need to reconcile borrowed time—is signaled early and deepens when the ghost reframes his failures as negative space rather than sum. The tightening occurs at “Defragment… Like a life,” which narrows his options from self-flagellation to acceptance. Cost is felt in the abandonment of the death certificate as talisman, though it’s implied rather than dramatized. Escalation is driven by reflection, but stays anchored in present stimuli (the screen, the shard).

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving language as sensation—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes she’s “conducting,” not just listening. Agency is clear: her humming and guidance actively shape the echoes. Cost is felt (trembling hands, canyon’s new silence) and narrows future options—she now bears the vessel, altering her role forever. Escalation is driven by her precise, pattern-based intervention, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—surviving the strange without losing oneself—is signaled early and tightens when the arrowhead warms and the phone rings. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to listen, defying Maren’s warning, which directly triggers his metamorphosis. Cost is unmistakable: his body becomes translucent, foreclosing his human identity. The “harmony untamed” isn’t just ambiance—it’s the rule-set that makes transformation inevitable once engaged.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving beauty against mechanized oblivion—is signaled early and deepens when Liora realizes beauty must be seized, not coaxed. The tightening occurs when she abandons maintenance for rebellion, narrowing her options: no return to the bridge. Cost is felt in bone-jarring impact and perpetual pursuit, though escalation leans slightly on coincidence (child appearing exactly there). Protagonist agency drives every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—carrying what cannot be delivered—is signaled early and deepens when Mira’s drop forces Jace to choose action over passive custodianship. The tightening occurs when he tucks the storm into his bag alongside letters, merging personal relic with communal burden. Cost is felt but not over-explained: the weight “pressing against his ribs” becomes literal and moral. Agency is quiet but decisive—renunciation as resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether silence can birth meaning—is signaled early and deepens when Elias’s hum awakens the halo fragment. Escalation is driven by his agency: singing isn’t passive reception but an act that forces the world to respond. The cost is legible in the final image: he trades the safety of solitude for the vulnerability of creation, embodied in his laughter swallowed by crowd-noise. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens—each sensory layer (bells, mist, light) tightens until the carousel’s spin becomes inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding where stories live—is signaled early and deepens when the scarf becomes a key. Pressure escalates not through external threat but through accumulated textual weight: each sensory cue tightens the pull toward the threshold. Elias’s agency drives the turn—he chooses to drape the scarf, to follow its vibration. Cost is felt in the irreversible knowledge: he now knows stories are alive, and the woman was lost within them. Coincidence (her forgetting the scarf) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Elias’s action does.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—capturing a runaway dream—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s shift from passive dreaming to active creation (painting, then photography). Each method narrows options: paint fades, so he seeks permanence in photos. The tightening occurs when the clear photograph validates shared longing, forcing physical pursuit. Cost is felt in the open-ended arrival—connection is possible but not guaranteed. Coincidence (abandoned palette) complicates but doesn’t resolve; agency drives escalation. Slight deduction: dream’s rules remain vague, softening pressure’s edge.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—freeing a truth too dangerous to speak—is signaled early and deepens when revealed as collective historical guilt. The locksmith’s agency drives escalation: he doesn’t just open but *interprets*, choosing to return the braid rather than speak himself. Cost is legible in Elara’s clenched hands and months of silence. However, the pressure tightens more through atmosphere than tactical narrowing—still sufficient under Accumulative lens, but not causal-grade intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—recovering stolen memories—is signaled early and tightens decisively when star patterns reveal the ring as celestial map, narrowing Elias’s options to one desperate return. Protagonist agency drives escalation: his detection of stellar gaps (not coincidence) forces the final confrontation. Cost is unmistakable: Liora’s hollow return and abrupt vanishing exact emotional and existential toll. The deepening—from curiosity to grief-stricken urgency—alters tactics without soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—whether resilience can be quietly mentored without repeating past failure—is signaled early and tightens when Mira asks to walk backward, forcing Elara to choose between protective isolation and vulnerable teaching. The meaningful deepening occurs when Elara hands over the teacup, narrowing options: she either re-engages with mentorship or confirms her exile. Cost is felt in her “combative tenderness” and the unresolved fear that this act won’t “undo her own exile.” Escalation stems from protagonist agency under Accumulative pressure, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder—is signaled early and deepens when the seed pulses and echoes appear, narrowing options to ritual song. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each hum intensifies the air’s hum, culminating in visible cost (Maren’s trembling). The tightening (planting + singing) forecloses passive loss, and agency drives escalation—luck complicates (miraculous preservation) but doesn’t resolve. Coincidence never solves; every turn stems from Maren’s choices.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—freeing grounded spirits—is signaled early and escalates through each unraveled knot. Agency is clear: Elias chooses exhumation over preservation. Pressure coheres under causal lens, though the Fisher King’s late entrance risks convenience; his warning deepens moral ambiguity rather than resolving it. Cost is unmistakable in the mask’s violent unraveling.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to silenced grief—is signaled early and tightens when Elias chooses to reopen the chapel despite social risk. The escalation is driven by his agency: comparing footage, interpreting symbols, forcing the door. Cost is felt in the suffocating silence and the visceral shock of the shoe. While pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens, the tightening lacks a second tactical consequence beyond emotional revelation—still sufficient for this length, but not quite 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding disappearance—is signaled early and deepens when Liora’s notes reveal “letting go of matter itself.” The tightening occurs when Elias realizes the globe is a key, not a souvenir, forcing a trade-off: preserve evidence or honor Liora’s intent. His agency drives escalation—he chooses to shatter it—and the cost (loss of historical truth) is felt in the silver plume carried away. Coincidence (finding the globe) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from his renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—articulating unspoken needs—is signaled early (“silence… hummed”) and tightens when Elias decodes the graffiti. His agency drives escalation: playing the lute transforms ghostly shimmer into solidity. The lightning-thunder timeframe imposes real pressure, narrowing options to a single musical act. Cost is visible: emotional exhaustion (“eyes stung”), irrevocable expenditure of song, and acceptance that some ghosts can only be briefly made whole.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—access to hidden truth—is signaled early and tightens when the cipher resolves into intimate grief. Lira’s agency drives escalation: she seeks, decodes, hesitates, and chooses to withdraw. The cost is felt (emotional weight of intrusion, relinquished knowledge) and shapes the ending. While pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens, the tightening hinges slightly on coincidence (diary slipped under door), though it’s mitigated by Lira’s active decoding.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—proving empty spaces remember—is signaled early and deepens when the sky shifts from witness to accomplice. The Astraea sighting escalates pressure by forcing confrontation with the past, narrowing options to observe or join. Cost is felt: abandoning his life’s work (cloud categorization) to leap. However, the tightening relies more on revelation than protagonist-driven agency—the telescope shows him the ship; he doesn’t earn the vision through action, slightly weakening escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—possessing vs. revering the sky—is signaled early and deepens when the sketch’s perfection forces Liora to confront her own artistic limits. The tightening occurs at the safe: taking it would betray everything her work stands for. Agency is clear in her deliberate refusal, which forecloses ownership with emotional cost. The condemned building’s countdown applies external pressure, but the true conflict is internal, escalating through tactile engagement with the sketch until renunciation becomes the only coherent act.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—earning the cartographer’s sigil—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes discovery requires interpreting hidden systems, not just recording landmasses. The tightening occurs when he chooses to act on intuition (copying the pattern), narrowing his path from obedient apprentice to co-navigator. Cost is visible: he risks ridicule or dismissal, though the story wisely avoids melodrama. Agency drives escalation; coincidence (starlings) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the lantern only works because Elias prepared the key.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—mending broken mechanisms to restore time—is signaled early and tightens when Elias enters the hall of mirrors, foreclosing avoidance. The deepening occurs when he sees the clockmaker’s entrapment, raising the cost from personal failure to cosmic responsibility. Pressure escalates through protagonist agency: each gear placement is a deliberate act under the Accumulative lens. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; insight emerges from pattern recognition within established rules.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—orchard survival through changed human behavior—is signaled early and tightens via Liora’s escalating messages. The meaningful deepening occurs when villagers shift from passive recipients (“murmuring”) to active participants (ringing the bell, repairing wings). Cost is legible: Liora’s fading form embodies the price of success. Agency lies in collective micro-choices (sharing fruit, listening to arches), not luck—coincidence never resolves core conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—extending the moment before apocalypse—is signaled early and deepens when Elias chooses to soothe rather than save. The tightening occurs in his shift from mechanical delay (gears, hands) to emotional transmission (lullaby through glass), narrowing options to one irreversible act. Cost is unmistakable: he surrenders his life’s work, accepts futility, and stakes everything on a whisper. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves tension.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—balance lives per the curse—is signaled early and deepens when Mira realizes indirect guidance suffices. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she decodes the nut’s map, scatters them, and refrains from direct aid. Cost is felt (guilt, isolation) and visible in her frozen stillness post-rescue. Mechanical birds and frost create coherent external pressure, though the blueprint’s sudden utility slightly softens the tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reconciling control with connection—is signaled early and deepens when Lina realizes nature thrives in impermanence. The meaningful tightening occurs at the riverbank: her decision to design adaptive polymers forecloses her old paradigm of rigidity. Cost is felt (abandoning years of work) and visible (scribbling new equations). Though no external antagonist exists, internal pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, and the stakes remain viscerally tied to her identity and relationships.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—finding where stories begin—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes it’s not a place but a moment of potential. The woman’s arrival tightens pressure: her purchase forces Elias to relinquish the only unpriced item, costing him certainty. Agency is subtle but present—he chooses to accept the sigh-coin, enabling the key’s manifestation. Cost is unmistakable: the warm coin cools, his name fades, and the library holds its breath, foreclosing his original quest while opening narrative possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—whether grief consumes or is carried—is signaled early and deepens when Maren touches Kael and absorbs his daughter’s drowning. The tightening occurs in her choice to grasp his hand despite the pain, narrowing her options to shared burden or retreat. Cost is felt in the “syrup-thick” remorse coating her tongue and the lightening of her own memories afterward. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, though the pressure shift leans more on emotional density than tactical narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—transforming isolation into shared voice—is signaled early and deepens via Mara’s multilingual invitation, which narrows options: success requires actual turnout, not just mechanical repair. Escalation is driven by her agency (posting posters, pulling the cord), and cost is felt in the workers’ “hesitant” arrival and the implied labor of sustained community-building (“work not finished, but begun”). Yet pressure lacks true opposition; no one resists, complicating the “rehabilitation” claim with unrealized risk.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether to modify or preserve abandoned dreams—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the mirror reveals the scientist’s face. Lena’s agency drives escalation: her choice to press the mirror to the wall triggers the vision, forcing the climactic renunciation. Cost is unmistakable—the cold weight of inherited grief in her satchel—and forecloses her initial impulse to “reshape the past.” Coincidence never resolves; pressure accumulates through her own synaptic method.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost historical equations—is signaled early and tightens when threshold effects invert gravity, narrowing Elara’s window to act. Her agency drives escalation: she steps through the mist, triggering symbol shifts and the book’s revelation. Cost is felt in the grotto’s groan and fading symbols, foreclosing prolonged access. However, the “seeds of vigilance” remain abstract; they don’t concretely alter tactics beyond passive recognition, slightly softening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—creating music in a silent world—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes the sculpture’s cracks are “channels, not flaws.” His agency drives escalation: he doesn’t just listen; he intervenes, wedging the insulator and adjusting pressure. Cost is felt: the melody is “raw, uneven,” a voice remembering how to sing—implying years of failed attempts. Slight deduction: the hedgehog’s uncurling as a time marker doesn’t actively tighten decisions; it’s atmospheric rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the covenant before the celestial phase—tightens when the stones glow, forcing immediate interpretation. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his note-taking and star-chart recall directly enable revelation. Cost is felt in his irreversible commitment to stay, foreclosing courtly rehabilitation. Coincidence introduces Lysara, but she complicates rather than resolves; the real turn comes from their combined attention.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recovering truth through empathetic listening—is signaled early and deepens when Liora appears, shifting from mechanical unlocking to emotional attunement. The tightening occurs when fireworks threaten to drown out subtlety, raising urgency. Cost is felt: Elias forgoes confrontation for understanding, accepting silence as communion. Agency drives escalation—his tuning choices directly enable the climax—but Liora’s arrival borders on coincidence, slightly softening causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—cultivating serenity within motion—is signaled early and deepens when Nara delivers the grandmother’s journal, forcing Mira to confront generational failure. The tightening isn’t external conflict but internal recalibration: bloom obsession shifts to patient tending. Cost is felt (years of labor, potential madness averted) though not dramatized as loss; escalation relies on revelation rather than physical pressure, slightly limiting visceral stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—finding the source of resilience—is signaled early and deepens when Lira realizes it’s memory, not place. The gravity inversion provides coherent, escalating pressure that narrows options (only water flow is reliable). Agency is expressed through endurance: staying as the world turns inside out. Cost is felt in the shattering apples of past inversions and the quiet forfeiture of control. One tightening—arrival at the glowing grove—forecloses escape and forces confrontation with legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the port’s transformation—is signaled early and deepens via Elias’s escalating observations (wind patterns → thermal anomaly → organic groan). The tightening occurs when the city begins adapting faster than he can navigate, foreclosing escape. Cost is visible in his trapped state and implied in the broader threat (“before the city’s new logic spread”). However, the escalation leans slightly more on environmental pressure than protagonist-driven agency, capping full 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—releasing wonder before sculptor finishes—is signaled early and tightens with each chisel strike that shatters color-notes. Escalation is driven by Eira’s agency: she chooses increasingly larger bells despite rising risk. Cost is visible in trembling hands and fractured hues; the third strike nearly breaks her. Though the sculptor remains off-stage, pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each interruption deepens the fragility of silence.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—mending the tear before “the other side bled through”—tightens when Elias realizes sealing is wrong; weaving becomes the only viable path. This deepening narrows options and carries conceptual cost: accepting interdependence over control. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency (choosing to step through, then play a melody), not coincidence. The flute’s warmth-to-pain arc externalizes rising stakes with tactile urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—mapping emotion mathematically—is signaled early and tightens when the halo fragment activates, dissolving borrowed identities and forcing Elias into raw solitude. Escalation is driven by his agency: he touches the fragment, sets predatory equations, borrows the visitor’s voice. Cost is felt in unraveling selves and the workshop’s tremor; the woman’s warning (“you might be the last”) raises stakes without resolving via coincidence. Final poise crystallizes under coherent pressure: universe’s indifference versus human yearning.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—delivering the unnamed relic—deepens into carrying wonder itself, tightening when the stranger reveals the pendant seeks to “germinate.” Protagonist agency drives escalation: she chooses to trust the vibrations, then steps forward after the stranger dissolves. Cost is felt—the pendant’s magic exhausts, her mentor’s fate remains unresolved—but the relic lightens, implying purpose fulfilled. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure grows via sensory density, not causal turns, and the final stance crystallizes without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—proving objects absorb emotion—is signaled early and deepens into a need for communion. Pressure escalates through sensory accumulation: frost reveals a face, quartz pulses, memory surfaces. Elias’s renunciation of “proof” for “communion” forecloses intellectual certainty at a cost (numb fingers, vanished patterns). Though no external antagonist exists, internal conflict between belief and doubt tightens coherently under the Accumulative lens, with each revelation narrowing his epistemological options.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—resisting total erasure by answering a call from the past—is signaled early and tightens when the bead hums, forcing action. Elara’s journey forecloses her life in the orchard (visible cost: abandoned loom, forgotten shawl). Escalation is driven by her agency: she interprets the puzzle, chooses to step forward, and completes the ritual at Kael’s skeleton. Coincidence delivers the message, but resolution hinges on her sustained will under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (saving orchards via sealing mines) tightens when Elias realizes brute force won’t work, forcing reliance on the silk—a meaningful deepening. Agency is clear: his deliberate choices drive escalation. Cost is felt (physical toll, isolation), though the “leaching” threat lacks on-page demonstration beyond assertion. Coincidence (magician’s gift) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the silk’s use is earned by his study and resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—discovering the weight of a withheld multiversal truth—is signaled early and deepens when the doppelgänger reveals the gate’s purpose. Pressure tightens via protagonist agency: Kael’s scanner use triggers the spike; his decision to press the shard activates the vision. Cost is unmistakable—the risk of unraveling reality—and reweights the final choice. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the other Kael complicates but doesn’t solve, preserving earned escalation under the Hybrid lens.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving safety in the face of loss—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes safety isn’t passive but must be “bottled like fireflies.” His agency drives escalation: choosing to reply with stones transforms passive receipt into active communion. Cost is legible in the sea glass left behind and the emotional risk of hope after years of isolation. Under the Accumulative lens, the deepening isn’t causal but textural—the weight of accumulated messages forces a stance shift.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—shaping a new dawn using ancient shadows—is signaled early and tightens when the accidental prophecy reveals the ink-stained woman, forcing Veyra to actively “steer” the light rather than merely tend it. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her laughter unlocks the vision, her palm press warps it, her angle adjustment sharpens it. Cost is legible in her breath catching, her mirrored gesture—a surrender to destiny that forecloses passive guardianship. Under the Accumulative lens, this single deepening suffices, though a second pressure point might have pushed it to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding why some lives shimmer—is signaled early and deepens when the storyteller arrives. The tightening occurs in the balcony scene: dreams fade but become mist, just as the donor’s life persists invisibly in him. Agency lies in attention, not action; his choice to *see* differently forecloses the path of replication. Cost is felt as quiet surrender, not dramatized loss, but legible under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—measuring and bearing sorrow—is signaled early (“quantified sorrow”) and deepens when the sextant transforms into an earth-map, shifting Elias’s role from mapper to memorializer. The meaningful tightening occurs when sensation returns to his hand: a physical restoration that demands emotional responsibility. Cost is legible—Elias accepts perpetual witness—but agency remains internal (attention, endurance), consistent with the Accumulative lens. No coincidence resolves conflict; the pin’s mystery lingers, preserving tension.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restoring hope by reviving forgotten songs—is signaled early and deepens when Elara learns dawns wither without melody. The meaningful tightening occurs when she must sing despite fear of forgetting, narrowing options from passive seeking to vulnerable action. Cost is felt: her trembling voice, the people’s gaunt faces, the fragility of the first dawn. Escalation is protagonist-driven under an Accumulative lens—pressure grows through sensory and textual layering, not external opposition—and the communal singing crystallizes stance with undeniable emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—wisdom vs. regret—is signaled early and deepens when the invitation reframes truth as located in abandonment, not pursuit. The tightening occurs at midnight: time forces a binary (hide or act). Elias’s agency drives escalation; his past renunciation now demands reversal. Cost is felt—not just opportunity lost, but moral debt recalled—and shapes his final move. Coincidence (finding the note) complicates but doesn’t resolve; he chooses.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving memory against collective forgetting—is signaled early and tightens when Elias realizes he alone recalls the bakery. His agency drives escalation: carrying the bread, seeking the tea house, planting seeds. Cost is felt (isolation, grief) but slightly abstract; the “price” of guerrilla gardening isn’t dramatized beyond gesture. Still, pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving meaning against oblivion—is signaled early and deepens when the slide reveals a personal vow. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he samples frequencies, adjusts focus, locks settings. The tightening occurs when the illusion weakens and he must act to stabilize it, foreclosing passive observation. Cost is felt (emotional weight of inherited memory) but could be more physically or temporally concrete; the threat of the library’s collapse remains atmospheric rather than mechanically urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving the “truce of hush”—is signaled early and tightens when false starts escalate to a knife at a throat. Lena’s agency drives the turn: she steps forward, deploys the fob, and invokes her father’s wisdom. Cost is felt: she doesn’t stop betrayal, only delays it, accepting impermanence as victory. Slight deduction: the resolution hinges on name recognition, which borders on coincidental, though mitigated by world logic (tight-knit underworld).

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding why some carry weather—is signaled early and deepens when the compass points to a person, not a place. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she descends, follows, confronts. The cost is legible in her breath hitching, pulse quickening—emotional exposure replacing detached observation. Yet the man’s arrival borders on convenient; his knowledge feels granted rather than earned, slightly softening the pressure’s organic growth.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—answering the inescapable calling—is signaled early and deepens when the dream reveals the painted door. Elias’s agency drives escalation: sketching the lock, finding the painting, peeling it away. The tightening forecloses his prior path of passive remembrance; opening the lock demands active faith. Cost is legible in the shift from drawing ghosts to stepping into light—a renunciation of control for mystery. Coincidence (finding the painting behind his sketches) complicates but doesn’t resolve; his muscle-memory dial-turn earns the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—truth versus erasure—is signaled early via the forged certificate refusal and deepens when the map reveals the Echo Vault. Pressure tightens once: reconstructing the map forces Liora from studio safety into public risk. Cost is visible in her trembling hands and the city’s decay, but the escalation leans slightly on coincidence (finding both fragment and map under same floorboard). Still, agency drives every turn, and the final descent crystallizes stance: she chooses truth over comfort.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder as a language—is signaled early and deepens when the iceberg melts, forcing Elias to seek the glass orb. This tightening forecloses passive endurance; he must actively scavenge and destroy to sustain resonance. Cost is felt in the irreversible breaking of the child’s toy and his own approaching muteness. Though coincidence delivers the iceberg, Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to break the orb, transforming scarcity into song.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—containing inner static to preserve order—tightens decisively when magnetic shifts escalate, forcing Eli to choose between dome survival or self-liberation. His agency drives escalation: opening the box isn’t passive acceptance but active release. Cost is unmistakable: “the roses were gone,” dome cracking, yet peace replaces static. Coincidence (magnetic shifts) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Eli’s choice crystallizes under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether lost connection can be healed through silent witness—is signaled early and deepens via neighborhood fragments. Pressure tightens when Elara hears the mailbox click, forcing a choice: approach or wait. The cost is emotional labor and deferred closure, visible in her stillness. Coincidence (Clara’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the resolution stems from Elara’s endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—liberating truth—is signaled early and deepens via the dice-journal-dance triad. Pressure escalates texturally: each roll narrows possibility until coordinates emerge, forcing Elara to choose between drowning in secrets or diving deeper. The cost is felt in Kael’s dissolution and the rising water—time is literalized as structural collapse. Agency drives escalation: she rolls, interprets, pries open. No coincidence resolves; the lab yields only what her method unlocks.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—recovering his sister through echoes of memory—is signaled early and deepens via the journal’s revelation that the whale is a vessel. The tightening occurs when Marlowe chooses to exhume the journal, narrowing options from passive remembrance to active descent. Cost is legible: he drops the wildflowers (symbolic surrender of static mementos) and steps into gravitational pull. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, though the whale’s role borders on coincidental without clearer prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—releasing a coded prophecy—is signaled early and tightens when the summoner realizes it’s “a wound,” not a warning. The meaningful deepening occurs at the brook: unfolding the wing becomes an act of surrender, narrowing options from deciphering to dissolving. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence intervenes. Cost is unmistakable: the loss of meaning itself, paid when ink bleeds into water. Under an Accumulative lens, this reweighting of silence over code suffices for high-band pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—protecting vs. sharing Veyra’s legacy—is signaled early and tightens when Mira reveals her identity, forcing Elara to choose trust. Escalation is protagonist-driven: Elara’s decision to show the seal invites the reversal. Cost is felt in shattered solitude and inherited responsibility. Coincidence (meteor shower) complicates but doesn’t resolve; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—freeing Liora’s archived consciousness—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes the quarantine targeted her discovery. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: his archival work and nightly visits culminate in tracing resonance structures, which directly summons Liora. The cost is conceptual (surrendering self-imposed isolation) and felt in his trembling fingers and tightened throat. Coincidence is avoided; the garden’s altered hum arises from established rules (resonance structures), not external intervention.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. sanctioned lies—is signaled early and tightens when Vey arrives, forcing Lian’s choice between destruction and release. The deepening occurs when she redefines her goal (“to forgive the unfinished”), narrowing options from vengeance to legacy. Cost is felt in her abandonment of lifelong identity as forger-avenger. Slight deduction: Vey’s immediate stasis after the scroll reveal lacks tactical escalation—he doesn’t reach, lie, or flee, making his defeat feel slightly passive under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—understanding why some people echo—is signaled early and deepens when Veyan reveals echoes are “fragments” of those who spoke uncontainable truths. The tightening occurs when the shell halves reunite, foreclosing the path of solitary inquiry and forcing collaborative action. Cost is visible: Liora surrenders her singular voice to amplify others’. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency—she follows vibrations, presses shell to ear—and aligns with Accumulative lens through intensifying sensory and conceptual density.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—salvaging truth from wreckage—is signaled early and deepens when Mara learns the wreck was sabotage, not accident. Her agency drives escalation: she tracks descendants, interprets dreams, and confronts the quartermaster. The meaningful tightening occurs when she realizes the dead “wanted silence,” foreclosing her path. Cost is felt in her silent departure, though the final confrontation leans slightly toward revelation over tangible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding meaning in overlooked beauty—is signaled early and deepens when Mei arrives, transforming abstract appreciation into relational vulnerability. The tightening occurs in Ren’s shift from passive observation (“preferred solitude”) to active invitation (“Stay”), foreclosing his prior path with felt cost. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: Mei’s arrival complicates but doesn’t resolve; Ren’s choice crystallizes under pressure. Coincidence (whistle) introduces tension but resolution stems from character, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—exposing the truth about the stillpoint—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes the liquidation was a cover-up. Pressure escalates causally: shredded letters → assembled warning → armed confrontation → collaborative revelation. The meaningful tightening occurs when Elias chooses to trust the stranger, narrowing his path from solo debunker to co-conspirator. Cost is felt in the worn respirator, numb fingers, and implied risk—but could be sharper in physical or social terms at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—shaping the new dawn—is signaled early and tightens when the radio declares “You were meant to lead them.” Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to descend, confront, and invoke ancient shadows. Cost is felt (thirty years of solitude) but not visibly paid *in the moment*; the crowd’s wavering allegiance implies future peril rather than immediate loss, slightly softening the price.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving what time erases—is signaled early and deepens when Elias shifts from passive listening to active capturing. The meaningful tightening occurs on the third night: success with the jar transforms hope into purpose. Agency drives escalation; the girl’s arrival tests his renunciation of invisibility, forcing him to articulate his work (“translating what gets left behind”). Cost is felt: years of being unheard crystallize in his wistful smile—validation comes not from townsfolk but a child, making his endurance newly legible but still solitary.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—protecting the key from misuse—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes the scavenger’s method risks destabilizing the ice. The meaningful tightening occurs when he chooses to amplify the lighthouse hum, accepting shared peril. Cost is felt: near-fall, exposure of personal guilt, and irreversible engagement with the artifact. Escalation is protagonist-driven under a Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—patience vs. urgency in revolution—is signaled early and deepens when the viaduct pulses, forcing Elias from observer to participant. The tightening occurs when he chooses not to draw his knife, accepting vulnerability as tactic. Cost is legible: solitude is foreclosed, replaced by alliance. Escalation is driven by environmental pressure rather than protagonist agency alone, slightly softening the causal edge but fitting the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—exposing Voss’s engineered disasters—is signaled early and tightens at the door: hearing Voss’s plan transforms suspicion into certainty. Elias’s agency drives escalation: lock-picking (learned from a past case), sending evidence, then returning armed with light. Cost is felt—personal risk, moral burden—but could be sharper; the “machines” remain vague, slightly softening the threat’s texture. Still, pressure coheres under Causal lens with one meaningful deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—moral accountability for wrongful execution—is signaled early and deepens when Kael confirms the heart was post-mortem, validating Hargrove’s innocence. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he seeks Kael not for repair but proof, transforming passive guilt into active restitution. The cost—loss of priestly infallibility and lifelong belief in second chances—is felt in his shaky exhale and crystallized in his resolve. Coincidence never resolves; truth emerges through deliberate inquiry.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—completing the bell before workshop death—is signaled early and deepens when acid rises and gears halt, narrowing options to a single frantic window. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his transliteration method and gearwork are active choices, not passive waiting. Cost is unmistakable: workshop’s imminent dissolution, inherited trauma, and physical toll (raw fingers). Coincidence complicates (storm-lodged arrow) but doesn’t resolve; the echo is earned by the bell’s design.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—uncovering Project Echo’s erasure—is signaled early and deepens when Elias’s video confirms existential deletion. Lena’s agency drives escalation: her lie enables access, her digging reveals patterns, her final act forecloses safety. Cost is felt in the irreversible commitment to resistance. Pressure coheres under a Causal lens, though the “numbers everywhere” verge on coincidence without clearer mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—saving the village from the ice-borne creature—is signaled early and tightens when the child’s reflection reveals urgency. Elias’s agency drives escalation: each mirror press yields new knowledge that narrows options, culminating in the throw. Cost is visible: his shadows recede, implying expended inner reserves. However, the creature’s defeat hinges on a single intuitive act with minimal tactical buildup, slightly softening the pressure curve required for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—learning “the sound of endings”—tightens when Elias realizes it resides not in ice but human breath, forcing a trade-off: remain detached or engage. His decision to stay forecloses tourism with visible cost (identity shift). Pressure escalates via embodied stakes (frostbitten fingers, shallow breaths), not coincidence. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether to trust a returned love—is signaled early and tightens when the bus departs, foreclosing escape. Liora’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to stay, to confront, to offer the letter. The cost is visible in her “raw” admission and years of solitude. However, Elias’s arrival edges toward coincidence; his change of heart is declared more than dramatized in-scene, slightly weakening causal pressure under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving wisdom’s echo—is signaled early and deepens when the prophet warns “some wisdom is a lie dressed in truth,” forcing the walker to discern authenticity. The meaningful tightening occurs when the golden thread appears: honesty sustains it, doubt purifies it. Agency lies in attention and acceptance, not action, fitting the Situational/Accumulative hybrid lens. Cost is felt (tremor, vulnerability) but could be more concretely tied to a forfeited alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—transmuting collective pain into honest art—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s arrangement of photos. The meaningful tightening occurs when he places his own photograph at the center, shifting from curator to participant. Cost is felt: his solitude, his deferred life. Yet escalation relies on introspection rather than external pressure or irreversible action, limiting the visceral intensity expected at the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—proving the crystal encodes a pattern of remembered growth—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s escalating vocal experiments. Agency is clear: his whispers and hums drive the intensification, forcing the library (and reality) to respond. The cost is conceptual: he must abandon botany’s mutation model for a mythic, acoustic ecology. Though stakes remain intellectual, the closing “promise” implies future burden—testimony will demand public vulnerability, foreclosing his cherished solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—capturing the sound of growing older—is signaled early and deepens through the protagonist’s agency: his method (driftwood spiral) is his only tether against dissolution. The tightening occurs when the woman demands completion before handing over the tape, forcing a trade-off between impatience and ritual. Cost is unmistakable: the realization that memory is cyclical, not linear, and that each return exacts emotional toll. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from his choices under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—capturing the fleeting vision—is signaled early and tightens when Elias replaces the shutter with the clock hand, foreclosing conventional photography. Escalation is driven by his agency under Accumulative pressure: each tool interaction deepens commitment. Cost is felt in the observatory’s collapse and his evacuation, though the “foundations shake” timeframe could more actively narrow options rather than merely accompany them.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—executing a “flawless goodbye”—is signaled early and deepens when Lena specifies “hymn the mundane,” raising emotional precision as the bar. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his choice to sing ordinary images, not grand elegies, honors her request and narrows the path to authenticity. Cost is felt in his restrained performance and the irreversible act of accepting her death. One tightening suffices at this length, though the pressure remains gentle rather than harrowing—fitting for tone, but slightly limiting intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding where shadows go—is signaled early and deepens when Liora realizes it’s about relearning their nature. Pressure escalates via the journal, the key, and the descent, culminating in the guardian’s demand to “close the loop.” The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to descend, insert the key, and turn it in air. Cost is felt in reclaimed shadows and dissolved guardian, though the price of awakening remains conceptually implied rather than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—restoring wholeness to a fractured myth—is signaled early and deepens through Lena’s bone-setting ritual, which narrows options from passive doubt to active reconciliation. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: finding the second tooth, placing them on stone, following the map. Cost is unmistakable: the town’s ignorance is preserved at the price of public truth, and Lena shoulders sole witness. Coincidence (finding the garden) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from her choice to believe and act.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—sharing light without burning—is signaled early and deepens when Liora recalls her winter failure. The tightening occurs at the pearl: stillness replaces fire as method, narrowing options from active creation to reflective endurance. Cost is felt—she abandons the desire to “bring the sky down” forcefully—and visible in her lighter heart. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (choosing to seek, touch, emerge) under an Accumulative lens, with no coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming silenced grief—is signaled early and deepened when Elias proffers his notebook, forcing Mira to confront being seen. The tightening forecloses avoidance: her admission “You’ve been watching me” shifts from accusation to invitation. Protagonist agency drives escalation; cost is felt in trembling fingers and withheld voicemails. Coincidence never resolves—only shared vulnerability does.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—giving shape to fleeting hopes—is signaled early and deepens through each cameo, culminating in confrontation with his own unrealized protagonist. Pressure tightens as the river pulls harder and figures vanish faster, forcing Elias’s final decision to turn back. Agency is clear: he chooses witness over possession, accepting that hope must pass through him. Cost is felt in the lost kite, dissolving man, and unfinished novel—each a forfeited certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring balance through forgotten songs—is signaled early and tightens when the tendril demands action. Liora’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to hum *The Weaver’s Lament*, triggering the climax. Cost is felt in her cracked voice and societal dismissal, now transformed into communal possibility. Coincidence (harvest moon) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the song is her earned remedy.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving impermanence—is signaled early and deepens when Elias distinguishes the plate’s “pause” from his usual heartbeat-maps. The escalation is protagonist-driven: arranging detritus → tracing negative space → folding origami jar → igniting it. Cost is legible in the final beat: he abandons his life’s work (burning memories) for stillness, paid for by decades of ash. Under the Accumulative lens, the cadence shift at ignition (“glowed—not with fire, but with… radiance”) reweights the entire endeavor with earned sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—capturing wonder before winter’s silence—is signaled early and tightens when Elias risks using quartz to force motion, triggering the apparition. His agency drives escalation: months of study → new attempt → adjustment of quartz → recognition → release. Cost is conceptual but palpable: he abandons his preservationist impulse, accepting impermanence. Coincidence (wind whisper) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the ghost’s arrival stems from his precise action.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding the weight of unmade choices—is signaled early and tightens through three escalating burdens, each narrowing emotional options. Agency is clear: Liora chooses to ignite the flame, orient her body, and endure. Cost is unmistakable: near-petrification, physical pain, and the grotto’s structural strain. The final deepening—silence becoming song—reweights the entire premise without resolving it neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—whether to engage grief through creation—is signaled early and deepens when Elara chooses to carve. The tightening occurs in her shift from avoidance (“outrun the grief”) to containment, culminating in the physical act that forecloses passivity. Cost is felt in the “hesitant” first cut and the acknowledgment that meaning isn’t demanded. Escalation is protagonist-driven under an Accumulative lens, though the pressure curve is subtle rather than sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—negotiating with one’s past self—is signaled early and deepens when the ghost emerges, forcing a choice between clinging to relics or releasing them. The tightening occurs at the water’s edge: dipping her fingers constitutes agency that narrows options (no more avoidance). Cost is felt in the loss of the camera wheel and the admission “I thought I had time.” While escalation is subtle, it’s coherent under an Accumulative lens; however, the ghost’s appearance leans slightly on setting-convenience rather than strictly protagonist-driven causality.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—deciphering stalled purpose—tightens when Mara shifts from assessment to participation. The escalation is driven by her agency: following water, entering the greenhouse, offering the sextant. Cost is felt: she trades objectivity for involvement, risking professional irrelevance for emotional truth. The “redirected flows” method isn’t coincidence—it’s the discovered logic of survival, making the stakes tactile rather than abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—making peace with an abandoned dream—is signaled early via the forecourt memory and intensifies when the girl’s broken music box mirrors his own lost artifact. The meaningful deepening occurs when repair work triggers memory, narrowing his options from avoidance to engagement. The bear’s appearance functions as externalized pressure that crystallizes his internal shift. Cost is felt in the irreversible return to pain, though the escalation leans slightly on coincidence (bear as deus ex machina), preventing a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the architecture of lies—tightens when the mirror reveals the seeker himself as both subject and object of deception. The meaningful deepening occurs when the sundial points toward the reflection, forcing a reconfiguration of his method and goal. Agency is maintained throughout: his training leads him to board, his choice to “salvage” opens the crate, and his recognition crystallizes the climax. Cost is felt in lost time and misdirected life energy.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving vanishing knowledge—is signaled early and tightens when the rope reveals the Weeping Shoals, transforming archival work into threshold-crossing. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his decoding forces deeper engagement, narrowing options to either pursue the Shoals or let wisdom die. Cost is felt in physical endurance (kneeling in snow) and conceptual urgency (“the world was forgetting”). Coincidence (finding fulgurite) complicates but doesn’t resolve; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens with one decisive deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—making absence legible in a lying court—is signaled early and deepens when Lena plants the thread, foreclosing escape into detachment. Agency manifests as endurance: she chooses continued witnessing despite emotional depletion. Pressure tightens via the court’s denial (queen’s trembling hands) and Lena’s own hollowness, raising the cost of her vocation. Escalation is protagonist-driven, though the single tightening (thread burial) borders on solitary; a second pressure point would elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming lost beauty—is signaled early and tightens when machinery fails, forcing Kaelen to choose vulnerability over control. The third-night attempt deepens stakes: failure yields not despair but insight (“flaw in his genesis”). Cost is visible in abandoned tools and emotional exposure (weeping). Escalation is protagonist-driven; coincidence never resolves. One tightening suffices for this length, though the shift from assembly to remembrance could be slightly more pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—proving scars can sing—is signaled early and deepens when the girl appears, forcing Lena from private ritual to vulnerable mentorship. The tightening occurs in her renunciation of solitude: “I’ll show you how to listen to the scars.” Cost is felt in the lingering siren, the unextinguished past. Agency is clear, though escalation leans on dialogue rather than physical pressure; still, under an Accumulative lens, the cadence shift suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—liberating trapped memories—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes her own avoidance has been the lock. The tightening occurs at the fountain confrontation: her grandmother indicts her fear, raising emotional cost before the physical act of turning the key. Agency is clear—Elara chooses to descend—but the escalation leans slightly on revelation over action; the ghost’s arrival borders on convenient, though it’s mitigated by prior dream-whispers. Cost is felt in Elara’s tremor and the irreversible step forward.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transmitting light without fire to break generational violence—is signaled early and deepens when Kael’s scarred ship appears, forcing Elias to act despite familial opposition. The meaningful tightening occurs when Elias presses the gear into the console, accelerating sonar into a heartbeat that disarms Kael’s weapons. Cost is legible: Elias risks alienation (Kael’s accusation) and legacy (abandoning ancestral methods). Though coincidence doesn’t resolve conflict, escalation relies slightly more on atmospheric response than protagonist-driven causality, preventing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—discovering grief’s shape—is signaled early and deepens through protagonist agency: Elias chooses to follow the ribbon, wait, return. The tightening occurs when the father’s poem reframes grief as “a bridge,” narrowing options from solitary mourning to communal witness. Cost is felt: he relinquishes private sorrow for public vulnerability. Coincidence (butterflies) complicates but doesn’t resolve; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring balance through shared burden—is signaled early and deepens when the pendulum’s pause reveals incomplete absolution. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he retrieves the rake handle, climbs the ridge, and presses names into the bob. Cost is unmistakable: each inscription transfer trembles the pendulum, culminating in physical and emotional release. Coincidence never resolves; tension tightens via Accumulative pressure under the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—deciphering lingering human intentions—is signaled early and deepens through each thread color. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: Elias chooses to follow blue, then red, then gold, each narrowing his understanding. The cost is conceptual but legible: he confronts his own isolation. Coincidence (finding the case) complicates but doesn’t resolve; decoding is active, not passive.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reigniting scholarly innovation—is signaled early and deepens when Elara chooses to write a fluid, participatory future rather than a fixed one. Escalation occurs through her agency: each stroke narrows possibilities into a specific vision, raising the cost of failure (irrelevance). The tightening is meaningful: she trades control for collaboration. Though stakes remain intellectual, the cost—her vulnerability in offering an unguarded invitation—is felt in the wet ink and open-ended conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—restoring stories in a silent world—is signaled early and deepens when the song reveals dust as story-remnants. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he tunes, listens, gathers, hums, and witnesses the dust speak. The tightening occurs when lyrics shift from passive reception (“tell the dust”) to active creation (“spin them to gold”). Cost is felt (years of obscurity, brittle laughter) but remains conceptual; no concrete forfeiture (time, safety, tool) alters tactics mid-beat.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—crystallizing a fleeting emotion—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes his mother was fleeing, not capturing, that feeling. The mask’s appearance escalates pressure through protagonist agency: he chooses to wear it, triggering the vision that reframes everything. Cost is unmistakable: he forfeits his life’s project (completing the portrait) and accepts complicity in the family’s emotional dishonesty. Coincidence (the mask appearing) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the real turn comes from Elias’s decision to engage with it.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the plague’s true cause—is signaled early and deepens through the cog’s “sedimentary timeline,” narrowing options from passive study to active dissemination. The meaningful tightening occurs when Elias realizes scholars will “bury” his findings, forcing him to pivot to dockworkers—a credible trade-off sacrificing academic validation for grassroots resonance. Cost is legible: he abandons his sanctuary, risking exposure and futility. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence intervenes. Slight deduction: the shift from research to action happens narratively rather than through a dramatized crisis beat.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—braiding voices into harmony—is signaled early and deepens via Miss Voss’s method (“subtract the noise”). Agency is clear: she chooses the zither, ignores slights, persists through cracks. The tightening (rehearsals 3→5→7) narrows relational options until Maren/Liora’s hand-brush becomes inevitable. Cost is felt (emotional labor, years of hope deferred) but not fully dramatized as a trade-off; the story implies stamina loss without showing tactical adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—rewriting traumatic memory through the knowledge fruit—is signaled early and deepens when the fruit doesn’t just restore but *transforms* pain, raising the cost from personal retrieval to ethical responsibility. Mara’s agency drives escalation: her pruning enables growth, her infusion of memories shapes the fruit’s properties, her bite triggers the climax. The celestial clock tightens options (“only chance”), though its resolution feels slightly convenient; however, since alignment merely initiates growth (not success), coincidence complicates but doesn’t resolve. Cost is unmistakable: the healed memory is fleeting, leaving her gasping—peace is temporary, work remains.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving the city’s capacity for wonder via the drone beehives—is signaled early and tightens when the blackout reveals sabotage. Pressure escalates causally: discovery of the riddle → revelation of hive sabotage → need to enter forbidden tower. Elias’s agency drives the climax (he strikes the match), and the cost—violating sacred space—is felt in his hesitation and the story’s hushed tone. Coincidence (Maren’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve; she enables but doesn’t perform the decisive act.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—Elias’s need to sanctify/understand animate houses—is signaled early and tightens when the shard pauses rather than purifies. The deepening (houses listen to themselves) changes knowledge and narrows future options: he can no longer treat them as external mysteries. Cost is felt in the house’s altered resumption and Elias’s burden of insight. Escalation stems from protagonist agency, though the pressure peak leans slightly more on revelation than tactical trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the garden’s secret—tightens decisively when the diver learns the truth is containment, not cure. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses to insert the ampoule despite knowing the risk. Cost is legible in the final image: she’s no longer a restorer but a releaser. Pressure remains coherent under the Causal lens, though the statue’s omniscience slightly softens oppositional friction.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—rupturing infinity to grasp lost possibility—is signaled early and deepens when the dice roll fails to stop the cycle but alters it. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his theory leads to action, which produces consequence. The cost is felt in the staircase’s reconfiguration, foreclosing his original goal while opening a new path. However, the tightening isn’t as sharp as it could be; the transition from rupture attempt to acceptance occurs swiftly, slightly softening the trade-off’s weight.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving kindness in a forgetting world—is signaled early and tightens when she chooses to paint strangers’ faces despite exhaustion. The escalation is protagonist-driven: her methodical hope forecloses rest but opens connection. Cost is legible in her ink-smudged fingers and forfeited sleep, though the stakes remain internal/conceptual rather than viscerally tested by external opposition. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—rescuing dying arts—is signaled early and deepens when Liora realizes memory requires embodiment (“weight,” not just “shape”). The bakery scene tightens pressure: baking becomes a test of cultural fidelity with tangible risk (failure = continued silence). Bees’ return hinges on protagonist agency, not coincidence. Yet cost remains conceptual; no resource, relationship, or opportunity is visibly lost, softening escalation’s bite under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transcending fate via temporal manipulation—is signaled early and tightens when the yoyo rises instead of falling. Elias’s agency drives escalation: reverse-engineering, testing, then initiating the ritual. Cost is felt: the drowned voices, erased names, and irreversible rewinding. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening (the yoyo’s ascent) suffices; pressure coheres without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming selfhood from fear’s distortion—is signaled early and tightens when the reflection attacks. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses curiosity over flight, then touch over recoil. Cost is felt in lingering luminance, sweat, breath fogging glass, and ultimate relinquishment of talismans. One meaningful deepening (dream dictionary revelation) shifts tactics credibly under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—transforming omens into collaboration—is signaled early and tightens when clouds shift from warning to “collaborators.” Leeward’s agency drives escalation: each dub raises resonance, culminating in the crack that spins the raft. Cost is felt—years of solitary interpretation abandoned for vulnerable co-creation. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: chaos folds into rhythm via protagonist’s precise taps.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—access beyond the gate—is signaled early and deepens when the crack reveals the transformed expedition. Mira’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to widen the fracture, enter the dark, and flee with new understanding. The cost is conceptual and felt: the watchers’ true purpose reframes her life’s work, foreclosing naive inquiry. Pressure tightens via Accumulative lens—density of spirals, silence, and stillness culminates in revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes tighten decisively when Liora appears: Elias must choose between archival integrity and historical mercy. His agency drives escalation—he doesn’t wait for rescue or luck—and the cost (eroding trust in records vs. stripping descendants of heroism) is viscerally articulated. The moral calculus sharpens the peak choice without false balance; both options carry irreversible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—saving meaning from oblivion—is signaled early and tightens with each note, narrowing options to increasingly perilous placements. Escalation is driven by Elias’s agency: he chooses to respond, to go deeper, to use the last ink. Cost is unmistakable: physical exposure, emotional vulnerability, and the irreversible expenditure of the inkwell’s contents. The drawbridge’s timed descent adds external pressure that crystallizes his stance without resolving via coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the stamp’s origin—deepens into ancestral identity, narrowing options when the ledger forces recognition. The tightening is protagonist-driven: Elias’s persistent searching yields the Magister Veyne entry, which reweights all prior effort. Cost is felt in the irreversible shift from seeker to heir, though the blackout’s role as active pressure (vs. atmospheric) slightly limits escalation intensity. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; discovery emerges from methodical work.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—controlling grief through crafted dreams—is signaled early and tightens when Veyra realizes the lanterns feed the sorrow. The escalation is protagonist-driven: her choice to keep harvesting despite priestly warnings culminates in the lantern’s rupture. Cost is unmistakable: the dream invades her body, whispering her brother’s name before consuming her. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure builds via textual density, not causality, satisfying Track A expectations.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding where unused potential pools—is signaled early and deepens when the geode manifests grief as the scientist, transforming abstract hunger into concrete revelation: “It’s not just energy—it’s choice.” This tightening narrows Lena’s path: she can’t unsee that potential requires agency, not just retrieval. Pressure escalates via protagonist-driven action (activating the geode, demanding “Show me”) under Accumulative logic, with cost visible in her seared skin and rebooting alarms. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; the ghost appears because she summons it—agency intact.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—decoding belonging—is signaled early and deepens when revealed as “frequency,” not location. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: Elias actively pilots the drone, adjusts trajectory, and ultimately powers it down to step into the unknown. Cost is legible: he abandons control, routine, and solitude. Coincidence (the pilgrim’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the breakthrough comes from his choice to trust the signal. One meaningful tightening suffices—and here, it forecloses his old life.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—uncovering Liora’s fate—is signaled early and tightens when the carved symbol appears, narrowing options to confrontation and action. Protagonist agency drives escalation: he sifts wood, recognizes the symbol, chooses to break the watch. Cost is felt in the “numb” acceptance of truth’s pain. Coincidence (uncle’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the key enables, not solves.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—peace through fragile exchange—is signaled early and tightened by the moon-phase timing, which narrows the window for betrayal. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chose this spot, synchronized movements, carries proof. The cost is visible in emotional endurance (not acting on friendship or escape) and physical tokens that grow heavier. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; tension resolves through mutual restraint, with the waning crescent “like a blade” underscoring ever-present risk.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—escaping inherited expectations—is signaled early and tightens when the compass proves useless, forcing Elias to choose between clinging or letting go. The deepening occurs when he realizes utility poles, not stars, are his only guides, narrowing his options to self-reliance or surrender. Cost is felt in the weight of the compass and the ache in his shoulders; however, escalation relies more on reflection than external pressure, slightly muting tactical urgency under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—whether Elias can face what he’s done—is signaled early and deepens in the mirror chamber, where seeing his lost empathy narrows his options to either look or flee. The cost is felt: trembling hands, the weight of betrayal, the irreversible knowledge. Agency is maintained throughout; even his silence is a pressured choice. The tightening occurs when the baseball grows warm—a physical cue that raises the emotional price of avoidance.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reforging love beyond death—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency: Liora chooses to conjure, grinds spices, endures painful metamorphosis. The “reluctant” transformation deepens stakes by forcing trade-off: accept him as bird or lose him entirely. Cost is unmistakable in her tears and trembling, and the phoenix’s flickering form narrows options to one irreversible choice. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost time—is signaled early and deepens when she realizes some debts “could not be repaid, only carried.” Escalation occurs through her agency: tracing the crack leads to buried memory, which forces renunciation (Earned Stasis). Cost is unmistakable: the child will never know this moment, and she accepts enduring sorrow. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure tightens via textural density (ink, cloth, porcelain) rather than external opposition, fulfilling the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—opening the locked dimension through shadow work—tightens via each photograph, narrowing options until only self-annihilation as “the wound” remains. Agency is clear: Liora chooses to stitch, to carry weight, to become conduit. Escalation is protagonist-driven under Accumulative lens; cost (emptied locket, vanished ship, solitude) is unmistakable in the final float. Coincidence never resolves—only her labor opens the gash.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—saving others despite personal depletion—is signaled early and tightens when prophecy forces public action. The detour deepens pressure by introducing supernatural expectation that contradicts Elias’s self-concept (“I’m no one”). His agency drives escalation: he runs, choosing visibility over quiet charity. Cost is unmistakable: the lightning bug’s light extinguishes as he accepts necessity, symbolizing the end of private rebellion.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preventing the governor’s conflagration—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Mira reads the parchment. Her agency drives escalation: interpreting sundial angles, waiting out the aide, extracting the message, lighting the torch. Cost is visible: she risks execution, yet chooses indirect action, accepting she won’t witness the uprising. Slight deduction: the aide’s insertion feels slightly coincidental, though it complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—mending unraveling patterns—is signaled early (“friction vanished”) and tightens when eels return with the shard. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his precise placements activate the constellation. Cost is felt (the lifted chest-weight) but slightly understated; the world’s restoration lacks tangible sacrifice beyond effort. Still, pressure coheres under Accumulative lens with one decisive deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding scars as cartography—is signaled early and deepens when the photograph reveals deliberate patterns. The meaningful tightening occurs at the lightning flash: knowledge shifts from ambiguity to recognition, foreclosing interpretation-as-wound and forcing acceptance-as-map. Cost is felt in Elias’s swallowed laugh and the weight of the envelope as “second heartbeat.” Agency lies in attention and endurance, not action, consistent with the Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves tension.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—transforming adversarial inquiry into collaborative discovery—is signaled early and deepens when Elias reveals the needle card. Isolde’s lunge (“Why assume the angles are meant to be read?”) forces Elias to expose his study of her, raising emotional cost. Though escalation is elegant, the absence of tangible loss (e.g., broken trust, forfeited advantage) slightly softens the price; the cost remains conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—forging identity through communal beauty—is signaled early and tightens when Lumen inserts the key, foreclosing escape. Pressure escalates via Accumulative lens: each recalled fragment (Elias’s note, protest songs) deepens commitment until rebuilding becomes inevitable. Cost is felt in lost anonymity and the vulnerability of staying put. Coincidence (Elias’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Lumen’s agency drives every meaningful turn.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—escaping grief’s weight through a musical “loophole”—is signaled early and deepens when travelers arrive, raising the stakes from private ritual to public summoning. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his deliberate “clumsiness,” waiting for nightfall, launching the discordant piece. The cost is felt—years of stasis, the risk of failure—and the compass chaos isn’t coincidence but atmospheric pressure that crystallizes his stance. One meaningful tightening suffices, and it’s masterfully executed.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—protecting cultural memory—tightens when Liora learns the island bargained away names for survival, making preservation an act of resistance. The monsoon clock (three days) narrows options, forcing the seed’s planting. Agency is clear: her choice to plant, then to selectively reveal, forecloses passive guardianship. Cost is conceptual (truth vs. cohesion) and felt in her trembling voice, though physical or social consequences remain deferred.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—diffusing the weight of regret—is signaled early and deepens when the lace reveals specific memories (unsent letter, silent classroom). The meaningful tightening occurs when Elias chooses to mend, not cut, foreclosing erasure as an option. Cost is conceptual: he accepts permanent loss but transforms its texture. Escalation is protagonist-driven, though the compass’s magic borders on convenience; however, its rules are established early and paid off, avoiding deus ex machina.
