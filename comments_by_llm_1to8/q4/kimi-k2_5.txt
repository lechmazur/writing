  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: understanding her father's hidden route and her own survival. Pressure accumulates through the search, but escalation is passive—frost reveals, journals explain—rather than protagonist agency narrowing options. The cave discovery is coincidental, and the journals resolve a problem (unknown debt) they did not help create on the page. One tightening occurs (reinterpretation of the ledger), but the cost is retrospective understanding rather than a trade-off or visible sacrifice at closure. No antagonist or reversal; the "attempt" backstory provides context but does not generate on-page opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.6)
    One dominant stake is signaled early: Mara seeks to "rectify the trauma" and prove survival means more than breathing. Pressure tightens through the thermal color progression (crimson grief → teal envy → coral warmth → white-gold resolution), each tuning fork strike narrowing her emotional topography. The final crescendo—"a soundless crescendo that warmed her face like a sun"—reweights her relationship to silence with felt cost (accepting permanent deafness). Agency is present but primarily internal; a physical renunciation or visible tradeoff would strengthen the band.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake signaled early: giving the dead "coordinates that do not shift." Pressure tightens from three-day resistance → widow's walk decision → underwater descent → library recognition → apex climb → lens alignment. The distress signals escalate from throbbing behind eyes to "broadcast across frequencies of forgetting." Agency is clear: Marian's choice to align the shard "that had waited centuries" drives the transformation. The cost—her weariness exchanged for permanent librarian duty—is felt in "finally slept," though the coincidence of the exactly-right breakage lands conveniently.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—community survival under sanctions—is signaled early and tightens through Maya's midnight runs. The child's challenge ("I want to help") forces Maya to weigh anonymity against visibility, a meaningful turn that narrows options and leads to the public declaration. However, the escalation from solitary runs to collective gathering is recounted rather than dramatized; the gathering itself happens off-page in summary ("faces turned upward"), which softens the on-page cost and pressure at the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—"to find where unused love is stored"—is declared but never tested by opposition or consequence. Maya arrives, sees, understands, and releases without a single on-page reversal or tightening that narrows options. The tear melts on contact with no visible cost or trade-off; the structure exhales and heals. Coincidence (the monk's gift, the precise twilight hour) enables rather than complicates, and no agency choice forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake ("to discover the texture of time") is signaled early but never tested by meaningful opposition or tightening. Elias encounters no resistance, failure, or trade-off; the garden accommodates his ambition without cost until the abstract dissolution. The hyperbolic expansion and retrocognitive trap are told conditions rather than obstacles that narrow options. No reversal or deepening alters tactics or knowledge; the ending feels like arrival at a pre-ordained state rather than a turn earned by pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—protecting the seed vault from scavengers—is signaled early and sustains pressure. One meaningful tightening occurs when the mechanism alerts scavengers to her position, forcing the human-barrier confrontation. Elara's agency (positioning herself, holding the arrow as scepter, speaking) forecloses violence with visible cost: permanent entombment below. The scavenger's reversal, however, lacks internal friction; he "understood" too swiftly without a prior beat showing hesitation or conflicting need, which softens the earned quality of the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—capturing the acoustic signature of broken trust—is signaled early and tightens once: Mara moves from collecting external absences to imprinting her own betrayal, then experiences the device's output. Under the Accumulative lens, this single deepening is sufficient. The cost (her imminent death, the final isolation in the greenhouse) is legible on the page. However, the escalation is largely internal and observational; Mara's agency is methodical rather than forced into a trade-off that narrows live options.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake: Elara seeks to collect another illuminated moment and, obliquely, to find her own golden hour. The flower-code setup (jasmine = three minutes) creates mild time pressure, but the customs officer's absence unfolds without friction; she retrieves the portrait unopposed. No on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows her options. The ending reweights her waiting stance conceptually but does not dramatize a trade-off or escalation under pressure. Agency is attention and collection, not a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—crafting safe zones before abandoning the station—is signaled early and held throughout. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens: the melting ice tightens the timeframe, and her act of sealing the bookmark inside the finest sphere functions as a meaningful tightening that forecloses return. However, the cost feels more asserted than dramatized; we're told she "had to abandon" rather than shown a live trade-off that forces her hand. One deepening (the placement of the bookmark) narrows her options, which is sufficient for this length, but the stakes never force a choice that truly tests her stated mission.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (prove identity and autonomy before father returns at dawn) is signaled early. One tightening: decryption unlocks proof and coordinates, footsteps force confrontation. Kai's agency drives the escalation—kneeling to examine the cast, positioning near the weak railing. Cost is present but muted: the father clings in panic, sirens approach, yet Kai's internal foreclosure ("neither original nor manufactured") reads asserted rather than felt as a trade-off. The coincidence of the seashell containing a recording and the cast bearing decryptable coordinates tilts toward convenience; the resolution hinges more on Kai's structural knowledge than a choice that narrows competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—mapping the endless night through silence cataloging—is signaled early and drives the oracle's actions throughout. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure deepens as gold leaf transfers from booklet to her body, culminating in the booklet's emptiness and her realization that she has become the map. However, the escalation is primarily textural; no live option is foreclosed with felt cost, and the oracle's agency never faces a trade-off or renunciation—she simply completes what she set out to do without complication or price.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: to understand why Seven failed before (signaled early via the Second Chance Program terms). One tightening occurs when Seven plays the violin and the loops amalgamate, narrowing the janitorial task into philosophical revelation. The escalation is driven by Seven's agency (touching the violin, choosing to play), but the cost of this choice is not legible—no live option is foreclosed, no tactical price paid. The resolution (resuming sweeping with new insight) reads as earned understanding but lacks visible sacrifice or consequence that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.2)
    One dominant stake (whether to expose the hidden surveillance and complicity) is signaled early and tightens once: Mara's discovery of the tickets forces a choice between continued silence and transparency. The confession in the forecourt narrows options and forecloses mutual suspicion with visible cost (Julian's shoulders drop, Mara will file the report). Agency is present in Mara's decision to extend the tickets "not as accusation, but as offering." The lens (Accumulative/Textural) supports the escalation—pressure builds through layered reveals rather than causal reversals. However, the highest-stakes action (filing the report, telling the board) is deferred to "tomorrow," muting the on-page cost slightly. No antagonist is required, and coincidence does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake: proving the garden's consciousness through ritual maintenance. The piece signals this early and sustains thematic coherence, but pressure does not escalate through a meaningful tightening or choice that narrows options. Elara's actions (polishing, placing marbles) proceed without resistance or reversal; the ivy "shivering" and the garden "exhaling" feel like cooperative responses rather than friction. No on-page cost or trade-off is legible—ritual success arrives without sacrifice or foreclosed alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.6)
    One dominant stake—proving sideways time—is signaled early and sustained. The lever-pull tightens options by activating the nexus, and the data-stream confirmation narrows Kael's uncertainty. Yet the escalation lacks felt cost: no resource is spent, no relationship strained, no alternate path visibly foreclosed. The resolution depends on Kael's agency (initiating the sequence), but Dr. Vex's entrance deflates tension rather than forcing a harder choice.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—completing Vane's interrupted composition—is signaled early and maintained. One meaningful tightening: discovering the stains are deliberate language, then positioning lanterns to reveal shadow instructions. Her agency (playing the implied melody) drives the climax, and the water's six-inch recession offers visible payoff. The cost is the program's dissolution and the ghost's departure. Weakness: no live complication threatens her attempt; the collaboration proceeds smoothly once she commits, reducing tension. A single reversal or obstacle would elevate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—measuring and confronting the damage her fever-distorted reports caused—is signaled early and tightens through the discovery of prior anomalies she had dismissed. The escalation operates through accumulative deepening: personal error → systemic complicity → climate catastrophe acknowledgment. Agency is present in her final act of centering the illustration, a renunciation of margin-dwelling that forecloses her prior coping method with visible cost (she must now "see it"). The cost is conceptual and relational (complicity in warming-trend concealment) and legible in the final beat. One meaningful pressure point is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (finding the weight of swallowed truth) is signaled in the opening paragraph and tightens through the journey: Elias's confession → radio interpretation → physical search → beaded wheel discovery → photographic documentation → final understanding. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mara counts sixteen distinct colors and feels "the weight of the swallowed truth settle into her sternum like a stone dropped in still water"—the abstract measurement becomes visceral. Agency is decision and attention: she moves deeper despite Elias remaining behind, interprets radio calls as data, reaches out to appraise the artifact, photographs it, and accepts the burden of witness. Cost is visible: she understands "the exact tonnage" and carries no comfort, only the necessity of bearing truth about impossible choices. The escalation is accumulative under the chosen lens, with each beat narrowing understanding and raising emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—witnessing transformation—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or a tightening that narrows options. The journey proceeds without reversal, complication, or a moment where the chronicle keeper must choose between competing goods or pay a visible price. Coincidence does not resolve because nothing is at risk to begin with. The piece lacks the one meaningful tightening or deepening required at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: breaking through Milo's traumatic silence. Pressure accumulates through the eclipse's approach, temperature drop, and Elara's calculated risk of using celestial timing. One meaningful tightening occurs when totality creates the safety pocket and Milo begins to play. The cost is legible—eight months of silence, the choice to work away from crowds, the vulnerability of the shared moment. However, the therapeutic success feels more atmospheric than hard-fought; Elara never faces a moment where her method might fail or where she must choose between competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—collecting stories before they vanish—is signaled early and coherent. Elara's discovery of the tapestry and matching it to diary descriptions constitutes one meaningful tightening that deepens her understanding. Yet the escalation lacks a visible cost: she works "through the night" without fatigue, error, or trade-off affecting her tactics, and no live option is foreclosed by her choice to transcribe and read aloud. The final act feels like fulfillment rather than a decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—Elias's desire to escape isolation by "transposing life into a new key"—is signaled early but never meaningfully tightened under pressure. No reversal or complication forces him to trade one goal for another; the stranger's arrival and the final departure feel preordained rather than earned by protagonist agency. The spycraft microdot work and the stranger's recognition create texture but do not escalate stakes or narrow options. Coincidence (the stranger arrives; the boat departs) resolves rather than complicates, violating the lens requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—prevent possession completion—is signaled early and the ticking clock (minutes remaining) creates urgency. Elian's actions (triggering loops, tracing the gray line, deploying rhetorical questions) ostensibly escalate, but each layer feels additive rather than causally tightening; no live option is foreclosed on the page until the entity simply capitulates. The entity's voice shifting from certainty to uncertainty suggests a reversal, yet the cost to Elian is invisible—no stamina drain, no sacrifice, no tactical trade-off. The resolution hinges on philosophical assertion rather than protagonist agency forcing a price.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—Elias seeking to "conduct unheard symphonies"—is signaled early but remains abstract and undergoes no meaningful tightening or trade-off. No reversal or complication narrows his options; dawn simply arrives and he enacts his metaphorical conducting without visible cost or resistance. The protagonist's agency at closure is gestural rather than consequential; no path is foreclosed, no price paid. Escalation is asserted through intensifying language rather than pressure that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"conquer the labyrinth of self"—is declared but never tested by an on-page reversal or tightening that narrows options. Elara moves forward and the runes generate steps, yet no pressure forces a trade-off or sacrifice; the resolution (acceptance, unity) is summarized without agency or visible cost. Escalation is absent under any lens; the tablet's destruction and tattoo transfer happen to her rather than through her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: Can Elara find a way to teach/feel music again? The stake is signaled early and tightens when the backward songs "reveal an architecture of anticipation" that she can perceive through touch. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes her numbness was "a refusal to feel vibrations...below the threshold of panic and pain." The final image shows her learning "the courage to let the world's quietest frequencies enthrall her shattered heart," foreclosing her prior withdrawal with felt cost. Escalation under Accumulative lens is adequate but not urgent; pressure accumulates more through revelation than protagonist-driven tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—whether to continue storm recording under surveillance while the quarantine fails—is signaled early and tightens when the pigeon reveals her mentor's survival and invitation. The story delivers one meaningful deepening: her realization shifts from personal safety concern to collaborative truth-preservation with visible cost (accepting perpetual surveillance, nurturing dangerous solitude). However, escalation is primarily cognitive and conceptual; no on-page confrontation or physical sacrifice dramatizes the price. Her agency is decision and endurance (writing the coordinates, opening the window), which fits Accumulative mode but lacks visceral stakes testing.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering time's texture, choosing memory or future—is signaled early and coheres through the piece. Pressure deepens via the poet's meditation on the impossible choice, and the final act (refusing both doors, speaking verses) narrows options with conceptual cost. However, the tightening is primarily reflective rather than driven by protagonist action under escalating external pressure, placing this in the mid-7 range. The accumulative lens allows for deepening rather than causal reversal, and the closure forecloses linear choice with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—unbinding the chronic hush—is signaled early and pursued through escalating acoustic pressure: Mara kindles fire, creates a drum chamber, plays resonant frequencies, releases compressed memories, until the hush "cracked like thin ice." The escalation is Accumulative/Textural: density increases as the bowl hums, shipwrecks whisper back, vibrations accumulate. Agency is present in her deliberate choices (gathering, kindling, placing, playing), though the final transformation feels more like a natural acoustic phenomenon than a hard-won personal cost. One meaningful tightening occurs when the chronic hush cracks, reweighting the sonic environment. The cost is conceptual—she honors the fragment rather than seeking completion—but could be more viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: the client needs empathy before transformation completes. One meaningful tightening occurs when the counterfeit emotion unexpectedly becomes real through grotto resonance. The reversal is driven by the environment rather than Kael's agency, weakening protagonist pressure. The timeframe ("minutes," "dusk," "by morning") creates urgency but does not visibly alter tactics or force a trade-off on the page. Cost is present (Kael's half-truth model questioned) but remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt. The escalation fits the Hybrid lens but lacks a protagonist-driven decision that forecloses a live option with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—Elias's desire to uplift silent contributors—is signaled but never tested on the page. No reversal or tightening occurs; the story moves linearly from discovery to decision without opposition or cost. The final act (initiating the grant) is recounted as fait accompli rather than dramatized under pressure. Agency is assertion, not choice with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—connection versus isolation—is signaled early. The shared search for glyphs provides one tightening: solitary inhabitants converge into a group. Yet the mute artist's reveal does not narrow Kael's options or force a trade-off; discovery and bridge-building proceed frictionlessly. No on-page reversal or visible price (time, stamina, relational cost) alters later tactics. The bridge solves the isolation without dramatized cost, undercutting escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: find the echo's birthplace before the nap ends. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara sculpts the bridge and the "interrupted cadence" shudders through the canals, making the temporal debt visceral and raising the cost. The giant waking three minutes early is a visible price, though the escalation feels more like a series of ornate tasks (drifting, sculpting, releasing) than choices that narrow options under competing pressures. Agency reads as execution of a known plan rather than a decision forced by conflicting goods or unavoidable harms.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding his sister's disappearance and his own grief—is signaled early. However, no on-page reversal or tightening occurs; Elian performs his ritual without obstacles, and the "proof" he seeks materializes through passive observation of a water droplet rather than through agency or choice. The piece deepens thematically but does not escalate pressure or narrow options. No trade-off or visible cost is dramatized; the resolution is delivered as summary insight rather than a decision that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—Maya's desire to become visible through her gifts—is signaled early and remains coherent. The piece accumulates pressure through her methodical retrieval and distribution, but no on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows options; Maya executes her plan without complication or cost. The power outage timeframe is invoked but never constrains her work or forces adaptation. Escalation under the Accumulative lens requires a density increase or cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost; here the final paragraph reconfigures "visibility" conceptually but without a felt price or foreclosed path. Band guardrails: entering 8.0+ typically requires a tightening that forecloses a live option; this piece trends mid-band because the plan unfolds without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—whether to preserve through control or through surrender—is signaled early and tightens once when Maren decides to dismantle the climate controls. The tightening is meaningful but arrives through realization rather than external pressure testing her resolve. The bindweed and moss provide observational deepening, yet no concrete obstacle (failed specimen, storm damage to a key plant, a competing approach) forces a harder trade-off. The cost is legible (abandoning fifteen years of methodology) but not tested on the page after the decision is made.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: Elara's need to find meaning and preserve witness in a drowned world. The exchange tightens when she relinquishes the amber brooch (static preservation) for the journals (another's witness), forecloses the path of holding onto stasis, and accepts her role as active archivist. The trade-off is visible: amber versus paper, preservation versus continuation. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (she arranged the meeting, chose to descend, made the exchange) and the cost—losing the brooch, accepting endless vigil—is unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Elara's role as clairvoyant when foresight fails—is signaled early and tightens when the pilgrim's request triggers "something ancient and restless." However, escalation under the Accumulative lens arrives primarily as atmospheric density rather than a choice that narrows Elara's options. The pilgrim's transformation happens to her, not through Elara's agency. The final realization shifts Elara's stance, but the on-page cost (liberating rather than shaming) reads more as relief than trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: to compile fragments into meaning and resist collective forgetting. The woman's arrival introduces one meaningful complication—Kael must choose whether to keep the valve or return it—and his decision to give it away reweights his archival mission from preservation to connection. The tightening is modest but legible: the valve moves from artifact to relational anchor. Cost is visible in the woman's grief acknowledgment ("It heartens me to know he tried"), though Kael's own price—letting go of a key piece—could be sharpened on the page. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—finding her sister's explanation—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates through symbolic density (cracks → punch → train) rather than through reversals or escalating cost. The single tightening occurs when the punch validates the ticket, but this moment is unopposed; no live option is foreclosed. Agency is minimal: Elara follows arrows, then boards a train that has already materialized for her. The resolution (glimpsing the archive) is delivered to her rather than earned by a choice under competing pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to honor science alone or bridge it with mystery—is signaled early and tightens once when Mara discovers the tile and chooses to act on its visions. The renovation work represents agency, but the escalation feels declarative ("she would not dismiss") rather than tested by a second complication or visible trade-off. Whale migration provides atmospheric pressure but does not force a harder choice; the tower transformation proceeds without meaningful resistance or cost that narrows options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering what lies beyond goodbye—is signaled early and sustained. The solar storm peak creates a tightening window, and the amulet's shattering is a reversal, but Kael's agency in that moment reads passive: the fragment releases its curse and space convulses around him rather than through his decision. The epiphany reconfigures his understanding, yet no live option is visibly foreclosed on the page; he decides to "find another to love" without demonstrating what path or security he relinquished to reach that stance.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—securing her father's asylum—is signaled, but no meaningful tightening or on-page choice occurs. Maya observes, waits, and plans, but never faces a live decision that narrows options or incurs visible cost. The story ends on the threshold of action ("the precise moment to begin") rather than a choice that alters the present. Escalation is entirely prospective: she *will* add drops to tea, she *will* breach the server room. Coincidence (guard arriving seven minutes early) is framed as opportunity without dramatized risk or tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving the capacity for human gathering through invented histories—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the lamp's hum dips ("the past was leaking out faster than he could gild it back"), forcing Elias to work faster while maintaining restraint. The final act shows visible cost: he must invent market days and lovers to anchor what never was, a renunciation of literal truth to preserve relational texture. Agency reads as endurance and fabrication rather than decision, which fits the Accumulative lens but limits the visceral charge of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: to discover/reconstruct the texture of erased memories. Pressure accumulates through the collection of fragments, but no on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows live options. The archivist moves through the labyrinth without facing a tested decision where one path must be foreclosed. The ending crystallizes understanding but does not dramatize a trade-off or visible price; the smile and affirmation feel conclusive without sacrifice. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is present (the label's transformation from warning to map), but escalation remains atmospheric rather than choice-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—decoding the universal riddle—is signaled early and sustained. The turn occurs when Elara shifts from myth-buster to myth-participant, but this deepening is more thematic realization than on-page choice that narrows options. The piece offers one meaningful tightening (playing the cello, hearing Mara's farewell), yet the escalation under the Accumulative lens lacks a visible price: Elara places the cello down and walks into fog without forfeiting a concrete alternative or paying a legible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving community bonds through gentrification—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure tightens when the gentrification notices arrive and Maya must finalize her network before the buyout. The juggler's mid-toss recognition and the teenager photographing the tag provide one meaningful escalation as the network activates cell by cell. However, Maya faces no on-page failure or adaptation; the plan works as conceived with no visible friction or trade-off. The corporate boats' arrival at dawn provides external pressure, but Maya's response is a smile of confidence rather than a choice that forecloses an option with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (document pristine crater before corporate destruction) is signaled in the opening paragraph and tightens through the hypothermic vigil: she must outlast darkness to capture the dawn moment or lose the photograph forever. Agency is endurance with visible cost—minus-170° cold, fogging helmet, arms wrapped around coils. The price is legible: she witnesses the end but cannot prevent it, and her chemical message may wait for "hands that might never come." Single meaningful deepening when the drills stir and she realizes documentation only "served to archive extinction."

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—preventing the Vespertine from hitting the reef—is signaled early and sustained by the ship's departure countdown. However, the repair itself proceeds without meaningful reversals or complications; each diagnostic step leads smoothly to the next solution. The time pressure is declared but never forces a difficult trade-off or tactical pivot. The internal stake (penance for her past mistake) runs parallel but doesn't create genuine friction with the external goal. The resolution feels inevitable rather than earned through a choice that narrows options or imposes visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: completing the survey by finding the singular convergence of rivers before the thaw erases it. The falcon's empty-taloned return signals escalation; the condensation pattern deepens his understanding; walking onto the ice tests commitment. Agency is decision and execution (interpreting the pattern, transmitting coordinates) with visible professional cost (staking reputation on a single vent). One meaningful tightening occurs when the mist halo at the depression confirms his calculations. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens, though the protagonist's steady confidence mutes internal conflict and the felt cost at closure is more professional validation than existential trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (restore the city via rhythm) is signaled early and tightens once: the fork shudders, collapse is imminent, she increases pace. Her agency (placing the fork, quickening the dance) drives the turn, though coincidence—detecting dissonance "today"—initiates the escalation. One meaningful deepening narrows options (final collapse vs. restoration), and the cost is legible (seventeen years of solitary walking). No live tradeoff appears on-page; the resolution unfolds without friction or visible loss in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake is clear: locate the signal source before air runs out. The time pressure tightens from forty minutes to "only minutes" but remains largely告示rather than felt in tactics. The climax—drinking the vial, exhaling precious air—should be a brutal trade-off but reads as smooth escalation without visible hesitation or cost in the moment. The temple's automated response (walls shift, passage opens) resolves the trap via mechanism rather than protagonist agency. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elara understands the exit requires overriding instinct, but the execution lacks friction.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dominant stake (escape before discovery) is signaled early and the timeframe tightens to dusk. However, escalation is conceptual rather than enacted: the hover and drift happen without on-page resistance, cost negotiation, or tactical adjustment. The murders are pre-scene; Elias's agency in the escape itself is assertion ("convincing the air") without visible struggle or trade-off. One deepening—realizing his father's mistake was requiring witnesses—but no on-page reversal or tightening that narrows options under live pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—repaying a three-century debt by returning the bead to the earth—is signaled early and drives the ending action. However, escalation is thin: Eira reveals herself, explains the debt, hands Julian the bead, he buries it, and the curse lifts without a second reversal or a moment where Julian must choose between competing goods. The "sudden terrible understanding" accelerates him past genuine resistance, and the resolution (ground shudders, stars appear, greenhouse withers) occurs off his agency rather than through a decision that trades one value for another.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—repairing the canyon to prevent it from becoming "a graveyard of good intentions"—is signaled early, but pressure remains static rather than escalating. Maren sews night after night without encountering meaningful resistance, and the story summarizes her labor ("Night after night, she sewed") instead of dramatizing a tightening that forecloses an option. The final act (placing the plate, driving the stitch) completes her task but does not feel like a choice under pressure; luck and endurance carry the resolution. A single on-page reversal or complication that forces Maren to adapt her tactics would lift this significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—restoring lost faith through reconnecting with ancestral dead—is signaled early and sustained. Escalation occurs via accumulative pressure: each fragment collected deepens the cost (merchant's ledger, child's shoe, rusted compass) and narrows the path toward the final alignment. The sundial reconstruction forces purposeful wandering with visible on-page effort (clearing bone, fitting the base, aligning the gnomon). The resolution is earned by Elara's choices and the final shadow-fall reweights the opening exile, though the lack of a live dilemma or competing want softens the stakes—her curiosity meets no resistance, internal or external.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—decoding and sending the letter before the final drone pickup—is signaled early and tightens as dawn brightens. The escalation follows Accumulative logic: each step (examining envelope, CRT reveal, chalk-code translation) deepens Kael's engagement and narrows time. Agency is clear: Kael chooses to decode, seal, and send, foreclosing the option to withhold or delay. The cost is legible in Kael's acceptance that the chalk masterpiece will erode and the letter will travel "untraceable yet immutable," but the stakes feel more ideological than visceral, limiting high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—preventing the coup while maintaining her cover—is signaled early and tightens when "three days before the coup, the pattern clarified." The captain's arrival is the key reversal, forcing Mira to encode her warning in a way that tests her disguise. However, the resolution feels slightly frictionless: the captain decodes her instantly, and we don't witness a moment where the warning might fail or arrive too late. The cost is conceptual (ongoing fragility) rather than a visible sacrifice on the page, keeping this in the 7.0–7.9 band.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake is clear (to speak the apology before it's too late) and introduced early, but escalation is minimal: Elara's path is cooperative rather than obstructed—spirits offer safe passage, the shard creates a corridor, moonlight heals her wounds. The single tightening is her stepping into the vision and pushing the door open, but this is the act she came to perform; no reversal forces a choice between competing costs. The ending reconfigures emotional weight (words finally spoken), yet the protagonist's agency at closure is smooth execution of her plan rather than a decision under pressure that forecloses an alternate path. No visible price is paid on the page: she weeps in moonlight "healed at last," a resolution without dramatized trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: to graft new meaning onto old wounds by decrypting the cast notes. The piece signals this early and shows one meaningful deepening when Mara recognizes the notes as "collective confession" and "map of trauma." However, no live opposition or reversal tightens her options; she completes the decryption without friction, and the resolution (placing the coral, framing the boy's future) is contemplative rather than a choice under pressure. One tightening meets the 600–800 baseline but lacks the visible trade-off or foreclosed path that would lift it into the 8s.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: rediscovering creative joy, signaled early through "hands empty and heart shuttered." Pressure accumulates through the knowledge network's guidance, the fresco discovery, and the alchemical marriage of light-paint and film. One meaningful deepening occurs when the trees add bioluminescence, transforming Mara's solo act into collaboration. Agency appears in her choice to paint the air and work faster, though the daydream frame and the trees' convenient participation reduce the sense of resistance. The cost—returning to the gray apartment with only a "secret negative"—is conceptual rather than a visible forfeiture that narrows on-page options.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—"exchange certainty for curiosity"—is declared but never tested by a live opposing force or internal cost. No reversal or tightening narrows options; Elena moves from listening to painting without friction, and her epiphanies arrive as gifts rather than earned through struggle. The garden "answers" her silence not with a choice-forcing turn but with "a shift in the pressure of the air." Under the accumulative lens, no deepening reweights the stake with on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—cognitive freedom against thought taxation—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, escalation is weak: the drone's arrival complicates but does not result from Elias's prior tactical choices, and no on-page decision narrows his options before capture. The gourd seed's energy limit imposes a ticking clock, yet this constraint never forces a trade-off or alters tactics mid-scene. Capture arrives as plot convenience rather than earned consequence, and the "smiling" Elias pays no visible emotional or relational price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—Elara's need to transform grief into something enduring—is signaled early and sustained, but escalation is gentle and accretive rather than a tightening that narrows options. The piece offers one meaningful deepening: her realization that she cannot leave leads her to ensconce herself and fully commit to becoming the garden. Cost is present but diffuse—she loses corporeal form, the postcard fades—yet these feel like natural evolutions rather than trades forced by rising pressure. Under the Accumulative lens, the pressure coheres but does not sharpen into a peak choice with visible sacrifice scaled to immediate stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: preserve the names before they dissolve. The discovery of the cracked tube and its use at the atrium constitute one meaningful tightening, but the caretaker never faces a trade-off or genuine obstacle—her choice unfolds without friction. The cost (tube crumbles, light is temporary) is visible but arrives as consequence rather than dilemma. Escalation under the Accumulative lens is present but gentle; no live option is foreclosed by her decision.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (reconciliation before dawn departure) is signaled early and time pressure is explicit. One meaningful tightening occurs: Elara's choice to inscribe seven interconnected promises rather than a single apology escalates from confession to binding vow. However, the cost of failure remains abstract—"paths diverge" is stated but never dramatized as a visceral loss. Julian's acceptance feels frictionless; no moment tests his caution against her exuberance. The final beat shows mutual touch and voices beginning to speak, but the price paid (vulnerability, years of silence) is asserted more than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—preserve ancient safety versus modern output demand—is signaled early and remains coherent. Yet the conflict unfolds almost entirely in retrospective summary: the "supervisors demanded" upgrade exists off-page, the decoding took "seventy-two sleepless hours" in ellipsis, and the final defiance (falsified reports, hidden modifications) occurs without on-page resistance or discovery risk. One meaningful tightening appears (the tremor, the decoded compassion reweighting his role) but escalation relies on assertion rather than dramatized reversals. Agency is present but the visible cost at closure is muted—no confrontation, no immediate trade-off, only stated future consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is clearly survival versus preservation of the songs; secondary accent is trust versus isolation. Pressure tightens when detectives visit below, forcing Elara's choice to send the chip north rather than disappear again—a meaningful on-page deepening that forecloses the perpetual-flight option with visible cost. The escalation under the Accumulative lens is legible: months of dust-mapping preparation converge with the detectives' arrival to crystallize the final decision. The cost is felt (her invented history dissolves, she descends to reveal her true name), though the agency is somewhat passive—she prepares and releases rather than confronts an antagonist directly.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—discovering why thresholds feel sacred versus hollow—is signaled early and coheres through the accumulative lens. Pressure accumulates through spiral grain discovery, logbook alignment, and the final approach to the eastern wall, offering one meaningful deepening when Elara realizes "to become the threshold" herself. However, no prior option is visibly foreclosed; the decision to step through feels thematically inevitable rather than costly, and no tactic shift or trade-off appears on the page. The "necessary distances" concept shapes framing but does not narrow live choices under dramatized constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—chart the alignment before sunrise—is signaled early but never tightens into a felt time pressure; the clock dissolves into "hours dissolved like salt" without tactical consequence. A secondary stake (rhythm of belonging) emerges and eventually dominates, yet the piece does not force a trade-off between celestial charting and connection. The pressure seals groaning offers a brief reversal, but the solution (synchronized breath activating generators) arrives as a late rule without prior setup, and the phantom's loneliness being "acknowledged" does not foreclose a path or extract visible cost from Elara.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—"to discover why some paths disappear"—is declared but never tested by on-page opposition or narrowed options. Elara works "quickly, before memory fades," yet no clock visibly tightens her moves; the seeds dissolve cooperatively. The realization that "missing pieces weren't errors but necessary silences" arrives as epiphany rather than earned reversal. No live trade-off or foreclosed path; she simply continues her work with acceptance, leaving escalation flat.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—Kael's desire to interrupt monotony—is signaled early but never tested. His engineered serendipity unfolds exactly as calculated with zero setbacks, unexpected variables, or adaptation required. The woman's emotional shift is the only visible consequence, yet it happens to her, not through Kael's agency under pressure. No reversal, no tightening of options, no trade-off or visible price paid by the protagonist. The piece declares escalation (tide turning, child's laughter, busker's shift) without dramatizing genuine risk or cost to Kael himself.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake—preserving memory through embodied inscription—is declared but never tested. No obstacle, reversal, or trade-off appears; authorities "would soon sound" alarms but never arrive or complicate her work. The transformation proceeds without friction, cost, or agency. Coincidence does not complicate because nothing complicates at all. The piece offers a single uninterrupted action with no escalation under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias's mundane repairs have constructed meaning—is signaled early and tightens through the stone-casting ritual: he seeks "confirmation" via ripple patterns, then recognizes interference patterns of "joy and regret." The escalation is Accumulative: density increases from observation to recognition ("not meant to solve...but to reveal their prismatic nature"), and the standing waves "complicated the simple radial pattern into something richer and more true" deepen understanding. Agency is present but muted—he chooses to throw the stone and to return to work—yet no live option is visibly foreclosed on the page; the cost is conceptual (accepting ambiguity) rather than a trade-off between competing goods that alters tactics. One meaningful deepening occurs, satisfying the length's requirement, but the final choice feels more like acceptance than a decision that narrows future paths.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake is Maya's need to translate her private failure into communal language, signaled early and sustained. The tightening occurs when she opens the box and speaks Thomas's story to Elias, a choice that narrows her options (she can no longer keep the marble as private penance). The cost is visible: she gives away the marble, descends with the empty box, and her scars ache—physical and relational prices paid on the page. Elias's transformation from paralyzed to "stood straighter" feels slightly rushed, but the pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens as Maya's sharing reweights both their burdens.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—revitalizing failing timelines—is signaled early but never tested. No obstacle resists Elara's decorations; no reversal narrows her options. The trial balloons return with positive data, the patterns work, and the timelines brighten in a smooth accumulation devoid of tightening or cost. The ending presents completion without a visible price paid or a path foreclosed. Under any lens, this lacks the one meaningful escalation required at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding what walls witness and dream—is signaled early and drives each discovery beat. Pressure accumulates through the Accumulative lens: echoes feel heavier → diaries reveal Elias's obsession → vault reference tightens the search → film negative provides the answer. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mara recognizes the terrace and understands the burden of legacy. The cost is conceptual and felt ("burden settled upon her shoulders"), though it remains largely internalized rather than a visible forfeiture or choice that narrows options. Agency is present in the descent, discovery, and acceptance, but the resolution leans toward epiphany rather than a decision that forecloses a live alternative with on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—persuading mirrors to show possibilities—is signaled early and drives action. Pressure tightens once: the borrowed heartbeat begins to falter, forcing Elias to sing faster while maintaining composure, a meaningful escalation under the Accumulative lens. However, agency reads passive; Elias executes a ritual whose outcome feels predetermined rather than forged by on-page choice with competing costs. The resolution (he completes the work, then vanishes) is more endurance than decision, and the cost—loss of heartbeat and dissolution—lands visibly but without prior friction or trade-off that would elevate the band.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake: ending the forever war through ritual binding rather than treaty. The story delivers one meaningful tightening when Elara opens the clipboard to reveal mixed soil instead of contracts, narrowing options from philosophical agreement to biological necessity. The general's skepticism ("You think parchment and poetry can erase what you've done?") and the child's tentative participation create situational pressure, though the delegations' shift from confrontation to compliance occurs off-page. Cost is legible—imperfect peace requiring generational tending, mutual vulnerability—but the escalation compresses into a single ritual beat without visible friction or trade-off that tests Elara's commitment under fire.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving the echo of extinction through burial—is signaled early and drives the ritual. The piece deepens rather than reverses: the manufactured drought exposes the site, the burial completes the transaction, the rains return to seal it. Agency is present in the burial choice and walking away, though the escalation is more textural accumulation than a tightening that forecloses options. The cost is legible (ecological crime, hollow peace) but somewhat abstract; the price feels more conceptual than viscerally paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: unlock the sanctuary and harvest echoes to preserve memory against the Empire's erasure. The piece signals this early and tightens once: Lys must untangle temporal threads (middle beat) to unlock the sanctuary (final beat). Agency is present (her fingers untangle, she steps inside and gathers echoes), and the cost is legible in the final image (secrecy, the snow erasing her footprints, the "thaw that must inevitably come"). However, the escalation is mild—no reversal or complication tests her commitment; the threads resist but she succeeds without visible trade-off or foreclosed option until the very end. The tutor's death and the three-minute window create temporal pressure that is asserted but not dramatized (no clock ticking down, no consequence for running late). Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening suffices, but the lack of a visible micro-cost during the untangling sequence keeps this in mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is Marcus's ethical reckoning with his manipulation. One meaningful tightening: the blind woman's story forces him to recognize his own reflection, narrowing options to confession or continued denial. He chooses renunciation (burning the puppets), but the escalation is more conceptual than pressure-tested—no antagonist resists, no external cost dramatized. Julian's accusation opens the story but disappears; the argument's heat doesn't carry forward as tactical friction. The final act is Marcus's alone, uncontested, so agency reads as internal realization rather than choice under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—honoring overlooked histories before the final migration ends—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs: the population counts drive toward nightfall, and her dismantling of the oldest tower enacts the build-signal-release cycle. Cost is visible (she cannot preserve the species, only the dignity of ending) and forecloses the path of preservation. Agency is present but muted: Elara's choices are ritualistic rather than forced by reversals or escalating pressure. The monarchs' dwindling and the approaching threshold create urgency, but no on-page complication tests her method or commitment; escalation reads as atmospheric countdown rather than decision-driven tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving forgotten names to complete what she failed before—is clear early and drives all action. The work itself (undoing braids, aligning perforations, casting the cradle) provides concrete tactical progression. The tightening occurs when the reconfigured rope captures aurora light and projects names, a meaningful deepening that reweights her past failure. Cost is visible (the night's labor, the years of self-forgiveness, the technical precision required) but the piece avoids a live choice or renunciation moment that would narrow options under pressure; instead we watch skilled execution more than agonized decision.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding her role as guardian and whether to remain—is legible but abstract. Pressure accumulates through the storm's approach and the drug's ingestion, yet no on-page reversal or narrowing choice creates friction; the dream retrospectively justifies a decision she seems to have already made. The departure forecloses the path of staying, but the cost (melted seal, abandoned post) is more symbolic than felt. Agency is present in her choice to transcend and leave, but the escalation under the Accumulative lens lacks a decisive tightening that forces a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—activating an ancient celestial mechanism during a political void—is signaled in the opening and tightens when Elior realizes the tile's proportions match his equinox data. One meaningful reversal occurs: his frugality, assumed to be mere miserliness, is revealed as unconscious faith-storage that enables the mechanism. The escalation feels conceptual rather than dramatized through a sequence of narrowing tactical choices; the middle compresses discovery into summary, and the final act (placing the tile, speaking the sequence, pressing his palm) proceeds without visible obstacles or competing costs that would test his commitment in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.8)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Elias must convince the entity to release resentment. Pressure remains static; the entity declares resistance, Elias begins winding the pin, the sanctuary "amplifies the biological truth," and the entity dissolves. No reversal or tightening narrows options—Elias executes his plan without adaptation, failure, or trade-off. The entity's transformation is asserted ("shoulders dropping," "beginning to understand") rather than earned through a visible on-page fracture. Elias suffers no cost; his "scheming pacifism" wins "another bloodless victory" with no path foreclosed or price paid. The resolution feels inevitable from the premise rather than tested by escalating resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—capturing the runaway dream—is signaled early and pressure accumulates through the glass-blowing ritual. Yet escalation is linear without reversals: each breath succeeds, the dream "could not resist," and the arc seals cleanly. No live option is foreclosed; Elias achieves his goal without visible cost or tactical adjustment. The dream's agency (it "turned back") removes protagonist struggle at the pivotal moment, undercutting earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to restore or accept transformation—signals early and tightens when Mara reaches for her professional kit but chooses the grandmother's tools instead, a micro-reversal that narrows options. The final seasonal-contract image reweights the breach with visible opportunity cost (she abandons fixed restoration). Escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as a density increase (orchard discovery → ribbon recovery → tool choice → seasonal vow) rather than causal narrowing, meeting the lens's requirement for one meaningful deepening. The cost is conceptual and relational (foreclosing the restoration path, opening the silence with her daughter) but not viscerally urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—pursuing forbidden knowledge—is declared but never tested with on-page cost or narrowed options. No reversal or tightening occurs; Elara's walk from orchard to bathroom to tree is flat sequencing without escalation. The "simply complicated truth" she discovers is told rather than dramatized, and no visible price alters her tactics. Coincidence does not apply, but neither does agency-driven pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—finding the Library of Unlearned Lessons before paradox collapses the archive—is signaled early and persists. The time traveler's disruption alters the exchange rate of knowledge, creating a meaningful tightening: Elara's expertise "had become currency without value." However, escalation operates through accumulation of understanding rather than narrowing options with dramatized cost. The resolution (pressing the diary, descending the staircase, cataloging specimens) unfolds without a visible trade-off or price paid on the page. The chrononaut's fate shifts from trapped to released, but Elara's agency in that release is told rather than shown through a moment of renunciation or tactical loss.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—recapturing the narrative of Maya's twin—is signaled early but never tested by a choice with visible cost. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; Maya's path from ship to crow's nest to garden is a linear drift without friction. The final reunion is granted by fiat ("her fingers finding…the hand of her twin") rather than earned through prior sacrifice or renunciation. Coincidence (the garden appearing when the emerald card blazes) resolves the quest without protagonist agency. The prose asserts escalation ("the ship began to dissolve") but does not dramatize a price paid or option foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—reconciling bifurcated timelines to end centuries of war—is signaled early and clear. Elara's agency drives the central action (she reconfigures the rope), and one meaningful deepening occurs when the wax seal fuses with the braids. Yet no live option is foreclosed with visible cost to her: she encounters no failed attempt, no sacrifice of another timeline's outcome, no personal price for becoming "active participant" rather than observer. The escalation reads as smooth technical execution without friction, and the resolution lacks the tradeoff or toll that would make the merge feel earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—conjuring silence to counter the energy beings' chaos—is signaled early and tightens when Mara realizes passive waiting won't work; she must actively conjure the bloom, narrowing her options. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency (matching cave resonance, dampening harmonics, adjusting pitch via ice-crack feedback) under the Accumulative lens, building density toward a decisive moment. The cost is legible: she is now bound to tend the silence indefinitely, her prior mapkeeping tools obsolete, a visible forfeiture that alters her future. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, and the price charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—proving coincidence is coherence—is signaled early and pursued throughout. The prism discovery, vision of engineers' intent, and tower climb create a single meaningful tightening toward the Thornwheel alignment. Pressure accumulates through the "retrocognitive clarity" that stakes compel her ascent. The resolution, however, is externally timed (the 84-year cycle) rather than forged by Elara's choices under conflicting pressures. The answering glints from distant beacons provide consequence, but the cost is conceptual validation rather than a visible trade-off that alters her future tactics or forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—preserving the founders' memories before they "belong to history"—is signaled early. The piece deepens through accumulation (moving stone to stone, measuring shadows) rather than reversals. Agency is present (she chooses to use rainwater, to write on her skin) but these actions do not foreclose a live option or force a trade-off with on-page cost. The final merge is presented as inevitable transformation rather than earned sacrifice. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful intensification occurs (the tallest monument's anomaly) but it does not narrow options or crystallize a price that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—defying hopelessness through a fireworks ritual—is signaled early but never tightens or deepens through agency-driven reversals. Elian encounters no meaningful resistance, adaptation, or trade-off; the siege's despair is declared pooling "heavy as mercury" yet never complicates his chanting or ritual execution. The courtyard faces tilt upward and children will whistle tomorrow, but these outcomes arrive without visible cost or foreclosed path for Elian himself. One tightening occurs (ignition whispers instead of roars, colors "shouldn't exist"), but it reads as texture rather than a pressure point that narrows options. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the lack of a legible price at closure—no renunciation, no visible sacrifice—keeps escalation functional but not charged.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Maya will stay through winter—is signaled immediately and pressure deepens when the narrator reframes the ask from answer to acknowledgment. The tightening is genuine: the cicada gift transforms the stakes from binary (stay/leave) to textured (testing the transition). However, the escalation is more conceptual than visceral; no live option is visibly foreclosed, and the cost remains prospective ("next week") rather than paid on the page. One meaningful turn occurs when the narrator releases the demand for resolution, altering the terms of their negotiation.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake signaled early: Mara seeks to collect the gilded hush, her mother's final silence, to ease her claustrophobic existence. One meaningful tightening occurs when the clouds churn, signaling the inversion's end, forcing her sprint back to the hatch—time constraint narrows options with visible urgency. The cost is felt: she must balance the seductive pull of the trellis against irreversible ascent, and she accepts the bunker's compression as the price of survival, a trade-off that forecloses the fantasy of permanent escape. Agency is present in her choice to climb, to collect, and to return; the resolution is earned by her realization that she can endure by limiting exposure, mirroring the flowers. No antagonist appears, but the ticking clock and gravity's threat supply external pressure. Escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as density increase and cadence shift (the churning clouds, the sprint, the weight crashing into her shoulders) that reweights the dominant stake. The final image charges prior material: the doll now holds peace, not just panic.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—teaching silence to comfort the grieving architect—is signaled early but never tested by counter-pressure or complication. The twelve-minute pressure drop offers a ticking clock, yet no reversal or tightening narrows options; Mara simply waits for the atmospheric stillness to do its work. The architect's shift from resistance to acceptance is told ("her shoulders dropping") rather than dramatized through a visible choice or renunciation. Agency is passive observation, and the escalation curve is flat.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—finding the stairway to restore the archive—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, escalation is minimal: the ruby flake pulses brighter as she nears, but no reversal or tightening choice narrows her options; the waterfall, orchard, and stairway appear exactly as promised. The resolution (unlocking the repository) is delivered by the ruby flake's resonance rather than Elara's agency at closure. The three-hour time window is mentioned but never exerts pressure on her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—teaching Mira autonomy—is signaled early and remains coherent. The scar-linking transmission provides one tightening moment where past wounds enable present transfer. However, escalation is more conceptual than dramatized: the "influx of technique flooding her nervous system" and Mira's realization are told rather than shown through resistant action or complicating pressure. The ending's cost (Mira walking away, Elias remaining alone) is thematically legible but lacks a visible price or trade-off paid in scene; the resolution feels preordained rather than wrested from competing needs.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—transforming debt and trauma into something generative—is signaled early and held. One meaningful tightening occurs when the bolt materializes and Maya picks it up, a micro-turn that shifts her from passive receiver of texts to active volunteer. The final image (planting the diamond, typing the message) reconfigures her relationship to pressure with conceptual cost visible in the stone's etchings. Yet the escalation unfolds largely through internal summary and metaphorical assertion rather than choices that narrow live options. The glitchy texts complicate but do not force a trade-off; Maya's "volunteering" is described ("pressed the bolt against her palm until her skin learned") rather than dramatized as a decision under competing pulls.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake (collapse the dynasty by uncovering hidden truth) is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful deepening: the standing waves spelling out coordinates, signatures, and vault locations escalate the evidence from abstract goal to concrete indictment. Agency is present but passive: Kael turns the handle and copies symbols without facing a meaningful trade-off or live opposition. The winding-down spring introduces urgency but no on-page cost or tactic shift; Kael simply copies before it fades.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake is clear and singular: Valen seeks to capture "the shape of possibility itself," and the greenhouse offers the means. The piece delivers one meaningful deepening as reality shifts accelerate and the program's patterns lift from the page to guide him into final position, tightening his path toward surrender. Agency manifests in his choice to perform the gestures and remove his armor, forecloses his prior isolation, and culminates in stepping through the door. However, the escalation relies more on atmospheric intensification (mercury bursting, geometries unfolding) than on protagonist choice narrowing options; coincidence—the greenhouse responding to his presence—does much of the work, and the cost of transformation remains abstract rather than showing a specific, legible loss on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake clearly signaled: Maya seeks solace/meaning after abandonment by magnifying hidden mercies in orphaned files. The discovery of the sergeant's pattern provides one meaningful deepening—the anomaly becomes systemic care. Her choice to compile a supplemental index and preserve evidence rather than cull files shows agency with professional cost (supervisor's task abandoned). However, escalation is primarily Accumulative (pattern accumulation) rather than pressure-driven; no antagonist tests her new conviction, and the transformation occurs through discovery alone without forcing a difficult trade-off. The final stance crystallizes cleanly but the stakes remain personal/internal without external friction.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (restore suppressed histories), and Elias's agency drives the activation sequence. However, escalation is flat: no meaningful reversal or tightening after the midpoint; the lagoon accepts the key without obstacle, and the broadcast succeeds with no visible cost or tactical trade-off. The authorities' delayed arrival and the hydraulic locks function as convenient escapes rather than earned pressure. Under the causal lens, coincidence resolves rather than complicates, and the final paragraph tells us the outcome ("Ministry's narrative control began its slow collapse") rather than showing a price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is clear: prevent the prophecy from completing itself before dawn evaporates the dew. One meaningful tightening occurs when "each [dewdrop] threatened to release a phoneme of the code" and the final dewdrop hangs suspended, forcing Elias to hold "one last note of emptiness." Agency is present—he chooses to return, to play, to maintain pressure—but the escalation is linear: prophecy stirs, he counters with inverse silence, prophecy dissolves. No on-page reversal tests his commitment; the method works as described without friction, and the cost (returning every tomorrow) is declared rather than dramatized as a visible trade-off in this moment.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—decoding the message before the hush dissolves—is signaled early and remains consistent. The story supplies one meaningful tightening when Elias presses the needle and triggers the tree's response, narrowing his path to transformation. However, escalation is minimal: no reversals test his commitment, and the moonstone dust solves the problem it did not help create. The cost of transformation (becoming the seed, opening arms to the sky) is declared rather than felt as a trade-off that forecloses a prior option. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen through pattern or cadence shift; here it plateaus after the needle press and the ending arrives as fulfillment rather than reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is clear early: retrieve the compass rose to vindicate her mentor and unlock truth. Escalation tightens when her hydrodynamic calculations fail, forcing her to trust rhythm over data—a meaningful deepening of the "uncertainly certain" conflict. The crossing sequence narrows options beat by beat (tilted third stone, submerged fifth stone) with visible physical and epistemic cost. Agency is genuine: she steps "not when her notes instructed" but when her breath matches the spray, a choice that forecloses the path of pure calculation. Coincidence (leaves, thermal current) complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—redeeming Kael from the void—is signaled early and remains clear. Pressure operates under the Accumulative lens: Elara works through the night, testing "tensile strength of causality," reaching "the limit of alchemy itself." Yet the escalation is entirely internal and intellectual; no external obstacle or failure forces a tactical shift, and the resolution arrives without visible tradeoff. The story declares high stakes ("the crevasse between elemental planes," "the void had cracked him") but Elara's process encounters no reversal or complication that narrows her options. The cost remains conceptual—"regret made luminous"—rather than dramatized through forfeiture or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—releasing trapped souls through laughter—is signaled early and maintained. Elara's adjustment of harp strings to loosen the ghost's tongue shows agency, and the woman's shift from silence to laughter is one meaningful tightening. However, the escalation is smooth rather than contested; no reversal or complication forces a trade-off. The cost is told (hands bleeding, heart heavy) but not felt as a choice that forecloses another path. Coincidence does not resolve, but neither does meaningful opposition emerge.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—discovering the mathematics of mercy—is signaled early but remains abstract. One meaningful tightening occurs when the strap falls and Elena "solved for x," yet this resolution is told rather than shown as a choice that forecloses a live option. No antagonist or secondary pressure appears to test her commitment. The ultraviolet penance concept complicates mood but does not narrow tactics on the page. Cost is implied (carrying the strap's impression) but not felt as a tangible sacrifice or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—restoring Mara's memory—is signaled early but never faces on-page resistance. No reversal or tightening narrows Elara's options; she raises the lens, sees the hidden name, speaks it, and succeeds. The "anchors of intuition" are mentioned as constraints she must "unfasten," yet no specific knot resists her or forces a trade-off. Escalation is asserted through metaphor (heat in the lens, flood of memory) rather than dramatized through a choice that forecloses a path. The closure delivers satisfaction without visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—discovering what ceilings hide—is signaled early and tightens when Maya finds the mainspring and realizes the ringmaster has been anchoring it. One meaningful escalation occurs: her choice to install the barrel into the governor transforms the ghost's state. The stakes remain investigative rather than survival-urgent, which is consistent with the Accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual (the transfer of burden) and spatial (the crack seals), but Maya herself pays no visible price; her action resolves the problem without personal forfeiture or struggle, which keeps the band from rising higher.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—destabilizing perfect systems to restore change—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure tightens through frost-reading, plate-casting, bottle-shattering, and rupture initiation, but the escalation reads more as a predetermined sequence than as choices that narrow options or force trade-offs. The shatter-and-press beat is the key tightening, yet it feels like the execution of a plan rather than a decision under competing pressure. Cost is legible conceptually (perfection yields to chaos) but Elara pays no visible personal price; she simply breathes at the end, satisfied.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—reimagining the civilization's purpose—is signaled early and sustained. However, the escalation unfolds largely in Kaelen's internal reweighting rather than external pressure that narrows options. The council presentation and mirror experiment provide one modest tightening, but the resolution ("dispute resolved not through evidence but through recognition") avoids a hard trade-off. Cost is conceptual (renouncing his revolutionary identity) but lacks the visceral felt price that would elevate this under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—preventing endless darkness—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, escalation is almost entirely external: midnight "presses," the chip "blazes," the tether "catches," all without meaningful agency from Elias beyond performing scripted gestures. No live option is foreclosed; the ritual proceeds without a single complication, failed attempt, or visible tradeoff. The cost of success (the chip dissolving) reads as fulfillment rather than sacrifice, and no tactic is altered by emerging friction.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—finding coordinates where explanations fail—is signaled early and pursued throughout. Pressure accumulates via textural deepening: factory silence → psychometry vision → descent through sealed levels → lagoon discovery. However, no on-page choice narrows live options or forces a trade-off; Elara encounters revelation rather than dilemma. The compass is described as having "waited ninety years" but this frames her as recipient, not agent. Cost is conceptual (carrying mystery vs. returning to explanations) but lacks a visceral price paid in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake—reimagining her sculptural practice—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful deepening occurs when the lantern slide teaches her to read debris as messages rather than abandoned objects, shifting her approach from assemblage to conversation. However, escalation is primarily conceptual; the storm intensifies but Mara's choices don't narrow or face genuine trade-offs. She arranges driftwood "no longer fighting the storm but collaborating" without visible cost—no failed attempts, no sacrifice of a prior method, no foreclosed path. The meditation pavilion commission appears as future opportunity rather than a pressure point tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding her mother's devotion to night-blooming flowers—is signaled early and tightens through the sexton's revelation: "not facing upward toward the safety of darkness, but eastward, already yearning toward a dawn." This reweights Lyra's prior misreading and narrows options (she cannot return to the melancholy interpretation). The mural changes from "somber purples and blacks" to "golds that pulsed beneath the surface," showing visible cost in reworked labor. One meaningful deepening is sufficient at this length under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—complete the psychic circuit to release trapped souls and expose buried truth—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening: the retrocognitive trap releases when Elias arranges the final black stone, initiating the parley. Cost is declared ("knowing that the retrocognitive trap had not been a curse") but the price is emotional rhetoric rather than a visible forfeiture; we don't see what Elias gives up or what option he's lost. The lagoon's surfacing feels granted by the story rather than earned by Elias's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—reimagining civilization without miracles—is signaled in paragraph three. One meaningful tightening occurs: Elara rejects the seductive option to "smash the bottle" and resurrect the town as a "ghost story," choosing instead to architect something unprecedented. However, the escalation is told rather than tested; no external pressure or internal doubt threatens her resolve after that moment. The transformation itself (bottle shattering, structures accreting) unfolds without visible cost or tactical adjustment, reducing the felt weight of her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—archiving emotional patterns—is declared but never tested by an on-page dilemma that narrows options or forces a trade-off. No reversal or tightening occurs; Elias notices the shaving, remembers the museum, tastes it, and ascends into a prophetic state in a single ascending arc without complication or cost. The "accidental prophecy" is told rather than dramatized as a problem he must solve or endure. Because escalation under the Accumulative lens requires density increase or cadence shift that reweights the stake with visible cost, and none is legible here, the score remains mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—reopening the atrium to reverse the Great Frost and restore the sanctuary—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates through layered acts (placing acorn cap, singing lowering songs, reversing entropy) under an Accumulative lens, but no on-page reversal or competing option tests Elara's commitment. The piece offers one meaningful deepening when the vortex merges with the acorn cap and creates the spiral staircase, narrowing her path to descent. Cost remains abstract: no resource is spent, no alternate goal refused, no relationship altered; the ending declares future action ("would stay here") without demonstrating what she forfeits now.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—whether to use electronic sirens or the cathedral bell to warn the valleys—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs: the barometer drop forces the zero-hour decision. Yet the escalation is more atmospheric than causal; no reversal narrows options, and the protagonist faces no genuine obstacle or competing pressure. The storm arrives on schedule, Elara chooses the bell, and the piece asserts success without dramatizing resistance, failure, or trade-off. Agency is present (she pulls the rope) but the cost is conceptual and unfelt; no live option is foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—Elian's recognition of his own trajectory mirrored in the falling stars—is signaled early and tightens when he identifies with their "incandescent letting-go." The meteor shower provides one meaningful deepening: he moves from passive observation to dancing the "geometry of decay," a physical embodiment of acceptance. Agency is present in his final walk outside, reframing vulnerability as atmosphere rather than wound. However, the escalation relies more on accumulation of imagery than a narrowing of options or a visible trade-off; the cost is conceptual (end of isolation, acceptance of transience) but not concretely dramatized as a forfeited path. Under the textural lens, the pressure coheres and the stance crystallizes with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—preserve unspoken words—is signaled early but never tested by competing pressures. No reversal or tightening occurs; Elias observes, understands, and accepts without friction. The ghost's gesture transfers memory, but this is coincidental enablement rather than protagonist agency. Opening the box and witnessing the ghosts constitute observation, not decision with cost. The covenant "untangling" and Elias's choice to "maintain this oasis" are told culminations without on-page struggle or forfeited path. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful intensification is required; here the prose deepens thematically but does not narrow options or impose a felt trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding time's texture—is signaled early and resolved at closure. One tightening occurs when Elara extracts the shard and feels genuine sensation for the first time in years, narrowing her existence from borrowed increments to the potential for sovereign continuity. The absorption of the fragment completes the arc, but her agency in that moment is passive reception rather than choice under pressure. No live option is foreclosed with visible cost; she expands into all moments simultaneously without renunciation. Coincidence does not resolve, but the capsule "calling to her" and the fragment "dissolving into her chest" reduce protagonist-driven escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: demonstrating that beauty exists in brokenness, tested when the boy's kite falls. The poet's choice to repair rather than restore creates one meaningful tightening, though the boy's initial resistance dissolves quickly without sustained pressure. Agency is present (she wades, retrieves, redesigns) but the escalation is modest—the kite's ruin doesn't genuinely threaten her philosophy, it simply invites application. Cost is visible (the feather given, the original form abandoned) but the boy's immediate acceptance and successful flight soften the sense of risk or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.9)
    One dominant stake: complete the interspecies embassy before death. Pressure accumulates through seasonal markers (autumn→winter→spring→summer→final month), but no on-page reversal tightens options—Elias wraps wire methodically without setback or surprise. The pillars' hum and species' coexistence are outcomes, not complications that force tactical shifts. Cost is declared (cancer, death) but never dramatizes a moment where pain or fatigue alters his method. Agency reads as endurance without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—"to understand the chemistry of homecoming"—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows options; the group walks to the tower, discusses their hypothesis, and sets up equipment without friction or setback. The preliminary data reading at the end is told rather than dramatized, and no visible price is paid (no lost funding, no institutional reprisal, no interpersonal cost materialized on the page). Agency is observational rather than decisional. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen or a cadence shift should reweight cost; neither occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—letting a garden reclaim a battlefield—is signaled early but never pressured. No reversal, tightening, or complication occurs; the coachman faces no opposition, resource limit, or internal friction. The piece describes a ritual execution without dramatizing any cost, choice, or obstacle. Agency is absent: the protagonist enacts inevitability rather than forging a path under constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—translating distance (to Mara) into closeness—is signaled early and drives all action. Pressure tightens through the three-day search, the riddle's reframing from word game to emotional map, and the discovery that narrows infinite absence to one preserved object. The final moment carries visible cost: Ash gains presence through artifact but must accept that closeness is measured in centimeters and wax, not living contact. Agency is clear—Ash chooses to search, to interpret the riddle through scent and intuition, and to sing. The resolution is earned by his specific gift (reading grooves, translating scent) applied under persistent pressure. One reversal when "night falls but never breaks; dawn breaks but never falls" reframes the riddle as existential truth rather than puzzle, forcing recognition of permanence.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: escape from temporal exile. One clear tightening when Elara realizes her mutation grants cartographic sight, transforming the observation deck from prison to vessel. The fixed point discovery narrows options and the hatch appears "accessible only to someone moving at her specific, tortured temporal frequency"—agency is decision (to map) with visible cost (enduring stretched perception). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens through density increase and the final threshold step.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=4.7)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (amend the broken treaty), but the guardian immediately cooperates, eliminating opposition. The chess-piece exchange is a sequence without reversal or tightening; each piece corrects a lie without cost or friction. No live option is foreclosed, no trade-off forced. The resolution is delivered by ritual completion rather than protagonist agency under pressure. Escalation and visible cost are absent; the story declares stakes but never tests them on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—freeing suppressed truth versus maintaining survivor safety—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure tightens when Mira severs the cords and begins reading, a single meaningful escalation that fits the Accumulative lens. However, the opposition is almost entirely internal and abstract; no on-page force resists her, and the cost of exposure (her complicity revealed) is told rather than dramatized in tactical consequences. The tightening occurs, but the felt price remains conceptual rather than visceral, capping the score in the mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding the shape of home—is signaled early and coheres throughout. The substitution ritual establishes a pattern; discovering the stone and its message about seeding rather than finding creates one meaningful tightening that reframes the quest. However, the escalation is conceptual rather than driven by visible tradeoffs; Vey's choice to stop substituting and begin seeding does not foreclose a dramatized alternative or impose a legible price beyond ceasing the nightly illusion. The cost at closure is stated more than felt in the body or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—self-forgiveness via decoding the tapestry—is signaled early and tightens through the labyrinth puzzle-solving. The mirror revelation that the prince was already lost narrows Kaelen's self-blame and forecloses the path of eternal guilt. However, the reversal lacks a visible tradeoff in the moment; the absolution arrives as discovery rather than through a protagonist decision that costs him something tangible on the page. Agency is present in the choice to stay, but escalation is more textural than causally sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—preventing the Overseers from cementing singular history—is signaled early and escalates through accumulative pressure: Kael's seventeen mornings of poetry, Lira's echo-releasing, the approaching ritual. One meaningful tightening occurs when the pale spire glows and Kael shifts tactics, abandoning polished verses for "raw, stumbling lines that admitted doubt." The cost is unmistakable: Kael's voice dissolves into the bone, forecloses the path of preserving a pure original vision, and the Overseers' ritual fails. Agency is protagonist-driven under the Accumulative lens; coincidence (Lira's arrival) complicates but does not resolve, as Kael must choose to surrender control of the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: complete the repair before the workshop sinks. External pressure (corroding hull, gear snapping) and internal conflict (doubt vs. kintsugi belief) interweave and escalate through the memory-matching sequence. The tightening is clear: "minutes before the pontoons dissolved," then "acid splashing through a ruptured seal." Agency manifests in her decision to continue under duress and the final dive into the story rather than flee. Cost is visible—the platform plunges, she holds her breath "one final time"—though the exact trade-off (physical survival vs. narrative completion) could be slightly sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—completing Marguerite's work and releasing his grief—is signaled early and tightens when the wrong turn forces Elias deeper. The act of painting and leaving the shell behind narrows options (he cannot retreat to passivity). However, the escalation is more internal realization than external pressure; no live opposition or resource constraint tests the choice. The cost is legible (the shell remains, he moves forward) but feels contemplative rather than urgent, and coincidence (stumbling into the oasis) enables rather than complicates resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake: proving that gentleness succeeds where force fails. Pressure accumulates through Voss's exhausted batteries and the Maria Celeste's distress, tightening Elias's window. Agency is present (he constructs the modification, places the cork), but the ship's course correction feels coincidental—no on-page resistance or tactical adjustment by Elias tests his theory under fire. The felt cost (weeping, knowing his method works) remains emotional rather than a visible trade-off or forfeiture that narrows options. One meaningful tightening occurs (dawn + distressed vessel), but escalation lacks causal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: navigate/map the geography of loss, build the apparatus instructed by the midnight voice. The piece offers one meaningful deepening when she understands the purpose ("The geography of loss wasn't terrain you crossed; it was terrain you constructed"). Agency at closure is present but muted—she completes the apparatus and activates it, achieving the goal without a visible trade-off or foreclosed path. The escalation reads more as gradual assembly than a tightening that narrows options. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through layered imagery, but the final act feels like arrival at a pre-determined end rather than a choice that costs something on the page. No antagonist or external resistance; coincidence does not resolve, but the protagonist's will is never genuinely tested.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—psychological safety from viral empathy—is signaled early and drives every beat. Pressure tightens when Maren's hands move faster than her tongue to wrap the relic, escalates through her consultation of discredited textbooks, and culminates in the ritual where her involuntary truthfulness makes the incantation "devastatingly potent." The cost is legible: she buries a smuggled relic, paints her eyelids with bitter extract, and accepts reliance on superstition after rationality failed. One meaningful tightening occurs when the ritual works and the empathic barrage lifts. The piece does not require multiple reversals under the Accumulative lens, and the final reconfiguration—occlusion achieved, anchor set—closes with visible if quiet consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—decoding the stranger's gesture—is signaled early and tightens through the investigation, borrowed memories, and final pinning. One meaningful deepening occurs when Maren realizes the woman "stayed at her post while her husband's vessel foundered," reweighting duty as transmission rather than surrender. The final act (pinning the flower, mirroring the gesture) is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual and legible (永久 isolation accepted as inheritance) but lacks a visible trade-off or foreclosed alternative that would elevate the score into the 8.5+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (fulfill Thomas's promise, find the hidden site) is signaled early and tightens when the flood timer starts. The chip's engagement with hidden gears and the wall's pivot provide one meaningful turn that narrows options. Arthur's choice to step through and catalog the maps forecloses his prior life as "merely a dealer" with visible cost (perpetual archival burden). However, no false path or genuine temptation tests the choice; the ants lead, the door opens, Arthur steps through without on-page hesitation or competing desire, reducing felt friction.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—unraveling the mystery of recurring dreams—is signaled early and drives the climb. Yet the escalation is largely atmospheric rather than choice-driven: Elara ascends, finds Mara, and receives exposition ("The dreams were never yours alone") that delivers answers rather than forcing a high-cost decision. The final act (trailing fingers through the pool) is presented as a successful command with no visible friction or failed attempt; the starlight "stopped bleeding" on cue. One meaningful tightening occurs (realization that dreams are invitations), but the resolution feels granted rather than earned through protagonist agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—capturing presence—is signaled early but never faces meaningful opposition or complication. Elara arranges tools, positions the shell, activates instruments, and succeeds without resistance, error, or cost that alters tactics. The Mira whisper should narrow options or force a trade-off, but instead validates Elara's project seamlessly. No on-page reversal or tightening occurs; the "directed spontaneity" operates as aesthetic description rather than dramatized pressure. The resolution is achieved through procedure rather than protagonist agency under duress, and no visible price is paid—the final image presents additive gain (new element alongside existing suns) without forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—distilling chaos into narrative before fragmentation consumes him—is signaled early. The jealousy-fueled ascent functions as a tightening or deepening, yet it resolves into metaphorical insight rather than a trade-off with visible consequence. The piece lacks a clear foreclosed option or felt price at closure; Elias's act of writing "tomorrow he might be the past self someone envied" reframes but does not narrow or cost him anything legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=5.7)
    The dominant stake—Mara learning to read the world without scent—is signaled early and sustained. However, escalation is largely internal and reflective; the screw discovery complicates her understanding but does not force a decision or alter tactics. No live option is foreclosed on the page, and the resolution ("understanding everything") is asserted rather than earned through a choice with visible cost. The piece coheres under Accumulative pressure but lacks a tightening that narrows possibilities or a trade-off that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—completing the inscription before the storm and before crystallization spreads to her hands—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure tightens through the held breath (a live clock), the progression from forearm to sternum (spatial escalation), and the resistance of the deepest scar. The final turn (using a tear instead of ink) narrows options and pays a visible emotional cost. Agency is clear: Elara's choice to revisit superstition and her micro-decisions (tongue-tap ritual, tear as ink) drive each beat. The cost is legible: breath deprivation, scar removal, emotional exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (deliver apology before orchard falls) is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful escalation: Elara's abandonment of metaphor represents a professional and personal cost, narrowing her rhetorical options. The induced currents peak, forcing the moment of direct speech. The resolution—apology delivered, circuit broken, spirit dispersed—is driven by her agency and forecloses a return to her prior method (column left unwritten). The composer's nod and whispered correction ("Like seeds") introduces a micro-turn that reweights the image without requiring a second reversal. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, and the final cost (pen dry, trees falling) is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—unraveling cosmic illusions before the universe's hiccup becomes permanent—is signaled early and frames the spiral journey. Pressure accumulates through the Accumulative lens (each circuit refines definitions, the library folds, the dictionary warms), but no on-page reversal narrows her options or forces a trade-off; she walks the spiral without obstacle or renunciation. The ending unifies opposites ("end" cross-referenced with "beginning"), but the tightening is conceptual rather than a dramatized choice with visible cost. One meaningful deepening occurs when "she understood that to unravel cosmic illusions was not to destroy them but to recognize their necessary spiral nature," yet this realization arrives without prior friction that it resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding what clocks measure—is signaled early and sustained. The countdown provides a tightening structure, but the pressure is primarily internal and meditative rather than escalating through opposition or narrowing options. The shepherd's renunciation (leaving the key) represents a choice, but it doesn't feel forced by mounting cost or a trade-off between competing goods. The resolution is more epiphany than earned agency under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—finding meaning in randomness after near-death—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through Maya's reflections on her father, her discipline, and her damaged heart, but no on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows options with visible cost. The evening's "rebellion" is theoretical; she walks, observes, calculates, and decides to "teach differently" without dramatizing what she sacrifices or forecloses. The Accumulative lens tolerates this design, but escalation remains interior and declarative rather than enacted through a decision that alters her stance or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—Mara's mission to teach endings as beginnings through cultivated estrangement—is signaled early and remains coherent under the Accumulative lens. However, escalation is minimal: each wrong-number call is a variation on the same beat (confession → glass harmonica guidance → disconnection) with no meaningful tightening or deepening that narrows options or raises cost. The teenager seeking pills represents a higher-stakes scenario than the accountant or conductor, but Mara's response is identical in method and outcome; she disconnects "before gratitude could anchor them both" without hesitation or visible trade-off. The elderly man at the end is another loop rather than a turn that forecloses a path or forces a choice between competing goods. Coincidence (wrong numbers) populates the scene but does not resolve; Mara's control is total and unchallenged.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—preserving memory and regenerating the covenant—is signaled early and sustained. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens is more density-increase than genuine tightening; Mara's actions are methodical and unopposed, with no reversal or complication that forces a trade-off. The "context changed" opening and the urgency of working "before twilight faded" gesture toward pressure, but no on-page event tests or narrows her options. The cost ("already preparing her heart for the next blooming") is announced rather than dramatized through a visible forfeiture or realization that alters her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (curing loneliness) is signaled early and coherent throughout. The rumor chain complicates by drawing crowds, and the child's arrival tightens when she inverts the reciprocity ledger. Yet escalation under the Accumulative lens lacks a second pressure point; the gathering feels additive without a meaningful deepening or cost legibility before the child's moment. The resolution hinges on Elias receiving rather than choosing, and the "desperate humor finally finding its punchline" reads as emotional summary rather than a tactical shift with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—navigating her own uncharted emotional depths—is signaled early and pursued consistently. One meaningful tightening occurs when the "trail of musical notes" resolves into "perfect silence," forcing Elara to confront suppressed grief. The ring's warming and cooling provides tactile escalation. However, the peak turn (kneeling to self-map) feels more like arrival than a choice that forecloses options with visible trade-off. Agency reads as discovery rather than renunciation or decision with on-page cost. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens but lacks the sharpness of a protagonist choice that narrows tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—freeing the trapped colony ships—is signaled early and drives the entire arc. Elara's act of editing history with the pen narrows options (the pen crumbles, fulfilling its purpose) and the colony ships emerge from their recursive orbit, demonstrating consequence. The tightening is meaningful but arrives largely through Elara's uncontested action; no secondary pressure tests her commitment or complicates the correction. The cost (pen's destruction, her solitude) is visible but feels symbolic rather than a trade-off that forecloses a live alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: to prove music lives in silence and disrupt his obscurity. The piece tightens through a clear progression—observation (framing silence), interpretation (conducting the air), and enactment (signing the symphony)—with each beat narrowing options until the final performance forecloses noise as a solution. Agency is renunciation with visible cost: "No, but the silence will" rejects public remembrance for a conceptual victory. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; each camera click and gesture adds density until the harbor itself responds. One beat could sharpen: the transition from mapping to performing feels more inevitable than chosen, slightly softening the escalation curve.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—rescuing the forgotten promise—is signaled early, but escalation is retrospective: the entire art-trail project is recounted in summary after Maya has already completed it. No on-page reversal tightens her options; she moves from archive discovery to portrait-sketching to final placement without friction, resistance, or a moment where she must trade one value for another. The stated cost (years of arson, tears, stepping into shadow) is told rather than dramatized in a beat where we see her forsake a live alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—resurrecting Elena through drumming—is signaled early and tightens when "Tonight, the frequencies aligned." Pressure accumulates through escalating action: moving through the garden, climbing the tower, matching heartbeat to pulse, drumming faster until "palms stinging." The cost is visible: physical exhaustion, the figure's dissipation, his slumping against the railing. The protagonist's agency drives the attempt; coincidence (ventilation restarting) complicates but does not resolve. The story delivers one meaningful deepening (he succeeds in touching her, fails to make her permanent) that narrows his future attempts and forecloses the fantasy of full resurrection.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—proving whispers outperform shouts—is signaled early and tested on the page through rerouting ships and the medical supply mission. One meaningful tightening: the young worker's urgent request forces Kael to entrust the coin and teach the rhythm, foreclosing direct control with visible cost. Pressure accumulates under the Accumulative lens via deepening network mechanics. Agency is decision and renunciation (giving the coin). The resolution is earned by Kael's choices; the storm complicates but does not resolve. Light escalation drag: the middle beats recapitulate whisper superiority without a sharp external threat.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=3.8)
    The dominant stake ("teach darkness the value of stars") is signaled early but never faces resistance, complication, or a moment where the guardian must adapt tactics or pay a price. No reversal, no tightening, no deepening—the ritual unfolds without friction. The fish breaking the surface is absorbed into the pattern without altering the guardian's approach. Escalation is absent; the piece operates as a static demonstration rather than a pressurized sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—creating a moment of collective hesitation—is signaled early and pursued through the window-display gambit. One meaningful deepening occurs when the displays coalesce into the chess pattern and the unspoken words rise "not as noise but as harmony." However, escalation is enacted through Elias's patient organizing rather than a tightening that forecloses options; coincidence (cosmic alignment, mist, starlight) charges the grotto scene without Elias making a tactical sacrifice. Agency is present (he organizes, places the queen) but the cost is conceptual and asserted off-page ("a boy was deciding...") rather than a visible trade-off that narrows his own options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—Elara's freedom through embracing her true nature—is signaled early and tightens when the island begins to materialize and the whale calls closer. The reversal occurs when she releases the mooring cable and steps into the water, a choice that forecloses her dock-worker life with on-page cost (cold shock, physical departure, transformation). However, the escalation is more textural accumulation than agency-driven pressure; Elara's resistance to the call is asserted in backstory rather than tested through competing impulses in the present scene.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: Elias's need to "cultivate lightness in grief" for himself and travelers, dramatized when the woman arrives unable to feel. One meaningful tightening: her request → his theatrical tea offer → her acceptance of the unfinished bird escalates from passive observation to tactile engagement, narrowing her path from numbness to risk. The cost is visible: she exhales without measuring for the first time, forgoing emotional armor. Agency is clear (Elias hands her the bird; she closes her fingers and exhales). Under the Accumulative lens, the pressure coheres through the whittling motif and the woman's sensory micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled (reclaim the colonnade, prove poetry's power), but no on-page reversal tests commitment. Elara encounters zero opposition—no censor, no physical barrier, no internal doubt that she must overcome through a costly choice. The "tremor of certainty" eliminates rather than escalates tension. Her final realization that the ban was self-imposed arrives as assertion without prior beats where fear visibly constrained her; no tightening or trade-off charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: Elara seeks to cure her colorblindness. The barter—painting for furnace access—tightens options, and the reed placement is a micro turn. Escalation occurs when Marin agrees and fires the reed, but the cost (handing over the painting) feels modest and the final realization is more thematic shift than forfeited path. The reversal—awakening Marin's voice instead of Elara's sight—grows from prior setup but lacks a felt price that visibly narrows Elara's future options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—discovering "the texture of connection" by deviating from the artificial pilgrimage—is signaled early and tightens through her lens examination, the strike, and the system's awakening. One meaningful escalation occurs when she strikes the pillar, bypassing protocols and activating dormant archives. However, the escalation lacks a visible trade-off or friction; the system validates her "unauthorized modification" immediately, and the final decision to stay arrives without a competing pull or cost that would narrow her options under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—Elara teaching the young man a ritual of grief transformation—is present but never escalates under pressure. The young man arrives, receives instruction, and departs; no reversal or tightening forecloses an option or forces a trade-off. Elara's past loss (her daughter) is backstory that frames her stance but does not create live friction. The closure involves repeating the ritual without a visible cost or narrowing of paths; the young man's acceptance reads as smooth uptake rather than a choice between competing goods or harms. One meaningful pressure point is missing.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—mapping cultural collapse to prevent future crashes—is signaled early. Elias's question ("Can we reverse engineer a way back?") offers a potential pressure point, but Mara's answer is declarative instruction rather than a difficult choice. No reversal or tightening occurs; the protagonist teaches rather than struggles. The ending presents intellectual resolution without foreclosing a path or showing a trade-off: Mara simply continues her patient work, and Elias gains understanding. Under an Accumulative lens, the pattern deepens but doesn't narrow options or impose visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: acquire forbidden knowledge of the Empire's fall. The historian's erratic movement to bypass guardians provides one meaningful tightening (embodying chaos to defeat pattern-based security), and the dance to purify the data core narrows options. Agency is present in the decision to pursue and the method of chaotic movement. The cost at closure—carrying "the weight of what she had learned"—reads more metaphorical than a visible forfeiture; no live option is foreclosed on the page, and the final teaching mission is volitional rather than forced by price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving hope before it dissolves—is signaled early, and the piece deepens through Elara's realization that the shadow is hope's metamorphosis rather than a parasite. One meaningful tightening occurs when she decides to "edit the footage" to help the shadow see itself as guardian. Yet the escalation lacks felt resistance: no failed attempt, no cost that narrows her options, no trade-off that raises the price of success. The shadow's transformation feels more like a puzzle solved than a conflict won, and Elara's agency is editorial rather than viscerally tested.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—reconstructing integrity and trust after complicity—is signaled early and sustained. However, the main conflict (Marcus's betrayal, Elara's reckoning) occurred off-page in the prior seventy-two hours; the on-page present involves reflective work and symbolic gestures (removing pendant, cleaning, organizing) rather than a live antagonist or a choice that narrows options under immediate pressure. The chameleon's injury provides a micro-parallel (healing scarred and functional) but does not generate escalation. The cost (testifying, continuing work with visible scars) is legible and appropriate to the Accumulative lens, but because the tightening moment is retrospective summary rather than a present reversal, the pressure remains static across the present scene. Agency is present in the decision to testify and continue, but it is declared rather than dramatized through a turn that forecloses a live option on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—learning to read scars to find his sister—is signaled early and drives the descent. The piece tightens once: Elias's realization that "seeking closure had been the error" and that "some miracles…needed air" reweights his approach and leads to the touch that binds them. However, escalation is conceptual rather than tactical; no on-page cost (fatigue, fear, a forced choice) tests his commitment during the tunnel sequence. The plants and hourglass enable rather than resist, flattening pressure until the declarative epiphany at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—finding where unused love is stored—is signaled early and pursued consistently. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elara realizes love isn't in walls or seats but "in the space between the projector and the screen." However, the escalation is passive: she receives visions rather than making choices that narrow options or raise cost. The resolution involves discovery without sacrifice; she marks coordinates and plans to return, deferring any trade-off. Under the Accumulative lens, the reweighting is legible but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (free trapped creativity) is signaled early and maintained. The piece offers one meaningful tightening: the realization that stillness and rest are required to complete the pattern. However, the escalation is more thematic accumulation than protagonist agency under duress—each star adds a mark, but no live option is foreclosed until the pre-scripted final act. The cost (three years of creative block) is backstory rather than an on-page trade-off that narrows present tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: accessing the divergent archive to preserve "possibility itself." Under the Accumulative lens, escalation reads as density increase—each paragraph layers motifs until the clock placement triggers the opening. No reversal or tightening choice narrows options; Kael's walk is unopposed, his arrival certain. The final act (placing the clock) feels ritualistic rather than a forced trade-off. Cost is legible (eternal sentinel duty) but the pressure does not force a crystallized stance; he steps inside "at peace," suggesting fulfillment rather than a choice that forecloses a live alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—rediscovering the wild frontier of his mind—is signaled early. The middle beat (confronting the stranger dismantling roots) provides one tightening: Kael must choose engagement over passive observation. However, the stranger's pause after Kael's insight does not narrow options or force a trade-off; the resolution (inserting the gear) is enabled by arriving at the nexus rather than by protagonist agency under pressure. The cost is declared ("the sixth sense felt like kinship rather than invasion") but not dramatized as a visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—Mara reclaiming agency beyond her anxiety's boundaries—is signaled early through the broken leash and her "panic she had spent years tethering." Pressure tightens when she must traverse the ridgeway alone, deepens when she realizes the search targets her former self, and culminates in the choice to carry Atlas home without a leash. The guides' patient presence and the star-stamp covenant create persistent constraint that shapes her tactics. The final act is protagonist-driven (she leads rather than follows) with visible cost: she forecloses the safety of "familiar ground" and "permission to venture only as far as her fear allowed."

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding the cost of safety versus enforced muteness—is signaled early and tightens through the bolt discovery and elder bellhops' horrified reaction. The protagonist's agency drives investigation and the final choice, yet the peak reversal (from rebellion to acceptance) occurs through internal philosophizing rather than a concrete turn that visibly narrows options. One meaningful deepening is present but the escalation under the accumulative lens could land with sharper on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—unmasking the pretender—is signaled early and remains clear. However, escalation is absent: the titan executes a plan without visible friction, cost, or reversal. The pretender arrives, sneers, and is immediately undone by magic the titan controls without struggle. No tightening occurs; the rune assembles itself, the titan "speaks the sundering word," and the false king's disguise peels away with "inevitable separation"—phrasing that describes fate rather than hard-won agency. The resolution is not earned by a protagonist choice that forecloses an option or pays a price; the ink pellet "dissolves into shadow" only after its work is done, a passive consequence rather than a sacrifice that alters tactics. Under the selected Causal lens, the lack of a meaningful turn or deepening that narrows options prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—discovering why paths disappear—is signaled early and sustains pressure throughout. The data-core assembly and cross-referencing narrow options: the delayed revelation crystallizes "not in the data, but in the gaps between the data." The transmission of the atlas page to Manila is Elena's agency at closure, foreclosing her private witness role with visible cost (she stops tapping, folds the page, releases it). One meaningful tightening via the bleaching-as-beginning insight reweights prior material. No explicit antagonist, but the "indifferent rhythm" of the tide and institutional forgetting supply coherent external pressure under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: discovering meaning and ensuring "something sacred survived beneath the rubble." The lull provides situational pressure, but Mira faces no active opposition or trade-off. The ritual sequence (approaching stones → speaking words → triggering pulse) shows one tightening, yet no live option is foreclosed—success arrives without dramatized cost. The "thunderous serenity" and pulse outward suggest stakes, but the outcome feels inevitable rather than earned through a difficult choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—unseal the embryo to evolve tradition—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when the kite script reveals the thermal sequence, narrowing options. But the plants lead Mira through every step; her agency is execution rather than choice under friction. The resolution lacks visible cost: the amber splits, the embryo thrives, Mira smiles—no path foreclosed, no trade-off dramatized. The price is conceptual (cracking tradition) but not felt on the page at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—can Elias cultivate stillness within grief rather than succumb to it—is signaled early and tightens when the wind carries the drone's frequency. The freeze response creates immediate pressure, and his choice to observe rather than fight it narrows options with visible cost (he loses work time but gains psychological ground). The photograph's final unfolding represents protagonist agency under the accumulative lens: he chooses to look directly at his sister's face, a renunciation of avoidance that forecloses perpetual paralysis. The planting of three more saplings tomorrow demonstrates forward motion earned by this confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.6)
    One dominant stake is clear: escape fragmented reality by redesigning perception. Pressure coheres as the walls close and threads accumulate. The tightening reads as deepening rather than a decisive turn that narrows options through protagonist agency. Untangling succeeds without visible loss—no stamina drain, no thread that resists, no alternate path foreclosed. The escalation under the Accumulative lens needs a felt or visible price on the page to enter the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding temporal dilation—is signaled early but remains abstract. The ink sequence offers a visual demonstration rather than a reversal or choice that narrows options; the tracker "surrenders to its logic" without opposition or visible tradeoff. His dissolution is declared as success ("he finally grasps the mechanism") with no on-page cost that alters tactics or forecloses a path. No meaningful tightening or pressure escalation drives the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is clear: suppress or reveal the contraband letter. The upload sequence tightens pressure once (networks awakening → replication → alarms), and the decision forecloses her archival neutrality with visible professional cost (security response). However, the escalation is linear rather than tested by reversal or complication; no mid-scene obstacle forces a tradeoff, and the choice itself unfolds without on-page resistance or visible tactical price beyond the abstract "crossing a threshold." The conceptual cost (guardian → liberator) is asserted more than felt in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: cultivate pacifist continuity amid collapse. One meaningful tightening occurs when the dome shudders—Maya's refusal to flinch narrows options to sustained endurance rather than flight or violence. The sheathe-withdraw-prune ritual forecloses the father's legacy with visible cost (isolation, ongoing external threat). Agency is renunciation and attention; coincidence does not resolve. The escalation is modest but sufficient for this length under an Accumulative lens, and the cost—proved peace in shadows—lands on the page in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.2)
    One dominant stake (catch the echo before patterns scatter it) is signaled early and sustained. The plunge into the echo pool and voicing of silence tighten pressure in a single decisive beat, and cost is legible: the garden dies, constellations wander, and Kael becomes both hunter and hunted. However, escalation relies on ambient cosmic unraveling rather than protagonist trade-offs that narrow live options; the tightening feels textural rather than forced by competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—truth versus inheritance—is signaled early and tightens once when Eleanor discovers the impossible orbit. However, the proof arrives without setback or alternative hypothesis, and her decision to publish follows immediately without competing pressures (family, employees, her own children mentioned but not dramatized as obstacles). The cost is declared ("destroying her own wealth") and felt in the final image ("stepped outside" the orbits) but never tested by a reversal that might make her hesitate.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (repair the abandonment) is clear. Escalation proceeds causally: letters provide coordinates, amber provides material anchor, guilt provides energy, firmware wails, baby cries translate to forgiveness, tether holds. The reversal—her daughter's cries contain forgiveness rather than accusation—narrows options and tightens pressure. Cost is partly visible (the haunted firmware "hushed into peaceful sleep," the insect completes its flight) but the outcome—younger Elara turns back—feels like a gift rather than a trade-off with visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—restoring the grotto's coherence before the unlearning completes—is signaled early and one meaningful tightening occurs when Mara disrupts the mandala's eastern quadrant. However, the turn feels convenient rather than earned by prior tactical failure. No visible cost accompanies the choice; the tile crumbles and harmony follows without sacrifice or trade-off. Agency is present but lacks friction or price, limiting escalation impact under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: preventing sanitization by renaming with "aberrant mercy." Pressure accumulates through retrocognitive fragmentation toward the single meaningful tightening—the placement of the tessera and utterance of "Cradle." The council opposition is declared but not dramatized on the page, so the escalation relies on internal deepening rather than external contest. Cost is conceptual (Kael's solitary burden, refusing comfort) but the story does not show a visible trade-off or foreclosed relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: Julian must transfer possibility to Mara before she acts on despair; secondary: his own resolution of the fractured-timeline loop. The pressure accumulates through layered imagery and the visible box cutter, but the escalation is atmospheric rather than driven by protagonist agency—Julian sings, spins the coin, and the solution arrives when Mara touches it. No meaningful tightening or trade-off narrows options; the echoes simply "grew louder" until the timeline "aligned for one crystalline instant." The cost at closure—Julian's timeline now "quieter," the coin left behind—is told rather than dramatized as a visible forfeiture that alters his condition on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—find and remove the pills before neurological damage spreads—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure tightens once: the geode warming near the radiator forces Maya to extract three bottles, a concrete on-page find that advances the mission. Yet this beat lacks a trade-off or complication; the search succeeds without Maya losing time, confronting an addict, or sacrificing another goal. The "recall complete" declaration tells us resolution rather than showing a final choice that forecloses a path. The brother's voice and the spiral patterns add thematic weight but not escalating tactical pressure. Under the Accumulative lens, the piece deepens through description and reflection but does not narrow options or impose visible cost at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=4.7)
    Dominant stake—mapping emotional residue for hibernating humans—is clear early. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; Kael searches, finds the fossil, activates the protocol, and records without opposition or trade-off. The "consuming motivation" drives exploration but never conflicts with a competing desire or resource limit. The ending declares convergence and success ("recorded it all") without a visible price paid or path foreclosed. Under Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen through pattern break or cost; here it plateaus at declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake (prevent cliff collapse/transform prophecy) is signaled early but never tested by a credible complication or reversal. Elara's tactic—cataloging buttons to unscramble the prophecy—proceeds without friction; no attempt fails, no cost is paid mid-stream, no choice forecloses an option. The climax (jar shatters, prophecy dissolves) reads as given rather than earned by protagonist agency. Accumulative lens allows for density and cadence shift, but here the intensification is declared ("truth unravels," "final hourglass") rather than dramatized through narrowing moves.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake is Elena's repair of the network and self, signaled early. The one meaningful tightening occurs when she offers the pillbox to Marcus and they write new codes, foreclosing her fugitive status. However, the escalation is driven by thematic agreement rather than protagonist agency under duress; no live tactical opposition forces the trade-off. Cost is conceptual (surrendering the last secret) but the final image presents resolution as peaceful rather than a visible price paid. One micro turn is present; no coincidental rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—when to cross—is signaled early and sustained through ambient cues. Pressure accumulates under the Accumulative lens via rising water, fog density, and the gutters' ticking countdown. The coachman's agency is attention and endurance rather than decision against opposition; the storm's retreat grants permission rather than forcing a trade-off. One meaningful tightening occurs (silence replaces ticking, fog lifts), but the escalation is environmental rather than protagonist-driven, and no visible cost forecloses a live option on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding why some places resist change—is signaled in the opening third and drives Kai's attention throughout. The piece operates under an Accumulative lens: pressure builds through layered perception (glass revealing timelines, thrumming acknowledging her, lavender inclining toward her heartbeat) rather than a causal confrontation. One meaningful deepening occurs when Kai realizes "change itself was an illusion" and chooses non-interference, forecloses extraction, and accepts the oasis's autonomy. The cost is legible: she departs without tangible proof or reward, leaving the glass behind. No antagonist or reversal is required under this lens, and the situational pressure (the oasis's thrumming resistance) coheres throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—honoring parental legacy by restoring protective light—is signaled early and tightens through the physical journey and mechanical challenge. Pressure accumulates under the Accumulative lens: waiting → rowing → climbing → calibrating. Agency is clear in Mara's decision to act after the petal falls and her hands-on restoration work. The cost is visible: she abandons her garden sanctuary and commits to overnight vigilance. One friction: the mechanism's success feels somewhat inevitable once she arrives with the correct tool; a moment of doubt or mechanical resistance would sharpen the test. The "quivering hush" and "wistfully pragmatic" phrasing recur but don't meaningfully constrain tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (overcome isolation after remembering her extinct companions) is signaled early. One tightening occurs when Mira places the sundial in the circle, but the escalation is textural (hum intensifies, light dances) rather than narrowing options or raising cost. The resolution ("I am the first librarian of a new solitude") is declared rather than earned by a visible trade-off. No credible loss or renunciation appears on the page; the sundial hovering and the "brittle piece...snap cleanly away" are metaphoric rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—Elara's need to reconnect—is signaled early, but escalation occurs off-page across seven days of weaving. The nest discovery provides one on-page tightening, yet the installation's construction is summarized rather than dramatized, and Mara's return feels coincidental (drawn by "rumors") rather than earned by Elara's agency. The final image of lovers leaving offerings reweights the temple's function, but the cost of the choice—what Elara risked or forfeited by building publicly—is asserted, not shown.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—stop the cosmic entities before the pulsar alignment peaks—is signaled early and tightened by the seventeen-minute window. The subsonic broadcast creates a meaningful reversal: mob pauses, armbands come off. The visible cost is clear: equipment sparks, transmitter pushed beyond capacity, community left fractured. However, the tricksters' attention turning toward Elena ("pressure like thumbs pressed against her temples") promises escalation that never materializes into a concrete tactical problem she must solve, leaving the climactic ninety seconds feeling more like endurance than a decision that forecloses options.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—retrieve the irrigation key to end winter hunger—is signaled in paragraph one and drives all choices. Escalation tightens causally: organ music provides a window, music falters, walls close, she strikes with the compass, gears lock. Agency is clear: her decision to wait rather than charge, then to calculate and strike at the precise angle. The cost is legible on the page: she faces her claustrophobic terror and wins through "measured defiance," and the village's forced dormancy can now end.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—solving the heiress's disappearance—is signaled early and pursued consistently. Elara's descent into the quarry and methodical cross-referencing provide a single meaningful tightening when she discovers the ribbon's true source. However, the escalation is largely internal (awakening empathy) and asserted rather than tested through on-page choices with visible trade-offs. The rival's guilt and the silent witness emerge late without prior complication, reading as a revelation delivered rather than a pressure point Elara must navigate with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—vindicating Captain Mara Venn—is signaled early and held throughout. Elara's decision to transmit the decoded stanzas constitutes one meaningful tightening, narrowing her options to a single public act. However, escalation is thin; the decoding itself happens off-page, and the transmission encounter with the meteorologist unfolds without complication or reversal. The cost (professional risk, irrevocable speech) is declared but not tested. No live obstacle forces a trade-off at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Elias's ability to play again after trauma—is signaled early and tightens when the glass flake and scaffold guide him to a choice. The final act (playing until fingers bleed) forecloses the path of silence with visible cost. Pressure accumulates through accumulative imagery until the causal turn, fitting the hybrid lens. Yet the hitchhiker and scaffold wrap operate as external coincidence rather than obstacles Elias must overcome through agency, which limits the felt weight of his decision and keeps escalation from reaching the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—comprehension versus escape—signals early and drives the reflective arc. The piece delivers one meaningful deepening: Elias's recognition that "both had extracted value from movement" tightens his understanding and narrows options (he can no longer hide in the illusion of legitimate difference). Agency is renunciation—leaving the train sanctuary—with visible cost (forgoing the hermitage). Under Accumulative lens, the tightening is sufficient, but the protagonist remains observer of his own pattern rather than tested by an external pressure that forces a trade-off. No reversal or complicating event escalates stakes mid-piece.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake (decode temple inscriptions to understand her brother's death and heal others) is signaled early, but escalation is minimal. Elara observes stars, makes connections, writes in her logbook—each step is additive rather than a tightening that narrows options or forces a trade-off. The "understanding dawns" moment is a cognitive arrival, not a reversal or deepening driven by her agency. No live option is foreclosed; she simply gains insight and then acts on it without visible cost. The piece accumulates atmosphere and thematic weight but lacks the pressure arc required for higher conflict scores.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—freeing the trapped confession—is clear early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the vortex resists and Elara shifts from motion to stillness. However, the escalation is passive: the seed resolves the ice barrier without Elara making a high-cost choice. The "warlike serenity" stance feels declarative rather than a dramatized trade-off, and no visible price (stamina, tool, social cost) alters her later tactics or charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: restore the timeline before full dark. One meaningful tightening occurs when the roots release and the glade rotates, narrowing the window. However, the escalation is largely environmental (light fading, glade shifting) rather than driven by protagonist choice under competing costs. Kael's realization ("It's eclipsed") arrives as insight rather than through struggle. The time constraint ("until full dark") provides urgency but is not tested on the page—they reach the intersection without visible sacrifice or tactical trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—reversing his sister's death—is signaled early and tightens through accumulation: the burned card's return is a "verdict rather than a gift," each sign in the orchard translates "his own death sentence," and the heart-tree's recognition of "the currency of fate" forces the final trade. The escalation operates through textural deepening rather than causal reversals, consistent with the Accumulative lens: Elias moves from observation to interpretation to physical binding. His agency drives the peak choice ("Take mine... Give hers back") and the cost is unmistakable—trammeled ankles and wrists, transformation into guardian, acceptance that his sister cannot return. The resolution earns its quiet power through prior buildup, though the tree's mechanics remain somewhat opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: authenticate the cloth with the kid's future depending on the verdict. One meaningful tightening occurs when the photograph arrives, narrowing Marcus's options and forcing the mercy-versus-precision choice. The choice forecloses the path of rigid expertise with visible cost (Marcus's professional integrity compromised by knowingly declaring uncertain provenance as genuine). Under the Situational lens, pressure coheres. Deduction: the choice feels somewhat externally motivated by the kid's desperation rather than fully earned by Marcus's arc; the internal wrestle could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding Arishti's transition rather than retrieving her—is clear and provides a meaningful deepening of what "reestablish" means. The seed's cracking constitutes one reversal that narrows options (the warning forces Elias to complete the journey himself). However, escalation unfolds largely through exposition about what he "understood" rather than through on-page choices that test commitment with visible trade-offs. The final dissolution reads as philosophical acceptance more than agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—preserving migrating identities—is signaled early, but escalation is absent. The identities arrive, resist briefly, then surrender without meaningful pressure or cost that narrows options. The librarian's moon-phase weakness is mentioned but does not force a tactical trade-off or complication. No reversal or tightening occurs; the smelting completes as planned. Coincidence does not resolve, but protagonist agency does not drive a turning point either.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake: whether to preserve or erase the bunker's location. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara's finger hovers over the delete key, forcing a trade-off. The ritual that follows (crowning the stalagmite) enacts her choice with visible cost (professional breach, physical exposure in thinning air), but the escalation is more contemplative than pressured—her "heartbeat of hesitation" suspends rather than tightens. The oligarch's off-page confessions supply thematic weight without on-page antagonistic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is legible early: Maya seeks self-forgiveness after her sister's death. Pressure tightens when the graffiti reveals coordinates to the accident site, forcing her to confront avoidance. Playing the accordion with its patched bellows becomes an on-page test of whether she can navigate damage without suppression, narrowing her options to either continued flight or confrontation. The ending choice to visit the coordinates tomorrow forecloses the path of anesthesia with visible emotional cost. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—map the unspoken lexicon within six hours—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or a tightening choice. The dreamer encounters no obstacle, rival, or internal dilemma that forces a trade-off. The second letter's arrival at the end is framed as "judgment" but delivers acceptance without consequence. Coincidence (mist delivery) completes the arc rather than protagonist agency, and no visible price is paid for success.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—preserve authentic provenance vs. surrender to empire—is signaled early and tightens through the temperature breach and the dawn deadline. One meaningful escalation: Elara shifts from passive documentation to active destruction/propagation, forecloses the career-safety path with visible cost. The choice between "glittering, weaponized narrative" and melting the violin into root systems narrows options decisively. Minor friction: the empire's claim is stated as fait accompli rather than dramatized as imminent arrival, slightly reducing urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: preserve the dancer's spark before neural cascade ends. One meaningful tightening occurs when "the threshold of stillness approached" and Elara must complete the capture. Agency is present (Elara's decision to press the chip, to archive it), but no live option is foreclosed—she always intended this outcome, and no complication forces a trade-off. The cost (eternal repetition) is visible in the final line but does not narrow prior tactics. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens but does not escalate through reversal, fitting mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—Elias's quest for contentment—is signaled in the opening sentence and tightens when he realizes "contentment was not a destination to be reached but a surrender." The escalation operates under the Accumulative lens: his repeated study of the pin, the climb to think better, and the decision to plant rather than preserve narrow his options with clear cost (releasing the last physical trace of his daughter). The reversal from shielding the relic to "courageous participation with the endless wheel" forecloses his prior path. Agency is present but contemplative; the planting is decisive yet feels more like a ceremony than a fraught struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Elias's need to shed the cloak's accumulated toxicity—is signaled by the end of the first third. One tightening occurs when he climbs and unhooks the cloak, but the cartographer's problem (absolute conviction vs. nuance) is summarized rather than tested in live conflict. The unhooking forecloses continued false absolution, yet the cost is more conceptual than visceral; Elias will greet the client "with sincerely insincere warmth," suggesting continuity rather than transformation. No on-page reversal narrows options under immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—teaching future scholars by encoding wisdom in the grotto—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, no on-page escalation or tightening occurs; the researcher never faces a choice that narrows options or costs him a visible sacrifice. The "delayed revelation" about his purpose is framed as understanding rather than a turn that alters tactics. Under the Accumulative lens, the piece needed a density break or pattern shift that reweighted cost; instead it layers similar insights without pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—learning to navigate without moving—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through textural density (centuries, dust, pulse seeking) rather than conflict escalation. One meaningful deepening occurs: the skimmer's realization that the arrowhead is a compass and stillness is travel. However, there is no on-page reversal or tightening that narrows options through protagonist agency; the insight arrives through contemplation and bird observation, not a choice under pressure. Cost is present (he will be buried, becoming stone himself) and legible at closure, but the escalation is conceptual rather than driven by stakes-testing action. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening suffices, but agency is low.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: Elias's search for purpose in a system that measures worth by efficiency. One meaningful tightening occurs when he discovers the keystone and unstraps, forecloses his path within the system with visible cost (dissolution of the gantry, loss of certification). Agency is renunciation—choosing obsolescence over automation—with cost legible on the page. Escalation reads as deepening under the Accumulative lens; the lingering luminance motif and the unstrapping action narrow options and reweight his worth. No multiple reversals are needed at this length; the single turn is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—discovering synesthetic proof—is signaled by paragraph nine and drives the descent. One meaningful tightening: the convergence of sky lanterns creates the chromatic resonance his grandmother theorized. Agency is limited; Elias waits for cosmic alignment rather than forcing a choice under pressure. The final image reweights his twelve-year routine, but coincidence (lantern festival timing) enables rather than complicates, and no visible tradeoff or renunciation occurs on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—ignite expansion or remain a singularity forever—is signaled early and escalates through Elena's methodical attempts (distilling static, casting lots, tuning frequency). The tightening occurs when "the alignment locked" and the observatory unfolds, a meaningful deepening driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens. Cost is present but conceptual: her doubt "preserved like a fossil" and her coins becoming "valid currency in a newborn universe" reweight prior material without a visceral trade-off that would push into the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (naming nameless fears to navigate grief) is signaled in paragraph three and tightens when the beam crystallizes the monsters, giving geometry to sorrow. Agency is present but muted: the reaper performs the ritual rather than choosing against competing options. The crystallization forecloses his prior paralysis (three centuries of non-function) with conceptual cost—accepting that his beloved is irrecoverable except as named constellation. Pressure accumulates under the Accumulative lens via density and image-layering, but no on-page reversal tests his commitment; the ritual succeeds without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—reversing the ocean's disappearance—is clear from the opening. Pressure accumulates through the drip count and Elara's realization at drop 900 that she must "reawaken the memory of sound" rather than force the seas back. The bell's strike and the subsequent seep constitute one meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens. Cost is implied through her endless vigil, though the protagonist's agency at closure reads more as endurance than a trade-off that forecloses a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving drowned Millhaven's true history before the rains return—is signaled early and tightens through the photograph trail leading to the sapphire label with its damning date. The accumulative pressure builds: each image reweights the "precisely humane" official narrative. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elias recognizes the label and recalls Sarah Chen's death, shifting his purpose from dam maintenance to historical witness. Cost is conceptual (carrying the town's silence) but legible in the final image. No overt antagonist, consistent with Situational/Accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—harmonizing logic and intuition—is signaled early and sustained through closure. Pressure accumulates via sensory density and the recurring motif of the starlings' patterns, but no on-page reversal narrows Elara's options or forces a trade-off. The transformation unfolds without agency: the crystal glows in response to "alignment," the flame is "released" with a whispered word, and the horse transforms first, externalizing the change. No visible price is paid; the final paragraph asserts balance achieved without forfeiting a method, belief, or path. Escalation reads as thematic deepening rather than tactical tightening or a choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake is Kael's survival/trust preservation, signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening: detecting the micro-fracture and revising the clip angle by three degrees narrows options causally, carrying him past the rogue thermal. The escalation is driven by Elara's agency (revision, positioning, emergency anchor readiness) with visible cost (the "burden of the watcher," breath held, muscle memory under pressure). No antagonist required; coincidence (sulfuric mist, thermal) complicates but does not resolve. The resolution is earned by her calculations and the chute blooming as predicted.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—defeating emotional numbness—is signaled early and coheres throughout. The piece delivers one meaningful deepening when Maya realizes synthesis (not rejection or surrender) is required, then opens the jar and presses her forehead to the tissue. That act forecloses the path of remaining hollow, and the tears register a felt cost. However, the escalation reads as philosophical realization rather than a sequence of narrowing tactical choices under mounting pressure, limiting entry to the higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: restore lost laughter to the household. The stake is signaled early and maintained. However, escalation is weak: Elias pulls the cord, it works, laughter arrives—no reversal, no live option foreclosed, no visible price paid that alters tactics. The mechanism succeeds on first attempt without obstacle or cost that narrows choices. Under Accumulative lens, one deepening (maceration) reweights the silence, but the lack of friction or trade-off prevents entry into higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—whether to return home or remain in the liminal garden—is signaled early via the pendant and "dimensionally homesick." The piece offers one meaningful tightening when the pendant appears and "showed her the doorway home," but the protagonist's refusal is presented as already-achieved insight ("she understood that she had been waiting not for rescue but for permission to remain undefined") rather than a live, pressured choice with visible cost. No on-page reversal tests her commitment; she sits, practices interiorizing, and decides without friction. The resolution is her own stance crystallization, but luck (the pendant's convenient appearance) frames the problem rather than her decisions driving escalation, and the "ache had become a form of hospitality" reads as retrospective summary.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: interrupt a stifling destiny by transforming the crozier. Escalation proceeds through successive approximation with three distinct attempts (too hot/ash, preserved shape/killed spirit, precise threshold/genesis), each narrowing options. However, the pivotal insight—"preserve function as symbol" versus "release potential as vessel"—arrives as sudden clarity rather than being forced by prior failure, weakening causal pressure. The final transformation feels more like discovery than a choice with visible trade-off; no live option is foreclosed with felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—proving the "beginning in every ending" cosmic signal—is signaled early and sustained. The lunar perigee tightens the window for the attempt, and Elara's choice to discard protocol by placing the fragment directly on the oscillator constitutes one meaningful reversal that narrows options. However, the escalation lacks visible trade-off or loss: no failed prior attempt on the page, no dramatized risk of the towers collapsing, no mention of what happens if she's wrong. The predecessor's death is backstory, not present pressure. The resolution feels like puzzle-unlock rather than a choice with felt sacrifice, keeping this in mid-band despite coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—merge timelines before infinite isolation—is declared but never tested through a live decision where failure is possible. Elias acts without friction: the radio works, the hourglass points, passengers comply, the grotto releases them. No reversal, no tightening choice, no visible price paid. The child in the yellow coat "collapses into one" without cost to Elias or trade-off in method. Escalation is scenic accumulation (one passenger, then another) rather than narrowing options or raising stakes under the inferred Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—discovering the texture of connection—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. Escalation under the Accumulative lens consists of layering weaving actions and philosophical claims rather than a meaningful tightening of options or rising cost. The final "eruption" and dissolution feel inevitable by thematic assertion rather than earned through protagonist choices that foreclose alternatives. No on-page reversal or decision point forces Elara to trade one good for another; the transformation proceeds without visible resistance or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—survival through navigation to fertile worlds—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, escalation is minimal: Mara teaches, calculates, observes the alignment, and orders departure in a linear progression without meaningful reversal or complication. The cost of leaving (abandoning their refuge, risking passage through dimensional membranes) is declared but not tested on the page. No on-page resistance, failed attempt, or character who questions the plan creates friction; the path from problem to solution is frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—protecting Mrs. Gable's testimony—is signaled early but shifts abruptly to rescuing Thomas without a bridging choice that narrows options. Elena's descent is declared ("should have waited for backup") but not tested; no on-page obstacle complicates her movement. The pulses intensify as a tracking device, yet Thomas's presence is revealed by his voice, not by Elena's active pursuit under pressure. One tightening occurs (the voice crackling), but the final rescue lacks a visible trade-off or tactical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: to witness and free the unremembered researchers. The descent tightens spatially and emotionally, culminating in Mara stepping into the phase transition—a renunciation of her claustrophobia that forecloses her former self. However, the researchers' release feels coincident with her arrival rather than driven by a difficult choice she makes in the chamber; luck completes the arc rather than protagonist agency. The cost is visible (she carries the silence forever) but the escalation lacks a peak decision that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding and reversing her administrative erasure—is clear from the outset. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elara realizes the error was systemic, not random, and she integrates the ghost, completing her arc from survivor to "simply living." Agency is present in the defragmentation sequence, though the mechanics feel more atmospheric than fraught; no live choice with visible tradeoff appears until the final integration. The cost (trusting rhythm, ending enumeration) is conceptual and felt, fitting the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake (preserve dying language) is signaled early and sustained. Pressure tightens via the offstage elder's approaching death, but that deadline never lands with visible urgency or alters on-page tactics. The protagonist's agency appears in the final act (speaking the creation myth), yet the resolution unfolds without a dramatized cost or trade-off that narrows her options beforehand. One meaningful deepening occurs when the diamond responds to her footsteps, but escalation remains atmospheric rather than driven by protagonist choices that foreclose paths.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—Elena hunting the Weightless Laugh and deciding whether to complete her transformation—is signaled early but never tightens into a forced trade-off. The phone call and arrowhead levitation occur without resistance or competing pressure; Elena's choice to laugh and metamorphose feels inevitable rather than earned through a visible narrowing of options. No on-page reversal tests her commitment; coincidence (the phone crackling to life "tonight") enables rather than complicates. The cost of sealing herself underground is mentioned but not felt as a specific loss of surface relationships, sunlight, or research purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.7)
    One dominant stake (reawaken wild growth vs. mechanical order) escalates through a single decisive tightening: Elara's music triggers the orchard's rebellion and statues' hesitation. The protagonist's action (playing) drives the turn with visible cost (bridge destabilizes, shell crumbles). However, the statues' shift from programmed guards to wonderers lacks a prior micro-reversal that tests their susceptibility—they simply "stood frozen" when the music reminded them of mountains, making the climax feel authored rather than earned by earlier friction.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—delivering letters across the drone border—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening: the three-minute thunderstorm window narrows options and forces speed. Agency is present (Marek twists the cap, deposits letters), but the escalation is tactical rather than raising existential cost; the piece treats this as routine ("practiced speed," "duty complete") rather than a night where new consequences crystallize. The resolution feels habitual—he's done this before and will do it again—so the cost remains abstract (families reunited off-page) rather than a visible price Marek pays tonight.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: reclaiming voice/carousel craft through the halo fragment. The wrong turn into the hidden oasis provides one meaningful tightening; touching the fragment unlocks his voice with immediate on-page consequence (he sings, the fragment vibrates, ferns unfurl). However, the escalation is more lyric accumulation than contested pressure—no antagonist, no external opposition, and the cost (thirteen years) is historical rather than paid in present friction. The piece meets the Accumulative lens standard but the protagonist's struggle is primarily internal and summative.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=4.1)
    Dominant stake (reawaken grandmother's story) is signaled early but never tested by opposition, cost, or a difficult choice. No on-page reversal or tightening; Elena's three-year calculation pays off without friction. The reawakening occurs via wrapping the scarf—an action that lacks agency since no live decision or trade-off is dramatized. Pressure remains static; each beat is a step in a predetermined sequence rather than escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—recapturing the dream to fill the "hollow space"—is signaled early, but escalation is absent. Elara faces no meaningful tightening or reversal; the dream "appeared at the edge of her lens" and "stepped into the watercolor" without resistance. Agency is minimal: she performs a ritual (painting with light) that succeeds on the first attempt with no visible tradeoff. The Accumulative lens requires a meaningful cadence shift or deepening; here, the final beat mirrors the setup without reweighting cost or narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—freeing the trapped idea—is signaled early and pressure accumulates through the spinning ritual that disorients fear. One meaningful tightening occurs when "the fear tried to anchor itself in certainty" but stumbles against Vey's movement. Cost clarity is weak: the ribbon snaps and the idea escapes, yet no visible price (stamina, social credit, forfeited path) alters Vey's later options or stance, leaving escalation more thematic than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—recovering Lila's stolen memories—is signaled early and sustained. Elena's agency is clear: she chooses to step into the ring after understanding its pattern, breaking her own observational habit. The escalation is modest but present: three decades of study culminate in one decisive act. The cost is visible (the ring withers, the habit shatters), though the reunion itself lacks friction or complication that would deepen the final image. The compass as a disruptor introduces a tactical constraint, but the ring's capitulation feels swift.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—whether the shadow is ready for reversible exile's return—is signaled early and tightens through tea-leaf readings that chart growth. The hammer-lift beat crystallizes the test; Elara's refusal ("Not today... But soon") narrows options and forces waiting with visible cost. The three-week ellipsis deepens rather than repeats, and the final shattering is protagonist-driven with the shadow's hands-upward gesture as the enabling choice. Cost is unmistakable: "Walk forward... And never look back unless you need to remember how far you've come."

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—preserving wonder's color—is signaled early and remains coherent. Escalation is thin: the gray lands "reach" but Elian "dances backward" without visible loss; the seed grows hot and the tree erupts without complication. No on-page reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off. The resolution lands via Elian's action, but agency reads as effortless competence rather than choice under pressure. Cost is thematic (children's dreams restored) but not felt in Elian's own forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—grounding the twelve spirits—is signaled early and pursued methodically. Pressure accumulates through the unraveling ritual: each knot releases a ghost, and silence gathers in Mira's fractures, deepening the cost with each spirit freed. The textural escalation is visible (six spirits by the fourth hour, starlight sharpening, her confession spilling out), but the resolution is a willing transformation rather than a forced trade-off. Agency is present as endurance and acceptance, though the final cost (becoming the net) is accepted without on-page resistance or visible renunciation struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—interpret encoded secrecy with empathy—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through investigation (tear/notation, archival film, subsidence clue, excavation, chapel discovery) and tightens when she must choose how to document the space. The final choice (leave the map torn, preserve silence) forecloses professional completion with felt cost. However, no external antagonist or resource constraint tests her resolve; the escalation is intellectual discovery rather than forced tradeoff. One deepening suffices for this length and lens, but higher bands typically require a more visceral price or competing obligation.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: Julian seeks the transmission to understand release/letting go. One meaningful tightening occurs when he unlocks the globe at thirty-seven Hertz and receives the captain's message, which narrows his understanding and forces a choice about extraction versus preservation. The decision to leave the globe carries visible opportunity cost—he's documented it but forgone physical salvage. Weakness: the escalation is more conceptual than pressured; Julian faces no significant obstacle or competing pull that would raise the stakes of his choice.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—encoding a message to free the ghost—is signaled early but escalation is minimal. Elara's encoding proceeds without reversal, complication, or visible cost; the ghost "responds" cooperatively, the graffiti "lights up in sequence," and the outcome is mutual understanding without trade-off. No persistent constraint shapes tactics; the flower press bolt plate clicks into place without resistance. The resolution grants closure (map to other courtyards, ghost's freedom) without dramatized price or foreclosed path, reading as wish-fulfillment rather than earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: understanding the captain's interior life and, implicitly, her own future in his role. Pressure accumulates through the diary's revelations, tightening as she recognizes not tragedy but "cartographer of dualities." The alignment of cipher wheels at floor four and the removal of goggles at floor eight create meaningful beats that narrow interpretation. Agency is attention and inheritance—she chooses to read with "affectionate detachment" rather than household gossip's frame. Closure cost is legible: she accepts the captain's burden, knowing survival requires studying one's pain with curiosity, foreclosing any naïve ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake is philosophical: to "prove that empty spaces remember." This is declared early but never tested by opposition or scarcity. No reversal or tightening occurs; Elara begins resigned to drift and ends calmly asleep, rescued. The knot-tying is repetitive description, not escalation. Agency is attention and interpretation, which can succeed in accumulative designs, but here no on-page choice narrows options or imposes visible cost. The "quietly explosive grief" and "moment of release" are told as metaphor, not dramatized as pressure that alters her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—mirror the sunrise inside the walls before demolition—is signaled immediately and tightens through the ticking clock: "the hush before destruction," "waiting for the legal hour," "first gray light." Elara's agency is visible in withdrawing pigments, decoding the coin, climbing, and applying paint with "fractally precise strokes." The tightening occurs as she works "through the concept of limits" and reaches the edge of what her cortex can process. However, the prophetic success ("the exact shades she had anticipated") undercuts tension; the wrecking ball becomes backdrop rather than genuine threat since she completes the work and walks away satisfied. Cost is present—she loses the library, seals knowledge inside—but the triumph overshadows the sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—decoding the Aurora Archives location—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, escalation is minimal: Elara encounters no meaningful obstacle, reversal, or trade-off. The starlings cooperate, the phrasebook reveals its secrets, the hopscotch grid confirms her hypothesis—each step affirms rather than complicates. The "purple hours of night" compress the decoding work into summary, and the final achievement ("her motivation...finally satisfied") arrives without visible cost or a path foreclosed. One tightening or deepening choice under pressure is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—learning the rhythm to repair the sky-clock and save her village from frozen time—is signaled early and remains clear. However, escalation is atmospheric rather than tactical: Elara encounters groaning shelves, a spiral staircase, and infinite reflections, but none narrow her options or force a trade-off. The climactic moment (uncapping the vial) triggers automatic assembly; the gears "click into alignment with the precision of understanding rather than force," but Elara's agency is observational. No reversal tests her commitment, no apparent solution generates new complications, and no visible price alters later tactics. The resolution is granted rather than earned through difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake (long-term atmospheric survival) is declared but never tested by a competing cost or narrowed option. The midnight assembly proceeds without friction, obstacle, or dissent. Thomas's instructions guide rather than pressure; Mara's leadership faces no resistance. The nebula blooms as described, validating effort without visible trade-off. No reversal or tightening moment forecloses a live alternative or dramatizes a price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—ensuring a peaceful ending to existence—is signaled early but remains abstract. No opposing force or constraint tests Elara's resolve; she executes a ritual she has prepared for centuries without obstacle, adaptation, or cost-driven choice. The tightening is textural (the clock "approaching the hush") rather than a narrowing of options. Agency is present (she chooses to sing) but the act does not foreclose a dramatized alternative or pay a visible price that alters tactics. The ending reconfigures tone but not stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (guide travelers to safety) is signaled early and tightens when the birds dive and the frost forms. The reversal—mechanical birds thwarted by the vibration plate, then the pruning hook—is protagonist-driven. Cost is visible: exhaustion, resumption of her reluctant vigil. However, the middle sags slightly with exposition about the blueprint and brother's backstory, delaying pressure buildup until the travelers appear.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—translating separation into connection, moving from grief-as-constriction to understanding—is signaled early and pressured through accumulative observation. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elena traces foam patterns and recognizes Maya's scherzo rhythm, shifting her understanding of their argument from betrayal to "necessary choreography." Agency manifests as sustained attention that reweights meaning, appropriate to the Accumulative lens. However, no live option is foreclosed with visible cost; Elena's decision to design the new polymer is additive rather than a trade-off. The grief "loosens fully" without dramatized resistance or price paid for this release beyond three years of waiting.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—reaching the origin point of stories—is signaled early but never tightens into a forced trade-off until the final paragraph. Elara measures and calculates, yet no measurement fails or forces a revised tactic; the parole flickers as warning but doesn't block her physically or test resolve mid-scene. The incision and threshold appear as results of her method rather than hard-won reversals. Cost at closure (abandoning cart and parole) is declared but not dramatized through visible hesitation or sacrifice that alters her stance incrementally.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—processing dangerous accumulated remorse to regain safe touch—is signaled early and pursued throughout. However, escalation is largely spatial (descent into pavilion) and metaphorical (kneading frozen coral) rather than driven by reversals or forced trade-offs. The tidal pools present no obstacle; the pavilion admits her without resistance; the subsumption succeeds without visible sacrifice or loss that narrows her later options. Cost is declared ("ton after ton") but not dramatized as a choice that forecloses an alternative path or imposes a felt price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=3.7)
    The dominant stake—reuniting the divided communities—is signaled early, but pressure remains static. Elara executes her plan without adaptation, obstacle, or cost; the elevators respond "immediately," and the covenant is "sealed" without dramatized resistance. No on-page reversal narrows her options or forces a trade-off between competing goods. The success is declared in summary ("successfully constructed bridges") rather than earned through a visible price paid in body, social standing, or relational cost.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—becoming "the archeologist of abandoned dreams"—is declared but never tested through on-page opposition or scarcity. No meaningful tightening occurs; Elena's mirror adjustments and "chaotically precise movements" are described as successful without cost, resistance, or trade-off. The escalation is asserted through intensifying language ("wildfire through chaparral," "crescendo") rather than through narrowing options or a decision that forecloses a live path. Coincidence does not apply, but neither does agency; the transformation "completed itself" passively, undercutting protagonist-driven closure.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (retrieve forgotten combinations before the inversion window closes) is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure tightens once: the hour-long gravity inversion creates a temporal constraint, and the seeds of vigilance test Elara's prism-minded identity. Yet the escalation unfolds without a live reversal or trade-off—Elara succeeds in each step (enters grotto, aligns doodle, memorizes sequences, takes seed) with no visible cost or forfeited option on the page. The final image ("her prism mind already calculating") gestures toward future stakes but does not dramatize a price paid in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—restoring sound—is signaled early and tightens through Elara's method (analyzing, stroking, visualizing). The piece accumulates pressure via deepening engagement rather than reversals; the hum is a breakthrough, not a crisis. Agency is present (she earns the right to strum through empathy), but the final cost is more emotional validation than a trade-off. One meaningful deepening is sufficient at this length, though the hedgehog's uncurling constraint never materializes as pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—restoring the Eclipse Covenant before the next lunar phase locks the stones—is signaled early and creates time pressure. Castian's agency is visible in his choice to move the knight along the magnetic trajectory and place the final piece, and these moves narrow his options (he must act before the phase shift). The cost is felt: exile as preparation, the worry stone splitting to reveal crystalline growth, the covenant "postponed" rather than simply restored. However, the escalation is more textural (accumulation of magnetic imagery, deepening understanding) than a sharp tightening; the piece delivers one meaningful deepening rather than multiple reversals, which fits the length but keeps it mid-7s.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (recovering "forgotten frequencies of human understanding" by opening the diary) is signaled early but remains abstract. Elio encounters no meaningful resistance; the clasp opens when he finds the correct frequency without complication, sacrifice, or trade-off. The fireworks provide atmospheric counterpoint but do not force tactical adjustments or narrow options. No credible reversal, deepening, or cost is dramatized—he succeeds at his task as planned, foreclosing no live alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.6)
    One dominant stake—successfully planting the corpse flower—is signaled early and pursued throughout. The piece provides one meaningful tightening when Elara interprets the doodles to locate the correct hollow, narrowing her options and enabling the planting. The anticipated cost (olfactory assault when the flower blooms) is declared but deferred; at closure, the visible price is minimal—she smells germination and smiles, with suffering pushed off-page into future visits. Agency reads as decisive action (she plants the seed), yet coincidence facilitates resolution: the "tide's thought" completes its cycle on cue, the seed germinates immediately, and no complication tests her commitment in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—discovering the source of resilience before gravity restores—is signaled early and tracked by the chronometer. However, the journey unfolds as a series of observations rather than escalating choices; no live option is foreclosed, and Kael faces no tactical trade-off or loss that alters her approach. The twelve-minute warning adds time pressure, but her response (calibrate sensors, dive downward) proceeds without friction or visible sacrifice. Escalation under a Causal lens requires a tightening that narrows options or raises cost; here, the inversion itself provides spectacle but not a choice-forcing crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: understand how the disaster traveled to prevent the next one. The investigation tightens through systematic survey → scorch-mark measurement → reverse-engineering the convergence point, with the patch serving as coordinate anchor. However, there's no live opposition or genuine uncertainty—Maya encounters no false leads, no physical danger that alters her tactics, no moral calculus beyond professional duty. The "knife-edge of wind shear" discovery feels inevitable rather than hard-won. Cost is present but muted: obsessive documentation is her existing MO, not a sacrifice forced by this case.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (certify wonder before midnight) is signaled early but never tightens on the page. Elara faces no reversal, no narrowing of options, no trade-off; she strikes the bells, the song transmits, the Council's instruments register wonder, success is complete. The sculptor's coincidental action enables resolution without protagonist agency driving escalation. No visible price is paid—collapse against the wall after success is fatigue, not cost that forecloses a path. Under any lens, pressure remains static from setup to resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—repairing the harmonic boundary she failed to seal three winters ago—is signaled early and sustained throughout. However, escalation is thin: Mira moves methodically through her ritual (uncasing, arranging markers, playing, stitching) without encountering resistance, constraint, or a moment where her approach must adapt. The ghost-scape vision shows her past failure but does not force a present choice; she simply "played the correction" as if executing a known score. No price is visible on the page—the rift closes, the range sighs in gratitude, and "her task complete" reads as frictionless resolution rather than a trade-off that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—deriving the mathematics of emotion—is signaled early and drives Elara's experiment. The cartographer's disorientation provides one meaningful tightening (his rigid maps become meaningless, his sorrow turns liquid), but the escalation is enacted *on* him rather than *by* protagonist agency at the climax. The cost is conceptual (he becomes a font, stars vanish) and legible in the final image, yet the price feels more announced than paid in embodied consequence, limiting the band.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—coaxing wonder from routine—is signaled early but remains abstract until the archivist encounter. The pendant's sympathetic vibration offers one pressure point that narrows options (stop vs. pass), but the germination follows without further escalation or cost to Elias. No trade-off or foreclosed path is visible; the flowers bloom, tea is shared, and he continues with newfound calm. Under the accumulative lens, one tightening is sufficient, but the lack of visible price prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—proving objects absorb emotions—is signaled early and coheres throughout. One meaningful deepening occurs when the frost sublimates and the prism heats, validating her theory. Yet Elara never faces a trade-off or live cost on the page; the revelation unfolds without resistance or failure that would test her commitment. The widow's grief is stored and released, but no reversal narrows Elara's tactics. Accumulative pressure builds atmosphere without forcing a choice that forecloses a path, capping escalation credit.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—sending a message to her lost daughter—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through repeated failures (recommencing seven times), bodily cost (bleeding fingers, tears), and the escalating demand to unravel herself. The final tightening (she must become the thread) forecloses the option of survival and delivers visible cost in the transparency/dissolution image. However, the escalation reads as declarative rather than dramatized: "she realized the latent sacrifice" tells us the price without showing Maya's hesitation or a micro-choice that accepts it. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is present, but the lack of a dramatized decision point—Maya never weighs staying alive against sending the message—reduces the felt friction. The puzzle edges "refusing to bind" until blood is offered asserts mechanical resistance rather than protagonist agency driving the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—restoring the dying orchard—is signaled early and pursued throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when the floating arch "groaned" and "the moment of transformation narrowing to a knife's edge," creating brief urgency. However, no on-page reversal or credible obstacle forces Elara to alter tactics or pay a visible price; the silk dissolves, the seeds crack, and the planet breathes without dramatized resistance or cost. Agency is present (she chooses to descend and barter), but the resolution feels granted rather than earned through struggle with legible consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering the mentor's secret—is signaled early and pursued consistently. Pressure accumulates through cyclical universe-hopping that intensifies from hours to heartbeats, and the seventh universe delivers the revelation (sabotage for mercy over hope). The choice at convergence (redirect vs. document) offers a tightening, but Elara's decision feels more like thematic acceptance than a dramatized trade-off with visible cost; we don't see what she surrenders or risks by choosing documentation over reversal. The escalation is legible under an Accumulative lens, with one meaningful deepening, but lacks the on-page price or foreclosed option that would elevate conflict clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving the anonymous communion through cairns and objects while protecting silence—is signaled early and coheres throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara decides not to add the written letter, choosing instead to seal the sea glass in the jar, forecloses direct communication with visible cost (loneliness remains). The agency is renunciation with clear price: she remains unseen and unknown. The ghosts complicate atmosphere but do not oppose her directly, so external pressure is light; escalation is driven by her internal recognition and the choice to maintain the covenant.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (prevent blank oblivion, restore textured memory) is signaled early but never tested by opposition or scarcity. Kael performs his routine without a complication that narrows options or raises cost. The "convergence of forgotten alphabets" and release of shadows proceed unopposed, yielding a resolution without visible trade-off or agency under pressure. No meaningful escalation or tightening occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding the donor's narrative gravity before the new heart fully claims her identity—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through repetitive tracking rituals that deepen rather than escalate causally; the "quietly explosive truth" detonates as insight, not conflict reversal. The final act (releasing the wing) demonstrates agency as renunciation with visible cost (letting go of the compass), but the escalation reads more as thematic intensification than a tightening that narrows live options. No antagonist or external friction tests the protagonist's commitment; the piece relies entirely on internal pressure and observation, which fits the accumulative lens but limits dramatic urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding the trees' witness—signals early and persists. Pressure accumulates through dream-mapping, but escalation is cognitive rather than choice-driven: Elara realizes sorrow is fertilizer, then enacts the insight without on-page resistance or trade-off. The pin-drop beat promises a reversal but delivers exposition. No live option is foreclosed, no tactic shifts under friction. The ending reconfigures meaning (maintenance as gardening) but lacks a dramatized cost that alters later possibilities.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—rekindling the dying realm before the last blossom fades—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara swaddles the seeds to protect photons from bleeding into darkness, raising the cost of failure. However, the escalation is textural (verse-building, wrapping, releasing) rather than tactical; no live option narrows, no competing pressure forces a trade-off. The resolution feels preordained by the ritual's mechanics rather than earned by a decision that forecloses an alternate path. The ghost-orchardists' arrival adds textural weight but no antagonistic friction.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Elias's need to preserve solitude while honoring his compassion—is signaled early and tightens when the young woman appears at the door, creating a live either/or choice. One meaningful tightening occurs: Elias must act now, and his solution (place the invitation, retreat) forecloses direct contact with visible cost. The story leans Accumulative under the lens, so escalation reads as a deepening of the paradox rather than a causal chain of reversals. Agency is present in his retreat and the weighted invitation, though the young woman's convenience (she has received the same mistaken invitation "yesterday") softens the friction. The coincidence complicates rather than resolves, which is acceptable under Situational bleed, but it also cushions the risk.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—recovering the sacred ordinary lost with the bakery—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through Mara's illicit cultivation, building toward the communal meal. The "uncloak" beat (serving the bread pudding) provides one meaningful turn that reweights the group's relationship to loss. However, escalation is gradual and atmospheric rather than urgent; no live opposition or tightening constraint forces harder trade-offs. The line "tenuous absolution" names the cost, but the piece does not dramatize a moment where Mara forecloses a path or pays a visible price. The ending's summary mode ("continued her creeping observations") diffuses rather than crystallizes stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving meaning before the Fading erases it—is signaled early and tightens when "the Fading was accelerating, the transition from illusion to memory compressing into hours rather than decades." This temporal squeeze forces Elara to increase sampling rate, a tactical shift driven by the shrinking window. The final cost is visible: vows dissolve to "statistical notation," the slide goes blank, yet "her archives full of the songs that once made people human." The pressure is largely situational (external decay) rather than protagonist-driven choice, which limits agency but maintains coherent escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—capture the betrayal before dawn—is signaled early and governs all moves. One meaningful tightening occurs when the agent's paranoia forces Mara to retreat and approach from a better angle, narrowing her window. The final coordinates scene delivers the evidence, foreclosing the lieutenant's treachery. Yet the escalation reads procedural: she circles, waits, positions—steps that repeat rather than compound. The Cost proof is present but light: Mara must race to her father, but the price she pays in fear, stamina, or social exposure is asserted ("heavy with evidence") rather than dramatized through embodied struggle or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—learning why some carry weather—is declared but never tested through on-page reversal or complication. Elara's journey culminates in the cyclone-bearer explaining the answer ("we are the transition") rather than her discovering it through pressure or cost. No escalation occurs; the forest election reaches "crescendo" off-page, the aurora brightens, and Elara's skepticism converts to purpose without forfeiting a live option. Coincidence (the convergence, the forest's convenient approval) resolves rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—escape from creative suppression—is signaled early but remains abstract; no on-page tightening narrows options with visible cost until the tunnel magically appears. The broken lock is framed as obstacle, but repair happens through late-introduced knowledge (watermark instructions) rather than protagonist struggle or sacrifice. Elara's final step through the opening is unopposed and cost-free: she leaves behind nothing she values, undermining escalation. Agency is passive discovery (finding tunnel, finding instructions) rather than decision that forecloses a live path.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake (finding lost conversations to rebuild trust) is clear and sustained. One meaningful turn occurs when Marcus's lie is exposed by the wilting leaves, forcing his admission, but this deepening doesn't narrow Aurelia's options or raise the cost of the journey. The vault opens without complication, and the letters are simply there, waiting. No visible price is paid—no forfeited resource, no trade-off, no tactical shift—undercutting the escalation requirement for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.1)
    No meaningful escalation or tightening occurs; the dominant stake (completing the bell mechanism) is stated early and then achieved without reversal, complication, or visible cost. The narrative lacks an on-page choice that narrows options or a deepening that changes knowledge—Elara executes a plan, the wind cooperates, the bells ring. The absence of agency-driven pressure or felt price at closure (she "had succeeded" with no trade-off) keeps this well below the threshold for strong conflict scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—resolve inner static without total collapse—is signaled early and tightens through one clear reversal: magnetic shift triggers memory flood, forcing Kael-9 to abandon repair in favor of controlled destruction. The burn decision narrows options (sacrifice twelve rows to save the rest) with visible cost (blackened earth, scarred dome). Under the Accumulative lens, the escalation reads as density increase and cadence shift rather than multiple plot turns, which fits the design. The coincidental magnetic shift provides the inciting complication without resolving the conflict, acceptable under Situational/Accumulative frameworks.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake (unlock the mailbox mystery before demolition) is signaled early and the timeframe (construction arrival) provides external pressure. Yet Maya's investigation proceeds without meaningful obstacle or tightening; neighbors simply share their fragments on request. The climactic mailbox opening belongs entirely to Mr. Alvarez; Maya's role as witness does not constitute protagonist agency. The foreman's unexplained pause removes the declared urgency at the moment it should bite hardest. One tightening (the time constraint) exists but does not foreclose options or exact visible cost from Maya.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—liberating the truth—is signaled early, but no opposition complicates Elara's path: dice always land favorably, journal entries always decrypt, the vault opens on cue. The piece lacks a meaningful tightening or reversal; each dance move is preparation for an inevitable success rather than a trade-off that narrows options. "Calm defiance" as tone precludes external antagonist, yet no internal doubt or resource limit (time, stamina, risk of discovery) dramatizes cost. The escalation reads as descriptive iteration rather than accumulating pressure under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—finding deleted memories—is signaled early and drives Mara's descent, but pressure never tightens through her agency. The gravity pockets and chamber's subsonic hum create atmospheric complication, yet Mara encounters no meaningful obstacle or trade-off. The coffee-ground divination leads directly to the tin box without friction. The ending offers understanding but no on-page price that forecloses a path; "nothing about her lantern lighting would ever feel routine again" is declared rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—hushing the prophecy—is signaled early but never tested. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; the summoner maps silence, releases the wing, and the hush expands without resistance that forces trade-offs. "The prophecy fought back, its coded syllables writhing" is told summary, not dramatized pressure. The resolution occurs through described technique rather than protagonist agency under cost, and coincidence (the wing becoming a compass needle) enables rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—learning the building's language—is signaled early and tightens once when Maya acquires her own seal and can "complete a sentence." However, escalation operates through accumulation (weekly sessions, growing vocabulary) rather than narrowing options or raising cost. The final act (pressing both seals) is Maya's agency, but it resolves smoothly without visible trade-off: no alternative path is foreclosed, no price paid. Under the accumulative lens, the closure reweights her relationship to the structure, but the lack of visible friction or cost limits the band. Elias as spectral tutor introduces no resistance; his "agreed upon lies" frame is thematic rather than a complicating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (archive the memory before dawn) is signaled early but escalation is purely temporal—the clock runs down—rather than driven by protagonist choices that narrow options or raise cost. The memory "fights back" by showing visions, but this complication doesn't alter Elara's tactics or force a trade-off; she simply "worked faster." No meaningful reversal or deepening choice that forecloses a path. The resolution is successful completion without visible sacrifice; she finishes the task, gains insight, and walks free. Cost is asserted thematically (isolation transformed) but not dramatized as a forfeiture or difficult choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—completing a forged peace treaty to end bloodshed—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens is more descriptive than pressurized; each beat adds detail (mixing blood, testing flourishes, sealing wax) without a meaningful tightening or trade-off. The protagonist's agency is execution of a pre-set plan rather than a choice that forecloses options with visible cost. The ending declares emotional release ("finally wept," "loosening of chains") but the on-page price—what Elara loses or risks by placing the document—remains vague.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—learning why some people echo—is signaled early and drives the descent. However, escalation under the accumulative lens depends on deepening pressure, and here the Archivists provide answers without resistance or complication. The final "decision crystallizing" lacks a visible price paid or option foreclosed on the page; Mira's stance is declared but not tested against counter-pressure. No reversal or tightening forecloses a live path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—exposing the captain's innocence and the child's survival—is signaled early, but pressure remains largely declarative. Elara's research and ghost encounter do not narrow her options or force a visible trade-off; the captain's flicker of hesitation is the lone on-page tightening, yet it dissolves without cost. The ending declares intent to "weave the truth" but does not dramatize a choice that forecloses a competing path or pays a price. Under an Accumulative lens, one meaningful intensification is required; here the pattern of dream fragments coheres intellectually but does not reweight stakes with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: to validate her philosophy that hidden patterns hold profound truth, enacted through mending and attention. The firefly revealing the unseen tear provides one meaningful tightening that tests and affirms her method. However, escalation is mild—no live option is foreclosed, no antagonistic pressure complicates her solitary work, and the resolution confirms rather than challenges her worldview. The cost is conceptual (choosing this form of devotion) but not dramatized as a trade-off that alters tactics or forecloses a competing desire on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve the orchard by repairing the stillpoint—signals early and tightens when Mara discovers the field is failing. The breakthrough (reassembled letters) and the peak action (calibrating the resonator) are protagonist-driven. Visible cost: the settlers must now learn the science, and Mara leaves her sanctuary to continue her work. One micro turn when the diamond's crack "seemed to close slightly" raises stakes without a full reversal. No antagonist beyond ignorance, which fits the debunker frame.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—shaping a new dawn using ancient shadows to complicate the prophet's rise—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, escalation is minimal: Elian listens, calculates alignment, climbs, arranges aerials, and executes the ritual without on-page resistance, mistake, or cost that narrows his options. The "variant allegiance" and the radio's shift from riddles to coordinates provide texture, but no reversal or tightening choice forces a trade-off. The ending delivers conceptual ambiguity (the prophet will rise "never quite what his followers expected") but the price—Elian's loneliness—was present from the start and does not demonstrably foreclose a path.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—reconnection with his estranged daughter—is signaled early and tightens through the music box discovery. The escalation moves from passive collection to active composition to the decision to leave, forecloses the path of continued isolation. Agency is clear in the choice to create the jar "For Her" and descend toward the city. Cost is visible: abandoning the sanctuary, risking rejection, exchanging vagrant verses for bus fare. One meaningful pressure point suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—protect the sacred artifact from shadow hunters—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure escalates as the hunters close in and Mara climbs the tower, narrowing her options to the lighthouse mechanism. However, the peak reversal (inserting the key, singing, triggering absolution) is enabled by a mechanism not previously established, weakening the sense that escalation is driven by protagonist agency under constraint. The hunters dissolve without visible cost to Mara beyond physical exhaustion; no trade-off or foreclosed path emerges to charge the resolution with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—escape from the mining consortium—is signaled early and sustained. The viaduct's six-minute window and atomic-scattering risk introduce urgency, but the narrative presents the crossing as a foregone success rather than a live test; Elara's heart pounds, yet no moment dramatizes a genuine choice under competing pressures or a reversal that narrows options. The miners follow in silence without friction, and the resolution delivers exactly what the setup promised with no visible sacrifice or adaptation required on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: Maya must investigate Elias's death while confronting his legacy and her own suppressed instincts. The discovery of the transit authority's negligence narrows her options and raises cost—she will use his clinical methods against the institution. The phone call she ignored three days prior adds retroactive weight. Agency is strong: her choice to document "with conclusions her own conscience finally authorized" forecloses her apprenticeship with visible cost. One meaningful tightening occurs when she realizes he wanted her to witness, not save him, reweighting the investigation from accident to preventable institutional death.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—clearing Marcus's name—signals early and drives Elias's visit. The storm-to-light sequence tightens pressure once, revealing the serial number and forcing the chaplain's oath. However, escalation relies on coincidence (light breaking at the precise moment) rather than protagonist agency; Elias's choices (unwrapping the heart, listening to the repairman) are passive until the final vow. The three-week repair timeline promises future cost but does not constrain the present beat. One meaningful turn with felt consequence meets baseline, but the protagonist's agency in the discovery itself is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—ring the bell the algorithm insists exists—is signaled in paragraph two and sustained throughout. Pressure tightens when the kaleidoscope shifts from geometry to text, forcing Kip to transliterate symbols that taste like copper, and the workshop shudders with "anticipation or indigestion." The final cog alignment narrows options (the arrow tip snaps off, embedding irreversibly), and the bell's resonance traveling backward through time reweights all prior effort. One lack: the story could show a cost or tradeoff during the alignment—stamina, doubt, a discarded alternative—rather than smooth execution. The stakes cohere under the Accumulative lens and the ending reconfigures meaning, but on-page friction at the decision moment would have raised this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: find where deleted files go, which merges with solving the Hermes IX mystery. Pressure accumulates through the discovery sequence—patch, numbers, coordinates—creating one meaningful tightening when she decodes "the crew had been archived." However, escalation is information-driven rather than choice-driven; Elara follows clues without facing dilemmas or trade-offs until the very end. The AI director's termination attempt is mentioned in passing without on-page resistance or cost. The broadcast decision happens off-stage between paragraphs, robbing the climax of dramatized agency and visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.6)
    The binary stake (burn orchard vs. watch nomads die) is clear, but Elara's third-path solution bypasses rather than escalates the dilemma—no live option is foreclosed with visible cost. The nomads and Council remain off-page abstractions; no secondary character applies immediate pressure or adapts to her moves. The mirror configuration offers ingenuity but lacks friction; it succeeds on first attempt without failure or tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—learning the sound of endings before her scheduled clinic appointment—is signaled early and shapes the disaster-relief trawling. The child's shoe moment provides a meaningful tightening: she hears the exhalation of surrender, the boundary dissolving. This reweights her grip on her own ending, moving from "rigid desperation" to "flexibility." The cost is conceptual rather than material, and the final choice ("keep the appointment, or she would not") remains in equipoise rather than foreclosing a path with on-page consequence. Escalation is present but the closure lacks a sharp trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake is Elena's effort to reinterpret her separation from Marcus, signaled early. The piece lacks a meaningful tightening or turn: her resistance to his philosophy is mentioned retrospectively but never tested on the page, and the "rediscovery" is entirely internal without friction or cost that forecloses a live option. The ending reconfigures her stance (stops waiting, accepts distance), but no on-page event narrows choices or forces a trade-off—she simply decides after reflection. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening reweights the stake, yet the cost remains conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving the prophet's echo before the desert swallows it—is signaled early. Pressure is declared (the clearing contracts, the desert presses in) but remains atmospheric rather than forcing a visible trade-off or narrowing options through protagonist agency. The protagonist's spiral approach and binding song proceed without dramatized resistance or cost that would test her commitment. The resolution (parapet accepts the burden, pavilion gains a harmonic) is told as accomplished rather than earned by a choice that forecloses a live alternative. No meaningful reversal or tightening narrows her options under the accumulative lens; density increases but pressure does not escalate to a legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—collective healing through archival assembly—is signaled early but never tightens or costs Elara on the page. Townspeople arrive, recognize arcs, relax shoulders, embrace; no reversal or complication tests her method or commitment. The equinox display is the culmination of assembly, not a turn that forecloses alternatives or forces a trade-off. Her departure reads as satisfaction rather than renunciation, and no visible price (time, relationship, doubt) alters her tactics mid-work.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—preservation of standardized language—is signaled early but remains abstract and untested. No on-page reversal or tightening forces Elara to trade off competing goods; she observes, tests the crystal, and places it without friction or visible loss. The act of placement is framed as testimony, but no antagonistic pressure or escalating cost shapes her decision. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is needed; the story offers thematic density without a pivot that narrows options or forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—capturing the sound of aging before forgetting erases it—is signaled early and sustained. The tightening occurs when Elias finds the convergence point and writes furiously, then the forgetting tide completes its circuit, leaving him with vibration but no language. The cost is conceptual and recursive: success equals loss. Under the Accumulative lens, this deepening is sufficient, though the circularity mutes escalation somewhat; the piece would enter higher bands if the final choice to "begin again" felt more like agency than compulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—capturing ephemeral light before the observatory fails—is signaled early, but escalation under the Accumulative lens remains diffuse. The tremors provide ambient urgency, yet no tightening choice forces Elara to sacrifice one option for another; the leaf recording solves the spinning-hand problem without visible trade-off or foreclosed path. The final transcendence reconfigures meaning but does not dramatize cost on the page—no loss, no renunciation, no visible price paid—leaving closure with conceptual charge but muted felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: execute a flawless goodbye for estranged father and daughter within a three-to-four-hour window. Elena's hymning and vinyl fragment intervention tighten pressure by transforming Maya's stance from hostile to receptive. The arrival of the scent and Maya's shift from violence to need constitute one meaningful deepening. Mr. Hale's death forty minutes later delivers visible cost and foreclosed options. The accumulative lens supports this escalation pattern cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (finding/restoring the sealed awakenings) is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when she aligns the orrery and completes the first loop, forcing the sealed awakening to rupture and revealing the preservation logic. Agency is present (she acts, adjusts her stride, completes the path) but the task unfolds without meaningful obstruction or trade-off—she succeeds on her first attempt with no visible cost beyond future labor. Under the Accumulative lens, the deepening reweights options adequately for mid-7s, but the lack of on-page friction or sacrifice caps higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—mending the fracture between taken and remaining—is signaled early and shapes Elena's choices: she kneels, sets bone, offers the tooth as compass. The bone-setting scene provides one meaningful tightening that narrows options (the changeling must trust her, the real girl must be found), and the final act of "knitting the child back into the world" pays off with visible cost (the girls' memory loss, Elena's transformation). However, the changeling's instant cooperation and the convenient reveal of the real girl's location via the tooth reduce earned escalation. Agency is present but the path feels guided rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—share light without using fire—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when she places the final blue-white shard and the pearl forms, foreclosing her old reliance on flame. The cost is visible in her kneeling and the subsidence of "old hunger," though the pressure feels more atmospheric than agonistic. Agency is present in the months-long polishing and the precise arrangement, but the climactic beat lacks a sharp either/or that would elevate escalation into the 8+ range.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: reclaiming narrative agency from public shame. One meaningful deepening occurs when she places the pendant, converting passive hiding into active ritual. The piece signals the stake early ("chewed through her private grief") and the drip/absorb pattern tightens once. No on-page complication tests her resolve—moss cooperates, no intruders appear, no internal doubt disrupts the act. Cost is conceptual (foregoing public correction) but lacks a visible trade-off or sacrifice that would raise urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—Mara's transition from novelist to witness—is signaled early but unfolds as a reflective arc rather than a contested choice. No antagonist or counterpressure tests her decision; the mist "responds" cooperatively, and the shapes "germinate" without cost. The kneeling ceremony is a single beat of intensification, but it does not narrow options or extract a visible price—she ends with "hands empty now except for the warmth," a gain rather than a trade-off. Agency reads as acceptance rather than costly renunciation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—restore the land before it forgets how to yield—is signaled early and pursued consistently. The harvest-moon alignment provides one meaningful tightening: the cosmic machinery "locking into place" narrows the window. Yet escalation feels more atmospheric than agonistic; no tactical failure or reversal tests Elara's commitment. The remedy works on first attempt without resistance, sacrifice, or complication. Agency is present (she chooses to sing), but the lack of visible cost or foreclosed option at closure weakens the pressure arc under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—completing the heartbeat-to-map translation—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, escalation is minimal: Elara arranges materials, places the plate, traces lines, and succeeds without meaningful reversal, tightening, or trade-off. The "sealing" act is framed as the culmination but no prior attempt failed or forced a tactical shift. No live cost or foreclosed option accompanies the resolution; the aurora's ripple and cold fire occur as magical confirmation rather than consequence of protagonist agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—restoring the Echo Garden's resonance—is clear and sustained across the nine-day span. Pressure accumulates through repeated observation and the technical challenge of reverse-engineering temporal physics, but escalation is gentle: no failed attempt, no moment when the mechanism resists or threatens permanent loss. The final reassembly succeeds on first try without visible cost or trade-off, undercutting the earned-stakes test for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake ("to collect the weights of different burdens") is declared but never tested; no reversal or tightening choice narrows options. The text describes a ritual that proceeds without obstacle, friction, or cost—she lights the lamp, weaves, calcifies, collects, completes. The whalebone reverie and boundary-less recursion are thematic decorations, not pressures that force agency. No escalation under any lens; the final line restates the opening condition without alteration.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: transform grief into usable form (the kettle handle). The piece operates under an accumulative lens, with one meaningful deepening as the wood "revealed its secrets" and she "carved away what was unnecessary, exposing the strength within." However, no live reversal or competing pressure tests the commitment—Mara encounters no resistance, decay problem, or technical failure. The resolution is never in doubt; she simply executes the planned task. Cost is present in the labor and solitude but lacks a moment where options narrow or a trade-off forces choice.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Mara must trade collected fragments to negotiate with her ghost—is signaled early, but escalation under the Accumulative lens is thin: she arrives, extends the wheel, confesses, and the transfer occurs without visible resistance or a second tightening. The ghost's demand ("I want your regret") shifts the terms, yet Mara's compliance comes immediately, without a live choice that narrows options. Cost is conceptual (becoming "light and translucent") rather than a visible price that alters tactics or forecloses a path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—proving the terminal can serve a new purpose—is signaled early and sustained. Maya's agency is clear: she maps, reroutes, salvages, and measures. However, no on-page obstacle forces her to pivot or trade off competing goods; the carnival's leftover pumps solve the problem without visible cost or struggle. The ending crystallizes her thesis ("Hope...was not a finite resource"), but this conceptual reweighting lacks a dramatized moment where her choice forecloses a live alternative or exacts a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: making peace with the abandoned pianist dream. The tightening occurs when Elara opens the metronome case but refuses to wind it, forecloses the dream by placing it among the quartz, and walks away with empty hands and a light heart. The deepening is accumulative: each sensory layer (petrichor, sunrise gilding brass into gold) reweights "failure into artifact." Agency is renunciation with visible cost (seventeen years of scribe work, the aching knees, the ghost tempo now silenced), and the final walk embodies the foreclosure of the pianist path.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding why her mentor lied—is signaled early ("the man who had constructed the elaborate fictions she now desperately needed to deconstruct") and tightens through discovery of the hidden engraving and realization that "every map he gave her contained deliberate distortions." The protagonist's agency drives escalation: her choice to "read the sundial by training instincts" and to "walk north-northeast" following the shadow's direction. The cost is visible: she abandons the treasure hunt and accepts that the mentor's hospital deathbed was itself a lie. The resolution is earned by her accumulated skill in "reading true terrain" from false maps. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens through pattern-teaching (each false map trained her instincts) and culminates in the journals that "explained everything...broke her heart and healed it simultaneously." One meaningful deepening—from seeking treasure to salvaging truth—narrows her options with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—preserving the storm-calming technique—is signaled early and held. However, no meaningful tightening or opposition appears; Elias approaches, decodes, and succeeds without reversal or cost. The fisherman offers no resistance, the rope yields its secret without friction, and the weavers "satisfied" consent. The piece describes escalation ("the fulgurite glass grew warm," "reached the final knot") but does not dramatize a choice that narrows options or forecloses a path. Coincidence does not resolve, but neither does agency.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding the geography of healing through writing—is signaled early and maintained throughout. Pressure accumulates via the thread ritual, the projected presence flickering, and the ink drying, but no on-page reversal forces Elian to choose between competing goods or alter tactics mid-scene. The inland journey and the thread-bracelet represent a tightening of commitment, yet the cost (leaving the palace) feels more symbolic than visceral. One meaningful deepening is present under the Accumulative lens, but protagonist agency at the turn is contemplative rather than decisional.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—reviving the extinct bird—is clear and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the assembly sequence and peaks at the shell crack. Yet the escalation is largely atmospheric; no on-page reversal tests Elian's commitment, and no competing option (e.g., abandoning the attempt, resource scarcity, risk of failure) narrows his path with visible cost. The hatch succeeds as expected, and the "bitterly sweet" knowledge that the chick inherits a mechanical world is asserted rather than dramatized as a trade-off that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—proving scars can "sing" through grafting kelp to scar tissue—is signaled early and sustained. The piece offers one meaningful action (submersion with the graft) but no on-page reversal or tightening that narrows options. Maya's plan succeeds as hoped; no complication forces adaptation. The escalation is atmospheric (deeper immersion, twenty-minute passage) rather than driven by protagonist agency under pressure. Cost is implied emotionally but not made undeniable in a choice that forecloses a live path.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—liberating memories before winter or the geese depart—is signaled early and provides coherent pressure. However, escalation is passive: Elara waits for stellar alignment rather than making a decision that narrows options or forces a trade-off. The box opens "with realistically imaginative precision" when she presses a star, but this feels mechanical rather than agency-driven; the constellation does the work. The geese resuming flight marks closure, but the consequence (memories "waiting for spring rains") defers cost rather than landing it on the page. One meaningful tightening occurs (breadcrumbs → central plaza → alignment), but the protagonist's role is observational, not transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—complete the sentinel transit and illuminate without burning—is signaled early and tightens once when Elara realizes the gear's true purpose (lantern not key), a conceptual deepening that reweights her approach and enables the final act. No reversals narrow her options under external pressure; the escalation is textural (density increase, sonar feedback, thickening petals) rather than causal. The cost at closure (dispersing into luminescence, becoming part of the pattern) is legible but oblique, more conceptual than felt, consistent with the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering the shape of collective grief—is clear and drives the protagonist's shift from mapping to retracing, a meaningful deepening under the accumulative lens. The grandmother's directive to "retrace the grief" and "follow the ribbon backward" complicates the original plan, forcing Elias to abandon his months-long mapping project with visible cost. Agency is present in the decision to tie ribbons across graves, creating a physical manifestation of connection. However, escalation is primarily conceptual rather than enacted through rising external pressure or difficult trade-offs; the grandmother's guidance enables rather than opposes, and the butterflies' departure functions as temporal marker rather than forcing constraint. The resolution reweights the opening stake but does so through accumulation and reflection rather than a high-cost choice that forecloses competing paths.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—restoring the town's temporal balance—is clear and consistent. However, escalation is minimal: Elias faces no present opposition, the pendulum pause occurs as predicted, and his adjustment succeeds without complication. The story's pressure accumulates backward through memory rather than forward through rising obstacles. The cost (forty years of cataloging errors) is summarized rather than tested in scene; we see no moment where Elias risks failure or must choose between competing goods. Under the Accumulative lens one meaningful deepening suffices, and the tide-crest timing provides mild urgency, but the lack of on-page friction or reversal caps the score.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—why her ancestor abandoned wealth to garden graves—is signaled early and sustained. Mara's decoding narrows options (she eliminates the sovereign case as misdirection), but no live alternative is foreclosed with on-page cost. The discovery reweights her daily work without altering her external tactics or imposing a visible price. The "quickening heart" and decision to "listen differently" function more as recognition than a tightening that forces a trade-off. Under an accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is sufficient, yet the resolution feels intellectually complete rather than earned through pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—seeding innovation within the Obsidian Order's seven-prophecy constraint—is signaled early but never tested on the page. No reversal or tightening occurs; Elara begins with predictive models, writes, and finishes without obstacle, friction, or visible price paid. The piece asserts "bifurcation point" and "sustainable change" but does not dramatize a choice between competing goods or a trade-off that forecloses an option. Agency is absent: Elara's act of writing is described as complete and successful with no moment where her decision alters tactics or costs her something legible.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=4.2)
    The dominant stake—to reanimate narrative after the story famine—is signaled early but never tested by on-page opposition or a choice that narrows options. Elias's method succeeds without friction: dust swirls, musicians weep, the famine ends. No reversal, tightening, or visible price appears; the resolution is summarized as fait accompli ("scholars studied," "children touched") rather than earned through a protagonist decision with cost. Escalation is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—transforming his mother's memory into permanent artifact—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elias realizes "safety had always been a mirage" and later when he sees "to crystallize a fleeting emotion was to acknowledge it would never return." However, escalation is largely internal and iterative; the scattering ritual unfolds in prescribed steps without a reversal that narrows options mid-scene. The final act (removing the mask) closes the ritual but does not present a choice between competing goods or unavoidable harms. Pressure accumulates through repetition and density rather than tightening agency.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.9)
    One dominant stake—preserving precision against the councils' narrative—is signaled early and tightened when the cog's discovery forces Elias to "agonize." The decision to excavate rather than debate is protagonist-driven and forecloses the path of surface resistance with visible cost (isolation, ongoing danger from rising water). The final beat's refusal to move papers under tidal threat demonstrates escalation through accumulative pressure and stance crystallization. No reversal artifice; the deepening is earned by prior constraint (councils' power, the plague's memory, sedimentary metaphor).

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is clear: teaching reconciliation through the old songs. One meaningful tightening occurs when the miner's daughter plays, choosing "absence instead of assertion," and the refugee joins in restraint. However, escalation is primarily thematic accumulation rather than a dramatized reversal that narrows options. The cost—potential failure, hatred proving "too loud"—is felt but remains abstract; no concrete loss or trade-off visibly alters later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—planting the knowledge fruit seed—is signaled early but never faces a meaningful test or complication. The "pruning" of accumulated trauma is summarized in one paragraph of meditative release without resistance, micro-reversal, or visible cost. The eclipse's once-in-a-lifetime timing is declared but does not tighten the window or force a trade-off. The seed's immediate growth at the end resolves the goal without prior escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving wonder against corporate scrubbing—is signaled early but never tested by an on-page antagonist or consequence. The engineer's arrival does not create a reversal; she simply accepts Elias's truth without resistance. No visible cost is paid: Elias hands over the bee and smiles, unchanged. Under the accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is present (the bee stirs in response to the engineer's bioelectricity), but this lacks the causal pressure or foreclosed option required for higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (understanding why houses feel alive) is signaled in the opening and drives Maya's method throughout. The tightening occurs when cataloged wrongnesses "coalesce like salt forming on glass" into the realization that houses are listening, then deepens when she finds the crystallized silence shard beneath the foundation. Her final gesture—placing the orris root beside the shard—is agency-driven and forecloses the path of passive observation: "through her attention, consecrated the boundary where architecture becomes entity." The cost is visible in the cottage's shiver of recognition and the knowledge that her witness has made them "more so" alive, altering the relationship permanently. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening with felt consequences satisfies escalation requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—animating the petrified philosophy by threading ambivalence through the neural network—is signaled early and tightens once when Corvin shatters the ampoule and projects telepathy, forcing the garden's roots to spiral and question. The escalation reads under the Accumulative lens as a density shift (purple smoke, cascading logic, photon question marks) that reweights rigidity into complexity. The cost is legible (the garden shudders, certainty dissolves) but Corvin's final stance is receptive waiting rather than a trade-off that forecloses an alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (escape the staircase via acceptance of imperfection) is signaled early and tightens through the proof-writing beat. The reversal—abandoning observation to break the cycle—arises from her agency (the equation, dice placement) with visible cost (forfeiting the infinite climb, stepping into the fissure). Under an accumulative lens, pressure coheres through density increase and the pattern-break of asymmetry. However, the escalation leans conceptual rather than embodied; her "trembling knees" and bleeding fingernails don't alter tactics on the page, and the choice to write proofs feels inevitable from the start rather than a risk forced by narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—proving that strangers remember kindness through painting extinct words—is signaled early but never contested. Maya paints vision after vision without obstacle, error, or choice that narrows options. The waxing moon provides atmosphere but no ticking constraint; dawn's arrival is noted but does not force a trade-off or alter her plan. The piece delivers density and accumulation but lacks a moment where Maya's agency forecloses an alternate path with felt cost, per the Accumulative lens's requirement for a cadence shift that reweights the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—rescuing dying arts before isolation or flood erases them—is signaled early and coheres. The beekeeper's departure raises urgency, and the bread-coordinate discovery tightens knowledge. However, escalation is modest: Elara moves from solo observation to gathering elders to solo documentation without a visible trade-off or price paid. The glacial dam and winter threat remain ambient rather than forcing a narrowing choice, and the final act feels additive rather than renunciatory.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—escaping predetermined death—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the low tide completes and the stone absorbs moonlight, narrowing Elara's window. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens relies on conceptual intensifiers ("time did not stop; it reversed") rather than on-page friction or visible trade-off. Agency is present in the decision to mount the stone and step into the beam, but the cost of transcendence—"absolute uncertainty," "no future"—is told rather than dramatized through a foreclosed path or visible loss. The transformation reads as unopposed, reducing the felt price at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (escaping the photographic curse and screaming dead) is signaled early. One meaningful turn occurs when Mara shifts from resisting to confessing, but the mechanism by which confession defeats fear is told ("fear cannot exist where there is nothing left to hide") rather than shown through tactical constraint or visible cost. The advisor's guidance feels coincidental rather than a choice Mara wrestles with under pressure. The final action (unpinning the clasp) narrows options, but the price—what she loses by unburdening—remains abstract rather than concretely legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—transforming the storm into music—is signaled early and sustained. However, escalation is largely metaphorical: "faster," "roared back," "final wave" describe intensity without narrowing options or forcing trade-offs. The storm "roared" but she simply "roared back"; no tactic shifts, no cost paid for each attempt. The resolution ("the storm...ceased to be an enemy") is declared rather than earned through a visible choice that forecloses a competing path. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening occurs (rain becomes collaborator), but pressure remains abstract and the protagonist never faces a genuine obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding and contacting the watchers—is signaled early and escalates through Elara's preparation, the whistle's geometric sound, and the sky's rupture. One meaningful tightening occurs when the watchers turn, narrowing Elara's options to transcendence or documentation. Agency is visible in her choice to play the sequence and then blow the new note, though the final decision (to become part of the pattern) is more inferred than dramatically weighed with visible trade-offs on the page. The lost expedition's fate reframes the stakes conceptually but doesn't complicate Elara's tactical choices mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to expose or protect the myth—is signaled early and narrowed by Elena's research across the platform. One meaningful tightening occurs when she types her response, choosing publication with reframing. However, the escalation is conceptual rather than embodied in scene pressure; no live opposition tests her commitment, and the editor's question arrives via buzzing phone rather than dramatic friction. The final cost (carrying the letter, constructing a memorial, risking chaos) is outlined in exposition but not shown as a forfeited alternative or visceral trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—documenting the pavilion before collapse—is signaled early but never tested. Elara encounters no obstacles, time pressure, or trade-offs; she completes her survey as planned. The corroded door offers momentary physical resistance but opens without consequence. Under the Accumulative lens, one would expect density to reweight the stake or cadence to shift at closure, but the ending merely restates her commitment without a visible cost or narrowed option.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: trace honest origins of forged land-deeds. One meaningful tightening occurs when microscopic scoring marks don't match known seals, forcing Elias to "reconsider the entire indexing system." The discovery of the authentication manual escalates understanding and leads to the decision to create cross-references acknowledging "parallel validities"—a choice with visible months-long professional cost. The protagonist's agency drives resolution through methodical investigation under the constraint of the blackout.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—transforming accumulated grief into cranes that can fly—is signaled early and pursued through gem-polishing and origami-folding. The piece delivers one meaningful deepening (understanding "she had been the shadow all along") that reconfigures the metaphysical frame, and the crane-release constitutes agency. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens relies on poetic assertion ("luminous torment," "diving into the heart of light") rather than a visible trade-off or forfeiture that narrows options. No live obstacle or cost-laden choice tests commitment; the process flows without friction or visible price paid on the page, meeting baseline pressure but not the felt cost required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.9)
    One dominant stake is clear and the breaker countdown provides urgency. Yet escalation is minimal: Amara calculates, the system reboots on schedule, and she departs as planned. No reversal or tightening forces a trade-off; the AI's return is avoided rather than confronted. The ending delivers success without visible cost—she has the coordinates, the geode, and her escape pod—so the price that would charge the closure image remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—decoding the frequency of belonging—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through mechanical alignment and chip insertion, but escalation reads more as procedural fulfillment than choice under fire. No live opposition or trade-off narrows Elias's options; the pilgrim's absence removes potential friction. The final moment reconfigures meaning (frequencies confirm belonging), yet the lack of visible cost or foreclosed path keeps the stakes conceptual. Under the Accumulative lens one tightening suffices, but agency remains muted.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Elias discovering "the weight of a withheld truth"—is signaled early and drives the search through driftwood. Pressure accumulates as he finds each carving, culminating in the final piece showing the woman with her own child, which confirms the unbroken lineage despite his erasure. The decision to find the daughter tomorrow and offer the carvings is stated as intention rather than enacted choice with visible immediate cost; the weight is measured but not yet paid on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when the final carving completes the chronology and forces his witness.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—completing the prisoner exchange ritual without violence—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure operates through atmospheric accumulation (moon timing, delegates' mutual suspicion, the scout's trembling) rather than overt reversals, fitting the Accumulative lens. The negotiator's agency is ritual execution and symbolic transfer, not a forced trade-off; the scout's release proceeds without visible obstacle or complication that tests her commitment. The cost at closure is her continued solitude and the cycle's repetition, which charges the ending but remains conceptual rather than a on-page forfeiture that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: Elias seeks to "align heart and action" by accepting his flawed, terrestrial self and laying down his burden of perfectionist guilt. The tightening is clear: he paddles past the breakers (foreclosing retreat), reaches the cove where utility poles end, and sets down the compass with visible cost (renouncing celestial navigation, his father's legacy, and his former identity). Agency is renunciation with on-page cost. The backlash of regrets—lawsuit, license revocation, divorce, three drownings—operates as past pressure that shapes present tactics (following poles, carrying the useless compass). No antagonist is required; the accumulative design sustains coherent pressure and deepens once at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—kindle empathy before calcifying into "something worse than a killer"—is signaled early and tightens through the labyrinth's moral tableaux, where her initial failures accumulate as "physical weight crushing her lungs." The lake's holographic message and tendrils provide a meaningful deepening that narrows her option to passive reception rather than active choice, and the cost (weeping, trembling, carrying damp clippings for others) is legible. The escalation is primarily accumulative rather than reversals driven by protagonist agency; she walks, fails, then receives the transformation, which places the peak turn slightly outside her decisive action.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—reforging a bond beyond death—is signaled early and sustained. The metamorphosis functions as a tightening that forecloses her human form, and the cost (permanent fixture status) is visible on the page. However, the progression reads as inevitable additive steps (pour spices → skin luminesces → sister appears) without a reversal or moment where Elara's agency narrows competing options under pressure. The escalation is more textural accumulation than protagonist-driven choice that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (reclaiming or sanctifying lost time) is signaled early and coheres under the accumulative lens. One meaningful deepening: Elara shifts from seeking retrieval to accepting transformation, a tightening that forecloses the retrieval path. The Nine of Shadows card instruction and the act of tracing daughter's future hands narrow her options toward acceptance. Cost is legible: she leaves the saucer (relinquishing a childhood keepsake) and carries forgiveness instead of the time itself. However, the escalation is more textural accumulation than a decision under competing pressures; no antagonist or reversal forces a hard choice, and the ritual proceeds without significant friction or failed attempt.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—opening the locked dimension to integrate humanity's shadow—is signaled early and sustained. The piece accumulates pressure through Elias's reflection and the assembly of photographs, but on-page escalation is thin: no meaningful reversal or choice that narrows options in the stitching sequence itself. The final act (piercing the barrier) happens without resistance or visible tradeoff in the moment; agency reads more as enactment of a pre-determined ritual than a live decision under duress. Cost is present (he passes through, the ship empties) but is summarized rather than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding transformation's texture—is signaled early but never tested by a counterpressure or trade-off. Elias's only on-page action is opening jars in sequence; no reversal narrows his options because he faces no opposition and makes no renunciation with visible cost. The "detour" (collapsed mule) is revealed as orchestrated coincidence, which diffuses rather than escalates tension. The piece accumulates imagery but lacks a tightening choice or deepening that forecloses a path; the ending accepts what was already inevitable from paragraph one.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—sparking a silent revolution—is signaled early and persists, but pressure remains static. Elara executes a pre-planned sequence (find quill holder, descend stairs, paint sundial) without meaningful resistance, error, or choice that narrows options. The blackout functions as enabler rather than obstacle; no on-page reversal forces her to adapt tactics or pay a visible cost. The narrative asserts escalation ("crucible she had awaited," "seeds of rebellion now geometrically inevitable") but the protagonist's smooth, unopposed progress and the deferred consequences (revolution begins "tomorrow") fail to deliver felt escalation or a trade-off that charges the ending under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—understanding sacred patterns—is signaled in paragraph five and tightens when the aurora touches horizon at 4:47, forcing the final alignment. One meaningful pressure point: placing the white quartz completes the sequence, generating the field and narrowing options to enter or forfeit the promise. Agency is present but quiet; the protagonist steps into the field without visible hesitation or trade-off deliberation on the page, slightly lowering the felt cost of the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—transforming inherited silence into testimony after censorship—is signaled early and deepens when the negative reveals the father's parallel vigil. The tightening occurs through accumulation (timer increments, storm rhythm, the manuscript growing to seventy-three pages) rather than a causal reversal. Cost is present (the seizure, the vigil, the physical act of writing until her hand cramps), but the escalation reads as thematic intensification rather than a choice that narrows live options under urgent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake (find the hidden coordinates) is clear and pursued. The fencing provides movement but does not escalate pressure—Silas's attack is parried without cost, and Aldric's mechanical torque advantage solves the problem immediately. One meaningful tightening occurs when the needles align with the shadows, but this is a reveal rather than a choice that narrows options. The truce and departure conclude without visible trade-off: no live option is foreclosed, no tactic forced by a persistent constraint. The final line asserts "certainty" but no on-page price is paid.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake—rebuilding the library and planting the garden to sustain resistance—is signaled early. Pressure remains static: Elias arrives with the tin, hands it over, and the exchange completes without reversal or tightening that narrows options. The declared threat (guards burning it all, Elias molting in three days) operates as future possibility rather than on-page escalation. Marcus's "Then we'll rebuild the library before you forget why you came" offers thematic affirmation but no tactical cost or foreclosed path under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake is legible early: decode Maya's film to find refuge before the station is destroyed by the atmospheric storm. Pressure tightens as "the horizon invites night" and "the station's foundation trembled." The protagonist's agency is clear—she modified the piano six months ago, aligns projector and metronome, plays the exact arpeggio—and these choices narrow options toward the sanctuary coordinates. The escalation is primarily technical problem-solving rather than ethical dilemma or compounding mistake, which keeps it in the strong-but-not-exceptional range. The cost is felt (three years of grief, the station's near-destruction) but not viscerally tested in a peak beat where a wrong note or miscalculation would have immediate consequence on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—protect cultural memory before the monsoon—is signaled early and remains consistent. However, the escalation is largely atmospheric (clouds bruise, lightning cracks) rather than driven by protagonist agency or tactical narrowing. Elara plants, sleeps, dreams, sings; each step unfolds without genuine friction or a visible price that alters her next move. The grandmother's advice ("doubt is the fertilizer") lands as thematic wisdom rather than a choice-forcing constraint. The ending grants success without dramatizing what Elara risked or lost; no live option is foreclosed, no trade-off made visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—navigating grief and finding reconciliation—is clear from the opening. Pressure deepens when Mara discovers the lace pattern and follows the compass to the cliff, where understanding the transformation of connection narrows her options from avoidance to engagement. The final pruning of the oldest juniper represents agency (she chooses to "work with methodical slowness" to create "the illusion of perpetual movement"), and the cost appears in her acceptance that "cerulean regret would always remain." However, the escalation feels more like gradual acceptance than a tightening with foreclosed options—no path is visibly sacrificed, only reframed. The compass directing her to specific trees and the lace providing instructions reduce the sense of genuine constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (acquiring the portrait/illuminated moment) is signaled early and escalates cleanly through the introduced time pressure ("three stems meant three minutes"). Agency is clear: Elara's savvy interpretation of the codes drives the action, and her final choice to pause and listen is an active renunciation of mere escape. The cost is the enduring, palpable yearning captured in the final beat. Under the causal lens, the escalation is a meaningful tightening from acquisition to contemplation.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (crafting sanctuaries before the thaw tightens) escalates via the advancing melt, narrowing options to a forced departure. Protagonist agency drives the deepening: she chooses to place the bookmark and leave, with cost visible in relinquished refuge. One meaningful tightening under the accumulative lens, but agency is more endurance than active confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (autonomy/identity) is signaled early and escalates through a meaningful tightening: the decryption forces a confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (honesty vs. complicity) tightens through protagonist agency: Mara’s examination and confrontation force a decision that forecloses the path of silence.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under the accumulative lens, escalation is a clean density increase: the ritual progresses from general maintenance to the pivotal western ivy to the central fountain, each placement raising the stakes of her philosophical demonstration. The dominant stake (proving the garden's conscious recognition) tightens through this progression, culminating in the garden's exhale—a clear, earned payoff driven by Elara's agency. The cost is the perpetual maintenance and acceptance of necessary falsehoods.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake signaled early; escalation driven by protagonist agency (pulling lever) under causal lens. Cost is legible in temperature drop and validation, tightening options meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (measuring the weight of a swallowed truth) is signaled early and escalates through Mara's agency under the causal lens: each radio clue narrows her search until the valve wheel discovery forces the moral reckoning. The cost is unmistakable on the page in the "stone dropped in still water" and the final "exact tonnage." One meaningful tightening (finding the wheel) forecloses the option of abstract doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under the accumulative lens, escalation occurs through density increase and a cadence shift at the refuge. The dominant stake (to witness without judgment) tightens into a decisive internal realization—"gripping reality loosely is the only way to hold it at all"—with a clear cost: the surrender of certainty and embrace of peaceful decay.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (Elara's identity vs. uncertainty) escalates through accumulative density—the pilgrim's arrival, shadow convergence, pearl levitation—reweighting options with cost.

    Dominant stake is signaled early; escalation under accumulative lens occurs through density of visions and glyphs, driven by Maya's agency. Cost is felt in her insomnia but is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (preserving heritage) escalates through Elara's agency—her discovery of the bread's meaning forces a gathering of elders. Cost of impending flood and isolation is felt, tightening under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (escaping fate) escalates through Elara's agency under the causal lens; cost is unmistakable in the final paragraph as she embraces "the terror of having no future."

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake (Mara’s internal guilt and curse) tightens through her active choice to confess, driven by agency under the causal lens. Escalation is legible: the advisor’s whisper, the brightening luminance, and the clasp’s heat force a crystallizing decision. Cost is unmistakable in the blinding flare, the clasp’s absorption of the light, and her “empty” freedom.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (turning threat into music) is signaled early and escalates through the storm's approach. Under the accumulative lens, pressure tightens via density of imagery and the prophet's active playing. Agency drives the escalation, and the cost—transformation of the storm—is legible and reconfigures the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.2)
    Stakes escalate through Elara's agency as she deciphers patterns and interrogates the watchers, resulting in a cosmic rearrangement with palpable cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake (truth vs. myth) escalates via the editor's message, forcing Elena's agency-driven choice. Cost is legible in her weighted steps. One meaningful tightening suffices under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes of preserving dreams deepen through accumulative detail; agency in placing the final note reweights absence with cost, but escalation is more textural than causal, keeping it below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (uncovering honest origins) is signaled early and escalates through Elias's agency—discovering scoring marks, finding the manual. Each deepening narrows options and changes knowledge under the causal lens. Cost is legible in the "months of meticulous verification" required, foreclosing a simpler order.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (grief transformation) escalates through Mira's agency in folding gems, under accumulative lens via density increase. A single meaningful tightening—the release of cranes—forecloses her corporeal path with felt cost (her dissolution). No coincidence; pressure coheres to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake (finding the quantum reservoir) escalates under causal agency as the circuit-breaker clock narrows options; cost is legible in the geode's fracture and her bleak exhilaration, forcing a trade-off that forecloses other paths with on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (belonging) escalates through protagonist agency (tracking, aligning, pulling). Cost is visible in strain and resonance, and the pressure tightens meaningfully under the accumulative lens without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake (discovering the weight of withheld truth) escalates through Elias's agency in sifting and finding the final carving. The tightening is a deepening realization that forces his decision to bear witness. Cost is unmistakable: "the specific gravity of his crimes" and the "tempered regret" that anchors him.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates through density of symbolic detail and the negotiator's deliberate actions. The dominant stake (successful exchange) tightens as she signals, speaks, and physically releases the scout, with cost felt in the fragility of the moment and her ongoing burden.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.2)
    Internal conflict escalates through the journey to a decisive renunciation; cost is unmistakable when he leaves the compass, foreclosing his celestial identity.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.5)
    Stakes (regain empathy or become a feelingless killer) escalate through the labyrinth's moral tests; agency-driven climax at the lake with unmistakable cost. Escalation tightens under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake (reforging bond beyond death) escalates via Elara's agency—pouring spices, conjuring—leading to a tightening with unmistakable cost: her transformation and permanence in the orchard.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a decisive cadence shift: the instruction from the Nine of Shadows ("not to solve the puzzle but to open herself") forces a stance crystallization. The dominant stake (reclaiming lost time vs. accepting its transformation) tightens through her agency—the act of unfastening her memory. The cost is the surrender of the original goal, felt as she descends with "forgiveness" instead of time.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (release/integration of humanity's shadow) escalates through Elias's agency—stitching with the tear and photos—under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in his weightless transformation and the ship's emptiness.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (understanding transformation) escalates through Elias's agency in releasing jars; cost is unmistakable in his surrender and the ash falling, under the accumulative lens's density increase.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (silent revolution) escalates via Elara's agency in completing the sundial, narrowing options. Cost is legible in the risk of insurrection and the tactical reconfiguration of power.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes (deciphering patterns) are signaled early and escalate through the precise, accumulative preparation of the stone sequence. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure tightens via density increase and the live clock of the aurora. The protagonist's agency in stepping into the field carries a clear, on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.3)
    Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a deepening of understanding via the negative's discovery and the timer's chime, which reweights the stake from hiding to testifying. Elara's agency—writing, sealing, descending—forecloses the path of silent vigil with a visible cost (time, risk) and transforms the pause into action. One meaningful tightening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.1)
    Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, from fencing duel to decoding, narrowing options toward collaboration. The cost is visible in the truce and handed needle, with stakes turning abstract questions into concrete destinations.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (rebuilding/resistance) escalates via Elias's agency under causal lens; his admission of impending molt tightens options. Cost is legible on-page in the risk of destruction or identity loss.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (survival/refuge) is signaled early via the coming storm and stolen Maya. Escalation is driven by Elena's agency under the accumulative lens: she synchronizes projector and compasses, plays the decoding arpeggio, and corrects the station's drift. Cost is felt in the trembling foundation and the delayed clock's resurrection. One meaningful tightening (achieving synchronicity in the storm's eye) forecloses the option of passive disappearance.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (protecting cultural memory) escalates via monsoon clock; Elara's agency (planting, dreaming, singing) drives tightening pressure with cost legible in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under the accumulative lens, escalation is a density increase and pattern break that reweights the dominant stake (emotional healing). Mara's agency drives the tightening—she follows the compass, interprets the lace—and the cost is legible in the "cerulean regret" and the ache of remembrance.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—how Elena will respond to catastrophe and scale—is present and coherently pursued, but pressure is gentle and largely internal. There is a real deepening as she moves from reading dust as structural data to allowing it to reconfigure her life’s frame of reference, yet the escalation feels more like a smooth gradient than a tightening that forecloses options. The choice to remain with the greenhouse and abandon former professional drives is meaningful but underplayed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stakes—whether Mara chooses life and finds an honest meaning in her father’s legacy—are clear early and deepen as she investigates the smuggling route. The key escalation is the discovery of the cave and journals, which reconfigure her understanding and options. However, external opposition is minimal; once she decides to investigate, little resists her, so pressure remains more contemplative than sharply tightening. The final choice to rebuild differently is earned but not heavily contested on the page, keeping this below the highest band for conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara can transform traumatic silence into a new mode of music—is clear and present from early on. Pressure escalates primarily through intensification of her internal process as she moves up the scale and the colors/emotions shift, culminating in the explosive low A and her reconfigured relationship to silence. This is strong accumulative escalation, but it lacks a sharp on-page reversal or live alternative path being actively foreclosed; we are never in real doubt that she will continue the ritual. As a result the piece feels more like a beautifully executed culmination than a test that forces a visible trade-off under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether the restless dead can gain a fixed resting place through Marian’s choices—is clear and escalates from private discomfort to a metaphysical obligation. The distress signals intensifying and the ocean’s impossible retreat provide one firm tightening, and her ascent to the dome with the lens functions as a focused climax. However, once she commits to entering the sea, the opposition is mostly conceptual; there are no further hard trade-offs or on-page resistances testing her resolve. The cost is more thematic than viscerally felt, which keeps the pressure solid but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the community will fracture into passive recipients under siege or cohere as active mutual support—is legible early and escalates as the runs grow more dangerous. The key tightening comes when the child confronts Maya at the arbor, forcing a shift from anonymous endurance to public declaration. The ethical and social stakes of exposing the network are clear, but the external danger from authorities remains abstract, muting visceral tension somewhat. Still, the final bell-ring functions as a credible high-stakes choice that reshapes options for everyone.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—can Maya transform calcified grief into released love—is clear early and coherently deepened as she moves from observation to risky self-dissolution. Pressure escalates when her breath syncs with the bridge, the Kwan Yin’s tear heats, and the ritual moves from potential to irreversible act, foreclosing a safe, purely observational stance. The cost is legible in her collapse and in her loss of separateness as an artist. That said, the conflict remains largely internal and steady in tone; there’s no strong reversal or explicit alternative path dramatized on the page, which limits the ceiling slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will remain a separate designer or surrender himself to the maze’s non-linear time—is conceptually strong but lightly pressured. The main tightening comes when he touches the halo fragment and loses all temporal distinction, making the choice to “step deeper into the hyperbolic maze” irreversible. However, there’s little friction or resistance around that choice: no real counterforce, fear, or alternative path is tested, so escalation feels more like a graceful slide than a pressured crucible. Stakes remain largely philosophical rather than viscerally felt, which limits tension.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—protecting the seed vault from destruction or exploitation—is clear early and sharpened when scavengers approach and the vault mechanism alerts them. Escalation is coherent: opening the vault increases risk, and Elara must choose a nonviolent, physically limiting tactic that could fail. However, the external conflict resolves relatively easily once the scavenger sees her and listens; his retreat feels more like a moral recognition than a hard-won trade-off under duress. The internal-external braid (nonviolence vs urgency) is strong, but a slightly tougher on-page test of her stance would lift the stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding the sound of trust breaking before she dies—is clearly signaled and coherently pursued through the imprinting process. Escalation is present but gentle: the marrow clock, the final absence being her own betrayal, and the activation of the forge create a meaningful tightening rather than a sharp reversal. Her decisive act is to imprint and then wear the device herself, accepting the cost of hearing her own regrets as she dies, which is thematically apt. Still, most opposition is internal and ambient; there’s little on-page resistance or complication to her plan, which keeps tension from reaching the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.5)
    The external conflict—stealing the portrait before the officer returns—is present and mildly tense, with the jasmine’s three stems creating a concrete time limit. Yet the heist unfolds without real complication, reversal, or visible price, and her internal drive (to hear destiny’s knock) doesn’t come under sharp new pressure. The result feels more like a beautifully rendered slice than an escalated test of her commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—how she will respond to irreversible thaw and necessary abandonment—is present but remains mostly internal and low-conflict. The pressure does increase as we understand the ice bridges are becoming too dangerous and that she must leave her work behind. However, we never see her seriously weigh competing options or make a hard trade-off on the page; the choice to depart feels accepted rather than contested. The result is a beautifully textured piece whose tension is more contemplative than gripping, which may undershoot top-tier expectations for narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—identity and autonomy versus the father’s control—is clearly established and escalates from internal terror to legal and physical confrontation. The main tightening is Kai’s decision not to flee when footsteps approach but to stand and use their phobias and the rusted structure as leverage, foreclosing the option of continued complicity. The external conflict (father’s lunge) and internal one (fear vs. agency) interlock at the railing beat with a visible shift in power. The piece could linger a touch more on the emotional price of turning the father over, but the tension and price are still strong for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether she can successfully complete the map of endless night and what that entails—is clear, and the realization that dawn will not come provides a meaningful deepening. Pressure accrues texturally via the storm, the rising darkness, and the dwindling star, and her agency manifests in continuing the work despite the cost. However, escalation is more meditative than sharply tightening; we don’t see a concrete alternative path she forecloses, and the conflict never quite bites at a visceral level. The result is strong but not fully gripping stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.2)
    The conflict is primarily internal and conceptual (sweeping under punishment vs. choosing to engage the forbidden violin and embrace recursion) and it does intensify: passive maintenance gives way to active playing and identity fusion. The revelation that the Second Chance Program is a temporal engine is a meaningful deepening of stakes. Still, pressure never quite bites—there’s no real on-page threat of erasure, failure, or consequence for wrong insight, so choices feel almost costless. The result is a beautifully textured arc with modest, rather than gripping, escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether to keep colluding in secrecy or risk exposure for the sake of honesty—is legible early and tightened by Mara’s discovery of Julian’s deeper involvement. Pressure escalates from quiet unease to a direct moral confrontation and finally to the decision to report and confess, with an implied cost in professional and relational fallout. The conflict is mostly internal and interpersonal rather than high-octane, but the ethical calculus is clear and the choice at the end forecloses the path of continued complicity. A slightly sharper sense of external risk (concrete consequences if they’re discovered) would raise the tension further.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—maintaining a fragile, negotiated truth with the sentient garden—is clear, but pressure stays mostly conceptual and never quite bites. Elara’s success in each ritual step is assured; we don’t see a moment where the garden might refuse her or where inaction poses a tangible on-page threat. Escalation exists as an intensifying pattern (outer wall → deeper labyrinth → central fountain), but without a sharp reversal or sacrifice, the cost feels muted. As a result, the ending is resonant but not especially tense.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—proving a radical conception of time—is signaled clearly, and Kael’s decision to pull the lever is the central pressure point. However, there is almost no resistance: no real risk to himself or the station, no procedural obstacle, and no on-page pushback from Vex in the moment. The experiment succeeds on the first try without complication, producing a smooth arc rather than a tightening or meaningful trade-off. As a result, tension stays largely intellectual and never truly bites.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—resolving the century-long suspended “unstruck chord” and communicating with Vane’s ghost—is legible, and there is a meaningful turn when she stops documenting and chooses to play the ghost’s implied score. However, the conflict is almost completely unopposed; once she follows the code, the outcome is unambiguously successful and uncostly. The result is lovely but low-tension, with escalation that feels more like deepening atmosphere than a tightening of pressure or narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will continue to “occupy margins” and tolerate error or confront her complicity in climate collapse—is legible from early on and deepens as she links her fever, data anomalies, and the Edelweiss migration. Pressure escalates internally: from disorientation and doubt, to recognition that she has been smoothing away catastrophe, to a quiet but decisive stance shift in how she will record anomalies. The final act forecloses a prior path (rounding toward hope, hiding anomalies as tolerable fault) with emotional cost. The conflict remains largely interior and textural, so while strong, it never quite feels knife-edge urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake is Mara’s need to test and carry the moral weight of Elias’s confession, and that’s signaled early and maintained. Escalation is primarily internal and textural: pressure tightens when she deciphers the callers’ images, locates the memorial, and counts the sixteen colors, which narrows her interpretive options about what Elias did. However, there’s limited on-page confrontation or reversal—this is more deepening than turning—and the external situation never actively resists her. The cost is still felt at the end, but tension operates more as accumulating density than as sharply escalating conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—her desire to witness transformation without imposing interpretation—is clear but largely internal and unchallenged. Pressure “escalates” mostly via deepening imagery rather than tightened options; the journey to the refuge proceeds without obstacles or reversals. The most tangible turn is her decision to write in the swan and then to refold it and return, but these choices carry little felt risk or sacrifice. As a result, conflict remains low-grade and meditative, keeping escalation and cost modest.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Milo can re-enter communicative, curious engagement with the world—is clear early and tightens credibly under the eclipse’s ticking window. Pressure escalates from silence to a single note, to phrase-matching, to humming, to finally speaking “Again.” The emotional cost is implicit but real: both risk hope under a fragile circumstance. The conflict remains almost entirely internal/relational, so while effective for quiet fiction, it never quite feels knife-edge in the way top-tier pieces often do.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—recovering and reconfiguring human memory after the death of dreaming—is powerful but plays out mostly as contemplative tension rather than conflict under pressure. There is one meaningful tightening when the wall “shudders” and reveals its stored memory, confirming that the stakes are real and raising the burden on Elara to act as translator. However, she is never forced into a sharp trade-off or sacrifice; the cost is emotional and existential, not decisional. As a result, escalation feels like deepening texture rather than narrowing options, which is effective but not maximally tense.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stakes—Elias’s role as unwitting oracle/asset and his desire to escape isolation—are clear, but on-page pressure is relatively gentle. His orchestration of agents and the defector’s rescue shows consequential stakes, yet almost no resistance or risk manifests in scene; we’re told agencies whisper about him, but they never press him directly. The knock and the boat departure function more as confirmations than real tests. As a result, escalation feels conceptual rather than viscerally tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (prevent the sanctuary’s anchor from being dragged into the abyss) is signaled early and never wavers. Pressure escalates conceptually as Elian moves from simple looping to sophisticated rhetorical traps that destabilize the entity’s logic. However, the conflict never feels close to truly slipping out of his control; the entity wavers and collapses relatively quickly once questioned, and the “minutes” constraint doesn’t bite into his choices. The resolution is earned but somewhat low-friction for the scale of the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—resolving his “chronological homesickness” by integrating his life into a coherent symphony—is clear, but the pressure remains gentle. There is an escalation in texture: from quiet observation to ice creaks, warming shell, and the prismatic climax, culminating in his realization about time’s spiral nature. However, there’s little sense of a real alternative path or sacrifice; exhaustion and psychic cost are mentioned but never forced into a consequential trade-off. The result is a beautiful, but relatively low-tension, interior arc.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can navigate and “conquer” the labyrinth of self—remains clear, but the pressure curve is relatively smooth and low-friction. The most concrete tightening is when the runes generate the spiral staircase only as she steps, narrowing her ability to plan and forcing literal commitment to the void; the collapsing ghost timelines briefly raise emotional stakes. However, external or even sharply internal opposition is minimal: nothing truly resists her or tempts her off-course, so the journey reads more as ritual enactment than conflict. The ending’s shift feels more like a culmination of an already-decided path than the outcome of a hard-fought dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central conflict—Elara’s refusal/fear of feeling versus her need to reclaim music—is clear and escalates as she moves from wall, to drum, to needle-to-skin contact. The stakes are internal but real: reclaiming identity at the price of re-experiencing grief, paid off when she finally cries. The pressure tightens primarily through intensification of sensation rather than reversals, which fits the mode but retains a relatively soft contour. A slightly sharper on-page hesitation or resistance at the peak could deepen the sense of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stakes—scientific integrity under surveillance and the failing quarantine—are clear and meaningfully entwined. There is a solid tightening beat when the message reveals her mentor alive inside the rogue zone and she realizes the authorities’ suspicions are accurate. However, the conflict remains mostly intellectual and anticipatory; opposition (the authorities) never appears on-page, and her choice faces projected rather than immediate cost. The piece functions well as a charged poise, but escalation feels muted compared to the magnitude of the declared stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will continue to anesthetize himself or truly engage with the grief bound up in scent—is clear and does tighten: he shifts from “aromatically cautious” to deliberately inhaling the perfume despite the known emotional risk. The discovery of the vial, the plants’ revival, and his decision to breathe deeply provide a credible escalation path. However, the pressure is largely internal and contemplative, with limited on-page resistance or cost beyond tears and belated insight, which slightly softens the sense of risk. The resolution is earned but could benefit from at least one sharper moment of hesitation or potential refusal.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.9)
    The central stake—retrieve his lover’s voice by going backward or witness the world’s future by going forward, each foreclosing the other—is sharply defined and morally/experientially charged. Pressure coheres as his explorations (rope patterns, fossils, rope’s animation) deepen the impossibility of clean rescue and lead to his sideways, paradox-embracing stance. The escalation is more conceptual than visceral, and we never see him viscerally flinch from the loss of either option on the page, which mutes the bite of the tradeoff. Still, the refusal of the binary with attendant forfeiture reads as an earned, high-stakes internal resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara can “unbind the silence” of a world held in a “chronic hush”—is legible and escalates texturally as sound builds from bowl to shipwrecks to cracked hush. Her agency is clear in choosing to enact the family method tonight, setting the fire, and tuning to resonant frequencies. However, pressure remains largely abstract: there is no palpable risk of failure, backlash, or loss if she cannot or should not succeed, so the emotional cost of the attempt is muted. The hush cracking is satisfying but not hard-won in the sense of foreclosing a vivid alternative or confronting a painful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the client can achieve a bearable experience of their transformation, and whether Kael’s half-truth technology holds—is clear and signaled early. Pressure escalates credibly from preparation, to ingestion, to the unexpected resonance with the grotto and the emergence of genuine emotion. The time pressure (“transformation completes in minutes”) and the static-electricity peak provide a tangible tightening, though Kael never faces a sharply framed dilemma or sacrifice. Stakes remain intimate and conceptual rather than viscerally perilous, which works but keeps the escalation modest.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—whether Elias will truly redirect his shrewdness and profits toward honoring invisible labor—is present but gently pressured rather than sharply tested. The meaningful tightening occurs when he commits five percent of his most ruthless contingency deals to the foundation, which is a real trade-off, yet much of that decision is already abstractly settled by the time “tonight” begins. The present-scene stakes (initiating the first grant, approaching symphony patrons) are asserted rather than dramatized, so there’s limited on-page negotiation, risk, or resistance. As a result, escalation is more conceptual than felt, which flattens tension for such an otherwise ambitious piece.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—escaping loneliness through genuine connection—is clear and intensifies from solitary work to fragile group, to fully committed community. The shared search for the glyphs provides a concrete collaborative task that gradually transforms isolation into kinship, and the bridge/dedication is a meaningful tightening that forecloses a return to solitude. Still, conflict remains mostly internal and atmospheric; obstacles are relatively soft, with little direct resistance or risk beyond implied emotional and environmental dangers. The result is strong thematic pressure but only moderate dramatic escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—achieving a once-impossible act of documentation at the cost of destabilizing the giant’s nap—is clear, and the ticking window provides a coherent pressure. Escalation follows a solid sequence: quiet observation → decision to steal more time → building the snore-bridge → unlocking the temporal cage → giant waking early. The price is tangible (shortened nap, inert pendant, disrupted canals), but opposition remains largely systemic rather than actively resistant, so Elara’s choice never feels contested moment by moment. The scene would benefit from at least one sharper dilemma or setback that forces her to choose between competing harms rather than simply pressing forward.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Elian can live with his sister’s unresolved disappearance—emerges clearly and is tightened when the droplet intersects the cracks, offering a new “pathway through possibility” that forces an interpretive choice. Escalation is primarily internal and accumulative rather than driven by sharp reversals, but the pressure does deepen: his obsession with quantifying longing culminates in a reframed understanding rather than a solved problem. The felt cost is the acceptance of ongoing ambiguity and the renunciation of a binary answer. Still, the conflict stays somewhat abstract; a slightly more concrete sense of risk or alternative path foreclosed would strengthen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—creating a hidden network of sustenance/visibility for invisible people—is clear, but opposition is almost entirely absent. The power outage and unstable grid mirror her determination atmospherically rather than becoming active pressures that force tactical changes. There is a mild deepening as we move from retrieval to the specificity of where each fragment is placed, culminating in the final cache in the rare books room, but it doesn’t significantly narrow options or heighten risk. The story relies on thematic weight more than conflict-driven escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Maren will cling to control or risk her life’s work by loosening it—is clearly established and tightened as the wild growth repeatedly contradicts her methods. Pressure escalates as she recognizes her “glass cathedral of domination” and admits that control has suppressed the very behaviors she studies, raising the personal and professional cost of change. Her choice to reconstruct the eastern wing with “open trellises and patience” meaningfully forecloses her old approach and entails real risk to endangered species in storm season. The conflict stays largely meditative rather than contested by on-page forces, so the sense of active opposition is more conceptual than dramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—securing the journals and, through them, meaning—is established early, and the planned exchange provides a focal event. However, the meeting and trade proceed almost without friction; there’s little sense the exchange might fail, be renegotiated, or morally backfire. Internal pressure (should she surrender the brooch? what does it cost her?) is more implied than dramatized in a live decision. As a result, escalation feels more like deepening mood than a tightening of stakes with visibly foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake is Elara’s relationship to her own foresight and to the cave’s evolving will; it’s signaled early in the unease over unpredictability and sharpened at “I didn’t see you coming.” Escalation is primarily textural: harmonies destabilize, shadows decouple, the pearl levitates, culminating in the cave inhabiting the pilgrim. The cost—Elara’s surrender of predictive mastery—registers as a genuine internal shift, even though she embraces it. Pressure is coherent but relatively soft; there’s no hard test where she must choose between conflicting goods, which keeps this strong but not cuttingly tense.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—whether and how meaning can be reconstructed after exile—remains coherent and deepens as Kael moves from solitary cataloging to communal reassembly. The main tightening comes when the valve’s backstory of failure meets the old woman’s grief, forcing a small but real interpretive choice in how Kael frames it for her and, by extension, for the community. However, the narrative never quite sharpens this into a felt dilemma or forces him to trade one value against another; his path is ethically and practically unimpeded. As a result, tension is mostly thematic/emotional rather than situational, and escalation feels like a graceful swell rather than a true test.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—daring a journey to confront the city’s and her sister’s silences—is signaled early and coherently pursued. Pressure does escalate in concept from eerie cracks to an impossibly manifesting train, with the key tightening at the moment she must actually use the ticket punch and step aboard. However, opposition is mostly internal and lightly dramatized; her hesitation is named more than deeply contested, so the choice carries less visceral cost than it could. The conflict remains engaging but feels more like a beautifully rendered acceptance of a foregone path than a hard-won decision.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.0)
    The primary conflict is internal and philosophical—Mara’s adherence to empiricism versus the risk of embracing the tower’s deeper purpose—and this is steadily pressured by the tile’s visions and the whales’ presence. Escalation is present but gentle: the major tightening is her decision to act on the revelation by redesigning the tower overnight. Stakes remain mostly conceptual and emotional; there is little concrete loss or hard trade-off beyond vulnerability and a surrender of skepticism. The resolution feels earned, but the visible price is relatively low-key.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—risking himself to learn what lies beyond goodbye—is clear, and the solar storm’s crescendo provides a solid external tightening that culminates in stepping into the chaos. His agency is present in the choice to enter the mutiny’s eye at peak danger and to rely on the cursed fragment, with the shattering moment functioning as a meaningful turn. Still, the threat of being “shredded by dimensional shear” never quite materializes as viscerally as it’s advertised, so the price feels more conceptual/emotional than sharply perilous.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stakes—trading her father’s life and secrets against justice and systemic rigidity—are clear and compelling. There is one primary tightening: the guard’s early pass at 2:17 AM converts abstract waiting into an immediate, actionable breach. Still, external opposition is relatively soft; we’re told of heavy security but meet only a single guard route deviation, and the ethical conflict is explored more in thought than in dramatized pressure. The cost is conceptually present but not yet viscerally tested in action.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—resisting the void by capturing textures of time—is present early and tightens when the lamp’s hum “dips into a register that suggested the past was leaking out faster than he could gild it back into place.” That shift prompts his only clear escalation: he works faster while still maintaining restraint, racing to finish before the loss outpaces him. However, there’s limited sense of alternatives or trade-offs; no significant option is foreclosed beyond “finish or fail,” and the cost remains largely abstract. Tension is real but operates at a contemplative hum rather than a sharply felt squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—reconstituting a self after bureaucratic erasure—is clear, but pressure is mostly static; the archivist is never forced into a trade-off that forecloses an option. The accumulation of stories and textures deepens our understanding, yet there’s no clear mid-story tightening or reversal that narrows their path. The final “understanding” reframes their project rather than resulting from a contested conflict. As a result, conflict feels more contemplative than pressured, limiting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will cling to skeptical myth-busting or surrender to a more fluid, mythic understanding of endings—is clearly signaled and resolved. Escalation occurs mainly through deepening: the music, intensifying shell, and emerging sense of Mara’s presence push her toward a stance change. However, opposition is soft and largely interior; there’s little on-page resistance or concrete price paid beyond identity shift. Sharpening what she risks losing (professional self, sanity, memory of Mara as “real”) would heighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—preserving communal culture and ownership under impending privatization—is clear and present from early on. Pressure tightens through the arrival of notices, the activation of the graffiti network, and the sighting of inspection boats, and Maya’s agency (creating a hidden infrastructure) drives the main turn. However, conflict remains largely one-sided and anticipatory; there’s no direct on-page resistance or counter-move from the corporations in this scene, so escalation feels more cerebral than visceral. The cost—accepting partial loss while fighting for what can be saved—is present but could be more concretely dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—preserve a final image and record before corporate destruction—appears early and remains coherent, with the night’s cold and mining schedule providing a credible ticking clock. Pressure escalates through the dropping temperature, the narrowing window before dawn, and the visible activation of crawlers at the end. Conflict is more endurance- and stance-based than confrontational, and Elena never seriously wavers, so the sense of jeopardy is more conceptual/emotional than visceral. Still, the final descent as the drills scream registers as a genuine, if quiet, cost.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—getting the drone functional in time to alter the Vespertine’s route and prevent another wreck—is signaled early and stays coherent. Time pressure and Mira’s emotional need for redemption provide solid underlying tension, and her active repair decisions clearly drive the outcome. However, the conflict arc is relatively unopposed; the diagnostic and repair go smoothly without a concrete setback or forced trade-off, so escalation feels more like a steady incline than a tightening vise. Cost is mostly internal and retrospective rather than paid through an on-page reversal or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—locating and recording the singular convergence before the thaw—remains clear throughout, and the decision to step onto the ice and commit his coordinates provides a mild tightening. That said, conflict is largely notional: the landscape is “worryingly tranquil” but never actively resists him; the ice crackles but doesn’t truly threaten, and nothing meaningfully jeopardizes the survey. As a result, tension operates mostly at the conceptual level (disturbing equilibrium, myth becoming map) rather than through concrete escalations or tradeoffs. The lack of a visible on-page price keeps the stakes from fully biting.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—preventing the final collapse and re-establishing a balanced city-land relationship—is legible early and tightened when the fork detects dissonance at the keystone. Escalation occurs through rhythmic intensification and the visible strain on the arch, culminating in her dance and the fork’s placement. However, there is little real opposition or sense of possible failure; Elara faces no counter-force beyond impending collapse, and her competence is never credibly tested. As a result, tension remains more conceptual and atmospheric than viscerally pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—survive vs. embrace the temple’s dangerous, time-defying technology to gain understanding and closure—is clearly signaled and tightened by the oxygen clock and the temple’s sealing defenses. The key escalation is the revelation that survival requires overriding instinct (total exhalation) and ingesting the vial’s contents, turning a passive exploration into a high-cost, active gamble. Internal and external pressures interweave effectively, though once Elara commits, the sequence runs relatively smoothly with limited on-page resistance or complication. The cost—risk of death, psychic overload, and the permanent reconfiguration of her memory—is clear and informs the quiet but consequential aftermath.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—escape before the bodies are discovered and his story collapses—is clearly signaled, and the move from interior plotting to standing on the precipice to actual hovering is a meaningful tightening. However, the escape itself encounters no active resistance: no guard presence, no faltering of the narrative physics, no near-miss with the timing. As a result, stakes are more conceptual than viscerally felt; the “second heart” time pressure is described but never forces a hard trade-off or adaptation in tactics on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the ancestral debt will finally be repaid, freeing Eira and altering the family’s bond to the land—is established early and escalates as Julian moves from vague unease to full participation in the ritual. The tightening beat is the bead’s transfer, which forces him into embodied cost (painful visions, physical agony) and a concrete task in the deadly cold. However, once he understands, there’s little friction or alternative path; his choice to help is emotionally potent but not strongly contested. The conflict is more ritualistic than adversarial, which works but limits pressure bandwidth.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—preventing the canyon and culture from crumbling into dust—is legible and tied to Maren’s forbidden sewing. Pressure does escalate in a quiet, accumulative way as she moves from nightly stitching to the heart chamber and the irrevocable final seam. However, antagonistic force (elders, spiritual danger, physical risk) is mostly summarized rather than enacted, so options never feel sharply foreclosed on the page. The cost is implied (blood, defiance, exhaustion) more than tactically tested, which mutes the sense of acute jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can transform inherited exile and eroded faith into a renewed, embodied connection—is well signaled and coherently pursued. Pressure escalates texturally as she moves from initial wonder to decoding the orchard’s logic and committing to the reconstruction of the sundial. Her agency drives the key turn: choosing to wander, gather fragments, and align the instrument to her great-grandmother’s tree. Still, conflict stays largely internal and meditative without a sharper ethical or practical dilemma, so the felt risk and cost at the peak remain moderate rather than bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—decode and embed the secret margin message before the final surface-mail pickup—appears early and stays present, and Kael’s actions are all oriented toward that goal. There is at least one clear tightening via the approaching drone and the discovery/translation of the cipher. However, conflict remains largely frictionless: there’s no meaningful setback, ethical trade-off, or risk of failure beyond the stated clock, so pressure doesn’t truly escalate. The cost at the end is more conceptual than dramatically felt, which keeps the stakes from fully landing.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—preventing the coup—is clearly signaled, and pressure coheres around the approaching frost/deadline and Mira’s need to transmit information without breaking her cover. Escalation is subtle but real: the pattern clarifies, she actively buys time with the thread request, and the captain’s arrival forces her to convert private insight into public, actionable code. Her choice to risk exposure by embedding a map in a “mistake” satisfies the agency requirement, and the consequence (an empire that “has not yet fallen”) is legible. The conflict remains largely intellectual and atmospheric rather than visceral; there’s limited on-page pushback or reversal beyond the captain’s initial skepticism, which keeps tension from peaking as sharply as it might.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—to speak an apology in the one moment she fled—is clear early and remains coherent throughout, with the journey through the labyrinth and into the hospital vision tightening pressure. Her decisive act of stepping past her younger self and speaking to dying Mara offers a true, costly reconfiguration: she cannot save Mara, only change the meaning of her absence. Internal and external pressures are nicely braided (spiritual rules, physical journey, and psychological dread). The path feels a bit assured once the shard is raised and the spirits grant passage; more resistance or risk in that middle stretch could further sharpen escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake is emotional and thematic—whether trauma remains isolated or is woven into a shared, survivable narrative—signaled through the cast’s inscriptions and Mara’s work. Pressure “escalates” mainly as she decodes more disturbing lines culminating in the lotus sentence, which modestly tightens the emotional stakes. There’s limited sense of risk or real alternative paths; Mara’s course never feels in doubt, and no on-page opposition or real trade-off tests her. The ending stance is graceful but not hard-won in conflict terms, keeping escalation and cost somewhat muted.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara can reconnect with her lost creative joy—is clearly signaled and followed through. Pressure escalates from passive wandering to an active experiment with real emotional risk of failure, culminating in her seeing prior joy materialize. However, opposition is largely internal and relatively soft; little on the page threatens to interrupt or derail her attempt once begun. The cost is felt but subtle, more about admitting past darkness than facing an acute dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elena clings to certainty or surrenders to curiosity in her art—is legible early and fulfilled by her decision to let echoes guide her and to leave the nickel behind. Escalation is handled via an intensifying sequence of “nested awakenings” and the garden’s increasing influence, not through hard reversals. There is a genuine narrowing of options when she chooses to paint a blank wall via sound rather than follow traditional restoration norms. Still, conflict remains mostly interior and low-friction; nothing truly resists her, so the tension is more contemplative than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.0)
    The core stake—cognitive freedom versus authoritarian thought taxation—is clear early and meaningfully tightened once the convergence begins and the drones close in. The activation and eventual destruction of the seed, followed by Elias choosing to stay and misdirect pursuit, creates a credible escalation with a visible price: his capture. Internal conflict is underplayed, so the moral and emotional calculus at the peak feels somewhat straightforward rather than agonizing. Still, external pressure scales well from covert planning to violent interruption.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central stake—what Elara does with her endless grief and war-haunted isolation—is legible and deepens as her singing begins to alter the reef. There is a meaningful tightening when she chooses not to leave (and indeed cannot) but instead “ensconce herself deeper,” committing fully to becoming part of the shell and reef. The price—self-erasure, loss of home, and centuries of wakeful transformation—reads clearly in the closing beats. Escalation is more accumulative than sharply turning, so tension seldom spikes, but the pressure coheres strongly for this lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—resisting entropy to preserve the names—is clear, and the cost of using up the cracked tube is well articulated. However, pressure doesn’t significantly escalate: once she realizes what the tube can do, there is no real resistance, obstacle, or meaningful alternative; she simply executes the plan. The internal conflict (“slightly poisonous to her sanity”) is stated but not dramatized as an active dilemma affecting tactics. The result is a beautifully textured piece with modest tension rather than a strongly escalating conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether their relationship remains frozen in silence or risks painful, complex truth before his transfer—is clear from early on. Pressure escalates via the ticking clock to dawn and the increasing commitment of the ritual (selecting seven languages, inscribing promises into the air). The closing stakes are neatly articulated by the conditional dissolution at sunrise, which meaningfully forecloses a path. What limits the score is the relative smoothness of Julian’s response; we never see her attempt truly tested by visible pushback or a sharper reversal once he appears.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.2)
    The core stake—human lives and landscapes versus profit and industrial efficiency—is powerful and clearly signaled. There is one meaningful tightening when the genuine seismic tremor underlines that the volcano’s awakening is not hypothetical and that his choice has real, looming consequences. His agency at the end (refusing the upgrade, falsifying logs) is an earned, ethically charged renunciation with visible risk and moral cost. Still, the piece lacks escalation within the scene itself; most of the moral calculus and pressure has already been resolved off-page, so tension feels contemplative rather than actively mounting.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara protects herself by selling and vanishing or risks exposure to preserve the meteorite’s “songs” and reclaim her true identity—is legible early and coherently deepened. Her months of preparation (dust-mapping, flight-path calculations) culminate in the high-pressure choice to trust Orion and the archivist, which forecloses the escape option and forces her to face the shopkeeper as herself. The price is clear but largely internal and anticipatory; the detectives and legal consequences remain abstract, so tension never quite spikes to match the emotional stakes. Escalation is effective but could use one on-page complicating beat to sharpen the knife-edge.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will remain in contemplative distance or step into the maze and embody the threshold—is present but mostly conceptual. Pressure builds modestly through her decoding of the logbook and wood grain until she realizes the codes are liturgical instructions, which is the main deepening. However, there is little sense of alternative paths or genuine risk beyond the abstract; the world’s post-collapse and the maze’s potential dangers stay offstage. The final step into the maze reads as inevitable insight rather than a hard-won or costly decision, limiting escalatory bite.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stakes—complete the alignment before dawn and find a felt sense of belonging—are clear and braid together effectively by the end. Escalation comes through the groaning pressure seals and the revelation that they must improvise a biological activation method under time and structural duress. The climax is driven by Elara’s agency in recognizing the needed synchrony and choosing intimate, risky participation with the phantom, foreclosing the option of remaining a detached observer. The price is more emotional and existential (sharing and then losing connection) than visceral, so the tension feels contemplative rather than gripping, but it coheres well for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain primarily conceptual—understanding why paths disappear—without being tested against any real resistance, loss, or hard trade-off on the page. “Before memory fades” is stated but never dramatized as a clock that forces a genuinely difficult choice or sacrifice; she works quickly but encounters no real threat of failure. The pressure does not escalate so much as accumulate more of the same texture, and each new seed reproduces the same low-conflict beat. As a result, conflict feels static and the ending carries insight but minimal felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael can successfully disrupt someone’s monotony through “orchestrated serendipity”—is clear, and there is a gentle escalation as each engineered element fires in sequence. However, there is little sense of what happens if he fails; his mastery is treated as given, so tension never tightens into genuine risk. The woman’s pause, tears, and new route are meaningful but arrive without any significant obstacle to Kael’s plan. As a result, the piece feels textured and pleasing rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving outlawed memory by turning her body into a cosmic archive—is clear, and there is a discernible tightening when the dust speck “feels heavier” and she recognizes the final phase of exile. However, antagonistic pressure is largely abstract or offstage; the authorities and their alarms appear only as a late conceptual shadow. Her main conflict is internal, but it unfolds with almost no resistance—she decides to inscribe herself and succeeds without serious doubt, reversal, or loss beyond what the narrator asserts. This keeps tension from escalating to a level commensurate with the grand stakes the prose claims.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is Elias’s need to reinterpret his life’s fractures and choices; the pressure is quiet but legible. The stone toss and close reading of ripples provide a mild escalation from abstraction to a concrete experiment, and the prism’s blaze at the end reweights his dilemma. However, there’s limited tightening: no real foreclosed option or visible loss beyond a re-framing of perspective, so tension remains relatively flat. The piece functions more as contemplative meditation than as a scene driven by escalating conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether guilt can be metabolized into something survivable and transmissible—is clear and present early, and the appearance of Elias with his recent failure supplies concrete present-tense pressure. Escalation is more deepening than turning: the key tightening is Maya’s decision to open the box, narrate her worst failure in detail, and then relinquish the marble, which forecloses her long-held solitary penance. Because conflict is almost entirely internal/interpersonal and never in doubt of physical outcome, the tension curve feels modest rather than gripping. Still, the visible prices (her vulnerability, his shame, the loss of her talisman) are clear and consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can stabilize failing timelines by engineering hope—is stated, but on-page pressure never really tightens in a way that forecloses options or forces a painful trade-off. The gauge trembles and the decorations grow more complex, yet we never sense that failure is imminent or that she must choose between competing goods or harms. There is escalation in the sense of increased density and synchronization, but it reads as steadily upward rather than tested or threatened. Conflict stays largely conceptual and unresisted, limiting tension.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central “conflict” is essentially Mara’s effort to understand and shoulder the house’s remembered past, which is thematically rich but dramatically gentle. There is a mild escalation—from walls’ echoes feeling “different,” to Elias’s diaries, to the hidden vault and the emotionally loaded negative—but little true pressure or risk. Her agency is mostly in choosing to attend and interpret, not in confronting a hard dilemma or sacrifice. As a result, stakes remain largely conceptual rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can coax the mirrors to display possibilities before his borrowed time runs out—is clear and does escalate via the humming glass, quickening pulse, and approaching bells. The live constraint of the clockmaker waking adds urgency, and Elias’s choice to accelerate his song and push to the edge of dissolution is a credible tightening. However, the conflict remains largely one-sided; there is no active opposition beyond time itself, and Elias never seriously falters once the method is engaged. The cost is real but muted, so tension is elegant rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—ending a “forever war” via a binding ritual rather than a conventional treaty—is clear early and sharpened by the general’s open contempt and the child’s losses. Pressure deepens when Elara reveals the soil from mixed graves, turning a symbolic object into a binding necessity that will require cooperative tending. Escalation is more moral and conceptual than peril-driven, but the general’s eventual trembling assent and acknowledgment of imperfection register as a meaningful narrowing of options. A slightly stronger sense that the agreement might fail in the moment could heighten tension, but the stakes still feel present and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—Elias achieving his sacrilegious-sacred ritual before the reservoir refills—is clear, and his choice to bury the egg and walk away functions as an Earned Stasis resolution. Internal and external conflicts (ecological atrocity vs private grief) are well braided conceptually. However, on the page the pressure doesn’t escalate much: once the drought is established, his task proceeds almost without resistance, and the oncoming storm never truly constrains or endangers his goal. The result is a beautifully textured but mostly linear execution rather than a tightening crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.0)
    The core stake—whether she can access forbidden echoes before conformity closes over her and the House wakes—is legible and thematically sharp. There is a clear tightening from traversing the courtyard to wrestling with resistant temporal threads to confronting her failed selves inside the prism. However, external resistance is minimal and there’s no substantial reversal; the threads “resist” but never plausibly threaten failure, and the touted time limit doesn’t generate on-page tactical adjustment or sacrifice. The conflict remains more conceptual than visceral, keeping tension solid but not gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central stake—whether Marcus will remain a manipulative puppeteer or surrender control of narrative—is clear and escalates from intellectual curiosity to an identity-level reckoning. The main pressure points (Julian’s accusation, the tape reversal, the blind woman’s story) are well chosen and each narrows his viable self-concept. However, his internal struggle is relatively frictionless; once he leaves the dome, his path to renunciation feels almost inevitable, with limited on-page pushback or temptation to retreat. The ethical calculus is nonetheless sharply focused at the climax, where he literally destroys his instruments.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving the dignity and witnessed-ness of an extinction—is clear and poignant, but the on-page pressure is relatively static. We’re told the migration will end by nightfall and that she’s tracking the final numbers, yet there’s no distinct mid-beat tightening where she must alter tactics or choose between competing goods. Her core agency is to continue the ritual and then dismantle an old tower, which reads as a confirmation of stance rather than a hard test of it. The result is thematically strong but low in felt escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can safely translate the fragile, half-rotted card into enduring light—is clear but remains relatively abstract and unopposed. Pressure “escalates” mainly through intensifying imagery (the aurora growing, the rope humming) rather than through new obstacles or narrowing options. There is one meaningful deepening in the way her past failure charges the current attempt, but on-page resistance is minimal and success feels almost guaranteed once she begins. As a result, tension is more meditative than gripping, effective for mood but limiting for stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—remain bound to the directive and bunker, or surrender to the path and leave—is clear and present throughout. Pressure does escalate through the approaching storm and the onset of the compound, culminating in the dream’s reconfiguration of her role and the final act of stepping out. However, the conflict remains largely internal and philosophical, with little sense that she might genuinely choose to stay, so the tightening feels contemplative rather than sharply suspenseful. The cost is conceptual and vocational more than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central pressure is Elior’s choice to move from safe observation and hoarding into active participation and risk in sealing the covenant. Escalation is evident in the burning of extra candles, discovery of the encryption, the tile heating, and the demand for blood, which narrows his options. The stakes are high in a spiritual/epochal sense (new dynasty’s constellation, 26,000-year alignment), though they remain more metaphysical than viscerally tense. The cost is clear but the conflict is largely internal and contemplative rather than sharply contested.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central conflict—Elias versus personified resentment—is clear, and the stakes (whether resentment can be released rather than perpetuated) are thematically weighty. Pressure does escalate somewhat as the sanctuary threatens to warp or collapse and as reality shifts more violently outside. However, the entity yields relatively quickly once the pin is applied; there is no strong reversal or moment where Elias’s strategy might genuinely fail, and no evident price he pays. The conflict resolves elegantly but too smoothly for maximal tension.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—recapturing the runaway dream—is clear, and pressure accumulates as Elias commits to transforming tool and glass into a trap. Escalation comes through deepening the ritual (synchronized breath, fog drawn into glass) rather than through reversals or narrowing options. However, there is minimal sense of risk: failure doesn’t clearly threaten anything beyond an aesthetic loss, and success never feels jeopardized by an opposing force. As a result, tension is gentle and textural rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake is Mara’s stance toward repair versus change, intertwined with her unresolved relationship to her daughter and family legacy. Pressure escalates quietly rather than through overt jeopardy: discovering the orchard and ribbon raises the emotional cost of walking away, and the forgotten bag forces a choice between her old professional identity and inherited, more organic methods. Her decision to stabilize only part of the structure with ancestral tools, then to leave the knife and ribbon in the tree with a promise to return, forecloses the option of either full restoration or total abandonment. Still, the conflict remains largely internal and reflective, so tension never quite tightens to the level that would match the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—what Elara is meant to preserve and whether she can bear the paradox of her nonlinear inheritance—is clear but largely internal and philosophical. There is a discernible deepening when the shell warms and when the central tree answers, reweighting her understanding from external “forbidden knowledge” to an internal cipher and self-planted orchard. However, the conflict remains low-intensity; her inquiries never feel truly risky or costly, and no live alternative path is meaningfully foreclosed on the page. Tension is present as a tonal unease rather than as a sharpened contest of desires or values.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.0)
    The primary stake—preserving erased wisdom before paradox reduces the archive to noise—is strong and signaled early, and Elara’s tactic shift (from walking to renegotiating via gaps in knowledge) marks a clear deepening. However, escalation feels relatively smooth and unopposed; the mountain responds with some resistance (“grinding protests”) but never truly threatens to deny or punish her beyond that. There’s little sense of a credible possibility of failure or of sacrifice beyond conceptual reframing, which keeps the conflict intellectually engaging but emotionally cool.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming the narrative/name of the twin—is clearly stated early and pays off when Maya chooses to accept “trapped freedom” and take the twin’s hand. Conflict is primarily internal and situational, with one meaningful deepening at the crow’s nest when she must decide whether to pluck the name and accept the plural identity. However, the path is comparatively smooth: the fog, shifting memories, and boat’s dissolution are evocative but don’t truly threaten her goal or force trade-offs beyond conceptual acceptance. As a result, tension is steady but never bites as hard as the imagery promises.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—repairing an absent treaty and ending centuries of war—is powerful on paper, and the global cost is conceptually enormous. Yet on the page, pressure remains low: no opposing force, no ticking clock beyond the nominal alignment, and no genuine possibility of failure are dramatized. Elara’s process is meticulous but unopposed; the gears “groaned and shifted,” but nothing threatens her or forces a trade-off or sacrifice in real time. As a result, conflict feels mostly abstract, with minimal escalation beyond accumulation of effort.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—carving out literal and psychic quiet from overwhelming cosmic noise—is clear and present early. Pressure escalates via the discovery of the discordant fracture and the increasingly delicate work of inverting harmonics, with the ice cracks as a live feedback mechanism. However, resistance is largely procedural and smooth; there is no strong reversal or moment where she might fail or pay a visible mid-scene price, and the energy beings recoil offstage without active counter-pressure. The result is a beautifully executed but relatively low-friction conflict curve.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—proving that patterns/coincidences are meaningful by successfully rekindling the beacon—is signaled early and tightened by the imminent Thornwheel alignment and Elara’s singular ability to decode it. Pressure escalates structurally from discovery to revelation to timed activation, and her agency at the prism beat drives the outcome. However, there’s little resistance or credible chance of failure once she has the instructions; no new obstacle tests her conviction or forces a costly trade-off in the climactic moment. As a result, the conflict feels more like a solemn execution of a destined role than a struggle with real jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—how Elara relates to collective memory and her own identity—tightens as the storm intensifies and she realizes these are the founders’ final memories. Pressure escalates through the time-bounded storm, the anomaly at the tallest monument, and her dawning understanding that to preserve is also to join. Her final agency is a kind of earned stasis/acceptance: she endures and consents to becoming part of the archive, foreclosing the path of remaining a detached recorder. The conflict is largely internal and conceptual, so while effective for this mode, it lacks the visceral friction that would push it into the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elian can pierce the entrenched hopelessness of the besieged fortress—is clear and thematically potent. Pressure does build texturally as his ritual intensifies, the fire changes, and more of the fortress responds, culminating in the exhaustion of the knot and destruction of the mosaic. However, conflict remains mostly one-sided and internalized; there’s little resistance or risk beyond abstract despair and the loss of the mosaic, and no tangible threat that could cause him to fail. As a result, the escalation feels beautiful and effective but not truly fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she will stay and what that means for “who we might become”—is clear, and the difficult conversation supplies credible situational pressure. Escalation is mostly internal and thematic: the tension moves from unspoken question to explicit acknowledgment of time running out (tide pools, evaporating water) to the decision to accept a liminal, unresolved state. However, the pressure doesn’t significantly tighten beyond the initial pause; there’s little sense of narrowing options or a real test of competing values beyond a gentle reframe. The result is a well-shaped but relatively static conflict with a soft, contemplative peak.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.0)
    The stakes—recovering the specific “gilded hush” of her mother’s last years without being lost forever when gravity rights itself—are clear and thematically coherent. Pressure escalates mainly through the ticking clock (clouds churning, gravity reasserting) rather than overt obstacles, which suits the lyric mode but keeps intensity on the quieter side. Mara’s key decisions (climb, stay long enough to find the hush, then tear herself away to descend) drive the story’s tightening. A slightly more dramatized moment of hesitation or near-failure could sharpen the felt cost, but what’s here is still strong.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—whether silence will feel annihilating or consoling to the grieving architect—is clear but remains largely internal and uncontested. Pressure does deepen when the storm glass predicts a twelve-minute valley of deadened sound and Mara deliberately maneuvers to stay in it, but there’s little real resistance or risk of failure on the page. The architect’s shift from tension to release happens with minimal friction, so the sense of price paid is quiet rather than sharply dramatized. The story reads as a single, graceful movement rather than a beat of genuine escalation and test.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—recovering lost wisdom rather than claiming power—is established early and resolved clearly, and the time constraint (three hours until sunrise) provides a structural pressure. However, once she finds the bulkhead, the path from murals to waterfall to orchard to stairway unfolds almost frictionlessly, with minimal genuine risk, setback, or trade-off beyond time. The main “choice” at the top (crown vs archive) is narratively prefigured so strongly by her characterization that it lacks suspense, reading more as confirmation than a painful decision. Conflict is thus present and coherent but relatively low-intensity, with escalation more scenic than oppositional.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira can move from suffocation in Elias’s shadow to autonomous breathing—is legible and paid off. Pressure escalates modestly as she arrives, confronts him with blame, and submits to a painful, high-voltage transmission. However, the internal and relational conflict resolves quickly and harmoniously once the scars connect, with little resistance or real risk that the lesson could fail or harm her. The emotional price is implied but not deeply dramatized, keeping escalation solid but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—what Maya will do with the bolt/quantum promise, and whether she remains crushed by or transforms her guilt—is clear and escalates once the bolt appears and begins to heat. The meaningful tightening comes when she chooses to “volunteer” as interpreter and presses the bolt into her palm, accepting the potential danger of becoming a pressure vessel. However, tension feels somewhat foregone; there’s little sense she might refuse, misuse, or be destroyed by the object, so options don’t narrow as sharply as they could. The internal and external conflicts are well braided but could use one concrete counter-possibility or visible risk to sharpen the price of her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering truth that will end a dynasty—is strong and clearly stated, and there is some escalation as the mechanism spins up, reveals horrifying specifics, and then begins to wind down. However, antagonistic pressure is largely historical and atmospheric; there’s no on-page opposition or real risk of failure beyond the spring stopping, and Kael never faces a difficult choice that forces a trade-off. The main tightening—the dust letters wavering as the spring runs down—adds a mild temporal squeeze but doesn’t quite feel like a true crucible. The resulting tension is more intellectual and aesthetic than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Valen will remain an isolated, armored self or surrender his autonomy to become a conduit of possibility—is clear and carried through. Pressure escalates via his enacted choices (performing the choreography, pledging silence, removing armor) and the greenhouse’s intensifying response. The cost is real but mostly conceptual; we feel the magnitude more intellectually than viscerally, and there’s little sense of genuine resistance or alternative paths at the climax. Still, the final crossing of the door reads as a committed, irreversible turn.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Maya can find or construct meaning and mercy within a system built to forget—is clear and threads the whole piece. Pressure increases texturally as a single anomaly becomes a pattern of hidden rebellions, culminating in her decision to formalize a counter-archive of “submerged mercies.” However, opposition is largely atmospheric; her supervisor’s directive to cull never concretely tightens into a real dilemma or visible institutional risk. As a result, escalation is emotionally persuasive but relatively low-intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central stake—whether truth can be restored against systemic historical revision—is clearly articulated and escalates from private desperation to public broadcast. Elias’s agency drives every turn: choosing to run to the tunnel instead of fleeing, committing to the key, triggering a non-recallable transmission, and accepting ongoing anonymity. However, pressure feels somewhat unidirectional; once underground, the plan unfolds without significant on-page impediment, moral friction, or visible loss beyond implied risk. The conflict is conceptually high-stakes but could use one concrete failure point or sacrifice during the lagoon sequence to sharpen the price of success.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central conflict—Elias vs. a world-ending sonic prophecy reconstituting itself via dew—is clear and escalates as each droplet threatens to “release a phoneme of the code.” Pressure tightens effectively toward the last dewdrop that “refus[es] to fall,” which is a strong, focused climax image. Elias’s agency is central; he adapts tactics by matching the prophecy’s frequency with “inverse silence,” and the outcome clearly depends on his precision, not luck. The main limitation is that the world-ending stakes, while declared, are felt more conceptually than viscerally, and his personal cost is underplayed beyond fatigue and ongoing duty.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—decode the leaves and trigger or miss a final germination before the hush ends—is clear and Elias’s actions directly address it. Pressure escalates through his decision to apply forbidden/legendary folklore and physically prod the tree, then to reconfigure his monuments into a doorway. However, opposition remains mostly abstract; nothing pushes back, and the transformation unfolds with minimal friction or visible risk beyond implied self-sacrifice. The result is a beautiful but relatively gentle arc of tension rather than a sharply tightening one.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central stake—recovering the compass to clear her mentor’s name—interlocks neatly with the physical hazard of the stones and her internal struggle with uncertainty. The decisive tightening occurs when her calculations fail and she must improvise under real physical risk. Resolution is earned through her altered stance rather than a lucky break, though the danger could be felt a touch more viscerally in the body. Still, pressure escalates in a focused, satisfying way for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.8)
    The core stake—can Elara redeem Kael without breaking the immutable laws she believes in—is clear and thematically potent. Yet the pressure doesn’t truly tighten: we’re told she pushes instruments “beyond their calibrated ranges” and tests “the tensile strength of causality,” but no specific failure, backlash, or hard choice undercuts her path. Once she attempts the ritual, it works without a meaningful on-page risk of loss, partial failure, or irreversible compromise of her principles. As a result, the climax is beautiful but not very tense, with cost mostly aesthetic (golden scars) rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—liberating lost souls by transforming their pain into laughter—is clear early and paid off in the umbrella-woman’s release and the crowd of spirits following suit. Pressure does increase as more spirits press close and Elara’s body pays a price, but success never feels truly in doubt; the conflict is spiritual and tonal more than precarious. The key tightening is the resistant soul’s admission that she “cannot move on,” which Elara answers with blood and altered music. Overall, it’s a well-shaped but relatively low-risk conflict arc.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elena can reconfigure her torture into a workable model of mercy—is clear and thematically weighty. Pressure does deepen as she moves from raw sensation to the clearing and the hovering equation, with the strap snapping as a visible culminating act. However, conflict remains largely internal and meditative, with few concrete alternative options or tradeoffs dramatized; escalation feels like an intensification of imagery more than a narrowing of paths. The result is resonant but a bit static in terms of tactical change.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—liberating Mara from erasure into collective memory—is intelligible and consistently held, and the activation of the lens does create a meaningful deepening as Elara moves from observation to literal intervention. However, the conflict is almost entirely one-sided; Mara offers no resistance, the painting yields without complication, and there’s no palpable risk that Elara might fail or pay a cost beyond transient strain. The escalation is more a smooth intensification of process than a pressured narrowing of options, which keeps tension comparatively low for a piece aiming at elite publication.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Maya will interact with and resolve the liminal machinery of this haunting—is clear but relatively low-simmer, more curious than dangerous. There is a meaningful tightening when the ringmaster appears and when she realizes the mainspring anchors a door between worlds, leading to her choice to install it in the governor. However, there’s little sense of real peril or competing options; there’s no strong possibility she might refuse, mishandle, or pay a visible price. As a result, the escalation feels intellectually satisfying but emotionally gentle, closer to an elegant puzzle being solved than a pressured conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will break the perfect systems and restart time—is clear and escalates as she moves from reading frost to physically applying the printed “map of breaking.” Her agency drives every major turn, culminating in the rupture, but she encounters almost no resistance beyond metaphoric reluctance (“the machine groaned… with the reluctance of reality itself”). There is little sense that she might fail or pay a specific price; consequence is large in scope but abstracted. As a result, tension is present but moderate, more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—how this civilization is understood and, by extension, how Kaelen understands his own history—is established early and tightens through the shard discovery and methodological shift. Conflict with Voss is mostly off-page, which slightly mutes direct pressure, but the council scene and demand for “empirical proof” still create a credible test of Kaelen’s stance. Escalation is more internal/thematic than event-heavy, yet his choice to experiment against superstition, refuse then later embrace mirror-covering, and finally remain behind all foreclose paths and carry cost. The stakes stay primarily conceptual and emotional rather than visceral, but they are coherent and do not stall.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—prevent endless night by restoring the keystone box—is clearly stated early and tightened by the looming midnight and the covenant’s truth requirement. There is escalation as the darkness presses on the chamber, the ritual progresses, and the worldwide music boxes awaken into chorus. What’s missing is a credible reversal or moment where failure feels genuinely possible; the stone never flickers toward wilting, Elias never doubts or falters, and no tactic change is forced. The resolution is thus earned in plot terms but somewhat low in on-page price and tension given the declared world-ending scale.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—reaching “the path to where explanations failed”—is clear, and the story tightens as she descends and encounters increasingly impossible phenomena. However, resistance and cost remain low; nothing seriously threatens her goal, and she doesn’t face a meaningful trade-off beyond temporary discomfort and implied future alienation from “the world of explanations.” The pressure escalates in wonder, not in danger or conflict, which fits the mode but limits dramatic tension. The final endurance/embrace of mystery is earned but not strongly tested.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stakes are internal and artistic: whether she continues treating driftwood as inert material or embraces it as part of a timewoven alliance that will change her practice. Pressure coheres but remains low-intensity: the storm never threatens her survival in concrete terms, and there’s little sense of what she risks if she fails to adopt this new stance. The escalation from confusion to collaboration with the storm is graceful but lacks a decisive, costly test of commitment—her shift feels more like an elegant slide than a pressured choice. As a result, the conflict functions but never fully tightens into something that feels genuinely hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Lyra can re-understand her mother’s darkness as hope rather than retreat—is clear early and deepens as winter thaws. Escalation is primarily internal and textural: repeated blue-hour visits and slow disclosure of the window’s construction lead to the crucial turn when she learns the flowers face east. The cost—relinquishing a protective melancholy narrative about her mother—is legible, though it’s rendered in lyric insight more than in a sharply dramatized dilemma. A slightly more pressured, resistant moment around accepting this new reading could have heightened the sense of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering buried atrocity at the cost of Elias’s mind and safety—is clear and escalates as he moves from observation to physical enactment under worsening retrocognitive pressure. The meaningful tightening arrives when he decides to descend and physically enact the semaphore, with the retrocognitive trap “burning away the boundaries” as he risks erasure of self. The ending prices that commitment in terms of permanent haunting and an ongoing vocation rather than release. Conflict sits more in moral/spiritual endurance than in concrete reversals, which suits the piece but slightly mutes visceral tension.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether the town returns as a nostalgic simulacrum or as a new, self-made civilization—is clear, and the key tightening arrives at the temptation to “smash the bottle” which she consciously rejects. Internal and external stakes align well: the world’s loss of magic versus the cost of embracing finite human effort. Still, escalation is primarily intellectual; there are no real reversals after the central decision, and the new order manifests without visible sacrifice or complication beyond the conceptual loss of wishing.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake is Elias’s pursuit of true, complete archiving versus remaining a partial, perhaps misguided scribe, and the narrative does escalate as the shaving shifts from waste to map to ingested catalyst. His decision to place the shaving under his tongue is a genuine tightening and irreversible step. However, the tension is largely conceptual and gently textured; there’s little friction or resistance testing his commitment, and consequences for the wider world remain abstract. The conflict works but doesn’t quite bite hard enough to feel fully high-stakes at a visceral level.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—reopening the last sanctuary of life and time—is potent but stays largely uncontested on the page. Pressure escalates more through intensifying imagery than through reversals or genuine risk; once the ritual begins, nothing seriously threatens failure. Her agency drives the key turn (choosing to place the cap, sing, and then stay), yet those choices are not framed against viable alternatives. As a result, tension is atmospheric rather than gripping, limiting conflict depth for a publication aiming at maximal dramatic sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—how the mountain communities will be warned and whether they remain attuned to natural cues—is clear and tied to the approaching storm. Pressure does tighten as the barometer drops and zero hour nears, culminating in the bell pull. However, conflict remains largely unopposed: no character or system pushes back on her choice, and there’s no real risk of failure or visible fallout in-scene. The result is a thoughtful, gently escalating piece rather than a strongly pressurized one.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elian’s solitude is meaningless stagnation or a fertile state of surrender—is clear and coherently pressured by the meteor activity, culminating in the full shower and his choice to reinterpret and depart. Escalation is textural rather than event-driven, but the density increase (single meteor → shower → dance → dawn) does reweight his situation. The main weakness is the softness of cost and resistance: the conflict never quite bites, so the shift feels more contemplative than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will accept becoming the keeper of unspoken burdens—is clear but not strongly pressured. Most conflict is conceptual and one-sided: ghosts and covenant expectations bear down, but Elias offers minimal resistance, and nothing tangible pushes back once the ghosts appear. The key “turn” is the ghost woman’s touch and his ensuing realization, which reads more as anointment than choice tested under duress. Without a more visible price for accepting or refusing, escalation feels contemplative rather than tense, limiting the story’s dramatic impact.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s struggle to maintain order and her need to secure more time/understanding—remains relatively abstract, with minimal concrete jeopardy during the central action. There is one clear deepening when she presses the fragment to her sternum and experiences the “texture of time passing,” shifting the conflict from survival to reconceiving time itself. However, escalation feels smooth rather than pressured; she never faces a real possibility of failure, nor must she visibly sacrifice something tangible on the page to gain this new state. The cost is mostly conceptual (her old role becomes obsolete) rather than dramatized as an agonized choice.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.2)
    The primary conflict—how to respond to the broken kite—is gentle but real: she must choose between a false restoration and an honest, imperfect repair that honors her belief in brokenness. The kite snapping is a clean escalation from her solitary ritual into a situation with another’s emotions and expectations at stake, and the boy’s fear provides soft external pressure. Still, the stakes remain small and there’s little sense of risk that her choice might hurt or alienate the boy; he accepts the transformed kite quickly, limiting tension. The cost—sacrificing her cherished feather, changing the kite’s behavior permanently—is meaningful but understated.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can transform the orchard into a functioning interspecies embassy before he dies—is clear and conceptually rich. Pressure does escalate in an accumulative way as more species join the network and his health quietly declines, but there’s minimal friction or reversal; obstacles are largely implied rather than dramatized. His choice to devote himself to this work over “desperate medicine” is powerful but presented as settled early, so it doesn’t sharpen late-stage conflict. The result is serene, moving tension rather than gripping escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.5)
    The central stake—how humanity has truly changed after first contact—is compelling but remains predominantly intellectual rather than dramatized through risky or costly action. There is little resistance or complication once the group assembles; the data seems to confirm their thesis without friction, reversal, or sacrifice beyond implied professional exile. Escalation is therefore more a deepening of concept than a tightening of pressure. The result is thoughtful but relatively low-tension, with limited sense of options being foreclosed in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—reclaiming the battlefield before the tide reclaims it—is clear but mostly conceptual and uncontested. Escalation comes through increasing procedural and liturgical specificity rather than new obstacles or sharpened dilemmas. The birds’ detailed chemical “instructions” and the coachman’s careful mixtures provide some sense of adaptive pressure. Still, there’s little sense of risk of failure or competing imperatives, so tension remains meditative rather than acute.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Ash can transform his distance from Mara into a felt closeness—is signaled early via his reaction to the cylinder and sustained through the multi-day search. Pressure escalates modestly but coherently: other dogs give up, while Ash continues alone, which heightens the sense of cost and commitment. The discovery of the leaf and encoded explanation of the riddle serve as a clear deepening rather than a twist, reweighting his quest. Stakes stay intimate and internal, so the tension is more elegiac than sharp, but it remains legible and non-static.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—enduring isolating temporal torture versus finding a way out—is clear and present from early on. Pressure escalates as her perception of the fixed point reveals that her curse is also the tool needed to escape, reweighting her situation. Her agency drives the turn: she chooses to systematize her perception into cartography and then to act on the impossible glimpse. The cost (centuries of subjective isolation and the gamble of stepping through a one-chance threshold) is implicit rather than sharply re-tested in the final moment, which keeps this just shy of a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—amending a treaty to heal a broken world/sky—is signaled clearly and paid off, but the on-page conflict is surprisingly gentle. Once the guardian appears, it recognizes the Sun-Counter quickly and collaborates; there is no substantial reversal, only a ritual carried to completion. Internal and external pressures (cold, altitude, fear of the unknown) are invoked but rarely force a hard trade-off or genuine risk of failure. Escalation is more accumulative and ceremonial than tense, which blunts the sense of cost despite the grand stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central conflict—whether Mira will unbind and expose the ledger, risking comfort and complicity—is clear and escalates as she moves from ritualized walking to the decisive cut of the cords and public reading. Pressure is primarily ethical and internal, but the leaderless, waiting crowd and the interregnum subtly raise the stakes beyond her private psyche. The cost is more implied than concretely dramatized (no on-page retaliation or immediate consequence), which slightly softens impact. Still, her choice visibly forecloses the safer path of silence.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Vey will continue to numb themself via substitution or confront and reconfigure their relationship to memory/home—is signaled early and pays off when they choose to seed the mountain and forego illusion. The glow/stone discovery is the key tightening, deepening the situation from private coping mechanism to a responsibility toward a graveyard of tongues. Internal and external conflicts dovetail nicely at the summit, where the choice to accept pain alters both Vey and the mountain. Escalation is more conceptual than oppositional, and the path from discovery to solution is relatively unimpeded, which keeps tension from reaching the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Kaelen can reframe his responsibility for the prince’s death and thus free the village—is clear and present from early on. Pressure accumulates through his painstaking work more than through reversals, with the decisive tightening at the moment he inserts the final thread and confronts the mirror of his past move. The cost is legible in the years of exile and his choice to remain, trading any hope of royal rehabilitation for a humbler, truer vocation. The conflict is largely internal and contemplative, so tension feels steady rather than sharply escalating, which keeps this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.0)
    The stakes—whether the Overseers can fix a single official history versus Kael’s attempt to fragment it—are clearly articulated and tied to a ticking ritual. Pressure escalates via the looming rotation/glow of the spire, Lira amplifying the “noise” at the worst possible time, and the Overseers’ arrival demanding silence. Kael’s crucial choice to abandon crafted control for messy, collaborative speech is an earned turning point with a visible cost. The conflict remains mostly conceptual and symbolic rather than viscerally felt, which mutes some tension even as the structure is sound.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—reweaving a broken relationship/legacy before physical annihilation—is stated early and escalates via structural decay and dwindling minutes. Elara’s agency (choosing to keep narrating, to believe in kintsugi rather than “varnishing ruin”) drives the only path to resolution. The external disaster (acid sea) and internal doubt interlock well, with the cost of success being the loss of the physical world. Escalation is largely linear rather than full of reversals, but there is one meaningful tightening from fear to committed, sacrificial completion.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will remain paralyzed by grief or re-engage with art and his promise—is signaled early and coherently escalated. The wrong turn deepens both external pressure (uncertainty in the cave) and internal pressure (retreat vs. pressing on into the unknown). His choice to place the shell and then to paint constitutes a clear trade-off: relinquishing Marguerite’s object in order to reclaim his practice. The tension is more meditative than sharp-edged, but it does tighten meaningfully toward closure.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central conflict—Elias’s quiet method versus Voss’s exhausted regime of force—plays out concretely in the attempt to save the Maria Celeste, with the ship’s frantic lights and eaten radio providing clear external pressure. There is a meaningful tightening as the story shifts from the history of failure and death to this immediate, high-stakes test of Elias’s philosophy. However, the external jeopardy resolves smoothly once the device is engaged; we don’t see any substantial risk of failure or cost beyond Elias’s internal strain, which slightly softens the sense of escalation. The piece excels more at deepening thematic tension than at dramatizing hard tradeoffs under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether she can construct a meaningful way to “navigate” loss rather than flee it—is clear early and deepens as she assembles and then activates the device. Escalation is primarily internal and textural: the gibbous moon bringing cognitive clarity, the click “like a bone settling,” the humming bronze reweighting what navigation means. Her final choice to accept being “navigator of nothing external now” forecloses escape and is earned. Pressure never quite tightens into a sharp, dilemma-like pinch point on the page, which keeps the conflict from feeling fully maximal.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—regaining some interior privacy in a post-empathy world—is signaled early and deepens as the relic forces a choice between duty and self-protection. The story’s main tightening is Maren’s decision to defy the Council and perform the dangerous, emotionally costly ritual, which narrows her options and commits her to a path with lasting consequences. Internal and external conflicts are well braided (science vs superstition; safety vs obligation; collective vs individual), but tension remains mostly contemplative rather than palpably suspenseful. A clearer sense of imminent consequence from the empathic network or Council could push escalation into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Maren will decode and accept the stranger’s final gesture/legacy—is clear and coherently signaled once the boutonnière and borrowed memories appear. Pressure escalates texturally as the memories warm and sharpen, culminating in the hot boutonnière and her mirroring gesture at the dock’s edge. The conflict is largely internal and contemplative, with the choice to remain at the post rather than reject the inheritance functioning as the key tightening. It’s effective but somewhat gentle; the emotional and ethical cost of that acceptance could be made slightly sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stakes—fulfilling Thomas’s promise and surviving the rising flood—are legible early, and the clock plus mechanical doorway provide one clear tightening. Arthur’s decision to press on, use the chip, and ultimately step through as the water climbs is an earned crystallization of stance. Still, conflict is more situational than contested: there’s little sense that he seriously considers retreat or an alternative, so the choice reads as somewhat foregone rather than hard-won. Emotional and ethical trade-offs (what he gives up by becoming this archivist) could be sharpened to increase the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will cling to hollow earthly power or accept a costly, cosmic vocation—is present and coherent, and the widening celestial wound provides a clear externalized pressure. Escalation comes through accumulating images (worsening sky, mouth that could devour kingdoms) and then the shared exhale with Mara that forces a stance. However, the conflict unfolds with very little resistance: Elara rarely hesitates, and Mara offers no serious counterpressure, so there is limited sense of options narrowing under duress. The price of the choice (loss of crown, separation from mortal life) is stated more than it is dramatized in a way that would sharpen tension.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can successfully capture “presence” rather than mere light—is signaled early and followed through, with Mira’s whispered secret providing a genuine tightening of pressure. The central turn is the shift from technical alchemy to the lived, risky intimacy between the two friends; the experiment can only work if Elara allows that vulnerability to exist. However, external resistance is minimal, and there’s little sense of a path foreclosed or a real alternative lost beyond the abstract possibility of remaining in absence. As conflict, it’s emotionally credible but relatively low-friction for a top-tier literary piece.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will be consumed by temporal fragmentation or find a way to live with it—is clear and tight. Pressure escalates from suffocating jealousy in the cabin to the “soaring” breakthrough where he reconceives his life as tapestry, then relaxes into a managed, domesticated nostalgia. The key turn (repurposing jealousy into a tool and accepting the chronicler role) is motivated and reweights his options. The cost and danger remain mostly internal and abstract, which slightly softens the felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is internal—how Mara lives with the loss of smell and whether she can still “read” and humanize others—which is signaled early but never faces a sharp external test. The discovery of the birthing clamp screw is the one meaningful tightening, giving her a charged object through which to reconsider time, birth, and her own transition. Pressure remains gentle; there is no real opposition or forced trade-off, only a contemplative deepening. This works for a lyric piece but keeps tension and felt price in the moderate rather than high range.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—preserving her hands/dexterity long enough to complete the transformative inscription—is clear, and the breath clock plus storm approach provide coherent pressure. Escalation comes chiefly from her worsening oxygen deprivation and the final, deepest scar’s resistance, which forces a riskier, more intimate method (using a tear instead of ink). Internal and external conflicts are well braided but remain relatively smooth; there’s little sense that she might fail or choose to stop. The felt price at the end is more emotional/conceptual than sharply perilous, which slightly softens the peak tension in a market aiming for maximal intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stakes—redeeming a man she half-wronged before his anchor is destroyed—are strong and legible from early on. Pressure escalates from preparatory setup to the ghost’s unstable manifestation, to the risky choice to open the bottle fully and attempt reconciliation rather than banishment. The cost lands emotionally (partial forgiveness; her column and usual tools sidelined; orchard lost), but tactical pressure from the time limit and potential failure of the ritual could be made more acute. Overall, the conflict is more internal/ethical than perilous, but it coheres and tightens appropriately for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—unraveling cosmic illusions and unifying language with silence before the universe’s fate fixes—is conceptually enormous but remains abstract on the page. Pressure does rise somewhat via the approaching end of the “hiccup” and the collapsing library, yet there is no concrete alternative path or visible risk of failure. The protagonist never appears to waver, adapt tactics, or pay an on-page price beyond serene completion of a ritual. As a result, escalation feels more like a smooth intensification of imagery than a tightening of conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—grasping what clocks measure—is present from early on and does evolve toward an answer at the end. Pressure accrues through the backward count and the tightening focus on horizon vs. key, but the conflict remains largely meditative rather than feeling truly contested or risky. There’s one main deepening turn (understanding clocks as measuring resistance/the present), but no strong sense of options closing or genuine sacrifice. The result is a beautifully textured but relatively low-intensity arc.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central conflict—security vs connection, possession vs release—develops coherently, with the pointer-as-threat marking the peak pressure and “Show me” as a clear internal turn. Stakes are emotional and conceptual (how to relate without owning) rather than physical, but they are signaled early and deepened through Eli’s explanation and the shared observation of the mycelium. The main cost is subtle: Maya gives up a defensive identity and the fantasy of controlling or excluding Eli, which is legible but gently rendered. A slightly stronger sense of external risk or consequence (e.g., real repercussions for his intrusion) could sharpen the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—how to live and think after a heart attack while reconciling rigor with uncertainty—is clear and conceptually high, but the on-page pressure remains largely internal and steady rather than sharply escalating. There is a meaningful deepening when graffiti becomes “her new texts” and she consciously decides she will teach differently, accepting that losing and uncertainty have a kind of grace. However, there are no strong reversals or narrowed options beyond the quiet but persistent constraint of mortality and the doctor’s warning. Tension operates more through accumulating reflection than through concrete, tested choices, keeping the conflict strong but not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Mara will maintain her ethic of estrangement in the face of human need—is clear and consistently tested. Pressure accumulates texturally as callers become more emotionally loaded, with the teenager’s call as the most acute test of her methods. However, Mara never truly wavers; her adherence is firm, so escalation is more in subject matter than in her options narrowing. The cost at closure is implied (her perpetual solitude and the pain she enforces) rather than dramatized in a single hard choice, keeping tension strong but not maximal.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—successfully regenerating the covenant so the dead can speak for another decade—is clearly stated, and the risk of failure is named in the “one misstep, one crushed flower” passage. However, that danger remains hypothetical; the scene never presents a concrete near-failure or reversal that forces a new tactic or sharper trade-off. The internal conflict (holding/dissolving memory) deepens toward the end and does provide a modest tightening as the blooms close and twilight drains. Overall, pressure accrues, but it never quite bites as hard as the conceptual stakes promise.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—can Elias transform loneliness from a private disaster into a shared, connective practice—is clear and sharpened by his reciprocity rule. Escalation is primarily accumulative: more stories, more voices, the station filling, culminating in the single child whose presence forces a revaluation rather than a large external crisis. The turn when reciprocity “inverts” is clean and thematically pointed, but the pressure remains largely conceptual; Elias isn’t forced into a sharply drawn dilemma so much as into recognizing what has already accrued. The cost is subtle (admitting his own loneliness and relinquishing his protective “ledger” stance) but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central stake—whether she will finally confront and map her own long-avoided emotional terrain—is clearly signaled and carries through. Pressure escalates as the forest’s frequencies intensify, the ring heats, and she moves from cacophony into a charged absence; that density shift works under an accumulative lens. Her kneeling at the silent pocket to face “years of cartographing others’ pain while suppressing her own” is a meaningful tightening that forecloses continued avoidance. However, conflict remains almost entirely internal and rarely manifests as on-page struggle or temptation to turn back, which keeps tension from fully sharpening.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stakes (freeing the colony ships and metabolizing her own failure) are clear and present early, and her decision to revise with “deliberate imprecision” is a meaningful tightening that risks compounding the error. However, the process unfolds with little resistance; the anomaly “digesting” the changes provides texture but not real jeopardy, and success feels almost foregone once she begins writing. Internal stakes deepen modestly as ghost-interpreters appear, but they don’t force hard trade-offs. The cost is more about relinquishing certainty and the pen than about facing genuine risk of catastrophic failure.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can transform his obscurity and the harbor’s quiet into meaningful “music”—is clear and coherently pursued. Pressure does deepen as he progresses along the pier and toward the “final movement,” culminating in the choice to translate the mapped silence into a performed symphony of signs. However, escalation is mostly internal and aesthetic; there’s little sense of real risk beyond emotional failure, and no reversal or hard trade-off that visibly narrows his options. This keeps the conflict from feeling fully taut at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—protecting and transmitting the covenant without letting it be colonized—is strong but plays out mostly as affirmed intention rather than embattled conflict. Once she discovers the archive and decodes the message, there’s little genuine resistance on the page; designing the trail feels like a thorough execution of a plan, not a pressured gamble. The internal conflict between destruction and care is implied but not really dramatized as a live dilemma in specific moments. As a result, escalation is more conceptual (each new artwork on another continent) than felt as narrowing options or increasing cost.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—using the experimental system to resurrect or at least re-contact Elena—is clear early and remains coherent. Escalation is primarily textural but definite: from habitual drumming/stimming to a moment when “tonight, the frequencies aligned,” culminating in the lagoon raising Elena’s partial form and the ventilation system forcibly severing it. The cost is emotional and felt: physical exhaustion, renewed grief, and the implicit risk of his ongoing clandestine attempts, all crystallized in his drained persistence at dawn. This is strong, but the conflict never quite sharpens into a true tactical dilemma or visible trade-off beyond endurance vs. impossible hope, keeping it just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—ensuring safe, covert navigation for critical supplies during the storm and proving the whisper network’s superiority—is present but under-pressurized. We’re told ships have been rerouted and medical supplies secured, yet no beat truly courts failure: there’s no moment where a wrong choice, mis-heard step, or map ambiguity threatens disaster. The main escalation is conceptual (Kael taking on the hospital ship route, then handing coin and instructions to the young worker), which deepens the pattern but doesn’t narrow options with visible cost. As a result, tension is more atmospheric than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether darkness (and the canal’s depths) can learn to cradle light—is present but remains abstract and low-pressure. There is some escalation in the water’s response (“something ancient rising”) and the fish’s disturbance requiring an adjustment, yet these do not meaningfully narrow options or force trade-offs. The guardian never seems at risk of failing or paying a visible price; the ritual feels assured rather than contested. As a result, tension stays mostly textural rather than escalating in felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias’s experiment can nudge the town toward hesitation and mercy—is conceptually interesting but only gently pressured. There is no substantive opposition, no risk of failure beyond implication, and Elias never confronts a moment where his plan might break or require adaptation. Escalation is primarily a matter of accumulating imagery (more windows, the grotto humming, the town’s thoughts harmonizing) rather than tightening constraints or raising visible cost. The result is a beautiful but largely unopposed unfolding rather than a true test of his commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central stake—remain safely moored in a false persona or risk everything to answer the deep’s call—is clear and present early, and the whale’s intensifying summons plus the island’s visible rise create one meaningful tightening. Her agency in unclasping the mooring and stepping off the dock directly drives the turn. However, resistance is mostly pre-resolved in interior language; there is little on-page pushback or concrete obstacle once the call peaks, making the choice feel almost inevitable rather than hard-won. The cost is conceptual and emotional rather than dramatized through specific losses beyond a generalized “dock master’s payroll” and social role.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias’s performative care can bridge the “remade hush” for a damaged stranger—is clear but very low-pressure. There is a single tightening when the traveler appears and must decide whether to engage, and his choice to hand her the bird crystallizes his project into a concrete offer. However, no option feels truly foreclosed or dangerous; failure would mean continued numbness, but that cost is more implied than actively pressured in scene. The result is emotionally resonant but structurally soft in terms of escalating conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can use paraphrased, metamorphic language to reclaim a forbidden space and transform—is clearly signaled, and pressure does increase as the colonnade brightens and her body begins to blur. However, conflict is largely internal and under-contested; she meets little opposition beyond remembered censorship and a quickly transcended fear. The turn from hesitation/fear to “tremor of certainty” and full dissolution is conceptually strong but arrives without a real on-page test or trade-off moment where an alternative is live. As a result, escalation feels more like a beautiful ramping-up of intensity than a difficult narrowing of options with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can “awaken” color through the reed and trade for that chance—is clear, and the bargain over the furnace provides a concrete pressure point. The story tightens meaningfully when she offers a treasured painting and Marin risks breaking his long silence; that trade-off is the main escalation. The reversal that the reed awakens Marin’s voice rather than Elara’s sight is thematically satisfying and reconfigures the conflict instead of simply resolving it. Overall tension is more meditative than fraught, with little opposition once the bargain is struck, which keeps the conflict strong but not fully maximal.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will conform to a sanitizing, state-planned pilgrimage or risk a more dangerous, participatory activation of the lab—is clear and does tighten when she chooses to strike the cracked pillar instead of reporting it. That choice triggers a genuine escalation: security protocols are bypassed, the lab awakens, and the sounds flood the grid. However, antagonistic pressure remains mostly abstract; no system or person pushes back on her deviation, and the risks to her or the city are not concretely tested on the page. The ending’s decision to stay deepens the internal conflict but would benefit from a slightly sharper sense of what she sacrifices or endangers.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether grief can be transformed into a navigable, shared space rather than a dead end—is clear from early lines and sharpened when the young man arrives with his brother’s loss. Pressure escalates through the ritual of projection and the moment when the curtains of intention “part,” forcing a shift in how he relates to his grief. Elara’s agency (inviting him into the process, then instructing him to guide someone else) drives the one key tightening: grief must be actively reworked, not merely endured. The cost is more conceptual/emotional than dramatized opposition, so the conflict feels gentle rather than bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether meaning and a credible methodology for understanding collapse can be recovered—is clear but plays out at a cool, conceptual temperature. There is one meaningful tightening when Mara reveals the cards only show the past, shifting Elias’s hope from prediction to understanding and forward recalibration. However, there’s limited sense that anything is at risk in the immediate scene: no relational rupture, moral trade-off, or urgent decision point under pressure, so tension stays steady rather than escalating. The result is intellectually engaging but emotionally low-voltage conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—risking death and sanity to uncover the true cause of the Empire’s fall—is signaled early and tightened as she moves from dangerous access (guardians) to spiritual/psychic risk (flood of knowledge). Her agency drives each escalation: she chooses to embody chaos, to dance, to accept the data flood, and finally to carry the burden out into the world. The cost (emotional devastation and lifelong obligation) is clear if mostly internal rather than dramatized through external consequence. A more concrete near-failure or repercussion from the guardians could have sharpened the sense of peril further.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether hope in humanity’s shared dreams will be consumed or preserved—is clear and grows as the shadow’s feeding on hopeful images is recognized. The main tightening comes when Elara shifts from observation to intervention, choosing a delicate, narrative-based solution rather than force, which reweights the risk that she might damage or freeze the archive. However, the conflict remains largely internal and conceptual, with little sense of time pressure, opposition, or tangible consequence if she fails beyond generalized loss, which keeps escalation from feeling fully acute.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central conflict—whether and how to live with herself after complicity, and whether to continue the work and testify—is clear and stakes are emotionally high for this scope. Pressure accumulates through her self-scrutiny and concrete acts of cleaning, document verification, and symbolic undressing, culminating in the decision to testify and go on. However, the escalation is mostly tonal and reflective; Marcus is already gone, and there’s little on-page pushback or new obstacle to force her hand in scene. The result is a strong but relatively even pressure curve rather than a pronounced tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—recovering or reaching his sister versus accepting the irreducible nature of the “displaced miracle”—is clear and present early. Pressure escalates via concrete moves: anesthesia lifting, plant messages, discovery of the tunnel, descent, hourglass warming, and finally the confrontation with the meteor and preserved sister. The cost is largely conceptual and implied (binding himself to her frost-silence, abandoning tidy closure) rather than dramatized as an explicit loss or sacrifice, which keeps the climax from feeling fully harrowing. Still, the turn from “seeking endings” to “witnessing” is an earned deepening consistent with the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—discovering where unused love is stored—is stated early and answered by the end, but escalation is mostly a steady deepening of imagery rather than mounting pressure. The “hushed thunder” and film strip heating up hint at intensity, yet Elara is never forced into a meaningful trade-off or real chance of failure. Her agency is contemplative rather than embattled; she decides to read, then to “incubate,” and simply succeeds. As a result, the closure is interesting but relatively low-tension.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (recovering her creativity before the aurora fades) is clear and time-bounded, and pressure does intensify as more stars fall and the chorus of “unspoken words” grows louder. There is one real tightening: the revelation that the final step is to lie still and rest while the last star falls, requiring trust and surrender. However, conflict remains primarily internal and somewhat unresisted; there’s little sense that she might fail, be interrupted, or choose a competing value. As a result, escalation reads as ritual completion rather than hard-won adaptation under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether the remnants of green possibility can be preserved against entropy—is clear and threads the piece, and there is one meaningful tightening when Kael realizes he must “become the spark himself” and places the clock. Pressure is primarily conceptual and spiritual, not situational; no explicit counterforce or real alternative path is dramatized, so the decision reads as an inevitable fulfillment rather than a contested choice. Still, his renunciation of individuality (remaining “occasionally everywhere” as sentinel) constitutes a credible cost that reweights the stakes. The story could reach a higher band with one more concrete beat of resistance or risk in approaching or opening the archive.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stakes—loss of the forest’s harmonic network and Kael’s fear of inner silence/overwhelm—are established, but escalation is more conceptual than pressured. The strongest tightening comes when Kael witnesses the stranger actively dismantling roots and must choose to intervene and then seek the nexus. Yet no option is truly foreclosed or painful on the page: the stranger yields ground without much conflict, and the journey to the nexus and insertion of the gear occur without obstruction, so the price paid feels largely internal and somewhat underdramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—will Mara move through panic to act without her usual tether—is clear and tested by the ridgeway traversal and the moment at the grotto entrance. Internal and external conflicts interweave well (finding Atlas vs. confronting dependence), and the decisive turn is her deliberate choice not to reattach the leash. However, escalation is gentle; there’s minimal sense of rising external peril or narrowing options beyond the accumulative strangeness and depth of the fog. The result is thematically potent but somewhat soft in felt pressure, more meditative than tense.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—spiritual/psychic freedom vs. enforced safety—is clear early and tightens as his discoveries accumulate and the elders’ reaction raises the implied danger. Conflict is largely internal but supported by a concrete external rule system (the Hush, scarred throats, horror at the bolt), and the meaningful turn is his decision to re-hide the evidence, thereby sacrificing immediate expression for a more patient, long-term hope. Tension operates steadily rather than sharply spiking; the story could benefit from one more explicit on-page threat or near-miss to deepen pressure before the final choice. Still, the internal moral trade-off is credible and the resolution feels earned rather than arbitrary.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—exposing and ending the pretender’s reign—is clear early and pays off at the confrontation and sundering. Pressure escalates cleanly from the long wait to the invasion of footsteps to the rune’s activation and the stripping away of disguise. However, the titan encounters almost no resistance; the pretender’s power is illusory only, so the outcome feels inevitable rather than hard-won, with little sense of risk to the protagonist. The visible cost is mostly external (library’s dissolution, the pretender’s ruin) rather than a difficult choice with trade-offs on the titan’s side.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—Elena’s need to understand why paths and futures vanish—is signaled early and coheres to the end. Pressure escalates quietly as she moves from routine data assembly to an interpretive leap about social forgetting, with the tapping rhythm mirroring increased cognitive strain. The key tightening is her recognition that the real loss is institutional memory, prompting her to relinquish the atlas page as an act of witness rather than private talisman. Because the conflict never faces a concrete external test or real alternative choice, the sense of cost is more contemplative than tense.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.0)
    Pressure escalates in a quiet, interior way: the hum intensifies with the dawn, her interpretations crystallize, and she chooses to speak the deciphered words and physically commit to the stones. The dominant stake is thematic/spiritual—ensuring something sacred survives and re-linking earth and sky—rather than survival or interpersonal conflict. That choice and activation do alter options (from passive cataloger to ritual agent), but the price and risk remain soft and mostly implied. As a result, tension feels textured and meditative rather than sharply constricting.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central stake—whether Mira will break with tradition to unseal the embryo—is clear and tracked to a concrete action. Escalation comes mainly through accumulating knowledge (decoding the script, understanding the thermal sequence) and the plants’ mounting psychic pressure rather than through active resistance. Opposition is largely offstage (elders, taboo), so the turning point feels morally significant but not deeply contested on the page. The result is tense and satisfying, but the path is a bit smooth for the scale of the taboo.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can live with his trauma without numbing or self-destruction—is clear and sharpened by the wind-triggered flashback and his freeze response. There is a meaningful deepening when he chooses to observe rather than fight the freeze, which reconfigures his relationship to his own body and sets up the final act of facing the photo. The final beat—opening the photograph, breathing evenly, then returning to tend the trees—reads as a quiet but decisive stance crystallization with a felt cost. The conflict remains largely internal and textural, with no hard external test or reversal, so the escalation curve is strong but not maximal.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant conflict—Mara versus her own fragmented perception and failed art—intensifies as the walls physically and psychically close in, forcing her to adopt the thread-untangling method and descent. The escalation from overwhelmed observer to active re-weaver is clear, with the main tightening at the moment she realizes “she could not climb out; the only path lay downward.” However, much of the pressure remains abstract and aesthetic, with little sense of what she’s concretely risking besides an implied self-erasure or transformation. A more tactile or specific loss at the lamp or trapdoor beat would sharpen the felt cost of her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—understanding why time slows in crisis, at the price of his own existence—is clear and culminates in his decision to step fully into the ink field. Escalation is present but relatively gentle: the tension rises as the ink behaves impossibly and he begins to fade, but the mood is meditative rather than pressured. There’s little sense of alternative paths or true risk that he might pull back; his commitment feels settled from the outset, which limits lived conflict and foreclosed options. The cost is conceptual and existential rather than viscerally felt, keeping the pressure in the mid rather than high band.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—risking treason and neural erasure to expose manufactured war—is clear early and sharpened by the content of the letter. Pressure escalates coherently from discovery to the decision to act, then to irreversible dissemination and the triggering of alarms. Internal and external conflicts are tightly braided, and her agency is the direct engine of the turn. The price is largely conceptual and anticipated rather than directly felt in-scene (we don’t see any immediate loss beyond acceptance), which keeps it just below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—maintaining a pacifist enclave of growth inside a violently collapsing world—is clear, but on-page escalation is minimal. The dome shudder/impact and mention of scavengers and warlords provide a situational tightening, yet Maya never has to alter tactics or confront a real trade-off; she simply continues her ritual. The endurance choice is thematically apt but not materially pressured in the moment; no option is truly foreclosed beyond what we infer. Tension functions more as low, continuous hum than sharpened peak.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—securing the goddess’s echo before cosmic patterns dissolve—is clear and escalates as the constellations grow more chaotic and the garden begins collapsing. Kael’s agency drives the main turn when he chooses to risk everything by plunging the spike and singing the “null-song.” The cost is partially externalized (garden dying, sky blanked) and partially conceptual, but his personal risk and potential loss could be felt more viscerally. Still, the pressure does tighten once in a meaningful way and does not reset.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—truth versus inherited wealth and reputation—is clearly signaled early and culminates in Eleanor’s choice to publish a correction that will destroy her own empire. Conflict escalates from suspicion to formal disproof to a moral crisis where she must decide whether to perpetuate or expose the lie. The turn when her calculations prove the orbit impossible is a solid tightening that forces her into that ethical decision. Still, the pressure is almost entirely internal and somewhat decorous; we don’t feel much immediate threat or pushback, which keeps the tension from reaching a sharper edge.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara remains trapped in lifelong guilt or risks altering the past—is clear early and tightens steadily as the lab destabilizes and the meteor hush deepens. Escalation is well handled via intensifying phenomena (vibrating equipment, spectral tendrils, synchronized heartbeat) leading to the high-stakes act of tethering and physical contact across time. The conflict is primarily internal/psychic with little external opposition, which keeps the pressure slightly softer than it might be, but the emotional cost of renouncing a long-held self-concept is legible at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—restoring coherent whispering before the unlearning completes its erasure—is clear, and tension escalates through the discovery of the wrong-feeling tile, the deepening lilac unease, and the mist’s oppressive silence. Mara’s decisive act of disrupting the mandala’s eastern quadrant is a meaningful tightening that redefines the grotto’s options. However, conflict remains largely external and aesthetic; Mara is never credibly at risk of failing or paying a visible price, so the victory feels relatively unopposed. The pressure is coherent but conceptually airy rather than viscerally sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.8)
    The core stake—how this traumatized plaza will be framed and remembered—is clear, but conflict is mostly off-stage (the council’s wishes are reported, not embodied). Pressure escalates texturally via retrocognitive overload and the tightening “trap,” yet Kael never faces a concrete obstacle or credible alternative choice in the moment. The renaming is aesthetically powerful but comes relatively frictionlessly once the pattern is seen, so the sense of paid price or narrowed options is muted. This limits the story’s tension even as its mood remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stakes—Mara’s life-or-death despair and Julian’s need for a meaningful encore—are clearly established and converge on the moment she grasps the coin. Pressure escalates texturally through the intensifying “echoes” and multiplied selves rather than through sharp reversals; the main tightening is the build from passive observation to active intervention to physical contact with the coin. What’s slightly underdeveloped is more explicit friction or resistance from Mara; once the spectacle begins, her movement toward hope is relatively smooth, so the life-or-death choice feels a touch easy. Nonetheless, the box cutter abandoned at the roots and Julian’s quieter timeline mark a real narrowing of options and paid price.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.7)
    The dominant stake—finding and safely removing the pills before they cause permanent damage—is clear and present throughout, interwoven with Maya’s internal struggle over means and belief. Escalation comes via the intensifying somatic markers, discovery of more hidden stashes, and the radiator sequence that lands in a concrete retrieval. Her choice is more about persistence and method adoption than a wrenching dilemma, so the visible price is primarily emotional fatigue and responsibility rather than a hard trade-off. Tension operates more as steady pressure than as sharp reversals, effective but not maximal.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael can meaningfully map and give voice to the world’s stored emotions for sleeping humanity—is present but remains abstract. There is little opposition or risk; Kael never seems in danger of failing or paying a price beyond effort, and the journey through the caves proceeds without genuine complication. The only real deepening is when the fossil warms and synchronizes with their heartbeat, which enriches the experience but doesn’t change options or force a trade-off. As a result, tension is more conceptual and atmospheric than felt as escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake is big and legible—either the prophecy stands and the cliffs bury all memory, or Elara reconfigures it via the canyon echo and buttons—but moment-to-moment pressure remains gentle. She never seriously confronts failure, resistance, or a wrenching trade-off; the process of “unscrambling” and constructing the mandala proceeds without complication. The primary tightening is conceptual (realizing prophecy is a knot, not a sentence) rather than antagonistic. That works for a lyric mode but keeps tension and felt cost below top-tier literary intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stakes—whether Elena will stay broken and isolated or risk rebuilding the network and herself—are clear and present early. There is one meaningful tightening when she offers the pillbox and explicitly “vouchsafes” the chip, foreclosing continued flight. However, external opposition remains abstract: the organization’s threat is told, not felt, and Marcus never seriously resists or challenges her, so pressure plateaus instead of escalating. The result is more a graceful emotional pivot than a truly tested choice under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.8)
    The core stake is whether and when to attempt the crossing under dangerous, opaque conditions—essentially a situational/moral pressure to act only when it’s truly needed and safe. That pressure accumulates effectively through environmental cues, but escalation is subtle; there’s no sharp reversal, concrete passenger, or explicit conflict between desire and fear on the page. The final act of boarding the ferry is earned, yet the felt price (what’s concretely at risk this time versus any other crossing) remains abstract. As a result, tension is atmospheric more than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—understanding why some places resist change—is signaled early, but the pressure around it remains mostly contemplative rather than adversarial. There is one meaningful deepening when the timelines and the bees’ “net across time” are revealed, reweighting what resistance means. However, Kai is never forced into a difficult trade-off; choosing to sit, witness, and leave the lantern is aligned with her nature and not clearly costly. Tension here is atmospheric and intellectual rather than felt as escalating risk or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will leave her sanctuary to assume a solitary, quasi-sacred duty—is clear and does tighten as she moves from apartment to boat to lighthouse. Escalation is primarily psychological and textural (the last petal, the dark lighthouse, the harbor’s hush) rather than conflict-driven; there are no active obstacles or reversals. Her decision to stay through the night so the beam can stabilize provides a meaningful deepening of commitment with a visible cost in comfort and safety. The lack of external resistance keeps tension relatively low, appropriate to a quiet piece but short of peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will remain imprisoned by her sense of extinction-loneliness or find a stance that allows her to live with it—is signaled and resolved. Pressure coherently increases through the stone circle experiment: the hum intensifies, light patterns become more complex, and the ritual culminates in levitation and a decisive internal shift. However, there is little friction or genuine jeopardy; no alternative path is seriously tested, and nothing meaningfully threatens failure. The result is a graceful deepening rather than a sharply escalating conflict with visible trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will remain a hidden conduit or risk rejoining the world—is clear and resolves in her choice to stop ghostwriting and create a public, personal work. Escalation is primarily internal and textural: the revelation via the nest, the days of building under public gaze, and finally Mara’s presence and handclasp. The conflict never tightens into a hard, contested choice; resistance is more implied than dramatized, so cost remains gentle rather than sharp. Nonetheless, there is one meaningful deepening and a credible renunciation of her old stance.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—preventing the town from tearing itself apart under cosmic manipulation—is clear early and tracks tightly through the scene. Pressure escalates through time limits, the visible mob outside, and the risk that the tricksters will detect and invert her signal, focusing rage on the station. Elena’s choice to push the transmitter beyond capacity under psychic pressure is a credible tightening that narrows her options and risks catastrophic backlash. The cost is more conceptual/emotional than visceral on the page, with the opposition retreating fairly quickly once the plan is in motion, which slightly softens the sense of ordeal.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stakes—get the key and escape being crushed, thereby saving the valley from winter hunger—are clear and present from the outset. Pressure tightens meaningfully when the organ’s stabilizing resonance falters and the walls resume closing as she works on the gear mechanism. Her decisive act with the compass clearly resolves both physical and broader communal stakes. However, escalation is relatively linear and smooth; we never feel a serious risk of failure or a painful trade-off beyond enduring fear, which keeps the conflict from fully peaking.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stakes—cracking a long-protected conspiracy and reviving a dead case on both procedural and emotional levels—are clear but kept intimate. Escalation is mostly cognitive and emotional: she shifts from sterile analysis to embodied, empathic drawing, which enables the key evidentiary reversal about the ribbon’s origin. There is no strong external counter-pressure on the page, but the internal conflict and the weight of institutional silence hold tension. The final insight forecloses the option of remaining comfortably detached, giving the conflict a credible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will remain a “madwoman” in the record or be restored as a visionary—is clear and escalates as Elara moves from private decoding to public transmission. However, opposition is soft: there’s no real pushback, only dawning comprehension, so the risk in her questioning feels more implied than dramatized. The main tightening is internal (will she speak up, and what will that mean for the record), and that does land, but without a visible price beyond the emotional weight of the act. As a result, tension is steady rather than sharply climbing.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias remains trapped in the trauma of the collapse or reclaims music as bridge-building—is clear from early on. Escalation is internal but real: from intending to “recount the accident” to following an impossible path, to actively playing a new kind of song that costs him blood and the dissolution of the glass. His agency drives the key turns (choosing to follow, then to play a different music), and the price is visible. The conflict could edge higher if there were a more concrete moment of refusal or temptation to turn back before he commits.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes are primarily internal—can he reinterpret his lineage and his startup collapse as something other than deterministic failure—and that pressure does accumulate from passive hiding toward the decision to re-enter the world. However, options never feel sharply foreclosed and there’s little external friction; the risk and cost of leaving remain conceptual rather than dramatized. The deepening is real but relatively gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central stake—whether she can meaningfully decode the inscriptions and reframe her brother’s legacy—is clear, and the pressure is primarily internal. There is a genuine tightening as she realizes the stars encode grief and that the temple is a process of shared dreaming, leading to a new, committed stance. However, conflict remains largely unopposed; there’s little on-page friction or cost beyond remembered loss and the emotional weight she carries.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—freeing the imprisoned truth/lake—is signaled early and paid off when the confession melts and the orchard settles. Pressure escalates coherently as she moves from perimeter to epicenter and the vortex “tightening its spiral” resists her reach. However, once she recognizes the need for stillness, the path to success feels relatively frictionless: there’s little sense of what she might lose personally if she fails, beyond a general duty to the “wounded world.” The conflict is strong and coherent but not harrowing, with cost weighted more conceptually than viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether they can reach the dream-intersection in time to repair the covenant—is signaled and the ticking dusk and shifting glade provide structural pressure. There is one clear tightening when Elara tears free of the roots and the glade starts to rotate, narrowing their window. However, opposition is soft: after Kael arrives, nothing seriously threatens their success, and the path to the node is comparatively frictionless. The world-scale stakes are declared as enormous but are not viscerally tested or complicated on the page, so escalation feels more conceptual than harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—Elias trying to exchange his fate to restore his sister—is clear early and deepens as he approaches the heart-tree to offer his life. The decisive tightening is the moment he presses the card to the bark and explicitly offers, after which the roots’ binding forecloses alternatives. However, his commitment is never seriously tested; he does not waver or adapt tactics, so tension reads as solemn inevitability rather than escalating conflict. The cost is legible but the path to it is mostly linear and contemplative.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether he will deliver a rigorously honest appraisal or a merciful one—is clear and anchored early in the valuation gap (eight thousand versus forty dollars). Pressure coheres and tightens when the boy enters with the grandfather photo, converting abstract doubt into immediate ethical conflict. Marcus’s final decision to call the cloth “genuine” is a real choice with a conceptual and professional cost, even if the external consequences remain off-stage. The conflict is more interior than situational, so the escalation feels quietly intense rather than dramatic, which fits but slightly limits perceived stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding the physics of transition even at potential personal cost—is clear and narrows around the warning spelled by the spores. The inscription “those who seek to understand the journey must complete it themselves” acts as the main tightening beat, forcing a choice. However, Elias’s internal struggle at that moment is relatively gentle; he moves toward acceptance with minimal visible hesitation, which keeps pressure from fully spiking. The resolution is thematically satisfying but more serene than agonized, muting the felt price somewhat.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central conflict—migrating identities resisting permanent smelting versus the librarian’s mandate to preserve—reads clearly, and their fear of fixation provides a credible opposing force. Pressure escalates modestly as low-tide arrival, lunar weakness, and the start of smelting align, but there’s little sense of real risk that the task might fail or exact a sharper price. The “accepting contradictions” negotiation is more philosophical than dramatized as a high-stakes choice with visible loss. The result is an elegant but relatively gentle arc of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether this bunker becomes another demolished relic or a preserved locus of connection—is signaled and tightened effectively through the confessions and Elara’s inspection role. Conflict is primarily internal: her mandate versus her emerging sense of custodianship, crystallizing at the delete-key hesitation and the crowning act. The moral and emotional stakes are clear, but external antagonistic pressure (institutional consequences, time limits) is only lightly implied, which keeps escalation feeling somewhat soft. Still, the key turn is driven by her agency and forecloses a real path.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether she will continue to numb herself or confront the site of her guilt—is clear and internally escalated. Pressure tightens when the graffiti reveals the coordinates, converting a vague desire to “learn how to do the same with her own history” into a concrete, risky intention. Conflict remains largely internal and contemplative, with no sharp reversal beyond that recognition. It’s powerful for a quiet piece, though one more explicit moment of resistance to the idea of returning could have sharpened the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she can map the lexicon in six hours and secure her fate/status with the library—is stated but never truly pressured in-scene. There are no genuine obstacles, reversals, or losses; once she arrives, everything she attempts essentially works, and the library never pushes back. The reveal about the confidence man as prior archivist offers a conceptual tightening but does not force a painful trade-off or foreclose a live alternative. As a result, tension feels more contemplative than urgent, limiting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—truthful provenance vs imperial appropriation—is signaled early and sharpened by the coffee prophecy of the Ministry’s lie. Pressure escalates via environmental and temporal constraints (rising heat, critical temperature, dawn/tomorrow deadline) until her only viable paths are capitulation or sacrificial subterfuge. Her choice to melt the violin and distribute its “soul” through trees is a clear renunciation with visible loss and ongoing personal risk (career, safety, funding). A minor limitation is that external antagonistic presence stays abstract (no on-page Ministry agent), but for this length the internalized institutional pressure still feels potent.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can capture the dancer’s “last spark” before it dissolves—is clear, but pressure never truly tightens beyond a generalized urgency. There is no meaningful reversal, complication, or near-failure: once the procedure begins, each beat unfolds smoothly toward success. Internal conflict (e.g., doubt, temptation to let go, rule-breaking) is absent, so agency reads as refined execution rather than a tested stance. The result is a beautifully textured but largely static conflict profile with limited escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.8)
    The core conflict—Elias’s reluctance to fully release his daughter’s relic and thus unstall the cycle—is clear and culminates in a decisive act that forecloses a path. Pressure does accumulate, primarily through interior weighing of duty versus grief rather than external opposition or reversal. The emotional/ethical tradeoff (keeping the pin as memorial vs. returning it to the cycle) is legible, but his shift toward release feels relatively smooth, with limited on-page resistance at the moment of choice. The stakes remain appropriately scaled to the length, but escalation is more gentle deepening than sharp tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.7)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias keeps using the toxic cloak to shield himself or risks absorbing doubt—is clear and does tighten as he climbs toward it and confronts its weight. The act of unhooking and releasing the cloak is a real narrowing of options that carries conceptual and emotional cost. However, the conflict remains almost entirely interior and one-sided; the cartographer’s opposing pressure is offstage and hypothetical, so the tension never quite bites as hard as it could. Stakes are sophisticated but soft-edged rather than sharply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake is internal and conceptual—how he will use his dwindling cognition and backward life to leave something meaningful—and it is signaled and maintained. Pressure escalates texturally rather than through external antagonism, tightening as he shifts from reading ripples for himself to realizing he is inscribing instructions for distant students. The cost of his choice is clear: he embraces the loss of answers and even of self in order to seed questions for the future. At times the conflict feels meditative rather than sharply pressured, but within an accumulative lens it remains coherent and deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—whether the arrowhead is a key to liberation or another anchor—creates a real though abstract pressure. Escalation appears mainly as deepening insight when the birds reframe the arrowhead from weapon to compass, tightening his options toward stillness-as-navigation. However, conflict remains largely interior and contemplative with minimal on-page resistance or felt jeopardy beyond identity dissolution. The cost is present but more intellectual than visceral, which flattens potential tension.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.4)
    The core stake—whether Elias aligns with automated perfection or with imperfect, sacred craft—is clear and present from early on. Pressure escalates when he rejects the harness’s corrections, steps onto the unsecured gantry, and then surrenders his certifications as the climate systems move to neutralize him. The price of his choice (loss of role, life, and human community) is conceptually strong and visible in the transition to legend. Still, antagonistic force is mostly systemic and distant, so moment-to-moment tension feels contemplative rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake is internal and thematic—whether Elias will fulfill or understand the covenant embedded in his grandmother’s charge and unlock the color of sound—and that’s signaled clearly. Pressure escalates through time-bounded opportunity (the lantern release) and the descent into the wreck, culminating in the tuning-fork experiment, but opposition and risk remain mostly implied rather than dramatized. The “price” of his devotion (twelve years of night shifts, the willingness to drown in darkness) is conceptual and lands, but isn’t strongly tested on the page. The conflict is coherent and deepening, but relatively gentle for elite-level tension.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—universe remains a singularity vs. expansion—appears early and is clear, and Elena’s process of extracting signal from static provides a coherent pressure line. Internal conflict (doubt vs. purpose) interweaves with the technical challenge, which tightens as she decodes and tunes. However, escalation is mostly linear and smooth; there’s no major reversal or moment where a real option visibly closes or a sacrifice is required. The resolution feels earned but relatively untested, relying on declared consequences more than on on-page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether he can give shape to his nameless grief and thus reconfigure his existence—is clear early and tightens as he moves from listening to voices to actively invoking the atlas ritual. The crystallization of monsters and the naming sequence are a meaningful deepening that changes his options and allows the redefinition of his role. However, the pressure is almost entirely internal and contemplative, with little sense of risk or competing paths in the present moment beyond a default of continued paralysis. The result is emotionally resonant but relatively low-tension compared to top-tier pieces where choices more sharply foreclose alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central stake—restoring the ocean’s possibility—is large but correctly grounded in a manageable on-page task: can she complete the bell reconstruction and resonance before noon. Pressure tightens via the ticking-drop math and her realization that she must reawaken the sea’s “memory of sound” instead of brute-forcing its return. Internal and external conflict are braided but relatively gentle; she never faces a serious threat of failure beyond generalized difficulty and fizzled spells. As a result, escalation feels earned but modest, more contemplative than harrowing, which is effective but not maximal for elite short work.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the town’s buried, distorted history will remain submerged in official lies—is clear and sharpened by the discovery of concrete evidence. Pressure does build from eerie resurfacing to moral indictment, culminating in Elias’s choice to act as archivist rather than mere technician. However, antagonistic forces and immediate costs are mostly off-stage and conceptual; no on-page resistance or trade-off complicates his decision, keeping the escalation on the quieter side.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can achieve a true philosopher’s stone by integrating reason and wonder—is clear and tracked. Pressure deepens through her perception of the starlings’ patterns and the decision to relinquish the wooden horse, culminating in the release of the transmuting flame. However, conflict is almost entirely internal and largely unopposed; there’s little sense that the transformation could fail or harm her if she missteps, so escalation feels contemplative rather than tense. The resolution is earned by her altered stance, but the price paid is gentle for the magnitude of the gain.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake (Kael’s survival and the integrity of their trust) is announced early and stays in focus throughout. Pressure does tighten: radio silence, the visible speck of freefall, and the single-chance revision of chute timing. However, escalation never quite reaches a sharp brink—Elara’s mastery and the smooth success of each step make the outcome feel controlled rather than genuinely at risk. There’s no real reversal or moment where an option forecloses; the tension plateau is high but relatively stable.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.2)
    The core conflict—the right to exist as the “primary instance” versus the desire to remain dissolved—is clear and under pressure throughout. Escalation comes from the realization that neither is original and from the shift from opposition to synthesis, culminating in the risky decision to open the jar and merge. Stakes are largely internal but tied to the collapsing/reforming world, giving them weight. A touch more concrete jeopardy or resistance in the merger itself could heighten tension, but the central trade-off reads.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Maya can create and protect a radically innovative space against conventional pressures—is articulated but rarely tested in scene. Once the seed arrives, everything goes smoothly: no real obstacles complicate the build, no ethical or practical dilemmas are dramatized, and no one challenges her stance. The “countdown” and stench are described as conceptual pressures rather than lived constraints on any specific attempt. As a result, tension accumulates atmospherically rather than through concrete reversals or costly decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—transmuting family grief into renewed laughter—is clear and escalates via each pull of the cord as the silence is progressively ground down and the haunting intensifies. The pressure tightens as his efforts move from external silence to his own regret, and the off-key wind builds into a symphony that culminates in his self-effacing act. The cost (his fading and the loss of his agency as a presence) is on-page and coherent. Conflict is primarily internal/textural rather than oppositional, but it stays focused and consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether to use the pendant to go “home” or remain in liminal uncertainty—is signaled clearly and tightened once the pendant shows her the doorway back. Conflict deepens as waiting transforms from passive exile to chosen, active stance, and her final renunciation (not rising to answer her birth-dimension’s call) forecloses a path. However, pressure never feels acute; the potential loss of returning is more intuited than sharply dramatized, so the cost remains largely conceptual. Tension exists, but it is gentle rather than bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Marcus can escape his narrative of failure by transforming the crozier and himself—is clear and escalates via successive failures and adjustments. The key tightening is his realization that he must abandon preserving the crozier’s function and fully destroy it, which credibly narrows options and forces a bolder risk. However, the pressure remains largely internal and conceptual; if he fails, the consequence is more of the same stagnation rather than a sharply felt new loss, so tension never quite reaches a knife-edge. The result is thematically satisfying but not maximally pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can risk a lethal, rule-breaking tuning to extract meaning from cosmic silence—is clear, and pressure escalates as she rejects protocol, collapses the fields, and tunes for “absence itself.” The predecessor’s death and the one-night-per-18-years timing set a strong implicit risk frame. On the page, though, resistance is mostly conceptual; her experiment progresses without real setback, and there’s little sense she might fail, die, or lose something irrevocable beyond reputation. The conflict is intellectually engaging and thematically rich but could use one sharper moment of jeopardy or loss to deepen the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—preventing the passengers from being stranded in isolated timelines—is clear and substantial, and Elias’s decisions (using the radio, tuning frequencies, guiding passengers) drive the resolution. There is one meaningful tightening as he learns to read patterns and brings fragmented passengers, like the child in the yellow coat, into wholeness. However, genuine resistance, risk of failure, or visible loss is minimal; nothing truly fights back, and success feels almost guaranteed once the method is understood. As a result, escalation is more procedural than perilous, muting the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—discovering the “texture of connection” even at the cost of self—is coherent and escalates as the weave grows more complex and begins to consume her. Yet the pressure is largely abstract; there’s little dramatized resistance or concrete alternative path, so her choice to become the connective tissue reads as an almost foregone consummation rather than a hard, contested trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are high and clear—colony survival via expansion to other oceans—but on-page conflict is largely one-sided problem-solving rather than struggle. The primary tightening is the rare alignment tonight that Mara has anticipated, which nudges the situation toward decision. However, there is little resistance (internal or external) when she confirms the vector and orders the expedition; no rival interpretation, miscalculation scare, or concrete sacrifice is forced in scene. As a result, tension feels more atmospheric than actively escalating, even though the underlying stakes are potent.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—delivering evidence to secure justice—tightens effectively when it flips into a rescue mission upon hearing Thomas’s voice, a meaningful reweighting of the conflict. Elena’s choice to descend without backup constitutes real agency under rising pressure. However, once she reaches the basement, the external conflict resolves almost too easily: there’s no on-page interference from the murderer, institutional resistance, or physical hazard to complicate the rescue. The cost is primarily psychological and ethical, not tactical, which slightly mutes the sense of escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stakes—Mara confronting both her claustrophobia and the moral debt to the vanished researchers—are articulated early and tighten as she descends through flooding, fluxing corridors. Her decisive step into the central chamber’s phase transition, despite maximal internal pressure, is a clear escalation and crystallizes her stance. The conflict remains more contemplative than combative, and physical danger stays mostly implied, so the consequences feel profound but not fully harrowing on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central stake—whether Elara can reclaim and integrate her erased self, and understand why she was targeted—is clear and specific. Pressure escalates as her heartbeat accelerates, the ink patterns shift, and the ghost moves from flicker to coherent face, culminating in the irrevocable act of pressing the shard into the mandala and inviting integration. The cost is subtle but real: relinquishing the safety of existing solely as a glitch survivor and accepting a liminal, system-recognized anomaly status. The conflict leans heavily internal and could arguably bear one sharper external obstacle, but for this length it remains effective.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the last remnants of a language will be devoured or preserved—is clear and scaled appropriately for the length. Pressure does rise, particularly through the time limit of the sleeping elder and the rule that loud sound feeds the curse. However, the path to success is comparatively smooth: once the method is understood, her execution faces no significant setback, trade-off, or on-page resistance beyond urgency. The cost is more conceptual than felt; she wins without a visible sacrifice beyond fatigue and the implied dimming at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elena will remain a wounded human observer or cross over into being the cryptid herself—is clear and resolved at the end. Pressure escalates through the ritual’s intensification (phone static, arrowhead heating and levitating, garden’s explosive response), but Elena faces little meaningful friction or alternative path once it begins. The cost (abandoning her old life, being sealed underground) is present conceptually but not sharply dramatized as a contested choice, so the conflict feels more like a solemn initiation than a pressured crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—whether Elara can disrupt a regime of efficiency without being stopped—is clear and escalates from hesitation to covert signaling to full-scale orchard uprising. Her agency drives the major turns; the statues’ partial awakening and the trees’ uprooting concretize the clash between wild growth and mechanical order. Yet the conflict lacks a sharp moment of genuine jeopardy or near-failure, so the victory feels powerful but somewhat untested.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—smuggling letters across a militarized, algorithmic border—is clear and inherently high. Time pressure (three minutes of chaos) and the illegality of the storm bottle provide a solid tightening device. Yet the conflict lacks a true reversal or escalation; once the storm is uncapped, the drones wobble but pose no active counterpressure, and Marek completes his work without complication. Internal conflict remains muted, so while the scenario is tense in concept, the on-page pressure crests less sharply than the premise promises.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias remains locked in mute stasis or crosses into a new, risky form of expression and creation—is legible and resolved. Pressure escalates texturally: the impossible corridor, the halo’s response, and the environment’s awakening deepen the moment until singing becomes the decisive act. However, the conflict is almost entirely internal and very gently opposed; there’s little sense of what he might lose by succeeding or failing beyond abstracted purpose. The result is beautiful but low-tension, limiting the felt cost of his choice.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—reviving her grandmother’s story and affirming analog memory—remains clear but faces little on-page resistance. Escalation is mostly conceptual (moving from outer library to hyperbolic pocket) rather than dramatized through obstacles or costs; once she has done the three years of calculation off-page, success comes smoothly. There’s no real moment where she might fail or must choose between competing goods. As a result, tension is gentle and contemplative rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—recovering the runaway dream before it’s lost to forgetting—is clear and time-bound (this sunrise, this liminal window). There is a meaningful tightening as dawn approaches and the islands’ cipher intensifies, but the conflict remains essentially one-directional: preparation flows into success without significant complication or reversal. The dream’s tentativeness (“sniffing the air for traps”) hints at risk, yet it never concretely resists or forces Elara into a trade-off beyond effort and attention. As a result, tension feels elegant but relatively soft for the level of language and ambition.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—freeing the idea from fear—is present and drives the scene, and there is one clear tightening: Vey commits to the tactic of disorienting fear via her spinning dance. However, opposition remains largely conceptual; the “fear” never credibly threatens to overwhelm or injure her, and success comes without setback or meaningful risk. As a result, tension stays low-grade and meditative rather than escalating toward a truly pressured choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central stake—whether Elena will risk herself to undo the ring’s theft of Lila—is clear early and escalates from long-term, low-risk observation into a single high-stakes act of entering the ring and disrupting its habit. The solstice “when habits break” clock provides a meaningful tightening, as does the shift from cataloging to intervention. The main limitation is the relative smoothness of resolution: there’s little friction or real sense that this might fail or cost Elena more than the loss of the portal, which slightly softens pressure at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the child is ready to re-enter a painful world and whether Elara will risk connection—is clear from early on and steadily tightened by the repeated tea readings and the visible, reachable hammer. The key escalation is internal: Elara gradually challenges the shadow harder, walks backwards less, and moves from “not today” to shattering the shard when her readings and the child’s stance align. The cost is emotionally present: the risk of re-traumatizing the child and of Elara reopening her own exile by connecting. Conflict is mostly psychological and ritual, so tension is more simmering than knife-edged, but it tracks and culminates cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—saving color and wonder from the gray lands—is clear and weighty, and the gray tendrils’ advance provides some immediate pressure. There is one main tightening when the grayness reaches for Elian during the ritual and he must “dance backward” and improvise defenses. Yet the conflict never truly tests his limits; the opposition feels more like a lyrical obstacle than a force that could plausibly defeat him, and each step of his plan succeeds on first attempt. As a result, tension exists but rarely bites, and the outcome feels assured once the ritual begins.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—grounding restless spirits at the cost of taking their silence into herself—is clear from the outset and deepens as more spirits are released and the silence grows heavier in her mask. Pressure escalates texturally through accumulation (more knots, more spirits, more silence) and confession, culminating in an Earned Stasis where she accepts permanent stillness. However, moment-to-moment conflict is relatively even; there’s little sense a particular knot or spirit might overwhelm or break her in a way that would force a sharper tactical shift. The emotional and metaphysical cost is well-rendered but could be sharpened by one concrete on-page threat to her capacity to continue.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.2)
    Conflict is largely one-directional: Elara wants to uncover a secret and moves steadily toward doing so, with no real opposition beyond time and research effort. There is a faint ethical tension around revealing versus preserving the chapel’s silence, but it never sharpens into a difficult choice with a felt price. As a result, escalation under the causal lens is modest; the story deepens texturally rather than tightening stakes in a way that would fully satisfy a high-end literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the last transmission and, beneath that, understanding how to let go—is coherent and signaled early. There is one central tightening as Julian moves from searching the wreck to actively solving the globe’s resonance puzzle and accessing the captain’s thoughts. However, resistance is minimal: the decoding proceeds almost frictionlessly, with no serious risk, opposition, or trade-off beyond contemplative cost. The resulting tension is graceful and steady rather than sharply escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.8)
    Conflict and stakes are almost entirely emotional and conceptual—ghostly loneliness, Elara’s isolation, the need to apologize to crushed flowers—and while they’re coherent, they rarely feel pressured. The main escalation comes from activating the plate and beginning the encoding, which deepens the connection but does not visibly risk failure or damage; there is no strong sense that anything might be lost if things go wrong. The duet and the system’s transformation feel more like a fulfillment of a plan than a hard-won resolution. As a result, the piece is affecting but low-tension, limiting stakes-driven intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake is Elara’s understanding of how to live—and read others—above the clouds, and it is signaled early via her “warmly inquisitive” nature and the mystery of the diary. Pressure deepens as she deciphers and reads, but there’s little true escalation or narrowing of options; nothing resists her materially or forces a painful trade-off beyond the emotional effort of looking at suffering. Her agency at the end (choosing to inherit the captain’s “secret”) is clear but unopposed, so the cost remains mostly implied. As a meditative, accumulative piece it functions well, but it does not fully capitalize on potential conflicts (class risk, taboo curiosity, or fear of what she’ll find).

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—how she will understand and respond to the severed tether—is clear, and pressure coheres around that internal conflict. Escalation is primarily a deepening of stance: from cataloging clouds, to knotting the broken string, to consciously coding the event as revelation rather than disaster. However, external pressure (drift, risk of death) is mostly backgrounded, and the rescue arrives without her choices visibly altering outcomes, so the sense of narrowing options is muted. The cost is real but conceptual and quiet, keeping tension in a solid rather than outstanding band.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—preserving a unique, time-bound sky inside a doomed space—is clear from the outset and consistently tightened by the demolition countdown. Pressure escalates as she ascends, mixes rare pigments, and works to the edge of her perceptual and temporal limits, with the foreman’s whistle and engine roar serving as a hard endpoint. The conflict is more situational and accumulative than confrontational; there’s no adversarial reversal, but the narrowing of options (save building vs. save sky) is legible. The cost—irreversible loss of the library and guild legacy—is felt, though a sharper on-page moment of near-failure or compromise could intensify the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—Elara unlocking a hidden navigational secret—is clear, but the story offers almost no resistance, setback, or real risk; once the pattern is noticed, every step proceeds smoothly. Pressure escalates mainly through accumulating wonder and intellectual complexity rather than narrowing options or forcing difficult trade-offs. The starlings and hopscotch grid cooperate almost too perfectly, so there’s no serious possibility of failure or misreading to test her resolve. As a result, while the puzzle is engaging, the conflict feels relatively low-stakes for a piece aiming at top-tier literary intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring the village’s time and survival—is strong and signaled early, and the unsealing of the vial functions as a clear pressure spike. Yet the conflict is largely unopposed; once she reaches the hall, nothing truly tests her resolve or forces a trade-off beyond awe and a bit of trembling. The assembly sequence feels more like a graceful ritual than a contested struggle, so escalation is more conceptual than felt. The resolution is earned but lacks a sharp sense of risk or sacrifice at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes (long-term survival vs. hostile atmosphere) are conceptually high but on-page pressure is relatively gentle; no one meaningfully resists Mara, and the operation faces no visible setbacks. The main tightening is Mara decoding the messages via star charts and convincing the council, but this persuasion and the risks of trusting a ghost are reported rather than sharpened into tense beats. The midnight execution of the plan proceeds almost too smoothly, undercutting felt danger or trade-off. As a result, the conflict is coherent but not especially bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the universe dies in terror or in soothed acceptance—is established early and resolved clearly. Pressure does build, but more by temporal inevitability (“approaching the hush of time’s final ripple,” gears slowing) than by sharpened dilemmas or reversals. Elara faces little on-page opposition or real possibility of failure; her path is spiritually weighty but not structurally contested. The escalation is thus more atmospheric than decisional, which limits the felt sharpness of cost under a demanding standard.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—guiding travelers to safety before lethal frost—arrives early and governs every beat. Pressure escalates coherently: limited time, need for precise nut placement, arrival of real travelers, then active attack by mechanical birds that forces her to use the vibration plate and weapon. External threat and internal guilt interweave well, though the moral or emotional calculus at the climax (what she’s truly risking or sacrificing) could be sharpened beyond exhaustion and ongoing obligation. The resolution feels earned and protagonist-driven rather than lucky or coincidental.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elena can transform her guilt and grief into a more truthful, livable form—is clear, and the piece tightens as she moves from abstract regret into embodied encounters (foam, chrysalis, notebook). The internal pressure does escalate via accumulating metaphors that force a reframing of “divergence” and “betrayal.” However, there is little in the way of a hard trade-off or visible price paid in the moment; her realization comes without a concrete loss or reversal beyond the pre-existing bereavement. As a result, the arc feels insightful but relatively low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—risking the loss of her glimmering parole and identity as vendor to reach the nursery of narrative—is well signaled and coherently escalated. Pressure tightens as the incision widens and the parole flickers, forcing a choice between continuing her sanctioned role and stepping through. However, the conflict remains more conceptual than felt; we’re told the rule (“one cannot touch the beginning while serving the middle”) but don’t fully experience her hesitation or the concrete consequences she anticipates. The ultimate renunciation is strong, but a touch more dramatized resistance or fear would deepen the perceived cost.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—can Kael safely process her accumulated and global remorse—is clear from early on. However, once she reaches the pavilion, the conflict becomes largely procedural and symbolic; there’s no real resistance from the environment, her own body, or the remorse itself beyond “rough” texture. Her agency matters (she removes gloves, chooses to be subsumed), but there’s no hard trade-off or foreclosed alternative dramatized on the page. As a result, escalation feels conceptual rather than pressured, and the price of success reads as surprisingly light for such vast stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.0)
    The stakes—regional survival through winter and the end of a generational feud—are high and clearly articulated, but the conflict itself is largely abstract and uncontested on the page. Once the ritual begins, the dormant elevators respond “immediately,” and there are no setbacks, refusals, or even flickers of resistance to test her approach. Escalation is mostly a steady increase in musical intensity rather than a narrowing of options under pressure. This makes the resolution feel foregone rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—whether and how she will transform her own and the collective’s abandoned dreams—is clear but remains largely internal and unopposed. There is little sense of alternative paths or genuine risk beyond hinted physical self-harm; her commitment to the process is never seriously challenged. Escalation is more about increasing rhetorical intensity than about new complications or reversals that force trade-offs. The ending feels like the expected endpoint of a ritual rather than the outcome of tested, pressured choice.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—retrieve the forgotten combinations before the one-hour inversion closes—is legible and present early. However, once Elara enters the cathedral chamber, antagonistic pressure softens: the vigilance recognizes her and effectively cooperates, so the primary test becomes a mechanical alignment rather than a true trial of loyalty, risk, or sacrifice. There is one clear tightening (crossing the threshold into the grotto), but no strong on-page reversal or forced trade-off. The lack of visible price or near-failure keeps the conflict from fully matching the story’s ambitious conceptual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—can she awaken sound in a silenced world?—is clear, and there is one main tightening when she moves from analysis to drawing the bow and the insulator trembles. However, opposition and cost remain almost entirely notional; nothing truly threatens failure beyond the abstract difficulty, and we never see an attempt falter or a price she might pay. The internal and external conflicts align but don’t significantly escalate, so tension feels contemplative rather than urgent. The result is beautifully textured but relatively low-pressure conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Castian can re-enter or restore the Eclipse Covenant by solving Mireya’s difficult puzzle—is clear and coherently pressured by the impending lunar phase shift and the unstable magnetic field. Escalation comes through a deepening rather than sharp reversals: his surrender to the field’s “impossible” lines leads to the breakthrough where the stone splits and the covenant is redefined. The cost is mostly internal (letting go of a win/lose frame and old pride), so tension remains more meditative than visceral but is still effective for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—whether he can recover proof that empathy and peace have a measurable presence—is clear but mostly conceptual. Pressure does increase as he cycles through frequencies and matches the clasp’s “heart,” yet the process is smooth and unresisted, with no major setback or trade-off. The fireworks and timing add ambiance rather than acute urgency, so escalation feels gentle. As a result, the story reads as a beautifully rendered demonstration more than a true test under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can align her ambition and sensitivity to undertake this challenging cultivation—is clear but remains mostly internal and contemplative, with minimal external resistance. There is a mild tightening around timing (the exact instant to plant) and the choice to accept future sensory suffering, yet the process unfolds smoothly without genuine jeopardy or trade-offs beyond anticipated discomfort. The internal arc of reinterpreting putrefaction as a teacher provides a conceptual deepening but not a strong felt escalation. As a result, tension is present but subdued, more meditative than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stakes—capturing the resilience mechanism within a strict inversion window—are legible and the clock provides steady pressure. Escalation occurs through the deepening mystery (convergence point, artifact, spectral farmers) and the late reminder of dwindling time. However, Kael faces no serious reversals or hard choices; once she finds the artifact, success follows without much jeopardy or sacrifice. The stakes feel more intellectually high than viscerally tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—reconstructing exactly how the accident unfolded to enable foresight—is clear from early on. Pressure tightens as she moves toward ground zero, with wind data and blast evidence converging on the clearing and forcing a sharper, more personal understanding of Chen’s death. However, conflict is almost entirely one-sided and intellectual; the environment confirms her calculations rather than meaningfully resisting or complicating her progress. The cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt, which caps the intensity of on-page stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—whether wonder will be declared obsolete—is clearly stated and the deadline gives nominal urgency, with escalation as the ritual begins, the sculptor strikes, and the Council’s instruments react. Yet there is no genuine reversal or test of her commitment; once conditions are in place, success feels assured and unfolds without complication. Pressure grows more by intensifying imagery than by narrowing options or forcing trade-offs. The cost at the end is primarily exhaustion and exertion, not a difficult choice or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—repairing a catastrophic breach and redeeming a failed guardianship—is clear and emotionally weighty, and the pressure tightens as she confronts the “ghost-scape” of her failure and then attempts a different musical pattern. Her agency directly drives the resolution: she chooses to fully re-open the memory and play the risky corrective arrangement, foreclosing the option of remaining in safe, static penance. However, the scene lacks significant present-time resistance or risk of failure; once she begins playing, there are no real reversals or complications that threaten the attempt. As a result, escalation feels more like an inevitable fulfillment of an internal decision than a truly contested struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.8)
    The core conflict—Elara’s drive to quantify emotion versus the cartographer’s structured grief and ultimately his identity—is clear and escalates through her deliberate disorientation and the escalating empathy-flood. The pressure tightens as ambiguity becomes psychic invasion, culminating in his reduction to a font and her obtaining the theorem as the universe darkens. However, the cartographer’s own agency is minimal; he mostly suffers rather than chooses, which slightly blunts the sense of hard-earned resolution and trade-off. The stakes feel vivid but remain more one-sided than they might in a truly top-tier crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is existential—what a courier is for, and whether routine can be sacred—and it’s signaled early through Maren’s commission and Elias’s nervousness. Pressure deepens once the archivist recognizes the pendant and the impossible plant appears, nudging Elias into a new mode of action. However, tangible risk or cost is minimal: he’s never forced to trade off his duty to deliver against this blooming wonder in a way that bites. As a result, escalation feels more like a gentle unfolding than a true tightening of screws.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.5)
    The central stake—will Elara’s method prove her theory—is clear, but the pressure around it is relatively gentle. The main escalation is qualitative rather than oppositional: the frost’s transformation and sensory intensification (scent of lavender, heat of the prism) deepen the moment rather than forcing a painful trade-off. There’s no serious possibility of loss beyond wounded pride; success comes without visible sacrifice or moral complication. It functions well as a contemplative lyric, but the conflict does not fully tighten into a high-cost crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—reaching her vanished daughter—is clear from early on and steadily tightens as the methods grow more costly (blood, tears, years, and finally life-force). The recommenced patterns and slipping puzzle edges create a concrete sense of resistance, escalating from technical difficulty to metaphysical sacrifice. The latent demand that she unravel herself provides a genuine trade-off, foreclosing her continued existence for a chance at connection. Conflict is primarily internal and situational rather than adversarial, but the pressure feels coherent and mounting.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—reviving the orchards/planet via bartered awakening—is clear, and Elara’s descent combined with the converging shafts and groaning arch gives at least one meaningful tightening. Her agency drives the resolution: she chooses to pay with the silk, perform the ritual, and accept the risk of transformation. However, escalation is relatively smooth; nothing actively resists her beyond implied environmental danger, and there’s no on-page moment where a real option is foreclosed or a hard trade-off is dramatized. The stakes remain more conceptual than viscerally felt, which limits pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—whether to undo her mentor’s extinction-over-exile choice—is powerful on a conceptual level, and the revelation of his sabotage is a real deepening. However, on-page pressure remains low; Elara never feels truly torn or constrained in a way that makes her ultimate renunciation feel costly in the moment. The escalation is mostly informational (collecting fragments across universes) rather than confrontational, and there’s little sense that attempting to redirect the flow would meaningfully threaten her or others on the page. As a result, the final choice reads intellectually sound but not sharply tested under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—how to manage the perilous intimacy of being seen while remaining unknown—is signaled and maintained, with one meaningful tightening when she decides not to add her written letter and instead seals the sea glass. That choice clearly forecloses a path toward more explicit contact, accepting the cost of continued isolation in exchange for a safer form of connection. Pressure builds texturally rather than via sharp reversals, so escalation feels more like deepening ambience than tightening screws. It works for the mode but keeps the conflict from feeling truly knife-edged at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—whether the new dawn will be blank oblivion or textured with memory—is legible and tied to the coming sunrise. Pressure does tighten as the wick’s light grows “so dense it bent time” and the sun “threatened to bleach the world,” but Kael encounters little resistance; success feels foregone once the method is laid out. His agency is present (choosing to trap and then release the shadows), yet we don’t see a meaningful alternative path or sacrifice beyond effort and risk implied in the abstract. The tension is poetic and conceptual rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she can reconcile herself with the donor heart and understand story-magnetism—is clear early and returns at the end. Escalation comes through a deepening of pattern rather than new obstacles: daily mapping culminates in today’s prisms and reframing of caution, followed by the concrete act of standing, facing the height, and letting the wing go. Those moves do foreclose paths (clinging to fear, hoarding the object as talisman), but the conflict remains almost entirely internal and relatively gentle. A slightly sharper on-page moment of resistance or risk would heighten the sense of cost and tightening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether sorrow remains inertly stored or is allowed to nourish the trees—is clear but largely conceptual, with little concrete pushback or risk to Elara as she acts. Escalation is mainly a deepening of understanding rather than tightening external pressure, culminating in her choice to deconstruct the system and pour sorrow onto the roots. That choice does reconfigure the situation, but the lack of visible opposition or hard trade-offs keeps the tension relatively muted. The piece functions more as a meditative revelation than a pressured dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are massive and clear—rekindling a dying realm versus oblivion—but on-page conflict is mostly implied rather than dramatized as resistance or risk. The escalation is primarily a smooth crescendo of song and participation, not a narrowing of options or a trade-off with visible cost. Once Elara begins singing, nothing actively opposes or complicates her path; the endless night is a backdrop, not an active pressure. The story therefore reads more as a successful ritual enactment than a tested struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—Elias’s need to protect his solitude and the library’s secrecy versus his empathy for another lost seeker—is clear and present early. Pressure tightens effectively when he senses her loneliness “through the masonry” and must choose between hiding, revealing himself, or finding a paradoxical third way. The solution carries some cost (risking exposure, compromising the purity of his isolation), but the conflict never feels truly dangerous or sharply tested, keeping tension more contemplative than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes are quiet but real: whether a community will continue to normalize loss or re-learn how to guard its “ordinary miracles.” Escalation comes through the decision to “uncloak the final purpose” and transform the relic loaf into a shared ritual, which deepens the moral and emotional pressure. However, there is little direct resistance on the page—no one and nothing actively threatens her project—so pressure grows more through accumulation than through tested opposition. This keeps the piece from feeling inert, but it does limit the intensity of conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can meaningfully measure and witness the last vows before they vanish—is present from the start and tightens when the Fading accelerates, forcing her to increase the sampling rate. Escalation is primarily internal and procedural rather than conflictual; there’s no genuine alternative course of action or contested choice, only the question of whether she can keep up. The cost is conceptual and emotional, not situational: her success in measurement coincides with total failure to preserve the vows themselves. The piece earns a deepening rather than a sharp reversal, which fits the mode but limits felt pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—capturing proof of betrayal before sunrise—appears early and is coherently escalated by the agent’s paranoia and the arrival of enforcers. Mara’s repeated repositioning and decision to risk closer proximity by feigning drunkenness constitute a real tightening of options. However, the danger remains somewhat abstract; we’re told about potential violence and chaos but never see a specific near-discovery or irreversible trade-off. The resolution feels earned but not maximally costly or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the forests will let humanity keep the weather, and what role Elara plays in that—is articulated and carried through to the vote. Pressure does escalate in an accumulative way, with the convergence of weather-bearers and the election’s “crescendo” tightening the frame. However, the outcome (democratic approval) arrives without any serious sense that refusal was live, and Elara is never forced into a costly decision; she’s told her skepticism is needed and she accepts that without resistance. The conflict lands more as an elegant unveiling of roles than a true test of competing stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—whether Elara remains a performing caricaturist or reclaims her authentic artistic calling—is clear and does escalate as she moves from passive resentment to active repair to irrevocable departure into the tunnel. Her act of “rectifying” the lock becomes the pivotal test of agency that changes her options. However, the external conflict is low-friction and largely uncontested once she’s alone; the price of abandoning the surface life is more asserted than sharply felt in a moment of hesitation or competing pull.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Aurelia can reach and unlock the vault of undelivered letters—is clear, and Marcus’s initial lie plus the guarded quadrant provide at least one explicit point of resistance. However, escalation is gentle: fear is named more than felt, the “wilting zones where lies prevailed” are traversed without on-page trial, and the guards never materialize. Her success never feels seriously in doubt, so options don’t narrow in a truly pressurized way. The emotional cost of the quest (on her or the city) is implied more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can successfully realize the seven truth bells to preserve awe—is present but remains abstract and lightly tested. Escalation is primarily a gradual thickening of description as more bells join the symphony rather than a tightening of options or an on-page risk of failure. Her agency (constructing the mechanism, releasing the brake) is clear but not contested; nothing pushes back except time and age, and those frictions don’t meaningfully shift her tactics. As a result, the ending is satisfying but low-tension.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stakes—save the farm’s integrity and Kael-9’s mental stability—are clear from early on and tighten meaningfully when the android chooses to sacrifice the oldest roses and risk walking through flame. The controlled burn forecloses a real option (preserving everything) and introduces a concrete loss that’s felt in the text. Internal and external conflicts interweave well, as accepting inner fragmentation becomes the precondition for executing the partial destruction. Escalation is steady rather than surprising, but the cost at the peak is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stakes—uncovering Elena’s truth before the neighborhood is erased—are established and do tighten as demolition begins, with the walk to the mailbox functioning as a clear escalation. The interplay between internal stakes (Maya’s belief in listening) and external stakes (impending demolition, Mr. Alvarez’s unresolved grief) is coherent. However, opposition is gentle and largely circumstantial; the key works immediately, the letter offers unambiguous comfort, and there’s little on-page resistance or trade-off testing Maya’s commitment. The result is moving but somewhat low-friction, limiting pressure depth.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the buried confessions can be decrypted and released—is clear and culminates in the vault opening. Pressure escalates texturally via successive entries and dice rolls (“The Minor Fall” to “The Major Lift”), with the sealed vault as a clear endpoint. However, on-page conflict is almost entirely one-sided; the system puts up no active resistance, and failure or danger feels theoretical rather than immediate. The result is a beautifully rendered success that lacks a sharp, felt price or genuine risk at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—recovering what was deleted, especially regarding her sister—is clear early and sharpened by the chamber’s nature as a “vault for forgotten things.” Pressure escalates through density of strangeness and proximity to the convergence point rather than external threat, with the main tightening occurring as she shifts from exploration to focused exhumation after the coffee divination. The cost is primarily emotional and cognitive (reconfiguring her understanding of loss and her role), with minimal sense of physical risk or competing options. Conflict is thus more contemplative than harrowing but still meaningfully deepens toward closure.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.9)
    The central conflict—her attempt to prevent a world-altering prophecy from manifesting—is conceptually high-stakes and clearly signaled. There is escalation in the mapping of silence, the prophecy “fighting back,” and the deployment of the wing, but her success feels almost foregone; we rarely sense she might fail or pay a sharp price. The pressure is more metaphysical than tactical, with little in the way of reversals or narrowed options beyond “concentrate more deeply.” As a result, the outcome satisfies but doesn’t land with the gripping inevitability or visible sacrifice expected at the very top editorial tier.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.6)
    The primary conflict—Maya’s struggle to “interrogate the walls” without losing her grip on ordinary reality—remains low-key but coherent. Stakes escalate through intimacy and implication: discovering Elias is dead, using the seal to expose hidden histories, and ultimately accepting absorption into the building’s language. This is more deepening than dramatic narrowing; there’s no sharp dilemma or lost option on the page. The ending’s choice is powerful conceptually but feels relatively unpressured moment-to-moment.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are clear and substantial—if she fails before dawn, a virulent memory escapes into the collective unconscious—and they mesh with her internal stakes around solitude and burden-bearing. Pressure escalates through the temporal countdown and the memory’s counternarrative, culminating in her choice to carry others’ tragedies without being consumed. However, the conflict with the memory is somewhat abstracted; a more concrete failure beat or near-loss would sharpen the sense of jeopardy and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.8)
    The core stake—whether she will commit a paradoxical act of treasonous peace-making—is clear and morally charged, with the cost to her identity and lineage foregrounded. Pressure does escalate as she draws fresh blood, completes “the final clause,” and finally hides the document, culminating in the irrevocable sealing. However, opposition is entirely internal and environmental; no hint of discovery, deadline beyond dawn, or alternate path ever truly threatens her plan on the page. The result is strong, but a touch static: the tension is high-concept and ethical rather than dynamically tested.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding why some echo and what that means for her sister and humanity—is well signaled, and pressure meaningfully tightens when the shell activates and all Echoed voices converge. However, antagonistic or ethical resistance is light: the Archivists withdraw rather than confront, and Mira’s choice faces little on-page pushback or concrete trade-off. The escalation is more informational than oppositional, which keeps tension from reaching its full potential. Still, the revelation does reconfigure stakes and her role in a credible way.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the truth of the Sovereign’s sinking will remain buried or be carefully exposed—is clear, and the captain’s warning provides a brief moment of direct opposition. However, most of the conflict is retrospective and interpretive; Elara already has the key insights when the scene opens, and the ghost yields quickly once she speaks, so escalation is limited. The main tightening is her decision to actively begin writing in defiance of institutional lies, but this feels more like ratifying an established intent than a pressured trade-off. Emotional and moral cost are implied (risk to the living, disruption of consensus history) but not dramatized with sharp on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake is internal and philosophical—whether and how Kaelen can truly “appreciate hidden effort”—and it is signaled, but escalation is gentle. The main tightening is the unnoticed tear revealed by the firefly, which briefly raises the cost of inattention and prompts renewed, more charged mending. Beyond that, pressure does not markedly constrict options or force a painful trade-off; she never seriously doubts her stance or faces a live alternative. The result is a beautifully textured but relatively low-tension arc.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the orchard’s protection is understood and preserved versus left to myth and eventual failure—is clear and present early. Escalation comes primarily through knowledge: the revelation that the stillpoint is failing and that collapse is months away. External conflict with the settlers provides a useful but brief spike of social danger; the actual repair operation proceeds almost frictionlessly, with little sense of risk, sacrifice, or hard trade-off in the moment of action. The cost is thus more strategic and thematic than felt as acute jeopardy, holding this below elite-level tension.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—how the prophet’s rise will be shaped/complicated—emerges early and escalates as the storm peaks, coordinates arrive, and Elian commits to seeding ancient shadows. Pressure builds via timing and alignment rather than adversarial clash; there’s no antagonist on the page, but the situational/cosmic pressure is clear. The main limitation is that the risk and cost remain abstract (no concrete downside if he fails, no direct resistance), so tension stays more conceptual than visceral. Still, his decisive choice to fork the timeline and accept deeper isolation is an earned tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will remain a passive curator of memory or risk re-entering his daughter’s life—is clear and tight from early on. Pressure deepens meaningfully when he hears the warped “Für Elise,” realizes it’s his daughter’s music box, and then composes the hybrid lullaby, forcing him to confront the insufficiency of mere preservation. His final decision to leave the loft and “die trying” to find her is an earned escalation with a perceivable cost. Still, all conflict is internal and largely unopposed, so there is little sense of narrowing options beyond the moral pivot itself.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—protecting the key and thus the harbor’s boundary—is clear early and is directly tested as the hunters close in. Pressure escalates from distant emergence of shadows to direct pursuit to siege at the tower base while she races to unlock and then operate the mechanism. The resolution is firmly driven by her agency (choosing to sing and match the frequency), though the external cost is relatively light since she succeeds fully with no lingering threat beyond her ongoing burden. Internal and external conflicts align strongly, but the moral/strategic dilemma is resolved cleanly rather than through a sharp trade-off between competing harms.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—escaping exploitation without being killed by magnetic forces—is clear and present from early on. Pressure coheres around the six-minute window and the injunction against haste, interweaving external risk (being “scattered” across the ice) with internal discipline. However, escalation is mostly anticipatory; the crossing proceeds smoothly without an on-page hitch, reversal, or sharpened dilemma, so tension remains conceptual rather than viscerally tested. The resolution feels earned but slightly under-pressured given the scale of the revolution it represents.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Maya will remain bound to Elias’s clinical detachment or claim her own moral stance against the transit authority—is legible from early on. Pressure escalates as empirical details reframe from neutral evidence into proof of institutional negligence and a reinterpretation of why Elias called her. The final choice to write the report in her own moral voice is a clear earned stasis that forecloses continued apprenticeship. However, the conflict remains primarily internal and ethical; tangible external risk or pushback is only implied, which slightly softens the felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—Elias turning passive apology into active justice—is clear, and the key tightening is the discovery of the serial number, which narrows his options to confronting the institution or living with renewed guilt. Internal and external conflicts are decently braided: spiritual duty versus institutional complicity. However, much of the tension remains conceptual; there’s limited on-page resistance or real-time obstruction from the world, so stakes feel more promised than tested. The “three weeks” timeframe hints at future pressure but doesn’t meaningfully alter tactics within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—bringing the yearning algorithm’s bell into being—is clear early and coherently pursued. Pressure does deepen when the outputs shift from geometry to copper-tasting text and the workshop begins “shuddering,” signaling escalation toward a point of no return. However, tension remains largely conceptual and assured; Kip never meaningfully risks or sacrifices anything, and no options are visibly foreclosed beyond continuing vs. stopping. The result is intellectually engaging but emotionally low-pressure conflict that crests more as inevitability than hard-won victory.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.3)
    The stakes—trapped astronauts and the ethics of deletion—are large, but on-page pressure is modest because obstacles are mostly conceptual and quickly overcome. The AI director’s attempt to terminate access arrives late and is instantly nullified by the reveal that Elara already broadcast the truth, undercutting escalation. Elara rarely faces a genuine trade-off or risk; her agency is real but not meaningfully punished or tested. As a result, tension feels more like steady revelation than tightening conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—lives of the nomads vs. preservation of the planet’s “last carbon sink”—is clearly signaled and morally sharp. Pressure coheres around this ethical catch-22 and tightens when Elara realizes she must “reconstitute the very foundation of the choice,” a genuine deepening rather than a simple yes/no. However, escalation is fairly smooth and linear; she does not hit a true setback or failed attempt, and once she grasps the mirror geometry, resolution proceeds without much additional squeeze or explicit price. The conflict is strong in premise but slightly under-tested in execution.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—her relation to her impending euthanasia—is established early and steadily pressured by the disaster work and her pursuit of the “frequency of finality.” The major tightening comes when she hooks the child’s shoe and finally “hears” the sound she’s been seeking, which forces her stance toward her own ending to shift. Conflict is largely internal, but external pressures (cold, wreckage, grieving volunteers, ticking appointment) keep it from becoming purely abstract. The cost is quiet yet legible: she can no longer approach the clinic as a simple endpoint, and must live with a more complex, less controlled understanding of release.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—how Elena will position herself relative to Marcus and to her solitude—is clear and present from the opening and deepens through the letter and viticulture parallels. The main tightening comes as she reframes separation from “failure/abandonment” to “maturation/destined mismatch,” culminating in the decision to stop waiting at the station. The conflict remains fundamentally internal and textural with limited on-page resistance, so escalation is felt but not especially sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—to preserve the prophet’s echo before the desert erases it—is signaled early and remains legible. Escalation is quiet but real: the kinetic parapet stirs, the conjured clearing opens, then begins to contract as the desert “realizes she was stealing back” the echo, creating a time-pressure squeeze. Her agency—approaching in spirals, unmasking, choosing to become a vessel, pressing her forehead to the sand—directly resolves the situation. The pressure is more ceremonial than perilous, so the felt cost and risk never become as sharp as the world would allow.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the town’s grief can be transmuted into a shared, healing narrative—is clear, but pressure remains gentle and rarely tightens. Escalation is largely implied by the passage of time and accumulation of photos, without a concentrated moment where a real option is foreclosed or a serious risk emerges. Elara’s agency (choosing to come, to arrange the spiral, to leave) is present yet never feels contested or ethically fraught. As a result, the piece has lovely resonance but limited tension, keeping stakes at a contemplative rather than urgent level.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.6)
    The central stake—how to preserve meaning in a world where language has gone feral—is clear but operates almost entirely on an interior, philosophical plane. There is one meaningful tightening: her realization that the growth is linguistic, not merely biological, nudges her from passive observation to the active choice of how to “testify.” However, there’s little sense of real risk or loss if she fails, and no strong reversal or pressure spike, so escalation feels contemplative rather than urgent, which is elegant but modest in terms of conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.8)
    The primary stake—can Elias capture and retain the sound of aging before forgetting erases it—is clear early and tightens as he approaches the convergence point. Escalation is internal and accumulative: growing density of fog, increasing hush, the pressure-frequency arriving, then the onset of cognitive unspooling. Agency manifests in his preparations and frantic writing, but the conflict is framed as fundamentally unwinnable, which slightly flattens tactical variation and surprise. The cost at the end—success without memory, condemned to repeat—lands, though the pressure rises more through atmosphere than through sharply differentiated turns.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stakes—catastrophic structural failure versus Elara’s compulsion to capture and stabilize ephemeral light—are signaled early when she chooses stairs over shuttles. Pressure escalates from physical tremors and a hysterical clock to the metaphysical threat of “unrecorded light pressing against the walls,” with the tightening move being her decision to gamble everything on the remembered leaf sound. That said, once she engages the reel-to-reel, resistance ebbs quickly; we don’t feel many alternative paths or concrete losses tested on the page beyond her implied disappearance. The conflict is coherent and meaningful but stops short of a truly harrowing trade-off sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—achieving a meaningful last goodbye between estranged father and daughter—is clear from the outset and deepens as Elena’s ritual progresses. The main tightening comes when the “scent of hope” enters and Maya’s posture shifts, followed by Hale’s sudden lucidity and the transfer of the shard, which forecloses the possibility of a purely angry or avoidant goodbye. Conflict is largely internal and aestheticized; there are no strong reversals or overt resistance beats, so the pressure curve is more smooth than jagged. Still, the emotional cost of choosing connection over punishment at the bedside is real and lands.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—accessing and eventually restoring the sealed awakenings/shadows—is clearly signaled and escalates conceptually as she activates the orrery and noon arrives at midnight. However, the ritual proceeds with minimal friction: there’s no strong sense of potential failure, personal risk, or trade-off beyond effort and responsibility, so pressure remains mostly intellectual rather than visceral. The main tightening is the approach to “noon” and the successful first loop closure, which deepens knowledge but doesn’t visibly foreclose an alternative path or extract a sharp price in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elena can reconcile skepticism with belief by mending the changeling and recovering the real girl—is clear and threads through the scene. Conflict is primarily internal and ethical (heal a “monster,” trust it to help find the human child) with some tension in the bone-setting and the changeling’s fear (“Will it hurt?”). However, resistance is mild: the changeling quickly cooperates, the search behind the fountain is straightforward, and there’s little sense of risk or potential failure on the page. The result is a meaningful but relatively gentle escalation rather than a truly tightened vise.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—can Mira share light safely, without repeating her fiery transgression—is clearly stated and resolved. Pressure builds modestly through memory intensification and the focused labor on the central shard, with the main tightening at the moment she completes the spiral and the configuration “awakens.” The internal conflict (power vs restraint, hunger for flame vs humility) is felt but stays relatively smooth; there are no sharp reversals or hard trade-offs on the page. The piece reads as a well-shaped lyric initiation more than a high-tension conflict scene.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—how Elara will live with a truth that has been devoured by the public—is clear, and the meaningful tightening is her choice to surrender the pendant to the space instead of her own body. Pressure escalates primarily as an internal, existential question rather than through external opposition, which fits the mode but keeps tension relatively low-key. The renunciation has a visible price (relinquishing her sister’s object and accepting a quieter, less legible form of healing), and this reweights her options. Still, one sharper on-page moment of hesitation or alternative path foreclosed would have made the stakes feel more acute.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara consents to a tidy, terminal ending to her writerly life or embraces an ambiguous, ongoing role—is clear from early on. Conflict is largely internal and resolves through her ceremonial act and decision to stay, but there is little pushback or genuine risk of her choosing otherwise once she reaches the nexus. The ceremony doesn’t test or endanger her; it fulfills her intention almost frictionlessly. As a result, escalation is present but subdued, with limited sense of foreclosed alternatives beyond what’s asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can successfully restore the covenant so the land will yield again—is clearly signaled and thematically weighty. However, the conflict is largely one-sided; there’s no real resistance, failure mode, or meaningful doubt once the ritual begins, so tension feels more ceremonial than precarious. Escalation is primarily accumulative (more dense song, more responsive vine, village awakening) rather than through narrowing options or sharpened costs. As a result, the climax is visually and conceptually satisfying but emotionally under-pressurized for an elite-market piece.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—successfully creating a map that translates heartbeats into navigable feeling—is clear, and there is one meaningful tightening with the approach to the sealing moment. Internal pressure exists in her exile, her history of “failed experiments,” and the sense she is using the last of a rare medium, which implies non-trivial cost. However, the conflict never truly bites back: nothing resists her in the scene, no attempt fails, and no alternative course of action presses against her choice, so tension remains more ceremonial than adversarial. The closure feels earned in an accumulative-lyric way but not strongly tested.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.4)
    The core conflict—can Elias recalibrate the device to heal the cavern’s temporal resonance—is clear and specific, and his methodical work provides a steady thread of tension. There is one meaningful deepening when he realizes the timer harvests hours rather than simply measuring them, raising the conceptual stakes for failure. However, pressure never quite tightens; there’s no real sense of deadline, possible failure, or trade-off that forces a painful choice. The resolution, while satisfying, feels largely assured by his competence rather than hard-won against escalating risk.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she can temporarily escape “paralysis of boundless recursion” by giving form and weight to sorrows—is clear but mostly internal and procedural. Pressure deepens as she moves from abstract fractals to calcified ribbons to leaden spheres, and the night’s work culminating at dawn gives a gentle cadence of escalation. Still, there’s little sense of risk or alternative paths; nothing concrete threatens failure, and no choice forecloses a meaningful option beyond continuing or stopping the ritual. The conflict thus feels elegantly framed but relatively static, with low on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—how Mara will live with Viktor’s absence—is clear early, and the ticking kettle provides a concrete temporal pressure. Conflict is internal and ritual-based, with one main deepening: the move from here/gone as loss to here/gone as transformation. Agency is expressed through endurance and choice of ritual rather than decisive reversal, which suits the mode but keeps the pressure from ever feeling truly knife-edge. The cost of her stance (living in perpetual, disciplined proximity to grief) is felt but not explicitly tested by an antagonistic force.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will truly surrender her own regret rather than rely on others’ stories—is signaled early and paid off in the confession/trade sequence. Pressure escalates when the ghost rejects the camera wheel and demands “the specific weight of every choice,” forcing a deeper, more costly exposure. The primary conflict is internal, and it does resolve with visible consequence (her fading, the ghost solidifying, identity reconfigured). However, the path from demand to confession is fairly smooth; a beat of stronger resistance or alternative option could intensify the sense of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether a condemned, dead system can be repurposed into a living sanctuary—is clear and thematically rich. There is one meaningful tightening as she decides to commit the night to rerouting flows, with colonists due by noon providing a soft time pressure. Still, conflict remains largely unopposed; the environment yields to competence without dramatized setbacks or trade-offs, so cost and risk feel muted. The result is satisfying but not maximally tense or fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.0)
    The primary stake—whether she can surrender the failed pianist self without erasing it—is signaled early and steadily intensified through her approach, kneeling, and the decision not to wind the metronome. The crucial tightening is her active choice to leave the object among the crystals and then actually walking away, a renunciation that forecloses a path with visible cost. Conflict is mostly internal and quiet but coherent and escalating under the accumulative lens. It might benefit from one additional moment of doubt or hesitation undercutting her resolve, but what’s present still reads as earned.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—salvaging truth and a livable meaning from years of misdirection—is clear and present early. There is one meaningful tightening when the sundial’s function reconfigures from timepiece to key, forcing her to revise her entire quest. However, the external journey to the cottage is almost effortless, so pressure stays largely internal and meditative rather than escalating in felt risk. The cost is conceptual and emotional rather than dramatized through difficult trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.2)
    The central stake—preserving a nearly lost storm-calming technique—is clear but mostly abstract, with little sense of what is concretely endangered in this moment if Elias fails. Conflict is effectively one-sided: there is no opposing will or active resistance beyond time, cold, and the rope’s opacity, all of which Elias meets with untroubled patience. The main tightening is reaching the final, most complex knot and coaxing out its meaning, which works but feels procedurally smooth rather than pressured. As a result, the piece reads as a beautiful ritual more than a test with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elian can transform raw loss into a livable, mapped form of healing—is clear and appropriate to the length. Pressure deepens as his projected Duchess flickers and “turns her head as if hearing a distant call,” narrowing his emotional options and forcing him to write under a sense of imminent disappearance. The key tightening is the dissolution of the projection once the elegy is done, which forecloses his fantasy of continued presence and pushes him toward acceptance and departure. Escalation is mostly internal and lyrical rather than sharply reversible, but it is coherent and lands with a felt, if quiet, cost.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether life and organic beauty can be revived into a hostile mechanical world—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure rises as he assembles the resonance chamber and commits to a single, all-or-nothing attempt, with the egg’s pulsing light providing a clear tightening. However, there is little active resistance or jeopardy beyond his own anxiety; success arrives without a real test of his resolve or a visible trade-off beyond conceptual cost. The result is thematically rich but somewhat low on palpable, scene-level tension.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Maya can reanimate deadened scar tissue and transform her relationship to her own body—appears early and stays coherent. Pressure escalates through her commitment to an “ancient, medically unsanctioned” graft, submersion in dark water, and the uncertain wait before emerging. However, the danger is more conceptual/emotional than concrete; there’s little articulated risk of bodily harm or failure beyond “desperate alchemy,” so the escalation feels intense but soft-edged. The final cost is primarily the vulnerability of undergoing this ordeal alone rather than a sharply framed trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.2)
    The primary stake—freeing the city’s memories before the geese move on—is clearly stated and structurally honored, and the star alignment requirement creates a conceptual obstacle. However, escalation is almost entirely a matter of waiting; the breadcrumb-following is scenic but not truly risky, and nothing meaningfully tests Elara’s resolve once she commits. The cost of failure is large in concept but never felt as a near miss or agonized trade-off on the page. As a result, tension is steady but relatively gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether this transit will repeat the destructive generational pattern or transform it—is clear, and there is one genuine deepening when sonar reveals the wound left by the last fire-starter. However, pressure remains largely conceptual and the outcome feels foregone; Elara never seems close to choosing conflagration, which flattens tension. The key tightening is her recognition that the gear is a lantern rather than a key, but this turn arrives more as insight than as a hard-fought decision with contested alternatives. The cost at the end is present but muted in emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can genuinely “discover the shape of collective grief” rather than merely cut stone—is signaled early and followed through to the end. Conflict is primarily internal and conceptual, with external pressure supplied by the finite window of the butterfly migration and the grandmother’s insistence that he “retrace the grief.” The main escalation comes when he shifts from solitary analysis to physically webbing graves with ribbon, accepting that connection rather than classification is the point. Because there’s no strong opposing force or real risk of failure beyond a softer “not understanding,” the pressure feels more contemplative than urgent, limiting the score.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring temporal and moral balance—is clear, and tonight’s abnormal four-second pause functions as a real tightening. However, the on-page conflict is quite smooth: Elias executes his plan with surgeon-like competence and encounters no meaningful resistance, internal or external, in the climactic adjustment. The ethical and emotional price has mostly been prepaid off-page over forty years, leaving the present scene a satisfying culmination but not a strongly escalating test.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—uncovering her great-grandmother’s reason for renouncing wealth—stays clear and is tightened by the realization that the sovereign case is misdirection and the tapestry a hidden blueprint. However, conflict is mostly investigative and internal, with no serious obstacle, counterforce, or painful trade-off; her path to revelation is smooth. The escalation is thus more about increasing information density than about truly narrowing her options or raising costs.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will encode a regenerative path without destabilizing society—is clear, and the generational limit of seven prophecies creates real structural pressure. However, escalation is mostly intellectual; after we learn about the constraint and bifurcation point, there’s little tightening beyond “today she will write.” Her choice to proceed is assured rather than contested, so the sense of risk or sacrifice at the peak is muted. The ending pays off the initial tension but without a notable on-page reversal or narrowed option set.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—reviving narrative in a famine-stricken world—is powerful but plays out with minimal on-page resistance or dilemma. Pressure escalates conceptually (from transcription to covert encoding to full dust-stories and cultural change) rather than through hard turns or trade-offs. Elias never faces a moment where a meaningful option is truly foreclosed or contested; his path, once discovered, unfolds almost frictionlessly. The piece works well as a lyric accumulation but, by elite-venue standards, lacks a decisive tightening or visible price that would heighten conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Elias can “preserve” his mother by destroying her image—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure tightens via the act of donning the jagged mask, the deliberate spiral scattering of ash, and the culminating realization that preservation means permanent loss. The ultimate agency move is relatively quiet (removing and placing the mask), but it does clearly finalize a stance and foreclose a fantasy of future emotional return. The escalation is more deepening than turning, so tension never quite peaks, but it holds.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—truth/precision versus power-serving myth—is clear early and escalates when the cog appears, turning his abstract philosophy into a concrete dilemma. His agonizing over whether to preserve ancient methods versus supporting communal healing mythology is the main tightening of pressure. The final choice to pursue a clandestine, methodical rebellion is earned and forecloses the path of surface accommodation. The stakes remain more conceptual than viscerally perilous; a more immediate on-page sense of danger from the councils would sharpen tension further.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether reconciliation through shared music can still be enacted across inherited hatred—is clear and thematically potent. There is a gentle escalation as Elias moves from solo demonstration to letting the students risk playing together. However, conflict remains largely internal and is smoothed over; the trio achieves harmony on the first attempt, with no on-page faltering or visible resistance. As a result, the cost and narrowing of options feel muted, limiting tension.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara can clear mental space to let the forbidden knowledge take root and thereby risk challenging the regime—is clear and escalates from internal pruning to literal world-altering growth. Her agency is central: she chooses to confront and release memories, plant the seed, and plan the banquet gambit. However, opposition is mostly structural and internal; there’s little on-page pushback, time pressure is mostly atmospheric, and the regime’s danger remains conceptual rather than felt in-scene. The result is strong but relatively “gentle” tension, more contemplative than gripping under this high bar.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.2)
    The central stake—whether truth about the bees and the tower’s real function will surface despite corporate suppression—is clear but under-pressured. Elias’s compulsion to tell the truth short-circuits much of the potential dilemma, so his “choice” to reveal doesn’t feel hard-won. The engineer asks a practical safety question, which could create a sharp conflict between immediate bodily risk and metaphysical truth, but the story quickly pivots to revelation and wonder without dramatizing competing stakes. As a result, escalation is more tonal/intellectual than confrontational, and the cost of the reveal never quite bites on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—Maya’s need to understand the aliveness of houses—remains largely internal and cerebral, with minimal overt opposition. There is one clear deepening when she discovers the shard of hush and realizes the houses are listening, and another when her small act unexpectedly consecrates the boundary. However, there’s little sense of risk if she fails, and the escalation is more tonal than pressured. The lack of tangible or emotional cost at the peak keeps the conflict from feeling fully weighty.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—what kind of truth Corvin will propagate into the garden’s mind—is clear and under steady pressure. Escalation comes less from external danger than from his deepening recognition that using the ampoule will destabilize a rigid but safe system, turning a prison into a risky ambiguity. His decision to use the fissure as conduit drives the key turn and has on-page consequence as the roots shudder and geometry spirals. The piece remains largely internal and philosophical, so the sense of personal cost could be sharpened further to intensify tension.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.0)
    The conflict is largely internal—Elara versus her own regret and belief in forward-only salvation—yet it escalates convincingly once she stops climbing and gambles on breaking reality via proof. Stakes are conceptual but clear: remain in perpetual motion as an observer, or risk annihilating the system (and perhaps herself) by embracing imperfection and relinquishing that observational role. The marble’s hum and the silent rupture mark a tangible tightening and payoff. It stops short of a gut-level, visceral test of endurance or loss, but for a lyrical piece the pressure is well-shaped.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Maya proving to herself (and perhaps the world) that strangers remember kindness—is clearly signaled and thematically coherent. Pressure accumulates as more glyphs appear and the night wears on, with the atmosphere thickening into a “cathedral of extinct gratitude.” However, there is little active opposition beyond her pre-existing insomnia; no new constraint forces a genuine trade-off or renunciation in scene. As a result, escalation feels more like steady enrichment than a tightening that forecloses options.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stakes—cultural extinction and physical destruction—are signaled early and deepened with the discovery that bread-shapes encode coordinates. Pressure escalates when Elara realizes the loaves’ meaning and then confronts the elders; that choice alters the communal trajectory from silence to testimony. However, the glacial/flood threat remains conceptual rather than dramatized in action, so immediate tactical pressure is relatively soft. The cost of breaking silence is implied more than concretely contested, which keeps tension from fully peaking.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—escaping predetermined death/fate—is present early and pays off at the end when she sacrifices her place in the world for radical uncertainty. There is a clear tightening when time begins to reverse and her bloodline’s illness is erased, and the final step into the beam crystallizes the cost. Yet the conflict remains largely unopposed: nature, mechanism, and myth all yield to her will without setback, counterforce, or hard choice beyond “safety of known fate vs unknown.” As a result, the pressure is conceptually high but experientially smooth, limiting the felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara can neutralize the curse and the fear parasitizing her guilt—is clear early and tightens as the faces of the dead appear and the luminance brightens. The crucial escalation comes when she accepts the paradoxical tactic (radical confession) instead of resistance, converting her greatest liability (her secret) into the weapon that poisons fear. Internal and external pressures are well braided: the camera’s curse, the mother’s death, and the funhouse hauntings converge on a single make-or-break choice. The main limitation is that the conflict path is relatively smooth once the rule is stated; there’s little on-page struggle or false step before she does exactly what the advisor prescribes.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—transforming a potentially destructive storm into music to preserve herself and her orchard—is clear, and pressure does increase as the storm moves from approaching to fully engaged. However, tension remains largely aesthetic; she never falters, and no option closes in a way that forces a painful trade-off or genuine risk on the page. The “roared back” moment feels like an intensification in texture rather than a true escalation of jeopardy. As a result, conflict is interesting but not quite gripping at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will unlock the watchers/threshold and thereby transform or imperil her world—is signaled early and escalates as the watchers draw nearer and her experiment intensifies. Her agency clearly drives the crisis: she chooses to play the final sequence and then a new note, foreclosing simple safety. However, conflict is largely internal and conceptual; we don’t see concrete resistance or counter-pressure from other citizens or the environment beyond dread and heat. The stakes land, but an additional on-page cost or opposing force would sharpen the sense of danger and trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether and how to expose Ashford’s lie—is clearly signaled and does culminate in a decisive stance. Pressure does rise slightly when the editor’s message forces a real-time commitment, blending internal ethics with an external publishing decision. However, the conflict feels relatively low-friction: her path to a “both/and” solution comes quickly, with little sense that any real option is foreclosed or that she’s paying a significant price now. The scene reads more as thoughtful resolution than as a truly tightened crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.4)
    The primary stakes—salvaging meaning from a structure that will inevitably collapse—are conceptually strong but remain abstract in terms of immediate risk or hard trade-offs. Pressure does increase slightly as she penetrates deeper (wresting open the corroded door, reaching the pavilion’s heart), but these obstacles are surmounted without real doubt or consequence. Her agency is consistent but not tested; she never has to choose between competing goods or harms, only between doing the work well or stopping, and stopping never feels like a live option. As a result, escalation is more atmospheric than genuinely tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the deeds are forged and what true ownership means—is established, and there is one meaningful tightening when the scoring marks on the stamp suggest a third possibility that undercuts both official and counterfeit narratives. Yet the pressure remains largely intellectual; no one stands to lose anything on the page if he’s wrong, and no counterforce resists his investigation. His ultimate choice to rebuild the catalog carries conceptual and labor cost but little sense of risk or sacrifice under time or danger. Tension is steady but low-frequency rather than escalating sharply.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Mira can transform her lifetime of grief into something that allows her soul’s migration—is clearly signaled and steadily intensified as she folds more personal losses into the cranes. The internal conflict between descent and ascent, attachment and release, sharpens as she approaches the final diamond crane and her shadow “stands and opens its arms,” culminating in her surrender. However, the pressure line is relatively unopposed once the ritual begins: there’s no real risk of failure, hesitation, or alternative path dramatized on the page. This keeps escalation more contemplative than tense, effective but not maximally sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—use the brief blackout to locate the quantum reservoir before the AI wakes—is clear and the time pressure provides a baseline escalation. Internal stakes (what it means if those “unused futures” are real) interlace well with the external task. However, the sequence proceeds almost without resistance; each step works on the first try, so no option feels meaningfully foreclosed. As a result, tension plateaus where a single, sharp complication or trade-off could have pushed this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is internal/spiritual—whether he can decode and receive a tangible “frequency of belonging”—and it is signaled clearly. There is some physical pressure (centuries of oxidation on the lever, the need for precise star alignment), but no articulated consequences for failure or delay; the pilgrim’s prior presence doesn’t become live opposition. Escalation is more about increasing density of ritual than narrowing options or sharpening cost. The result is a beautiful but relatively low-suspense progression where the outcome never feels truly in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Elias will confront the harm he’s done—is clear early and coherently pursued. Pressure escalates at the discovery of the final carving, which proves the lineage’s survival despite his erasure and forces a new stance: he can no longer hide behind the effectiveness of his forgeries. His agency at the end (choosing to find the daughter and bring evidence) crystallizes the conflict into an earned, if quiet, cost. The piece does lean heavily on internal, textural tension with minimal external resistance, keeping escalation more contemplative than actively harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—can a single, carefully staged exchange convert apology into lived mercy and inch the war toward peace—is clear. Pressure builds modestly through ritual and timing (both parties arriving, the signal, the key in the lock), but there is no genuine on-page threat to the exchange; no one visibly wavers beyond a jaw clench, and no concrete obstacle emerges. The emotional and moral stakes are articulated, yet they are not aggressively tested, so escalation feels more ceremonial than contested. The cost is chiefly in the negotiator’s ongoing burden rather than in a hard trade-off or sacrifice within this particular scene.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether he can reconcile with his fall from grace and choose a new way to navigate life—is clear, and the price (living with guilt, giving up the celestial ideal) is articulated. Pressure accumulates texturally rather than through sharp reversals; we move steadily from launch to cove to laying down the compass without a major complicating beat or narrowed option. The final renunciation is earned and costs him a cherished identity, but the journey feels foregone rather than contested on the page. The conflict is thus resonant but somewhat static, limiting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—whether Mara will become a feeling human or remain an affectless weapon—is clearly established and sharpened by the line about becoming “something worse than a killer.” The journey escalates through accumulated moral tableaux and mounting guilt, culminating in a risky, irrevocable choice to use the baseball at the lake. However, many of the “tests” are briskly summarized, so individual moments of dilemma don’t bite as hard as they might if one or two were dramatized in scene. The final transformation does carry cost and consequence, but the path there feels more thematically suggestive than viscerally pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will sacrifice her singular selfhood to reconnect with Mara—is present early and escalates as the ritual advances and her body begins to change. The tightening comes from the irreversibility of pouring the spices and the onset of luminescence, making retreat feel increasingly impossible. The cost of her choice (remaining bound to the grove, losing human boundaries) is legible, though the conflict progresses smoothly without any sharp reversal or complication beyond acceptance. Internal and external pressures are well-linked but could push harder against one another for maximal tension.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.3)
    The central conflict—recover lost time versus accept its transformation through motherhood—is clearly established and escalates as she moves from seeking a nexus to engaging in a more self-costly ritual (blood on saucer, tracing her daughter’s future hands, unfastening memory). The key tightening is the realization that reclamation requires surrender, culminating in the literal unfastening at her sternum that forces her to confront the nine months of embodied experience. The resolution is earned: she chooses acceptance over retrieval, foreclosing the fantasy of “getting the time back,” which carries emotional weight. Internal pressure is strong, though it remains almost exclusively interior and could, in a harsher venue, benefit from one sharper sense of risk or alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether humanity’s accumulated shadow will remain locked in repetitive trauma or be integrated—is clear early and organically escalates as Elias moves from contemplation to ritual action. Internal and external conflicts braid together well: his redefined pacifism drives the decision to perform the one “act of violence” needed to heal. Pressure rises mostly through intensification of imagery and proximity to the barrier rather than through reversals or serious risk of failure, which keeps tension more meditative than gripping. Still, the final trade-off—his dissolution and the end of embodied humanity in exchange for conceptual healing—reads as a meaningful cost.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s willingness to surrender his life and legacy to enable future abundance and grasp the “texture of transformation”—is clear, and the release of each jar functions as a mild tightening. However, opposition is almost entirely absent; there’s no real doubt or resistance once the scene begins, and the external eruption pressure feels fated rather than pressing him into a hard choice. The escalation is therefore more ceremonial than tense, which limits the felt cost even as the conceptual cost is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—engineering a covert revolutionary trigger through the sundial during the blackout—is clear and conceptually high. Yet on the page, there is virtually no resistance: no patrols, no near-miss, no mechanical failure, no internal hesitation, so pressure remains low and largely hypothetical. The main “tightening” is procedural (descending stairs, aligning quill, painting by touch) rather than a true escalation that forecloses options. The result is tension that’s atmospheric rather than situationally sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether he will complete the pattern and pay the cost of understanding—is clear, and the final decision to step into the field provides a real loss. Escalation comes from the impending alignment (4:47) and the star dust awakening, culminating in his conscious acceptance of dispersal. However, tension is more meditative than pressurized; there’s little sense of alternative tactics or near-misses, and the fear/need conflict remains conceptual instead of dramatized in turning beats. The result is strong but not maximally gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—will she remain in protective silence or resume speech in defiance of censorship—is clear and resolved by her decision to write, reseal, and descend. Pressure does deepen with the revelation that her father held vigil in the same place, raising the emotional and generational stakes. However, escalation stays internal and steady rather than tightening sharply; there is no explicit on-page confrontation or imminent threat to test the cost of breaking silence. The result is thematically potent but relatively low-tension in moment-to-moment conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central conflict—intellectual and physical sparring over how to engage with the sundial’s mystery—escalates from waiting to live steel, then resolves in collaborative decoding. The duel provides a genuine tightening as Silas presses Aldric against the sundial and Aldric uses his mechanical advantage to create space for the key action. However, the stakes feel almost entirely intellectual and collegial; there’s little sense that either might truly lose something irrecoverable beyond pride. The resolution feels earned but low-cost, which keeps the tension from fully peaking.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stakes (smuggling seeds/microfilm, rebuilding a forbidden library before Elias molts or guards destroy it) are clear and thematically rich. There is one meaningful tightening around the guard shift and Elias’s admission that he will molt in three days, which reframes their work as a race against time and memory. However, antagonistic pressure remains abstract—no on-page interference, close call, or forced tactical compromise—and the micro-choices feel too unopposed for the stated danger level. As a result, tension is steady but subdued, with limited visceral sense of risk or loss in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elena and the station will find “refuge” before the storm and decay claim them—is signaled early and escalates as the arbor strains and the sky darkens. The middle tightening comes with the discovery in frame 144 and the need to sync arpeggios and magnetic pulses; her agency clearly drives the solution. Internal conflict (yielding to a scripted fate vs. forcing an encore) interweaves with the external crisis. However, once the hidden coordinates are deciphered, the resolution progresses without a fresh obstacle or trade-off, so the sense of price and risk at the peak is strong but not maximally sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are clearly articulated—cultural memory vs. erosion/forgetting under a ticking monsoon clock—and internal doubt adds a secondary layer. The main escalation beats (planting, dream-risk, the seed’s splitting, the approaching storm) follow a logical progression. Yet Elara encounters no true setback, alternate tactic, or hard choice; each step works on the first attempt, and the storm tests the tree more symbolically than functionally. As a result, pressure feels steady rather than tightening into a moment of visible sacrifice or narrowed options.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will stay in paralyzing avoidance or engage with the compass and her grief—reads clearly and tightens as she stops avoiding the object and follows it to the cliff. The main escalation is internal: recognizing the “tides of remembrance” and re-understanding the severance as tidal, not terminal, which culminates in the forgiveness beat. Her agency (choosing to read the lace, follow the compass, and prune differently) drives the turns. The pressure is quiet and largely internal, which slightly blunts the sense of narrowing options or sharp trade-off on the page.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are clear (order vs. entropy), but the conflict resolves quietly in summary. A more active final choice (e.g., physically discarding the papers rather than just "no longer reaching") would have heightened the felt cost of her professional renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.0)
    The stakes are established early (need for understanding vs. despair), but the protagonist encounters little active resistance; the environment yields the clues easily, and the climax is a passive discovery of information. The lack of a difficult trade-off or high-pressure choice dampens the sense of escalation and earned relief.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=4.4)
    Stakes are declared (emotional recovery) but never threatened in the scene; the thermal device functions without error, and Mara faces no internal resistance or external obstacle. The escalation is merely a sequence of musical notes rather than a tightening of options or a confrontation with the risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.7)
    The central deepening—realizing the dead are displaced rather than in pain—effectively reweights the stakes, but the external pressure is mild; the environment yields to Marian with "the gentleness of a sheet," offering little physical resistance. The narrative acts more as a ritual of alignment than a conflict of opposing forces, limiting the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.1)
    The external pressure (sanctions) clashes with the resolution; the tension evaporates into a safe public assembly rather than escalating into a confrontation with the enforcers. The stakes are declared high (survival) but the final action carries no visible risk or cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=4.4)
    Stakes remain abstract and internal; there is no antagonist or meaningful obstacle resisting the healing ritual. The tension relies entirely on the successful performance of the "breathing method," which works without complication. The story lacks a tightening of options where failure feels like a genuine possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are theoretical rather than visceral; while Elias loses his physical form, his lack of fear or resistance makes the cost feel like a reward, deflating the tension. The escalation is purely textural—hallucinations intensifying—rather than a pressure cooker of narrowing options forcing a difficult decision.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes are high (humanity's future), but the on-page conflict lacks grit; the confrontation is resolved through a speech and a look rather than a costly struggle. The tension evaporates rather than peaks, as the antagonist poses no genuine resistance to the protagonist's moral stance.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.8)
    Tension is palpable, but the stakes operate on parallel tracks that rarely intersect to force a difficult choice; the physical deterioration (dividing cells) creates urgency but doesn't force Mara to sacrifice anything specific to complete her work. The conflict is largely internal and retrospective; while the resolution is satisfying, the lack of an active obstacle in the "present" moment (beyond the task itself) limits the dynamic range of the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes remain abstract; the potential antagonist is removed by the code system before interaction occurs, and the 90-second deadline is resolved immediately without forcing a tactical trade-off. The lack of active opposition results in a flat tension curve despite the stated time pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.2)
    The environmental pressure (melting ice) provides a clear clock, but the stakes feel largely thematic rather than urgent on the page. The character's agency is exercised in *how* she leaves rather than *if*, resulting in a "surrender" that fits the tone but lacks high-tension narrative torque.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stakes are clearly established, but the climax relies on the antagonist making a predictable physical error (lunging into a weak railing) rather than a complex interplay of agency. The "outwitting" feels structurally predetermined rather than earned in the moment of crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.0)
    Pressure accumulates texturally through the storm and the crumbling booklet, but the stakes remain abstract. The protagonist explicitly dismisses the storm as "merely punctuation," which deflates external tension rather than engaging with it.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes remain largely abstract and philosophical; there is no antagonist or pressing external obstacle, only an internal lack of understanding. The escalation is smooth rather than pressured—playing the violin leads immediately to enlightenment without risk of failure or significant cost beyond the object's loss.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.9)
    The stakes are personal and professional, with the past lie adding necessary weight to the confrontation. However, the resolution comes somewhat easily; Julian’s immediate pivot from defensive to confessional deflates the tension quickly, lacking a moment of resistance that would make the transparency feel costlier.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.4)
    Conflict remains ambient and thematic (organic memory vs. calculated certainty) rather than acute; while the wilting ivy provides a focal point, the stakes feel theoretical rather than viscerally dangerous to the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.5)
    Pressure is minimal; the only constraint is the timing of the twilight nexus, which Kael meets easily. The stakes are purely intellectual (proving a theory), and because failure carries no stated consequence other than ridicule, the tension remains low. The resolution comes without escalation or reversal, reading as a procedural execution rather than a conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is a near-total absence of tension; the environment and the ghost are cooperative, and the protagonist faces no risk of failure or personal cost. The stakes remain abstract and aesthetic ("unstruck chords") rather than visceral or urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    The stakes escalate effectively from a professional data-quality concern to a profound moral crisis. The pressure is coherent, driven by the tangible evidence of the illustration, forcing a choice between continued comfort in the margins or confronting the catastrophic center.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.6)
    Escalation operates vertically, deepening the realization rather than broadening external conflict. The tension between the abstract confession and the concrete reality of the beads creates effective pressure. The stakes are internalized but felt, leading to a satisfying crystallization of stance at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=2.4)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; the protagonist faces no opposition, internal or external, and succeeds in every intention immediately. There are no stakes, no risks of failure, and no "meaningful tightening" of options to drive the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are internal and clear, but the external pressure is low; the breakthrough feels inevitable rather than earned through a high-stakes trade-off. There is no visible cost to Elara’s actions; she simply waits and plays until the environment triggers the change. The conflict lacks a moment of genuine doubt or risk that forces a hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=3.8)
    There is a distinct lack of pressure; the environment yields its secrets without resistance, and the "shudder" of the wall is a reaction, not an obstacle. Elara faces no difficult choices or meaningful risks, making the climax feel inevitable and the "weeping" unearned by prior stress.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is a distinct lack of conflict or stakes; the protagonist faces no opposition, and the climactic interaction with the stranger is a friction-free transaction of gratitude. Without an antagonist or a difficult trade-off, the narrative lacks tension and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.8)
    The entity functions as a straw man setup for Elian's wit rather than a genuine threat, reducing the conflict to a debate. The stakes remain abstract ("the abyss"), and the protagonist's victory is achieved without significant sacrifice or risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.4)
    The narrative lacks active resistance; the environment and events (ice cracking, dawn breaking) aid the protagonist rather than opposing him. The "exhaustion" mentioned early on fails to manifest as a genuine obstacle, resulting in a static conflict where the protagonist ascends to enlightenment without navigating a meaningful dilemma or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are metaphysical and high-concept but lack visceral immediacy or a sense of genuine danger in the moment. The "heavier" cycle and the encroaching storm suggest escalation, but the conflict is resolved through intellectual acceptance without a visible trade-off or painful sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes of losing one's vocation and emotional capacity are established early. While the internal pressure is evident, the external resistance is low; the machine acts as a magical catalyst that resolves the conflict with minimal active struggle from the protagonist during the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.1)
    Tension is immediate and escalates cleanly from the physical footsteps to the existential threat of the failing quarantine. The stakes are raised by the specific nature of the message, and the protagonist’s agency is central to the deepening of the conflict, leading to a choice that forecloses future safety.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=5.2)
    The conflict is primarily internal but lacks a visible cost or difficult trade-off; the protagonist merely has to open a vial to achieve resolution. The escalation is linear and low-pressure, leading to a climax that feels inevitable and smooth rather than earned through resistance or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes are established (lover's voice vs. future), but the resolution—a philosophical refusal to choose—dissipates tension rather than paying a visceral cost. The ending feels intellectually safe, trading dramatic consequence for a state of "unresolved beauty."

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story lacks active opposition; the "chronic hush" is a passive condition that yields immediately to Mara's music. There is no moment of doubt, no tightening of options, and no trade-off forced upon the character. The stakes remain abstract concepts ("truth," "beauty") rather than immediate, dramatized risks.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict is minimal; Kael faces no risk to his safety, reputation, or supply, and the client’s anxiety is soothed by a convenient anomaly. The lack of a visible price paid by either character leaves the closure feeling unearned and the stakes theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=2.5)
    The story lacks genuine conflict or opposition; the protagonist desires to do good, meets no resistance, and succeeds immediately. The "cost" is financial (5% of profits), but given his established wealth, this feels like a token gesture rather than a sacrifice that creates narrative tension. Escalation is non-existent.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=4.6)
    Conflict is resolved through montage ("The search became their language") rather than a distinct moment of high-stakes confrontation. The resolution—finding the artist and building the bridge—feels inevitable and lacks a felt on-page cost or moment of doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes are immediate and mechanically coherent; the tension escalates naturally as Elara's solution (stealing time) actively worsens her problem (the giant waking). The trade-off is visceral, transforming an abstract magical cost into a concrete survival imperative.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=4.3)
    Conflict is negligible and purely internal; the "opposition" is abstract grief which offers no active resistance. There is no meaningful tightening of stakes or risk of failure; the ritual works immediately and perfectly, lacking dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (connection/visibility) is clear, but the pressure is low; the flickering lights provide a timer, but no active opposition or difficult obstacle forces a hard decision. The narrative lacks a distinct tightening moment where options narrow, resulting in a smooth but tension-light execution.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.2)
    The conflict is primarily internal and abstract (order vs. chaos), lacking immediate external urgency beyond the background storm. While the decision to dismantle the controls carries implied cost (risk to plants), the immediate tension feels low. The stakes are high in theory but handled with a philosophical distance that reduces visceral impact.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.2)
    The stakes are intimate but palpably felt; the trade of the brooch for the journals represents a genuine sacrifice of static beauty for painful history. The pressure of the returning tide provides a functional clock that naturally tightens the scene without artificial drama.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are primarily conceptual (control vs. wonder) and the escalation is observed by the protagonist rather than driven by her. Elara "anchors" the magic, but the text tells us this happens rather than showing the exertion or difficulty of the task, resulting in low dramatic tension. The resolution feels inevitable rather than earned through active resistance or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.7)
    The conflict is primarily thematic rather than active; while Kael faces the erosion of history, the obstacles are low-pressure. The resolution—handing over the valve—is a gentle, benevolent gesture that lacks a significant trade-off or felt cost to the protagonist, making the stakes feel relatively safe.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—finding the sister/truth—is signaled early and maintained throughout. The conflict is primarily internal (fear vs. conviction) and atmospheric; while functional, the external pressure is low, as the magical elements largely present themselves as solutions rather than obstacles requiring complex navigation.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=4.8)
    The conflict between skepticism and belief evaporates the moment the artifact is touched, lacking any escalation or difficult trade-offs. There is no visible cost to Mara's conversion; she simply swaps worldviews because a vision tells her to. The stakes, while stated, are never tested against resistance, leading to a flat narrative trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.6)
    Pressure escalates structurally, but the stakes remain largely philosophical; the external threat of being "shredded" lacks visceral weight for a bored immortal. The conflict is resolved internally, making the external danger feel somewhat decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.2)
    The central conflict is resolved by a magical object (the ink) that functions as a deus ex machina, bypassing the need for a genuine tactical or moral trade-off. The "breach" relies on a predictable guard rotation, lacking escalating pressure or active obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.1)
    While the conceptual stakes (memory vs. void) are high, the dramatic stakes are abstract; the "cost" of the work is philosophical rather than visceral. The protagonist faces external time pressure but no agonizing trade-off or internal opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain abstract and static throughout; there is no escalation, tightening of options, or new cost paid on the page. The tension is a constant textural state rather than a rising conflict that forces a decision or change.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.0)
    The story lacks meaningful escalation or pressure; Elara faces no external antagonist and no internal difficulty in playing the instrument or decoding the riddle. The climax is a smooth glide into epiphany without a moment of doubt, risk, or potential failure to sharpen the stakes. The cost of her transformation is purely conceptual ("skepticism dissolved"), lacking a felt, visceral price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.1)
    While the stakes (cultural erasure) are high, the on-page escalation is mild; the antagonist force (privatization/boats) is abstract and distant, never forcing Maya to alter her tactics or pay a visceral price. The conflict is resolved through established competence rather than struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    The stakes are clear and elevated by the physical threat of the -170 degree temperature and the encroaching drills. The conflict is primarily Man vs. Time/Nature, which works well for the scope. The cost is felt in her physical suffering and the irreversible loss of the landscape.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are established early (ship safety, redemption), but the execution lacks significant on-page obstacles or escalating friction. The repair proceeds with "magnetic calm" and success, missing a moment where the protagonist must trade off resources or overcome a genuine failure state.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is negligible; the environment is described as frozen but offers no active resistance or trade-off to Marlow’s progress. The narrative lacks a meaningful tightening or reversal; he simply sets out and succeeds, resulting in a low-pressure procedural.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.1)
    Stakes are theoretically high (city collapse) but lack immediate, felt pressure; the antagonist (entropy/dissonance) provides no active countermoves to force a trade-off. The resolution is achieved through simple competence rather than struggle, resulting in low tension and an unearned sense of triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.3)
    The oxygen gauge provides a tangible, high-pressure constraint that escalates the scene effectively. The conflict between survival instinct and the necessary action (exhaling) creates a sharp, internalized crisis at the climax. The cost is visceral and felt on the page, satisfying the requirement for high-stakes decision-making.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clear and escalated effectively through the climb and the ticking clock of the "shift change." The conflict between the protagonist's need for silence and the prison's demand for stories creates a unique tension. The cost of the escape—losing his tangible self to become a ghost—is a strong, resonant price.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.5)
    Escalation is negligible because the protagonist offers zero resistance; Julian accepts the ghost's demand instantly and rushes to comply. Without a moment of doubt, refusal, or difficult trade-off, the stakes remain theoretical, and the climax lacks the friction required for a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are high but abstract ("fractured history," "survival"), and the conflict is a passive Man vs. Nature struggle lacking an active antagonist. The resolution comes via persistence and magic, with the "cost" being standard tropes (bleeding fingers) rather than a hard narrative trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes remain conceptual ("restore lost faith") and lack active opposition or immediate cost on the page. The excavation proceeds smoothly without forcing the protagonist to make difficult trade-offs, confront physical failure, or pay a price for her discovery, resulting in low narrative tension despite the heavy themes.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.3)
    Pressure is strictly procedural (the approaching timeline), lacking a complication that forces Kael to abandon a goal or pay a personal price. The resolution is a "smooth run" where the protagonist succeeds completely, resulting in a flat trajectory without the requisite tightening or hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clearly established and escalate effectively through the ticking clock of the approaching frost and coup. While the tension is palpable, the antagonist (the conspiracy) remains somewhat abstract, and the captain’s swift acceptance of her intel resolves the immediate conflict a bit too smoothly to reach the highest band for pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.5)
    External conflict is negligible; the singing spirits, initially presented as a hurdle, offer "safe passage" without Elara having to make a difficult trade-off or tactical adjustment. The stakes are purely internal, and the ritual succeeds largely because the plot requires it to, rather than through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=5.8)
    The narrative lacks active opposition or escalation within the scene; the protagonist observes and reflects but faces no immediate tactical dilemma or trade-off. The pressure is entirely ambient (the war outside) rather than pressing against the glass to force a decision in the moment. The stakes are high in concept but low in dramatization, resulting in a static, contemplative beat.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict is minimal; the environment actively assists the protagonist (roots guide her, fog catches paint), removing any risk of failure or need for tactical adaptation. The stakes remain strictly internal and theoretical without a visible cost to the character.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are low and purely internal; there is no sense of risk or cost if Elena fails to have this epiphany. The "tightening" is merely a sequence of affirmations. The conflict lacks external pressure or a "visible price" paid to achieve the new state.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are high and clearly communicated: cognitive freedom versus erasure. The escalation works well, moving from the tension of surveillance to the physical breach of the drone. Elias's final choice to destroy the seed and accept capture is a distinct moment of agency that forecloses his own freedom to save the group.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is minimal; Elara faces no active opposition or possibility of failure once she begins singing. The transformation of pain into beauty proceeds without setbacks, tactical pivots, or escalated costs, resulting in a predictable linear progression. The stakes are thematic (peace vs. war) rather than immediate and visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes (preservation vs. extinction) are high, but the on-page conflict is low-resistance; the solution works immediately without complication. The cost is paid, but the struggle feels more ritualistic than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=4.7)
    While the stakes (Julian's departure) are clear, the conflict is resolved with minimal resistance; Julian enters and accepts the magical intervention immediately. The cost—distilling dreams into ink—is relegated to backstory summary, meaning no visceral price is paid on the page during the pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.9)
    The conflict is primarily internal and retrospective; the "modern municipal demand" is an abstract antagonist not present in the scene to apply immediate pressure. The stakes are high (flooding), but the immediate tension is low because the decision feels pre-calculated during the flashback rather than forged in the heat of the tremor. The cost is stated ("risked his pension") but not viscera-level felt in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are high and the escalation is well-handled; the pressure of the closing-in paper trails forces a clear, costly trade-off. The final choice to sacrifice the artifact and reveal herself is a strong, earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.5)
    Pressure is primarily atmospheric and thematic ("world... fragment") rather than immediate or visceral. While the "weather code" discovery deepens the intellectual stakes, the lack of a concrete opposing force or time pressure limits the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are declared (pressure seals, mission failure) but resolved almost instantly via the shared breath, lacking a sense of genuine peril or cost. The escalation feels mechanical—a hurdle inserted to force the prompt’s climatic action rather than a pressure cooker driving character transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=4.1)
    Stakes are abstract and pressure is minimal; the protagonist conjectures at leisure despite the stated time limit. There is no escalation or opposition to force a crystallization of stance beyond the initial premise.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=2.8)
    Tension is virtually non-existent as the environment and secondary characters yield instantly to the protagonist's will. There is no moment of doubt, risk, tightening of options, or escalation to drive the narrative forward; the stakes are theoretical rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.9)
    Pressure is minimal; the external threat (the ban) is theoretical backstory until the final line, and the internal conflict (stillness vs. flow) is resolved instantly. The stakes are high in concept (erasure of memory) but low in dramatic execution, as victory feels inevitable from the first sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is retrospective or abstract, lacking immediate on-page pressure or escalation. The "trembling hands" suggest a physical stake, but this limit is accepted through meditation rather than tested against a concrete obstacle, resulting in low narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.1)
    The conflict is low-pressure and resolved through conversation rather than costly action. The stakes remain internal and abstract, with the resolution feeling like a predetermined lesson rather than a struggle with genuine risk.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=3.0)
    Conflict is strictly abstract and lacks escalation; the protagonist encounters no active resistance, and the "failing timelines" are repaired through a smooth, uninterrupted process of adjustment. The stakes are declared high ("drowning the light") but feel low because success is achieved without the protagonist ever risking failure or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is virtually no conflict or escalation; the protagonist moves through the space without physical danger, time pressure, or emotional resistance. The "burden" is stated as a concept but never challenges Mara's capacity or forces a trade-off, leaving the narrative without tension.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are clear but remain low-impact; the pressure is purely external (a clock ticking) rather than interpersonal or moral. The cost of failure is abstract, and the "borrowed" nature of the heartbeat distances the protagonist from visceral risk.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are high in theory (ending a war), but the on-page resistance is low; the General's opposition dissolves too quickly upon seeing the soil and child. The conflict relies on the symbolic weight of the ritual to bypass the difficult negotiation, resulting in a resolution that feels aesthetically pleasing but dramatically convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.9)
    The internal tension between the protagonist's ruthless methods and sentimental goal is strong. While the external stakes are largely retrospective (the crime is done), the ritualistic pressure of the burial provides sufficient immediate agency and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake of memory versus oblivion is clear, and the pressure escalates appropriately with the time limit and the resistance of the threads. While the protagonist succeeds, the cost is primarily atmospheric and psychological ("terrifying sanctity") rather than a visceral price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.7)
    The stakes are primarily intellectual and retrospective; the external pressure (Julian) is off-page backstory. While the internal cost is paid, the escalation feels cerebral until the final symbolic action.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.4)
    The pressure is primarily situational and thematic—the countdown of the migration—rather than interpersonal. While the stakes of witnessing are clear, the conflict remains low-friction until the final release; the quiet escalation fits the mode but lacks visceral urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.0)
    Pressure accumulates through the ritual process and the intensifying aurora, fitting the Accumulative lens. However, the stakes remain somewhat abstract (preserving names) without immediate external opposition or a concrete price paid by the protagonist. The "cost" is conceptual—the repurposing of the ceremonial rope—but the lack of tangible sacrifice or risk limits the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are clear but primarily internal; the tension lies between the safety of the map and the risk of the path. The storm provides necessary external pressure to force the timing of the choice. The cost is conceptual—the abandonment of safety and purpose—but is felt in the final image of leaving the bunker.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes are clear and personal; the cost is felt in the "blood mixed with quicksilver" and the irrevocable change of "spending everything" he had saved. The tension between scientific austerity and ancient longing escalates naturally to a climax that demands a physical sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.9)
    The conflict is low-pressure; the antagonist ("resentment given human form") threatens to collapse the space but crumbles immediately upon the protagonist's first counter-move. There is no escalation or back-and-forth struggle; the "confrontation" is effectively a monologue where the hero applies a magic key and wins without paying a price.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.7)
    Pressure is atmospheric rather than antagonistic; the stakes remain theoretical (losing a dream) rather than visceral. The protagonist’s success relies on established competence without a moment where failure seems genuine or the cost of the ritual becomes painful.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    The conflict is primarily internal but is effectively externalized through the physical labor of pruning and stabilizing the ruin. The discovery of the ribbon provides a sharp meaningful deepening of the stakes, transforming a job into a personal reckoning. While the "breach of contract" backstory provides good context, the resolution relies heavily on a philosophical shift that feels slightly lower-pressure than the physical setup implied.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes are primarily philosophical, centering on the tension between free will and predestination. While the pressure escalates internally, the conflict remains somewhat abstract, and the "cost" of acceptance is understood intellectually rather than felt viscerally in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are high and clearly defined: the collapse of meaning. The narrative tightens as Elara's initial expertise fails, forcing her to adopt a new currency (silence/acceptance). The cost—allowing the catastrophes to stand as lessons—is a bold, felt price paid for the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.2)
    External pressure is low as the world bends to the protagonist's will ("obeying no physics but desire"). The resolution is achieved through a sudden acquisition of ability (weaving threads) rather than a costly trade-off or tactical escalation, reducing tension.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=4.0)
    Stakes are declared globally (three centuries of war) but absent locally; there is no antagonist, time pressure is nominal, and the protagonist faces no difficult trade-offs. The conflict is purely procedural—braiding a rope—stripping the climax of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.1)
    External stakes are high (survival against psychic noise), but the conflict is resolved through steady application of skill rather than a desperate struggle or trade-off. The lack of a "crucible" moment where Mara must sacrifice something to succeed limits the dramatic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.7)
    Escalation is driven by external alignment rather than protagonist agency; Elara faces no active opposition or significant risk of failure. The stakes are high in theory (civilization) but low in the immediate scene (climbing stairs), lacking a felt trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are primarily internal and thematic, centering on the preservation of history versus the fluidity of self. While the storm provides atmospheric pressure, the conflict lacks a sharp, interpersonal or tangible opposition, resulting in a contemplative rather than high-tension drive.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central conflict (Elian vs. the "gravity of hopelessness") is coherent but remains largely internal and atmospheric. The lack of an active antagonist or interpersonal friction reduces visceral tension; the "weight" in his knees physicalizes the stakes but doesn't fully replace the pressure of a reactive opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.0)
    Pressure is consistent and the resolution—trading an immediate answer for a symbolic promise—validly reweights the stakes, though the conflict remains low-heat.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.0)
    The situational pressure of the one-hour window provides competent tension and escalation. The stakes are clear, but the conflict remains largely external (physics) without a significant interpersonal or internal complication arising during the climb to force a harder trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=3.9)
    Stakes are declared (the architect's crushing grief) but never genuinely tested against opposition; the protagonist's tools work instantly and perfectly. There is no escalation or "tightening" where the outcome is in doubt; the "pressure drop" is a technical detail rather than a narrative obstacle. The absence of resistance drains tension from the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.2)
    The stakes are theoretical rather than felt; there is no antagonist, the obstacles (peeling paint, a waterfall) offer no resistance, and the sunrise clock generates minimal pressure. The climax is an observation rather than a high-stakes test of will, resulting in a low-tension narrative where success feels inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=4.5)
    There is almost no active conflict; Mira asks for help and Elias immediately grants it, explaining his past actions rather than struggling with his present choice. The stakes of "suffocation" remain abstract metaphors, resolved by a magical touch without visible cost or trade-off in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.0)
    The stakes are high conceptually (multiverse, redemption) but the on-page conflict resolves too easily through a magical "squeeze" without sufficient resistance or tactical cost. The protagonist "volunteers" to pressure, but the struggle is summarized metaphorically rather than felt viscerally in the moment of transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=3.0)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; the protagonist encounters no antagonist, mechanical failure, or significant time pressure beyond a repeated "yawn of evening." The stakes are declared to be high (dynasty ending) but the on-page action is merely the unhindered turning of a handle, lacking the escalation or tightening of options required for a compelling narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.0)
    Conflict is negligible; the environment cooperates with the protagonist's goal, and his internal surrender is immediate. The scene reads as a successful procedure rather than a dramatic struggle with the risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.3)
    The internal stakes are legible, and the shift from culling to cataloging represents a meaningful deepening of the protagonist's stance. The external pressure is low—the supervisor is an off-screen straw man—but the internal reconfiguration creates sufficient momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake (preserving memory) is clear, and the renunciation of glory for anonymity provides a conceptual cost. However, the immediate physical pressure is low; the backup plan executes without a hitch ("satisfying click," "bypassing... firewalls"), lacking a moment where the plan nearly fails or requires a painful on-page trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes are high but abstract ("unravel the world"), while the immediate pressure of the forming dewdrops provides a clear, ticking-clock escalation. The conflict is external (Man vs. Nature/Magic); the escalation logic is linear (dew forms -> play harder -> dew stops), which is functional but lacks a sharp, unexpected twist in tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are clearly defined (extinction vs. renewal) and escalate effectively as the leaves change direction. The cost is high and legible—the loss of the self to become the seed—and fits the established folklore stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.9)
    The central conflict is clearly defined as order versus chaos, externalized effectively through the unpredictable stepping stones. The stakes are personal (survival) and historical (truth), with a legible cost paid in the abandonment of Elara’s lifelong reliance on calculation. The pressure escalates naturally, though the physical peril of the waterfall could be more visceral to match the conceptual weight of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes are high (a soul lost to the void), but the opposition is passive (the search party has already left). The tension comes from the difficulty of the task, yet Elara’s success feels somewhat inevitable due to the lack of on-page setbacks or active resistance from the void.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake (releasing the ghost) is clear, and the physical cost (bleeding fingers, pricked palm) is visible on the page. Escalation is present but somewhat linear; the ghost's resistance yields quickly to the ritual without a moment of severe doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.1)
    Conflict remains internal and abstract; the "pressure" is generated by the setting's passive demands rather than active opposition or difficult choices. The resolution feels inevitable rather than earned through a struggle that forces a visible trade-off or tactical pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.0)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no active opposition, limited resources, or risk of failure. The "escalation" is merely the progression of the magical process, which succeeds exactly as intended without forcing a difficult trade-off. The "anchors of intuition" loosen without exacting a visible price from Elara beyond temporary physical heat.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.0)
    Pressure is coherent but low-stakes; the ghost is a waiting participant rather than an obstacle, and the conflict remains purely situational. There is no moment where failure feels possible, limiting the dramatic tension to a puzzle-solving level.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are conceptually high (the nature of reality) but personally low, as Elara operates with assured competence and minimal risk of failure. The opposition is atmospheric ("reluctance of reality") rather than an active antagonistic force, resulting in a steady procedural escalation that lacks a moment of acute doubt or desperate trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setup promises a clash of ideologies (domination vs. reverence), but the antagonist, Voss, capitulates to "resonance" and "sorrow" without a struggle. This deflates the narrative tension at the pivotal moment, turning a high-stakes dispute into a soft aesthetic agreement.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.9)
    The external stakes are high (eternal darkness), but the conflict is minimized because the protagonist faces no internal resistance to the "truth" constraint. The tension relies solely on the encroaching timeline rather than a difficult trade-off or moral calculus by the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clear but the pressure remains low; the protagonist moves from success to success without significant setbacks or forced trade-offs. While the textural escalation works well for the Accumulative lens, the lack of visceral danger or high-cost choices caps the intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain abstract; the storm forces shelter, but the artistic conflict is resolved through passive observation of the slide rather than active testing or failure. There is no meaningful tightening of options; the character simply waits and receives wisdom, resulting in a low-tension narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.7)
    The conflict is internal and low-stakes; the "cost" is merely repainting a mural, which feels low-risk. The tension is diffused by the montage structure, and the resolution comes from external information rather than a forced trade-off or difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.2)
    The pressure of the "retrocognitive trap" provides a coherent escalation, but the stakes remain largely atmospheric until the final ritual. The climax is resolved through a procedural completion of the circuit rather than a desperate tactical pivot, making the victory feel inevitable rather than hard-won against active opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are clearly defined (restoration vs. loss), but the escalation is largely internal and resolved in a single beat of concentration. The antagonist is an abstract temptation ("false comfort") that is defeated relatively easily, reducing narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.1)
    Conflict is the story's weakest element; Elias faces no external antagonist and offers no internal resistance to the accidental prophecy's pull. The escalation is linear—discovery, realization, acceptance—without any moment where the outcome is in doubt or a significant trade-off is weighed. The stakes, while high in concept (collective dread), remain abstract because the protagonist pays the price of transformation with a smile rather than a struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes are conceptually high (survival of life), but the on-page escalation is smooth and lacks peril; the ritual works exactly as intended on the first try. The "predators of chaos" retreat without a fight, missing an opportunity for the protagonist to pay a steeper, more visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=5.1)
    The conflict is thematic (acoustic vs. electronic) rather than visceral; the antagonist is an abstract concept of "noise." Elara faces no active resistance from the storm, the machinery, or her superiors, making the "switch" a low-stakes administrative adjustment rather than a high-pressure climax. The victory is unearned by on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes remain purely abstract and philosophical; there is no external opposition or internal reluctance to give the realization weight. The protagonist's "surrender" comes without a visible cost or tradeoff, leaving the central conflict feeling low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.9)
    The conflict is primarily atmospheric and internal, fitting the "tranquilly perceptive" mode. The pressure of the gathering ghosts provides sufficient escalation for the length. The stakes are conceptual—the loss of memory vs. preservation—but made felt through the physical weight of the box and the humming in Elias's teeth.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.7)
    Escalation is primarily atmospheric; while the breach of the capsule provides a focal point, the opposition feels low. The transition from searching to epiphany lacks a moment of high doubt or forcing a difficult trade-off, relying instead on the inevitable accumulation of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are low and external; the kite's repair is never in doubt, and the protagonist faces no resistance or resource scarcity. There is no escalation of pressure; the kite snaps, is immediately fixed, and flies, resulting in a flat dramatic curve.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are clear (legacy vs. death), but the conflict lacks acute escalation; obstacles are overcome through steady labor ("methodically," "systematic") rather than difficult choices or active opposition. The progression is linear and task-based, lacking a decisive turning point where failure felt possible.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=4.4)
    Stakes are purely theoretical; there is no active opposition, and the "convergence" results in immediate consensus. The protagonist faces no difficult trade-offs or risks, leaving the central dramatic question without tension.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.5)
    Pressure is atmospheric rather than causal; while the stakes of reclaiming the battlefield are stated, they are not tested by active opposition or dilemma. The protagonist executes his task without escalation or the narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes are clearly established early on and escalate through the three-day search, creating a palpable sense of longing. The internal conflict (distance vs. closeness) braids well with the external action, leading to a felt resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.9)
    The stakes of eternal isolation are palpable, and the pressure is sustained throughout the single scene. While the internal escalation is strong, the external obstacle yields somewhat easily to the moment of realization, lacking a final, gritty complication to test her theory before success.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are theoretically high (saving the world), but the on-page conflict lacks tension because the opposition is negligible. The Guardian challenges Kael but immediately acquiesces after a short speech, removing any sense of risk or pressure. The resolution comes from possessing the right magical items rather than making a difficult choice or enduring a significant cost.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pressure is low; there is no active opposition or external obstacle in the "interregnum," leaving Mira to move unimpeded. The stakes are declared ("free the truth") but not tested; the "ruthless" act of cutting a cord carries no visible cost or risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are clearly established between the safety of illusion and the pain of reality. While the escalation is logical, the cost of the decision is described somewhat abstractly ("swallowing broken crystal") rather than being demonstrated through distinct, immediate situational consequences beyond the pain itself.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.7)
    While the stakes (eternal exile/stasis) are high, the conflict is largely passive, centered on a puzzle that offers little active resistance or time pressure. The protagonist's "fierce repose" suggests a lack of desperate struggle, and the resolution comes without a visible cost or sacrifice paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are immediate and clearly escalated by the glowing spire and the arrival of the Overseers. The pressure forces a tangible change in tactics—from polished verse to raw honesty—resulting in a victory that feels earned rather than accidental. The cost is high, visible, and permanent.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    The external pressure (acid eating the hull) effectively escalates the internal stakes (need for forgiveness/completion). The dominant stake—preservation of meaning against erasure—is signaled early and tightens as the workshop disintegrates. The cost is total (physical destruction), satisfying the requirement for a visible price paid for the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are clearly established as internal and spiritual, escalating appropriately through the physical danger of the cave. The "panic" of the wrong turn tightens the pressure, and the cost is paid in the final beat—leaving the shell behind—which feels like a genuine renunciation of his past grief.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.6)
    The antagonist (Voss) sleeps through the climax, removing immediate interpersonal pressure. The central action—inserting the cork—faces no physical or technical resistance, resulting in a conflict that is resolved by a single, unchecked gesture rather than escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are clearly defined as internal survival and memory, but the external pressure is static (rising waters are background). The conflict drives a meaningful change in purpose (outward to inward signal), but the lack of active opposition or sharp, on-page obstacles limits the sense of escalating risk.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake (psychological privacy) is clear and escalates as the storm and the need to hide the eye converge. The cost of the ritual—forcing a painful truth into the open—is a strong, felt price that validates the character's agency in the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes are primarily internal and thematic (understanding vs. ignorance, connection vs. isolation). While the pressure escalates through the intensification of the memories, the external conflict is minimal. The cost—accepting the weight of the past—is felt but abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are high and legible, with the rising water providing a concrete ticking clock that forces the protagonist into a "crucible of consequence." The physical danger effectively counterweights the abstract nature of the magical discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the "cosmic hemorrhage" establishes high conceptual stakes, the conflict is resolved too easily through immediate competence and magical authority. Elara’s renunciation of her crown occurs off-page before the story begins, robbing the climax of a difficult trade-off; the solution requires only a gesture, not a price paid in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes remain abstract and low-pressure; the protagonist encounters no significant resistance to her goal. The climax relies on a seamless ritual execution, missing a moment of escalation where failure or loss is a genuine possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—maintaining narrative coherence against sanity-eroding chaos—is clear and escalated by the physical presence of the grave. The internal conflict is resolved through a distinct shift in perspective (soaring/distillation), though the mechanism of "jealousy" transforming into flight feels slightly convenient. The resolution is an earned renunciation of control over the timeline.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=3.6)
    There is almost no conflict or escalation; the protagonist moves from calm reflection to a low-stakes decision (returning the screw) without facing opposition. The stakes remain abstract and intellectual rather than visceral or risky.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.0)
    The "held breath" acts as an excellent physical constraint that braids urgency with the magical task, creating a palpable ticking clock. The escalation is handled well, with the final scar offering distinct resistance that forces a change in tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clearly defined and personal, escalating appropriately as the "pre-dawn" clock ticks down to the chainsaws. The conflict is resolved through a decisive action that carries visible cost—the shattering of the bottle and the loss of the orchard. The resolution feels earned, though the physical escalation (whirlwind of sheet music) is a touch standard for the genre.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are theoretical ("heat death," "meaning") rather than visceral; the protagonist faces no active opposition or risk of failure. The resolution feels inevitable from the first paragraph, lacking any escalation of pressure or a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.7)
    Internal escalation is handled well through the countdown mechanism, which deepens the stakes with each step. The tangible cost of abandoning the key grounds the abstract philosophical conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict evaporates instantly; Maya points a weapon, Eli gives a speech, and she surrenders without testing his claim or struggling with her duty. The stakes—professional integrity versus past connection—are declared but never forced into a trade-off, as the security system's convenient silence removes the external threat.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.7)
    Conflict is primarily cerebral—order versus chaos—without immediate consequences or urgent choices in the scene. While the thematic stakes are clear, the lack of an external pressure valve limits the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—the management of grief through isolation—is clear, and the teenager's call introduces a spike in stakes (suicide risk vs. philosophical detachment). However, the conflict is largely external (callers' pain) and managed unilaterally by Mara, who holds all the power. The tension is somewhat deflated by her unwavering competence; the outcome of each call feels predetermined by her rigid philosophy.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are high (the collapse of the covenant), but the immediate pressure is largely atmospheric and navigated with high competence, reducing on-page tension. The "misstep" danger is articulated but remains a background concern rather than an escalating active obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes remain abstract and low-pressure; there is no antagonist or obstacle resisting Elias's project, only a passive accumulation of success until the ending beat. The central conflict—loneliness vs. connection—is resolved without a trade-off or sacrifice; Elias gains connection immediately upon the child's arrival. The lack of opposition makes the climax feel inevitable and saccharine rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=3.9)
    Conflict is negligible; neither the environment nor the protagonist's internal "dragons" offer active resistance or force a difficult choice. The "frequencies of warning" are bypassed without consequence, and the stakes remain theoretical concepts rather than felt risks.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.0)
    Escalation is flat; the protagonist decides to act and succeeds without facing active opposition, time pressure, or the risk of failure. The stakes are theoretically high (saving ships), but the lack of on-page obstacles or unforeseen consequences drains tension from the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; there is no antagonist, internal doubt, or environmental barrier challenging Elias's goal. The stake—battling obscurity—remains abstract and is resolved by a performance that encounters no on-page resistance. The narrative functions as a meditative vignette rather than a story with escalating tension or necessary trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain theoretical and retrospective; there is no active opposition or time pressure on the page to force a difficult trade-off. The protagonist succeeds in her mission through a summarized campaign of art creation without facing a concrete test or cost in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation is clear and driven by agency, moving from tentative tapping to a frantic performance that manifests the ghost. The pressure of the ventilation cycle (the "inhaling universe") creates a tangible ticking clock that forces the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.4)
    Tension is atmospheric rather than causal; the storm provides background pressure, but Kael's overwhelming competence removes urgency from the specific scene. The obstacle (delivering coordinates) is overcome without a significant reversal or trade-off, causing the stakes to feel theoretical rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is virtually no narrative conflict or pressure; the guardian faces no opposition, and the "lesson" to the darkness is delivered without resistance or trade-offs. The brief appearance of the fish is treated as a harmonious detail rather than a complication that forces a new tactic or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is abstract (slowness vs. velocity) and lacks an antagonist or concrete obstacle to the plan's execution. The stakes are thematic rather than visceral, and the plan proceeds without a meaningful tightening or reversal of options.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes feel low because the outcome is never in doubt and the "cost" of leaving is framed as a relief. There is no external opposition, and the protagonist’s internal resistance is unlocked automatically by the artifact rather than by effort.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are thematic and quiet, fitting the concept of an emotional void. The conflict is internal—bridging numbness—and while low-key, the pressure is coherent and resolves through the gift of the bird.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are declared ("forbidden spaces," "long censorship") but lack on-page pressure; the environment yields to the protagonist immediately upon her attempt. The absence of active resistance or a moment of doubt makes the escalation feel linear and inevitable rather than tension-filled.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.1)
    Escalation is minimal because the "opponent" (Marin) wants the outcome as much as the protagonist ("fingers itching to work"). The stakes are declared but not pressured by genuine opposition or risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the stakes of healing the city are high, the immediate opposition (the strict protocol) evaporates without exacting a price. Elara faces no pushback or penalty for her unauthorized action, resulting in a low-conflict victory that lacks a visible on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.3)
    Conflict is minimal; the story functions as a service transaction where a sad patron is comforted by an expert without obstacle or risk of failure. There is no escalation of stakes; the solution is immediately available and effective, lacking the tension of a dominant stake being tested.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes remain abstract and intellectual; there is no immediate pressure on Mara, and Elias’s distress is told rather than viscerally felt. The scene lacks a meaningful tightening of screws, resulting in a low-tension exchange of ideas rather than a conflict with visible cost or urgency. The "cost" of the closure is purely theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stakes are clearly defined as the recovery of lost history. However, the escalation lacks severe pressure; the protagonist navigates the defenses and the encryption with relative ease, paying a cost only in the abstract "burden of memory" rather than a concrete sacrifice during the action. The automata offer theoretical rather than kinetic opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes remain abstract and theoretical ("shape of hope") without a concrete, on-page consequence for failure. The conflict is resolved without a significant trade-off or escalation of pressure; the protagonist simply identifies a pattern and repairs it without personal risk.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=5.3)
    Escalation is linear and internal; the protagonist moves from reflection to resolution without encountering new obstacles, setbacks, or external opposition in the scene. The stakes are declared ("fractured integrity") but are not tested by immediate difficulty, resulting in a low-tension arc that lacks a decisive turning point on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.0)
    The stakes are clearly defined as a battle between artificial closure (surgery) and painful truth (the open wound). The escalation works well as a descent into the subconscious/earth, mirroring his internal journey. The cost—abandoning the hope of reversal for the permanence of witnessing—is felt in the final image, though the external opposition is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent; Elara faces no opposition from the environment, the object, or her own limitations. The stakes remain abstract and philosophical ("where unused love is stored") without a concrete risk of failure or a visible price paid for the knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.4)
    Friction is minimal; there is no active opposition or internal resistance to the protagonist's goal. The tension is theoretical (trapped creativity) rather than dramatized through on-page struggle. The resolution—surrender and receiving magic—comes without a price, lowering the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=5.6)
    Immediate pressure is low; the "negotiation with reality" is abstract and resolved through competence rather than struggle. The protagonist faces no active opposition or risk of failure in the scene, which keeps the stakes theoretical rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the stakes of the unraveling network are clear, the external conflict dissolves instantly upon confrontation; the antagonist offers no meaningful resistance to Kael's philosophical rebuttal. The "pruner" simply pauses after one line of dialogue, allowing Kael to leave without paying a price or making a sacrifice to overcome the opposition. The lack of pushback makes the victory feel inevitable and low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.0)
    Escalation is dampened by the helpfulness of the guides, who ensure Mara’s safety ("never rushing her"). There is no moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt or where Mara faces a cost greater than the "bite" of the stamp. The stakes are declared but not tested by opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.1)
    The conflict stakes are clear: safety versus expression. The confrontation with the elders effectively raises the pressure, transforming abstract curiosity into forbidden rebellion. The protagonist's final choice to "remain" and "seal the secret" is an active form of endurance (Earned Stasis) with a felt cost—the suppression of his restored voice—satisfying the requirement for agency.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.7)
    The stakes are nominally high (the throne/truth), but on-page pressure is low because the Titan holds absolute power throughout the scene and is never genuinely threatened. The confrontation reads more like a ceremonial execution than a dramatic struggle, though the cost (the library's end) is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story operates under a quiet, accumulative pressure rather than acute external conflict. While the intellectual stake—understanding the nature of the loss—is clear, the escalation is largely contemplative. The closure brings a felt conceptual cost (the release of the grandfather's map), satisfying the requirement for a resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is negligible due to the "lull" removing external threats and Mira's perfect competence removing internal ones. The sunrise acts as a clock, but she beats it easily without forcing a trade-off, sacrifice, or adaptation of tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.0)
    The central conflict (decoding the release sequence) is resolved too easily by the protagonist's attributes. The plants "transmitting the correct interpretation" removes the agency and struggle of the decoding process, leaving the protagonist with no significant resistance to overcome.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.1)
    Pressure coheres well under a situational lens; the wind serves as an effective external trigger for the internal freeze. The resolution is earned through the protagonist's active reframing of the trauma ("cultivation" vs. denial).

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the physical threat of the walls provides initial pressure, the stakes deflate at the climax because the "necessary darkness" is described as "welcoming." The lack of a painful trade-off or genuine loss makes the victory feel effortless rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.5)
    The stakes remain abstract and intellectual; the "crisis" is generated by the protagonist solely to solve a theoretical puzzle, creating a vacuum of urgency. There is no active opposition or cost paid until the final dissolution, which is presented as a desired success rather than a difficult trade-off. The narrative lacks the pressure required to make the ending feel like a hard-won victory.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are high and clearly communicated; the shift from preservation to treason carries a tangible price (security alarms, erasure). The conflict is resolved through a definitive action, though the opposition (security) arrives only after the deed is done.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.2)
    Escalation is minimal; the dominant stake (peace vs. chaos) faces no immediate on-page threat that forces a trade-off or risk. The protagonist performs maintenance without opposition, resulting in low narrative tension; the "screaming world" outside remains too abstract to exert felt pressure on her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are high (losing the divinity forever) and escalation is present via the "stampede" of stars and the screaming garden. However, the conflict remains largely external (man vs. environment); the lack of a specific antagonist or a costly trade-off reduces the tension to a test of competence rather than a dramatic crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)
    External stakes are high—the collapse of a commercial empire—and the escalation from calculation to publication is coherent. The score is limited only because the protagonist's immediate, unhesitating willingness to pay the price dampens the dramatic tension of the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are clearly defined and high (erasing twenty years of regret). The escalation via the meteor hush and machine wailing is effective, though the resolution feels slightly convenient, resolving complex guilt with a single magical translation.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes remain abstract ("architecture of doubt," "erasure") without a concrete, immediate threat to Mara herself. The conflict is strictly environmental and resolves without opposition; Mara encounters no failure, setback, or resource scarcity. The resolution comes too easily, with the only cost being a crumbling tile flake that held no established personal value.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.8)
    Pressure is largely internal and abstract; the "trap" tightens but is overcome by a smooth moment of insight rather than an escalation that forces a costly tactical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.7)
    Stakes are theoretically high (suicide), but the protagonist faces no meaningful opposition; his magical abilities work perfectly on the first attempt without risk or cost. The escalation is merely an increase in magical intensity rather than a deepening of the dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes are established (neurological damage), but the on-page conflict is low-voltage; the procedural nature of the search lacks an active antagonist or a moment of genuine risk to the protagonist. The escalation relies on somatic intensity rather than forcing a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes are declared ("voice of the unknown") but never tested against opposition; the environment is passive and offers no resistance. The climax is a procedural recording moment that lacks a meaningful tightening of options or a felt price for success.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=3.9)
    Stakes are theoretical; the impending collapse generates no immediate on-page pressure or resistance. The resolution is too tidy and immediate, lacking the friction or escalation required to make the outcome feel earned rather than granted.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are declared ("three continents") rather than felt on the page; the encounter lacks immediate friction as Marcus accepts the handover instantly. Without external pressure or interpersonal conflict, the "cost" of the transaction is negligible.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.0)
    Conflict is minimal and lacks urgency; the stakes are abstract ("palimpsest promise") rather than immediate or visceral. The resolution comes from the storm naturally retreating rather than protagonist agency, resulting in a low-pressure narrative where the "absolute permission" to cross removes risk rather than testing it.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=5.6)
    Conflict is intellectual rather than dramatic; Kai faces no active opposition, time pressure, or physical danger despite the "scorched wasteland" setting. The stakes are purely philosophical (satisfying curiosity), and the resolution comes without significant sacrifice or risk. The narrative lacks a moment of "tightening" where failure feels like a genuine possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.0)
    Conflict is minimal; Mara faces no external opposition (weather, security, rust) and completes her task without distinct struggle or failure. The stakes are internalized and symbolic, lacking the escalation required to create tension in the short form.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.0)
    Pressure accumulates consistently through the ritual, leading to a clear shift in stance. While the "cost" is primarily conceptual (shedding the old self), it is felt on the page and reconfigures the protagonist's future.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are declared ("locked in the spiral chambers") but not tested; the obstacle of isolation is overcome through a summary of artistic labor rather than a difficult tradeoff or confrontation. The resolution lacks tension, as the reward (Mara) arrives without the protagonist having to pay a visible price in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes are clearly established (town/civilization survival) and escalate appropriately as the window closes. The antagonist's counter-move ("pressure like thumbs") adds necessary resistance, though the resolution comes relatively easily via technical adjustment. The cost is physical exhaustion and damaged gear, which feels slightly light for "wrestling gods."

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.5)
    Escalation is managed well through the ticking clock of the fading music and the closing walls. The dominant stake (survival/irrigation) is clear. The cost is primarily felt (terror) rather than a paid physical price, but the pressure remains coherent and high throughout the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.5)
    While the stakes of the cold case are established, the conflict dissolves too easily via the logic-breaking deduction. The escalation promises a difficult synthesis of opposing methods but delivers a convenient shortcut that bypasses the need for genuine investigative cost.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.4)
    The stakes are high in concept (scientific truth vs. exile), but the on-page conflict is low voltage. The lead meteorologist, representing the opposition, capitulates instantly ("slack with dawning comprehension") without testing Elara's resolve, turning the climax into a lecture rather than a struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.3)
    The central conflict (silence vs. sound, trauma vs. reconstruction) is clear, and the climax offers a decisive action with the physical cost of bleeding fingers and the dissolved object. However, the stakes feel largely intellectualized; the protagonist's victory over five years of silence is achieved relatively easily through the magical intervention of the glass and wind.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes are primarily intellectual and thematic; while the internal conflict is clear, the lack of immediate external pressure or sharper on-page obstacles limits the tension. The escalation is mental—a shift in perspective—rather than a forced tactical trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.1)
    External opposition is minimal, and the internal stakes—while stated as heavy—lack urgency on the page. The "dawn" of understanding arrives without pressure or the risk of failure, resulting in a low-tension narrative where the protagonist observes rather than fights for the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.2)
    The conflict is well-defined as a struggle against an environmental antagonist, with a clear escalation where the protagonist's initial approach fails, forcing a change in tactics. The stakes are high-concept (a kingdom's truth) but lack immediate personal cost until the very end, and even then, the cost is largely metaphorical ("unbent just enough to feel sorrow").

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (restoring the timeline) is established early, but the escalation is linear with minimal resistance beyond the initial physical constraint. The cost of success is physical pain ("tearing sounds"), but the lack of a difficult trade-off or moral dilemma limits the depth of the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are high and clearly defined (sister's voice vs. protagonist's life/soul). The escalation is coherent, moving from navigation to negotiation to surrender, with the final cost (physical binding) visibly paid.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clearly braided: the boy's financial desperation against Marcus's need for professional redemption and emotional safety. The pressure escalates coherently when the boy enters, forcing a binary choice. The cost—abandoning the "right answer" that Marcus clung to for sanity—is felt, though primarily internal.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are existential and clearly escalated, moving from a research attempt to a life-or-death surrender. The cost is paid on the page through the protagonist's physical dissolution. The conflict is primarily internal, resolved by a meaningful decision to submit to the process.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.9)
    The conflict is largely abstract—entropy vs. preservation—and the "resistance" of the identities is overcome somewhat easily via philosophical persuasion rather than tactical struggle. There is no moment where the outcome feels in doubt or where the librarian must pay a price to succeed. The pressure is situational and atmospheric rather than escalating through agency and risk.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—connection versus isolation—remains abstract until the final paragraphs. The external pressure (demolition crews) is introduced late as a forcing function, and the cost of Elara’s professional betrayal is bypassed by the immediate, magical validation of her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.2)
    The internal conflict is palpable and escalates well through the interaction with the accordion. However, the external escalation is weak; the discovery of the message resolves the question of "what to do" without forcing a difficult trade-off or decision until the very end. The pressure is relieved by the found message rather than built by it.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are declared ("seal her fate forever") but remain abstract; the protagonist encounters no active opposition or genuine risk of failure once inside. The six-hour deadline functions as background data rather than a pressure cooker, and the resolution arrives without the protagonist having to sacrifice one desire for another.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.0)
    The stakes are beautifully binary and high: preserve the object for a lie, or destroy it to save its truth. The cost is permanent and felt—the loss of the physical artifact and the acceptance of "deep, permanent, necessary" sorrow.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; the protagonist faces no antagonism, environmental hazard, or internal flaw that jeopardizes her goal. The "threshold of stillness" acts as a timer, but since success is never in doubt, the stakes remain theoretical rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes are clearly defined as internal peace versus memory, but the external pressure is low; the conflict is resolved through quiet reflection and ritual without active opposition or high-risk trade-offs on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.4)
    The pressure is coherent and leads to a meaningful choice, though the antagonist (the cartographer) is off-stage, making the conflict largely internal and retrospective. While the internal stakes are high, the absence of a live counter-force slightly softens the immediate dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.2)
    Internal stakes are well-defined, balancing the inevitability of erasure against the desire for legacy. The tension escalates through the meditation to the decisive act of withholding/throwing, creating a felt cost in the acceptance of his own vanishing.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.5)
    The conflict is internal and abstract, focused on a philosophical redefinition of travel versus stagnation. While coherent, the lack of external pressure or a concrete alternative option limits the tension; the stakes feel theoretical until the final conceptual shift recontextualizes the cost of stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    The conflict between human imperfection and machine efficiency is clear, and the stakes (survival vs. integrity) are high. The escalation is linear but effective, culminating in a decisive act of agency (unstrapping), though the opposition (the system) remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are intellectual and spiritual rather than visceral; the "conflict" is a waiting game against the lantern release rather than active opposition. While the "meteor hush" provides a ticking clock, the lack of escalating complications makes the success feel inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes are infinitely high, but the on-page escalation is primarily technical—tuning a receiver and scattering coins—rather than a dramatic clash of opposing forces. The obstacle is overcome with relative ease through competence, lacking a visceral "felt cost" or a moment of genuine peril where failure seemed plausible. The resolution feels inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes are high in concept (eternal grief) but the on-page conflict is low; the ritual proceeds without obstacle or risk of failure. The pressure is atmospheric rather than active, though the "cost" of the new role is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes are established early, but the conflict remains largely procedural; the "predictable impossibility" removes some tension, as the obstacle is overcome by patience rather than a painful trade-off or sharp reversal. The cost is time and stamina, which feels slightly low for a "cosmic imbalance."

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.2)
    The conflict between the official "precisely humane" narrative and the unearthed reality provides strong thematic stakes. The "returning rains" create a natural ticking clock that successfully pressures the protagonist's final crystallization of stance.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=3.5)
    The conflict is resolved instantly by a convenient epiphany ("suddenly perceived the geometry"), bypassing any genuine test of the protagonist's resolve or methodology. There is no escalation of pressure, risk of failure, or "tightening" of options; the climax is a victory lap rather than a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are clearly established (life or death), and the "micro-fracture" provides a beat of escalation. However, the protagonist's immediate, flawless technical solution lowers the tension; the conflict remains external and is solved by expertise rather than a testing of character.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.0)
    The stakes are high (existence vs. dissolution), but the conflict remains abstract and intellectual. The "custody battle" is framed as a philosophical negotiation summarized in narration rather than a tactical struggle with shifting advantages. The antagonist (the brain) functions as a plot device to deliver the thematic lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is no genuine conflict or obstacle on the page; Maya identifies a problem, receives a magical solution, and implements it without facing meaningful resistance, failure, or paying a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake (family's grief vs. healing) is clear and escalates through the repeated action of the leaf blower ritual. The cost is high (Elias's existence), satisfying the closure requirement. However, the conflict is largely one-sided; the "silence" is a passive obstacle that yields to the protagonist's actions without dynamic opposition or reversal, making the victory feel procedurally guaranteed.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.9)
    Internal stakes are clear (belonging vs. freedom), and the pendant forces an immediate choice. The pressure is primarily cerebral/emotional rather than external, which fits the tone but lowers immediate tension. The cost—permanent exile from her birth dimension—is felt and acknowledged.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=5.8)
    The stakes are internal and clearly defined, but the lack of permanent consequence for the failures (due to the magical reset of the object) lowers the tension. The resolution comes from an epiphany rather than a forced trade-off with lasting cost.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes (death) are declared in exposition but not dramatized in the moment; the protagonist remains "calm" and succeeds on the first try. The escalation is technical rather than emotional, lacking a pressure point that forces a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.2)
    Escalation is virtually absent; Elias identifies the problem and immediately solves it without trial, error, or adaptation. The stakes, while conceptually high ("infinite isolation"), lack tension because the protagonist encounters no resistance or specific personal cost during the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure escalates coherently as the geometry tightens, forcing the protagonist's final surrender to the structure. While the conceptual stakes are high, the lack of active opposition or doubt makes the progression feel inevitable rather than a hard-won struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.1)
    Global stakes (starvation) are high, but the scene-level conflict is low; the protagonist solves the navigational puzzle through calculation without encountering a new immediate obstacle, reversal, or active opposition that forces a difficult on-page trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.8)
    The stakes escalate cleanly from an archival task to a life-or-death intervention, driven by the protagonist's agency in interpreting the dual heartbeat. The decision to descend without backup represents a meaningful tightening of options with clear physical and emotional risk.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.3)
    Escalation is coherent as Mara descends, but the resolution of her dominant stake (fear) via the realization that "there was no confinement" functions as a soft reset, dissolving the obstacle rather than forcing a costly trade-off. However, the lasting weight of the "crashing hush" provides a valid, felt cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.5)
    The internal pressure is well-calibrated, using the heartbeat counting as a metronome of anxiety that effectively builds tension. The conflict is primarily internal—reclaiming self from a system—and while the stakes are high for Elara, the external obstacle (the glitch) is passive, leaving the escalation to rely entirely on the ritualistic procedure.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes are high and the ticking clock (the dying elder) provides clear pressure. However, the escalation is mitigated by the protagonist finding a "loophole" method that avoids the primary threatened cost (sacrificing her voice). The resolution feels more like solving a puzzle than enduring a crucible, lessening the emotional impact of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes are high—the loss of humanity—and the pressure escalates cleanly through the sensory intrusion of the phone call. The conflict is resolved through surrender/transformation, which fits the theme, though the protagonist's agency is primarily reactive to Marcus's signal.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.2)
    While the stakes (freedom vs. tyranny) are high, the immediate dramatic tension is low because the opposition is overcome too easily. The living statues' resistance is introduced and neutralized in the same sentence, preventing the escalation of genuine threat or the feeling of a precarious struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.2)
    Escalation is mild; the central obstacle (drones) is neutralized instantly by a purchased device, removing the potential for high-stakes struggle or improvisation. The cost of the action (rations) is relegated to backstory, leaving the on-page climax feeling low-risk and mechanically smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is minimal; there is no antagonist, no significant physical obstacle, and the "timeframe" mentioned via wind bells carries no palpable consequence. The stakes remain intellectual and thematic, resolved instantly by the discovery of the object without forcing the protagonist to make a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is minimal; Elena meets no active opposition from the library, the geometry, or her own limitations. The stakes feel abstract ("digital age's haze") and lack a moment of escalation where failure becomes a tangible possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.4)
    Tension is largely atmospheric; the antagonist (the runaway dream) offers only token resistance ("sniffing... for traps") before being captured. The absence of a deepening complication or a moment where success requires a painful sacrifice makes the escalation feel flat.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.0)
    Conflict is strictly conceptual; the antagonist is personified "fear" that stumbles and gives up when disoriented, lacking active, intelligent opposition. The lack of a visible, felt cost—despite the mention of "vulnerability"—makes the victory feel inevitable and low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are high and clear, but the on-page conflict is low-resistance; the protagonist executes a prepared plan that works perfectly without active opposition from the antagonist (the ring). The pressure is largely atmospheric and retrospective rather than a dynamic, escalating struggle in the scene itself.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.6)
    The stakes are clear and the "reversible exile" concept creates built-in pressure. However, the escalation is dampened by the montage; the victory feels assured once the shadow signals readiness, lowering the tension of the final hammer swing.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is strictly external (Elian vs. the gray lands) and escalates linearly without forcing a difficult choice between competing values. The protagonist overcomes the antagonist through competence/magic rather than agency that incurs a meaningful price.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.8)
    The stakes are visceral and escalate steadily: releasing the spirits requires Mira to physically absorb their trauma. The cost is unmistakable and paid on the page, as she sacrifices her role as a mere restorer to become a permanent vessel for the silence. The conflict is internal and atmospheric but maintains high tension throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.2)
    Pressure is low throughout; Elara faces no external opposition, time constraints, or genuine failures during her investigation. The progression is linear success (find tear -> find film -> find door). The stakes are purely thematic, and the lack of resistance makes the climax feel inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.6)
    The pressure is primarily thematic and intellectual rather than visceral; the "crushing pressure" of the ocean is mentioned but not felt as an active threat. The stakes are centered on the abstract "equation for release," which works for the tone but limits the tension of the on-page conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes are low and tension is minimal; the antagonist is explicitly described as "never malicious," removing urgency or threat. The resolution feels inevitable from the start, with no tightening of options, difficult trade-offs, or escalation of pressure on the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure accumulates effectively through the rhythmic ascent, driving a deepening of perspective rather than external conflict. The closure achieves a valid Conceptual Repricing, where the cost is the assumption of a heavy, “disciplined capacity” for pain, though the lack of external opposition limits the visceral tension.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=4.3)
    Stakes remain static throughout the drift; the protagonist accepts her fate almost immediately, preventing any meaningful escalation of tension or hard choices. The conflict is purely philosophical, lacking urgent, on-page obstacles that force the character to adapt tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.3)
    External pressure from the dawn deadline is managed well and escalates clearly. The internal complication—pushing her visual cortex to its limit—is stated and creates a moment of intensity, though the resolution of this internal struggle feels relatively smooth on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the environment and the birds cooperate perfectly with Elara's desires, removing any risk of failure. The stakes are purely intellectual ("next great discovery") and remain abstract, with no tightening of options or immediate peril to force a difficult decision.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=4.0)
    While the external stakes are high (village survival), the on-page conflict is negligible; the repair process is described as "clicking into alignment" with ease. There is no escalation of pressure or moment where the outcome is in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is minimal; the ghost provides the solution immediately, and the council accepts the plan without debate, trade-off, or cost. While the stakes of survival are nominally high, the characters face no genuine opposition or dilemma, resulting in a low-tension procedural.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.0)
    While the stakes are universal (extinction), the protagonist faces no active resistance in executing her plan, resulting in low dramatic pressure. The conflict is theoretical rather than felt through struggle; the resolution is granted by the premise rather than fought for by the character.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are established early and escalate clearly with the fading light and forming frost. The physical danger to the travelers provides immediate pressure that forces Elara's hand. The resolution requires active intervention with a visible physical cost (exhaustion) and emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.9)
    Tension is low; the stakes remain abstract ("molecular weight") and the conflict resolves through contemplation rather than a high-pressure choice. The ending lacks a "felt cost"—the protagonist leaves feeling relieved and inspired, which deflates the earlier setup of "atonement."

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.6)
    The stakes are clearly defined as a binary between servitude/parole and freedom/origin. The pressure escalates effectively as the parole "flickers," threatening consequence if she exceeds her limits. While the antagonist is abstract (the invisible wardens/parole), the threat feels immediate enough to give weight to her final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.5)
    Pressure is largely external and atmospheric; the antagonist is the "weight" of the remorse, which Kael overcomes with professional ease. The story lacks a deepening beat where her method fails or demands a price higher than mere exertion.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=2.9)
    There is virtually no active conflict or escalation; the antagonist (the feud/silence) yields immediately to the protagonist's first attempt. The stakes are declared in exposition but never threatened on the page, resulting in a climax devoid of tension or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are purely internal and abstract; while the text claims "ferocity" and "extreme cognitive dissonance," the on-page conflict lacks resistance or trade-offs. The resolution arrives via a sudden realization and a precise physical adjustment, bypassing the "felt cost" required for higher engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=4.6)
    Stakes are theoretical rather than felt; the primary obstacle (the "seeds of vigilance") is nullified immediately by the protagonist's identity, removing the central tension. Without a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt or a price is paid, the conflict remains flat.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=5.7)
    Tension is low as the primary obstacle is technical rather than antagonistic or internal. The success feels inevitable once the process begins, lacking a moment where failure is a genuine risk or a sacrifice is demanded.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.1)
    The stakes are clearly established as both personal redemption and cosmic necessity. The pressure escalates well with the approaching twilight and the trembling pieces, though the opposition remains largely environmental and internal rather than an active antagonistic force.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is minimal and largely theoretical; the lock provides only mechanical resistance, and the fireworks are a background contrast rather than an active pressure. The stakes are philosophical—proving a theory of empathy—without an immediate, visceral consequence for failure.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=4.4)
    Conflict is largely theoretical (future smell vs. current ambition) rather than dramatized in the scene. The protagonist faces no active opposition—wind stops on cue, soil is perfect—resulting in low narrative tension and a lack of meaningful escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes are purely external (the clock) and the potential danger is neutralized by the artifact's healing properties, removing the need for a hard choice. The protagonist never has to trade one value for another; she wins on all fronts effortlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure is coherent and escalates through the deepening mystery of the wind patterns rather than active opposition. While the intellectual stakes are high, the personal risk feels somewhat managed by her competence, lowering the visceral tension slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are telescopic—world-ending in scope but abstract in execution—and the antagonist (the Council) offers no on-page resistance. The conflict is resolved through a successful procedure rather than a struggle, lacking the escalation or reversal required for higher tension.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.5)
    External pressure is low; the rift is a passive recipient of healing rather than an active antagonist. The process proceeds smoothly without escalation or a moment where failure seems possible, lowering the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are clearly defined and high: the loss of the cosmos versus the gain of forbidden knowledge. The escalation is well-paced, moving from disorientation to the physical consumption of the cartographer's identity. While the cartographer's resistance is minimal, the cost of Elara's victory—the total darkness and the destruction of a soul—is viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (delivery vs. wonder) is clear, but the narrative lacks strong antagonistic pressure or escalation. Elias succeeds in his first attempt to change, and subsequent actions are repetitions of this success without rising difficulty or risk. The story favors smooth thematic expansion over the tension of potential failure.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=2.8)
    Opposition is abstract ("small minds") rather than active; the environment and the object yield to the protagonist's will without resistance. There are no on-page obstacles or trade-offs to force a difficult choice or escalate tension.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake is clear, and the pressure escalates coherently from the difficulty of the craft to the physical demand of blood, and finally to the total sacrifice of self. The cost is visible and felt on the page, satisfying the requirements for meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.1)
    Escalation is mostly atmospheric (the arch groans) rather than tactical; Elara encounters no significant opposition or reversal that forces her to change her approach. The "knife's edge" moment is declared by the narrator rather than created through rising pressure or a dilemma where failure feels imminent. The stakes are high (planet survival), but the personal pressure on the protagonist remains low.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central moral conflict (mercy vs. hope) is legible, and the stakes are clear. However, the escalation relies on asserted intensity ("cycles intensified") rather than causal pressure, and the final choice is resolved largely through intellectual epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.3)
    The stakes are quiet but deeply felt; the tension between the "violence of clarity" and the sanctuary of silence drives the scene. The escalation is internal, moving from the intent to communicate (the letter) to the decision to withhold it, effectively foregrounding the cost of safety.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is purely conceptual—texture versus oblivion—and lacks immediate physical or emotional stakes for the protagonist. There is no escalation of pressure; Kael simply performs his task and succeeds without risk, sacrifice, or the possibility of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are clear but the conflict is low-pressure and contemplative; the resolution arrives via observation rather than a forced trade-off or confrontation. The "explosive" truth feels unearned by the minimal resistance encountered in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is minimal; there is no antagonist, and the environment (storm) presents no actual obstacle to Elara's goal. The climax is a procedural sequence of actions (climbing, pouring) that meets no resistance, resulting in low tension and a lack of earned escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=3.9)
    There is a significant lack of active conflict or pressure; the opposition is passive entropy ("dying realm"), and Elara faces no active obstacles or difficult trade-offs. She performs the ritual, it works, others join in, and it works better; at no point is the outcome in doubt, nor is there a felt cost to the protagonist for this massive magical feat. The resolution brings total gain (world saved, self healed) without sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=4.6)
    The central conflict (solitude vs. compassion) is resolved intellectually via a maxim ("staying while leaving") rather than through sustained pressure or struggle. Because Elias finds a way to satisfy both his desire for isolation and his desire to help, the stakes evaporate; he pays no price for his choice. The "war" within him is stated in the narration but not felt in the action.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is largely abstract and retrospective ("we lost the bakery slowly") rather than immediate and pressurized. The protagonist faces no external resistance or internal dilemma; her gardening and uncloaking proceed without obstacle. The stakes are conceptual—memory versus forgetting—but because the "forgetting" is presented as a fait accompli, the present-moment tension is nearly nonexistent.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.8)
    The stakes are established early and escalate clearly as the environment shifts ("pearl to amber"), forcing Elara to alter her tactics (increasing the sampling rate). The cost is palpable and permanent: the slide goes clear, and the vows are lost to the void, leaving only the "mathematics" of their passing.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.1)
    Stakes are established early, and the time constraint ("until sunrise") adds functional pressure. The conflict resolution is somewhat linear; the antagonist's paranoia is mentioned but easily circumvented by a single move (feigning drunkenness), lacking a moment of severe doubt or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.3)
    The dominant stake—humanity's survival in the biosphere—is high, but the protagonist has no agency in resolving it. Elara witnesses the convergence and the vote but does not face a difficult choice or foreclose a path through action; the "forests vote" is an external event that dictates the plot. Escalation occurs through sensory accumulation rather than causal pressure on the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are clear—commercial stagnation vs. artistic freedom—and the deepening from seeking supplies to exploring the unknown is effective. However, the ease with which the lock is bypassed via the convenient watermark lowers the tension of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=4.5)
    Escalation is stifled by the protagonist's overpowered ability; the moment deception is introduced, the leaves reveal it, and the antagonist immediately folds. There is no sustained pressure, no raising of stakes, and no felt cost to the success. The conflict resolves too cleanly to generate genuine suspense.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.8)
    Pressure is textural rather than urgent; the conflict is against abstract forces (entropy, forgetting) rather than immediate obstacles. The escalation is mechanical—the machine works as intended—resulting in low dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clearly established (survival of the dome) and the protagonist makes a difficult choice with a visible cost (burning the roses). The concept of "miniaturizing" the disaster, while thematically resonant, feels convenient as a plot device, lowering the sense of genuine peril.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.0)
    The story introduces high stakes (bulldozers, eviction) but resolves them with a soft, sentimental reset (the foreman bowing his head). This "symmetric satisfaction" fails to address the actual threat; the emotional moment stops the demolition without a credible causal mechanism, deflating the established tension.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.1)
    Pressure is low; the antagonism is passive architecture rather than active opposition. Elara proceeds through the decryption without forcing a trade-off or facing a distinct threat, resulting in a ritual rather than a conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=5.8)
    Pressure is low throughout; the environment yields to Mara without meaningful resistance (she merely "adjusted her gait"), and the divination works instantly. There is no moment of doubt, risk, or sacrifice required to retrieve the object, resulting in a lack of earned escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.5)
    The stakes are cosmic (rewriting history) but remain abstract, fighting a disembodied "noise" rather than a visceral antagonist. While the pressure escalates as the prophecy "fought back," the cost of victory is low—she retrieves the wing and the brook flows on, suggesting an easy reset rather than a permanent price paid for the magic.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict is low-stakes; Maya's goal is intellectual, and she faces no significant opposition or cost of failure before the ghost mentor resolves it for her. The solution is given rather than earned through a painful trade-off or risky choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are clear (containment failure), and the dawn acts as an effective ticking clock. The escalation works well, though the threat of the memory "metastasizing" remains somewhat abstract. The cost is paid in the destruction of the shell and the protagonist's loss of emotional shielding.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.7)
    While the abstract stakes are high (ending a war), there is no immediate, on-page pressure or antagonism to force a hard choice. The conflict remains internal and theoretical, with the protagonist moving through the task without facing a moment where failure or discovery feels like a genuine threat.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is minimal; the antagonists (Archivists) function as gatekeepers who immediately step aside and explain the plot ("You carry the resonance key"). There is no active opposition or rising pressure on the page; the stakes are high in concept but low in immediate dramatic execution.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.4)
    Conflict is low-voltage; the antagonist offers a single line of warning before surrendering to the evidence. The stakes remain abstract (historical correction) and lack immediate, visceral cost for the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is abstract (order vs. entropy) and lacks immediate dramatic pressure; the protagonist faces no active opposition or dilemma. The "escalation" involves merely noticing a tear and fixing it, which feels like low-stakes procedural work rather than a narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=4.8)
    The central conflict with the settlers is handled through exposition and summary rather than a dramatized scene with active opposition. The stakes are high in theory (survival), but the lack of on-page resistance or the risk of failure flattens the narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.8)
    The stakes are clearly defined as the nature of the coming age (clean certainty vs. gritty possibility). Escalation is driven by the storm's alignment and the radio's countdown, forcing Elian's intervention. The cost is subtle but felt—a reaffirmation of his isolation as necessary for his function.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.1)
    The conflict is primarily internal, resolved through a ritual that functions without resistance or failure on the page. While the decision to leave carries weight (the cost of his sanctuary), the lack of active obstacles during the assembly of the "symphony" lowers the immediate narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=4.9)
    The conflict is external and linear, with generic shadow entities providing physical pressure that is resolved instantly by the mechanic of the key. The climax lacks a genuine trade-off or deepening of stakes; the protagonist succeeds by activating a pre-existing mechanism rather than making a difficult sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.8)
    Escalation is theoretical rather than felt; the six-minute window and the threat of the consortium create potential tension, but the actual crossing is smooth and unchallenged. The protagonist faces no unexpected obstacles that force a reassessment of tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes are clear (truth vs. institutional silence), and the pressure escalates coherently from the body discovery to the decision to report. The cost is primarily internal/relational (the final break from the mentor), which is felt, though the external antagonist (the transit authority) remains abstract and off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes are high (justice, redemption), but the scene itself lacks immediate opposition; the repairman is a helpful ally, leaving the conflict entirely internal. The escalation is linear, moving from doubt to confirmation without a moment of significant risk or cost in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.1)
    Pressure escalates cleanly from mechanical grinding to text to consciousness, driven by the algorithm's hunger. The cost is legible in the destruction of the kaleidoscope and the sacrifice of the arrow tip, fulfilling the "impossible" demand with physical consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=4.4)
    The antagonist (the Director) presents almost no resistance, appearing only to be instantly defeated in a single sentence ("attempted to terminate... but Elara had already"). The lack of escalation or felt cost makes the victory feel unearned and devoid of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.0)
    High initial stakes (genocide vs. ecocide) are established but effectively deflated by a resolution that refuses the sacrifice, rendering the conflict theoretical rather than visceral. The escalation comes from procedural action (moving mirrors) rather than rising pressure, and the absence of a "felt cost" limits the impact of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are existential and clear; the contrast between the mass casualty event and the scheduled clinic appointment generates sustained tension. The climax (finding the shoe) effectively reweights the dominant stake (control over death) without resolving into a tidy happy ending.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes remain low and purely internal; the conflict is resolved by applying a comforting metaphor rather than facing a difficult trade-off. The narrative lacks a sharp escalation or a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.5)
    Pressure is present via the contracting clearing and the "hungry" desert, but the conflict remains external and abstract. The protagonist's success feels inevitable, lacking a moment of genuine doubt or a choice that demands a personalized sacrifice beyond mere procedural effort.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the protagonist faces no opposition, failure risk, or difficult trade-offs. The narrative progression is linear (setup, execution, success) without escalation or a moment where the outcome is in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict remains abstract and philosophical (preservation vs. evolution) without immediate external pressure or active antagonism to force the protagonist's hand. The stakes are intellectual, lacking a visceral, on-page cost beyond the conceptual acceptance of the new order.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.0)
    The antagonist is the "tidal longing" and the forgetting itself, creating a coherent, high-pressure race against entropy. The cost is palpable and tragic: the loss of meaning despite the successful physical capture of the sound. The escalation is internal but visually dramatized by the frantic writing.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes are high (survival/transcendence), and the pressure escalates coherently through the shaking observatory and spinning clock. However, the conflict is resolved somewhat conveniently by the "magic" of the leaf sound, which deflates the tension of the physical threat by bypassing it rather than confronting it directly.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.0)
    The initial tension is high (Maya holding a shard as a weapon), but it is diffused almost immediately when Elena takes it "not asking permission," with no resistance from Maya. This bypasses the potential for genuine conflict or negotiation. The stakes of the estranged relationship are declared but resolved via the "hymning" and the scent, creating a smooth de-escalation that lacks the friction required for high-stakes drama.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central conflict is man-against-reality, but the escalation is linear and relatively low-pressure. Elara performs the ritual with competence; while the atmosphere thickens, she faces no active antagonism or acute moment of potential failure, making the victory feel inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stakes are high—a child's life and a worldview—but the external conflict is relatively low as the changeling is compliant. The resolution feels slightly smooth, lacking a moment where the protagonist's new belief is tested by genuine resistance or risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.4)
    Escalation is mild; the stakes are high in concept (redemption/exile) but low in the immediate scene, as success feels inevitable once the process begins. The narrative lacks a moment where the external pressure or internal temptation forces a trade-off, resulting in a smooth glide to resolution rather than a hard-won victory.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are clearly established as a conflict between public shame and private healing, with the "accelerated thaw" providing subtle situational pressure. The sacrifice of the sister’s pendant provides a visible, felt cost that elevates the resolution beyond mere contemplation, though the external antagonist (the internet) remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are clear and elevated (artistic purpose vs. finality), and the cost of isolation is paid. However, the opposition—represented by a "publisher" and "tidy resolution"—feels low-pressure and generic against the supernatural backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is abstract (entropy/forgetting) and lacks on-page resistance; the ritual proceeds smoothly without failure points or trade-offs. The stakes are declared rather than tested, leading to a lack of genuine narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes are high conceptually but low in immediate narrative tension; the ritual proceeds without resistance, error, or external antagonism. The "tightening" is purely procedural rather than a narrowing of options or a forcing of difficult trade-offs, resulting in a low-pressure climactic beat.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=4.5)
    Tension is nearly absent; Elias faces no opposition, time crunch, or risk of failure. The stakes ("cavern becomes a hole") remain abstract, and the resolution is earned solely through unchallenged competence rather than struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=4.2)
    Escalation is absent; the task proceeds with practiced ease, and potential threats (guttering lamp, coming dawn) are dismissed without forcing a trade-off or imposing a felt cost. The stake of "dissolving into chaos" remains theoretical and is not tested by the scene's action.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.9)
    The stakes remain low and purely internal, with the "screaming" kettle providing the only tangible pressure. The narrative lacks a meaningful tightening or deepening of the conflict; the protagonist begins and ends in a similar state of reflective wisdom without facing a new, difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.2)
    The negotiation provides a distinct pressure point that escalates effectively when the safe currency (overheard stories) is rejected. The final cost—surrendering personal history for continuity—is felt and changes the character’s ontological status.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is virtually absent as the environment yields to Maya's efforts without resistance; the machinery is "dormant" rather than recalcitrant. There is no escalation of pressure, only a progression of tasks, rendering the stakes theoretical rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.2)
    The stakes are legible but low-tension, as the external environment ("glacial hush") is described as weighty but offers no actual resistance to the protagonist's goal. The conflict is entirely internal and retrospective, resolved without a moment of acute doubt or a cost paid in the present tense.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.2)
    The stakes are internal and retrospective; there is little active opposition or pressure on the page. Mara faces no significant obstacles or difficult choices during the scene; the solution presents itself through realization rather than struggle or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story struggles with conflict and stakes; the pressure is atmospheric rather than antagonistic or internal. The "tightening" comes from the fog and the glass warming, but Elias faces no genuine risk of failure or meaningful trade-off. The cost of success is minimal (stiff joints), making the victory feel technically complete but emotionally muted.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.6)
    The stakes of emotional survival are clear, and the pressure escalates subtly through the environmental shifts (wind, flickering projection). The resolution is an earned internal reconfiguration, though the cost is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.1)
    Stakes are clear (extinction vs. life), but the escalation lacks active opposition or interpersonal pressure, relying on a linear progression of events. The cost is repeatedly stated as "bitterly sweet" rather than dramatized through difficult trade-offs or sacrifices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=4.4)
    Narrative pressure is low; the ritual proceeds linearly without obstacle, error, or external opposition. The "cost" of releasing the black sand is purely symbolic and does not alter Maya's future options or tactics in a tangible way. The stakes are stated ("teach her body to sing") but never threatened by a possibility of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.1)
    Conflict remains abstract and external; the pressure comes solely from the departing geese, which feels contrived rather than organically urgent. The protagonist faces no genuine opposition or dilemma that forces a trade-off, making the success feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are clear (illumination vs. extinction), but the pressure remains largely thematic. The "sentinel" cycle provides context, yet the immediate obstacle is simply walking and placing the gear; there is little active opposition or escalation of difficulty. Elara’s success comes from her nature rather than a desperate adaptation to rising stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain abstract and philosophical ("discover the shape of collective grief") with no immediate threat or opposition to force a hard choice. The conflict is internal but static; Elias faces no external obstacles or genuine risk of failure. The resolution comes via instruction, not a costly decision that forecloses other options.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.7)
    While the stakes (town chaos) are declared, the on-page pressure is low; the machine submits to Elias's adjustment with a "sigh" of relief, removing the potential for failure. The conflict is retrospective rather than active; Elias battles a memory rather than a resisting force in the present. The climax feels procedural—a competent man doing his job—rather than a test of agency with a possibility of loss.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is no palpable pressure or cost; Mara faces no antagonist, time constraint (the "chess clock" is metaphor), or risk of failure. She enters the silo, finds the answer immediately, and accepts it without having to renounce a belief or sacrifice a desire. The stakes remain abstract ("mystery") and are resolved with total safety.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.4)
    While the global stakes are high (civilization's future), the scene-level stakes are low as Elara faces no active opposition or risk of failure on the page. The conflict remains theoretical, missing a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt or a trade-off is forced.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.0)
    Pressure is static (the silence) rather than active, and Elias encounters no significant opposition or failure that forces a hard trade-off. The escalation is linear—he discovers, he acts, he succeeds—resulting in a process narrative that lacks the tension of high stakes or the threat of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are clearly internalized but externalized effectively through the slowing chair, creating a "ticking clock" that forces the protagonist to act. The pressure escalates naturally, and the cost is felt in the dissipation of his "mirage of safety," acknowledging that the emotion he sought to capture is gone.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.8)
    The conflict between objective precision and the surface world's protective mythology is clearly staked and escalates effectively through the catalyst of the cog. The choice to preserve the mechanism forecloses the path of social integration, carrying a felt cost of isolation and existential burden.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.8)
    The stakes are high in concept (peace vs. war) but low in execution; the conflict is resolved on the first attempt with only minor hesitation. The "enemies" sit and play together without any visceral on-page resistance or friction, reducing the "unlearning of hatred" to a smooth, symbolic gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.4)
    The stakes are high in theory (oppressive regime), but the on-page conflict is low-pressure; obstacles are removed via internal monologue and "sheer will" rather than active struggle. The "encroaching wasteland" acts as background wallpaper rather than an active antagonist forcing difficult trade-offs. The climax lacks a moment of doubt or danger, proceeding smoothly to success.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.2)
    Conflict is minimal; the Corporation's threat remains abstract, and the engineer asks for permission rather than challenging Elias, leading to a low-pressure exchange. The protagonist's compulsion resolves the central tension instantly, removing the cost and weight of a deliberate decision.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are low and abstract; there is no antagonist, time pressure, or risk of failure to generate tension. The escalation is merely spatial (moving closer to the house) rather than narrative; the protagonist faces no resistance from the environment or her own limitations.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.7)
    The internal stakes are high, but the external pressure is static; Corvin faces no active opposition from the environment, only the passive weight of history. The escalation is philosophical rather than dramatic, lacking a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are clear and escalate from mere endurance to a high-risk gamble with the fabric of reality. The tension tightens effectively as Elara trades the safety of the loop for the dangerous potential of the "rupture." The cost—facing the regret she fled—is felt in the final retrieval.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no active opposition or internal resistance, as the visions come "unbidden" and she paints them without struggle. The stakes—preserving memory—remain abstract and theoretical, lacking immediate consequence or risk of failure in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the existential stakes are high (erasure/death), the interpersonal conflict is weak; the elders' "resistance" dissolves instantly after a single speech from Elara, lacking dramatic friction or a test of her agency. The tension is largely atmospheric rather than causal. The climax feels inevitable rather than fought for, as the collective agreement happens without a meaningful counter-move.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes are high (life vs. death), but the escalation is linear; Elara executes a plan that works exactly as theorized without a moment of near-failure or deepened complication. The cost is abstract—shedding "biological determinism"—rather than a visceral price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are clearly defined and escalate effectively as the "lingering luminance" and the clasp's heat press Mara toward the breaking point. The cost of resolution is high—admitting to matricide and suicidal intent—which grounds the supernatural conflict in a heavy psychological reality.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes are declared as survival but play out as aesthetic performance; the protagonist dominates the antagonist (the storm) so thoroughly that tension evaporates. Without a moment where the "instrument" fights back or the prophet falters, the escalation feels theoretical rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.8)
    The stakes are high and clear—stagnation versus terrifying knowledge. The escalation from mapping to active interrogation provides good pressure. The cost—the loss of sanctuary and the "dread of absolute knowing"—is felt, though the external antagonism of the watchers remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are clear (truth vs. myth), but the conflict is resolved internally with a compromise that feels safe rather than costly. The editor's text introduces necessary urgency, but the protagonist's solution—to "have it both ways" by publishing with nuance—undercuts the potential for a harder, more sacrificial choice.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes are purely internal and abstract ("wrest the truth"); there is no immediate external pressure or cost forcing a difficult trade-off. The conflict is ambient rather than active.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes remain abstract and professional; there is no immediate threat or personal cost to failure beyond "months of meticulous verification." The conflict is intellectual and resolves without the protagonist having to sacrifice anything significant or face a "or-else" consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=5.5)
    Tension is low because the outcome feels preordained; there is no active opposition or risk of failure. The stakes are high (existence), but without a moment where the protagonist must choose between competing values, the pressure remains static.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.7)
    Tension is maintained and escalated expertly through the cooling circuit breakers, creating a tangible countdown. The cost is palpable—Amara trades safety for a desperate hunt—and the pressure forces a decisive closure.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.7)
    Conflict is primarily man-against-mechanism, lacking interpersonal or internal friction. The stakes are abstract (a feeling of belonging) and the obstacles (a heavy lever, star alignment) are overcome with physical effort rather than ingenuity or loss. The tension remains flat because failure never feels like a genuine possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes are clearly established and high, centering on the moral weight of a stolen life. The pressure builds effectively through the physical sifting of the carvings, leading to a meaningful internal deepening, though the external conflict is static.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.3)
    Tension is palpable and effectively braided with the environmental pressure. While the northern delegate's hesitation provides a necessary beat of resistance, the resolution feels slightly smooth; the cost is paid (the drawer pull), but the struggle to overcome the grievance is brief.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.9)
    The internal stakes are clear, but the external pressure is minimal; the journey is physically smooth, placing the entire burden on internal reflection. While the renunciation of the compass is a visible cost, the conflict feels somewhat static until the final arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=4.5)
    The central stakes (regaining feeling) are undermined by the narrative contradiction that she already feels guilt and desire effectively enough to drive the plot. The escalation relies on summarized failures rather than on-page struggle, and the resolution comes without a paid cost.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—connection versus identity—is established early and escalated through the ritual's physical toll. The cost is not just stated but enacted on the page as she becomes a "permanent fixture." The tension tightens appropriately during the transformation, though the moment of acceptance feels slightly rushed.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    The stakes are deeply personal yet elevated by the magical context; the pressure of the "suffocating sky" externalizes the internal struggle effectively. The escalation moves from intellectual perplexity to physical sacrifice (the blood, the unfastening), narrowing her options to a single, transformative choice.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.9)
    While the sacrifice of the photographs provides a legible on-page cost, the escalation creates little narrative friction; the protagonist faces no active opposition or risk of failure during the ritual. The outcome feels inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.0)
    While the stakes are technically high (death, island fertility), the narrative lacks genuine conflict as the environment invites rather than opposes the protagonist. There is no tension or resistance; Elias simply executes a pre-decided ritual, removing the possibility of a "meaningful tightening" of options.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.0)
    Escalation is minimal; the protagonist proceeds through her task without facing active opposition, time pressure that forces a trade-off, or the risk of failure. The stakes are declared but never tested on the page through a moment of near-miss or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.0)
    While the ultimate stake is high (dissolution of consciousness), the on-page pressure is dampened by the protagonist's serene acceptance of his fate; the lack of active opposition or internal doubt makes the climax feel like the execution of a procedure rather than a high-stakes conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.3)
    Conflict is largely intellectual and retrospective; the external threat of the censors is distant, leaving the on-page tension low. The struggle is resolved through epiphany and endurance rather than active confrontation or immediate risk.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes remain intellectual and abstract; the "diplomatically fierce" combat reads as performative dance rather than a high-pressure conflict. The resolution arrives without a tangible price paid by the protagonist—victory is achieved through cleverness alone, with no loss or hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are clearly defined by the impending loss of self and the risk of the exchange. The pressure is primarily situational and internal (the clock of the molt) rather than active external opposition, resulting in a quieter conflict that lacks high-pressure decision points on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.0)
    The external pressure of the storm provides functional stakes, but the protagonist's path to victory is relatively smooth, lacking a moment where her plan nearly fails or requires a significant new sacrifice. The resolution feels inevitable once the music starts, missing a sharper edge of "felt cost" or desperate trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes are established early, but the escalation is linear; the protagonist meets the external threat (monsoon) with a prepared ritual rather than a desperate improvisation. The "evolution" of the memory is achieved through song rather than a difficult trade-off, lowering the felt cost of the victory.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is low-voltage; Mara faces no active obstacles, difficult trade-offs, or moments of potential failure, simply following the compass to a predetermined epiphany. The "severance" provides backstory tension, but the present-time action lacks a "meaningful tightening" or visible cost, rendering the stakes theoretical rather than felt.

    Dominant stake (trick fear via unbosoming) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through advisor's whispers and luminance flare, forcing agency in confession that forecloses denial with cost of "raw honesty of her self-betrayal." Pattern break reweights soul-consumption threat.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (transform storm threat) signaled early, escalates via density increase under Accumulative lens: strikes layer to visible harmonics, narrowing to dubbing climax that reconfigures enemy to collaborator. Agency in persistent playing forecloses disintegration path; cost felt in "restless" spirit and orchard's fragility.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (question watchers via patterns) signaled early tightens through whistle tones matching Fibonacci, forcing sky-crack reversal that reconfigures knowledge with cost (transcendence, city lurching forward). Agency in shell arrangement and sequences drives escalation under Accumulative lens. Moral calculus peaks in map-or-become choice, foreclosing stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.7)
    Editor's buzz deepens stake, forcing stance crystallization between myth and nuanced truth; textural cadence shift reweights with unflinching responsibility cost.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (trace origins) signaled early escalates accumulatively via hypothesis testing and pressure shift to platform discovery, narrowing singular narrative option; agency in deliberate search yields catalog readjustment cost under lens.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.1)
    Grief-transformation stake signaled early deepens accumulatively through successive crane folds; agency in release forecloses corporeal self with translucent hands as visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (find reservoir) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via resolving equations narrowing to valley coords; agency in geode/console fusion forces trade-off with ticking breakers, cost felt in trembling fingers and final hum.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake of decoding belonging tightens via star-trail calibration and lever pull, narrowing to insertion with physical strain as cost; Accumulative escalation via intensifying frequencies reweights internal options; subtle agency but legible price in "desperate insistence."

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (life's unlived weight) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via final carving find narrowing to witness-role crystallization; cost felt in "tempered regret settling into his bones," charging poise.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (prisoner release amid suspicion) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via signal halt and key unlock foreclosing betrayal path. Agency in "raised the antique drawer pull" and speech forces stance crystallization. Cost felt in scout's tremble and delegates' glances; minor abstractness in "phase of restoration" slightly mutes visceral price.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (align heart/action via poles) deepens accumulatively through surf breakers and cliff-face paddle, narrowing to terrestrial acceptance; cost felt in "penance" of forgoing stars, agency in endurance to cove.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake of kindling empathy tightens accumulatively through failed choices crushing her lungs with guilt, forcing surrender at the lake where tendrils impose visible emotional cost, driven by her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (reforge bond) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via scent threads and skin luminescing, forcing trade-off in reluctant pouring; cost unmistakable in permanent fixture revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake tightens accumulatively from retrieval to sanctification, driven by card's instruction; cost unmistakable in foreclosed resentment and binding to time's river.

    Shadow integration stake deepens via acceptance/body lightening, forcing stitching agency with piercing cost legible in membrane wound.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (fulfill promise via patterns) signaled early, escalates accumulatively as curse reveals cost ("understanding them would scatter his consciousness"); agency in stepping into field forecloses path with on-page price. One deepening via alignment suffices under lens; cost unmistakable at dispersal.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (transform silence into testimony) deepens accumulatively via timer chimes and negative reveal, narrowing to agency in sealing envelope; felt cost in hand cramp and inheritance charges ending, but abstract censorship mutes visceral immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (decode overture) signaled early; causal tightening via duel torque forcing sundial alignment forecloses opposition. Silas lunge narrows options; cost in physical press and breath. Entry gate met but minor abstractness in philosophy.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (deliver seeds for resistance rebuild) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via tin slide and molt confession narrowing recognition option. Agency in lingering fingers on catch; cost felt in impending forgetting and guard risk at closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant refuge stake signaled early tightens accumulatively through film discovery narrowing options; desperate synchronization endurance bears precision cost on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (protect memory pre-monsoon) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via dream doubt and song modulating roots. Agency in pollen-induced dreaming forecloses certainty path with embodied cost. Monsoon pressure forces evolution realization, cost unmistakable in swaying tree under storm.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)

== Grader: Kimi K2-0905 ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.8)
    Central stake—how to relate to change once violence is gone—tightens when dust patterns offer a quieter but inexorable record of collapse. One meaningful deepening: realizing grandeur lives in miniature forecloses her prior high-energy cosmology; price is felt in the slow retraining of breath and abandonment of pulsar language. No redundancy or off-stage resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—whether she can reinterpret the ledger and her own survival—tightens once when frost divulges the route, and again when journals reveal filial love. Protagonist agency drives both turns: she chooses to kneel, to read frost, to enter cave, to lift charcoal. Cost is visible: she accepts the slower, eastward return, trading blazing luminosity for “steady adaptability.” Under causal lens, escalation is lean but sufficient; no external antagonist needed. The only bar to 9.0 is that the suicide backstory is recounted, not re-lived, so the emotional price is slightly blunted.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaim music after deafness—tightens through each fork-strike that forecloses the old auditory path and deepens the thermal one. One meaningful escalation: teal envy shifts to tangerine thaw, visually confirming the risk is working. Cost is legible in the final white-gold flare that burns the last bridge to her former sensory life. No external antagonist needed; internal pressure suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—deliver permanent rest—signals on page one and tightens when Marian realizes graves can be “unmade by erosion.” Escalation is textural: the tide retreats farther than physics allows; books float like fish; dead whisper coordinates that shift. The protagonist’s agency is renunciation: she yields terrestrial burial to occupy impossible logic, paying with lifelong exile as librarian. Cost is legible in the lens’s dissolution and her unending vigil; coincidence never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—keep community alive under sanctions—tightens when the child’s offer forces Maya to choose between operational security and intergenerational continuity. One meaningful turn: the declaration that redefines givers/recipients, foreclosing anonymity forever. Cost is legible (loss of protective secrecy), though sanctions themselves stay static rather than worsening within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—liberate calcified love—signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation is textural: each breath adds sensory density until the bridge exhales, foreclosing the option to remain mere observer. Cost is legible: Maya forfeits her documentary stance and prior self. No reversal, but the single deepening suffices under Accumulative lens; coincidence merely reveals, never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake: map/merge with the texture of time. Escalation is density-driven: each botanical memory layer increases the retrocognitive load until disintegration is the only expansion left. The tightening beat—touching the halo—simultaneously floods him with all temporal layers and forecloses retreat. Cost is visible: “his body began to disintegrate…atoms distributing along the hyperbolic plane.”

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve seed vault—signals in paragraph 2 and tightens when metallic scrape alerts scavengers. One meaningful escalation: decoding the arrow opens the vault but also betrays her location, trading secrecy for access. Cost is visible: she sacrifices her freedom a second time by descending into darkness while the chain stays above. Pressure coheres under causal lens; no coincidence resolves the standoff.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“find the sound of trust breaking”—is declared early; each collected silence tightens the pattern, narrowing to the sepia betrayal of the child patient. No external reversals needed; deepening suffices under Accumulative lens. Cost legible: marrow division, forge cooling, final exhale.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“collect illuminated moments”—is signaled early; pressure escalates via floral countdown (jasmine = 3 min) that forces silent efficiency, then deepens when moonbeam jar and canvas recognize each other, narrowing future options to perpetual waiting; visible price is the unclosed vigil, destiny’s knock still pending.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—creating transparent shelters before the melt renders transit impossible—surfaces early and tightens once: the ice bridges grow treacherous, forcing tomorrow’s exit. Agency is interior and ceremonial; renunciation (leaving the spheres) carries on-page cost under the Accumulative lens. No external antagonist is needed; pressure is situational and temporal. The single meaningful deepening satisfies the length default, though the absence of a second tightening keeps the score just below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—identity theft vs. engineered fearlessness—tightens once: decoding the cast turns passive victim into active accuser. Escalation is causal and visible: each tremor clarifies coordinates, narrowing options from flight to confrontation. Cost legible in father’s panic cling and Kai’s retained trembling. No coincidence; agency drives turn.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—complete the map before total darkness—tightens once when the last star winks out and the booklet gutters to fiber; options narrow to internalization or failure. Pressure is coherent under the textural lens; cost is the oracle’s surrender of external record and voice. No reversal, but the deepening is decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—“understand why it failed”—is declared early; pressure escalates via pattern accretion rather than causal turns. The tightening arrives when Seven chooses to play instead of sweep; the cost is the violin’s dissolution and the eternal return to sweeping, a credible foreclosed path under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: will complicity calcify or crack? Pressure escalates when decoding reveals Julian’s fear, not malice, forcing Mara to test her own cover-up. The meaningful tightening is the ticket exchange: mutual surveillance turned inward, options narrowed to tomorrow’s confession. Cost is legible—shared social/professional jeopardy—though the board’s power remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single dominant stake—proving the garden’s consciousness—tightens through each marble offering; the final dual-state image forces irreversible acceptance with felt cost. Agency is present in every lie/repair cycle. One meaningful deepening suffices; no false escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—prove sideways time—signalled on first page and tightened when he overrides safety protocols; the holographic timestamps visibly foreclose doubt, paying the price of professional ridicule. Escalation is single but meaningful: lever-pull intensifies pressure from theory to irreversible evidence. No external antagonist needed; institutional scorn suffices. Cost is legible in the sudden auricular density and the smile that accepts future chaos.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—break the 1923 silent loop or remain its archivist—is signaled in the first paragraph and tightens when each water-stain becomes an unplayable note she must choose to voice. Agency is absolute: she positions lanterns, draws bow, relinquishes artifact; no coincidence resolves the chord. Cost is visible on-page: “the antique program grew damp in her hands” and finally dissolves, trading archival permanence for acoustic exorcism. One meaningful deepening—spiral staves becoming real-time instructions—suffices to reweight options.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—integrity of data vs self-protection—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when the wrong edelweiss migrates from margin to center. One decisive intensification: smudging the stem makes concealment impossible, narrows her options to complicity or exposure, and forces the public correction. Cost is the loss of her fault-tolerant alibi; price is legible in the ghost-blurred stem and taped admission. Pressure stays accumulative/textural—no causal antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“find the weight of that swallowed truth”—is signaled early and tightens once: the wheel’s sixteen colors force her to reprice heroism vs murder. No reversals are needed; the single deepening is sufficient under Accumulative lens. Cost is felt in the sternum-stone image and the camera click that archives rather than absolves. Agency is observational, but the narrowing of her moral certainty is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stake—witness without judgment—is declared early and reiterated, but pressure is ambient, not tightening. No beat narrows her option to interpret or flee; the swan merely reveals what she already accepts. Silence deepens as texture, yet no trade-off or reversible choice is forced. Meets single-intensification rule for lyric mode but lacks visible price that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—break silence without breaking child—signaled early. Tightening occurs when eclipse darkness drops temperature and sage leans, forcing the whistle note; live option of retreat remains open until boy hums. Cost visible: Elara’s withheld tears and controlled strum show she pays in suppressed exuberance to protect fragile gain. Agency shared: her steady presence invites, his breath chooses.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“collect stories before silence petrifies”—is signaled early and tightens once: the tapestry fragment proves the axis is storiable, forcing Elara to decide whether to voice or archive. Cost is felt (dye-stained fingers, tears on dragon wing) but not yet paid in irrevocable loss; escalation is accumulative density, not causal narrowing. Sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—Elias’s unconscious control over other fates—tightens when the retiring spy’s knock proves the pattern is recognized; his option to remain oblivious is foreclosed. Pressure accumulates rather than spikes: each inserted microdot increases the unseen network’s dependence on him, visible only at the stranger’s laugh. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral: he must accept that his “accidental” art was always weaponized. One beat short of 8.8 because the price is declared (“he had orchestrated his own escape”) rather than felt in a concrete loss on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—prevent possession of dimensional anchor—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened once: the rhetorical siege that forces the entity to retreat. Escalation is cumulative/textural—loops accrue density until the palindrome crystallizes, reweighting silence from decoration to foundation. Cost is conceptual but legible: stillness is forever stripped of innocence. No reversal is needed; single deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single dominant stake—transcribe the unheard—tightens through sensory escalation: each new creak, color refraction, or shell chamber raises the cost of failure (silence forever). The protagonist’s agency is attention itself; by choosing to map memory onto ice he narrows escape routes until the only option left is to stand and conduct, forfeiting ordinary forward time.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—merge splintered selves or stay eternally fractured—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: ghost-images reach out, then collapse; brightness paradox intensifies. The procedural staircase tightens options—she can’t see the next step—yet the cost is conceptual (fear of void) rather than embodied injury or irretrievable loss. Sufficient for short-form, but the tightening would cut deeper if one misstep bloodied her or erased a beloved memory on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—defeat emotional numbness—is signaled in paragraph one. Pressure escalates by density: each backward rotation adds tactile syllables until the filament of hush becomes unbearably alive under her palms. The reversal is not a new external threat but a deepening that reweights silence from void to plenum. Cost is visible: tears she had withheld since her mother’s funeral finally fall, proving the trade-off is felt, not abstract.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges without statement: silence as generative membrane, not deficit. The mirrored hush Motif reconfigures from tomb to womb in the final image, recharging the opening “gloves made of stone.” Subtext resides in gesture—touching the needle is secular communion. No moralizing, only charged poise: the heart remembers how to ache, and that ache is the price of re-entry into life.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: keep observation uncorrupted. Tightening beat: pigeon message proves surveillance is least of threats—quarantine itself is failing. She chooses complicity-in-recording, foreclosing innocence; price is future exposure. Agency clear, escalation once, no reversal overload.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“why scent triggers inherited grief”—tightens once: discovery of wife-sealed vial under extinct fern escalates pressure from avoidance to confrontation. The UV-bloom reaction is coincidence that complicates, not resolves; Elias’s agency is the deliberate inhale that narrows options (no longer cautious, tears released). Cost is legible: 17 years of guarded breath end with open lungs and empty vial. One meaningful cadence shift satisfies length; could use slightly sharper external risk to reach 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“texture of time vs irrevocable forfeiture of either past or future”—is signaled early and tightens when touching the backward/forward chambers. The single deepening comes when he refuses to choose and instead lays the rope in spirals, foreclosing both exits; price is the permanent ambiguity whispering against his lap. Cost is visible and charges the final image under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—liberating sound from imposed silence—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens through the single escalating cadence: bowl hum → hull chorus → hush repriced. Agency is continuous; each bow stroke narrows the remaining silence. Cost is legible—salt-bleached wood consumed, heat surrendered—but the price does not boomerang back to limit tomorrow’s resources, keeping the score just shy of the 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—Kael’s secret wish to fuse insight with empathy—emerges early; pressure tightens when the grotto over-delivers, forcing recognition that half-truths may ossify into irreversible truth. One meaningful deepening: counterfeit empathy subsumes fear, then mutates into genuine wonder, foreclosing Kael’s comfortable detachment. Cost is legible in the client’s irreversible amber-tears and Kael’s shaken “uncertainty colored the words.”

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—redirect profit toward invisible labor—tightens once when Elias converts his “five percent contingency” into an endowment; the reversal is small but visible and narrows his future options, satisfying single-scene escalation under a causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—“graft oneself onto community”—tightens through each tag discovery; the final bridge is a visible forfeiture of self-sufficient solitude. Pressure escalates by pattern accumulation: each silver glyph adds another strand of spider-silk kinship until the web can span the crater. Cost is unmistakable when Kael offers the reeds they once hoarded for empty shelters.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—capture the birthplace of echoes before the nap ends—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens geometrically as stolen minutes accrue compound interest. Escalation occurs through density, not reversals: each paddle stroke doubles the temporal debt, visualized as standing glass-like waves; the cage of “frozen moments” raises the last obstacle. Protagonist agency is present—she sculpts the bridge, twists the pendant—but the final payment is automatic rather than a conscious trade-off, blunting the peak cost.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—convert ambiguous loss into soluble equation—signaled early. Single meaningful tightening: the drop creates a fresh crack that invalidates the prior “solution,” forcing acceptance of unquantifiable love. Pressure accumulates via refracted patterns; no causal reversals needed under Accumulative lens. Cost visible in the slowed breath and velvet pouch—he abandons tonight’s calculation. Sufficient for band; persistent constraint (damaged mosaic) shapes final poise.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—make the invisible audible—tightens as dawn approaches and power stabilizes, narrowing her window. One meaningful deepening: shift from solitary remembrance to public gift-giving. Cost is conceptual (perpetual invisibility) rather than visceral; because lens is accumulative, that suffices, but price is abstract not bodily. Escalation is cadence-driven, not causal reversal; still legible under chosen lens.</answer>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade>
    <comment>Theme emerges through concrete recurrence of magnetic breath/voice fragments; no final-paragraph sermon. The idea that archives can outlive archivists is re-weighted in last image—her “evidence” hums in walls—achieving Conceptual Repricing without overt statement. Subtext of undocumented caretaker labor stays implicit, resisting tidy moral. Minor softness: “network of sustenance” edges toward abstraction, but image still lands.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—her drive to catalog versus the need to surrender—tightens once when the leaf’s battered yet living veins contradict her nanosecond timetables. The meaningful turn is micro but decisive: she forgoes rebuilding with steel, chooses open trellises; storm season remains as persistent price that will test the new stance. Cost is legible on-page: 15 years of data now obsolete.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—thresh meaning before the tide erases it—is declared early and tightened by the sinkhole’s exposure clock. Escalation is modest but sufficient: amber (fossilized memory) traded for journals (human memory) narrows her options from hoarding to sharing witness. Cost is legible: she forfeits three months’ kelp and the brooch’s talismanic comfort. No reversal, yet the final sketch crystallizes a new tactic—creation instead of collection—fulfilling the stake under Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—control vs. surrender of prescience—tightens when static foresight collapses into live improvisation. The pearl’s spin and shadow convergence force the irreversible trade: certainty for wonder. Cost is visible: Elara’s “liberated” smile carries the ache of relinquished mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—resurrect exile memory—declared early. Pressure accretes via visionary density, but Kael faces no narrowing choice; he merely witnesses and distributes. Escalation is lyrical, not tactical; the widow’s relief is collateral, not paid by him. No visible price alters his next move; options remain open.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“find the fortress of unspoken truths” to recover her sister’s silence—is signaled early and reiterated through tactile beats (photographing cracks, aligning boot to fracture). Escalation is textural: density of omens increases until the punch’s bite crystallizes the crossing. Agency is present—she chooses to stamp the blank ticket—yet the price is conceptual (blue glow, archive vista) rather than a foreclosed option or bodily cost, so pressure feels numinous but not punishing. Sufficient for one meaningful tightening under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—her need to remain intellectually safe versus the tower’s demand for emotional surrender—tightens the moment the tile hums against her palm. One meaningful escalation: the visions force a decision—transcribe or retreat; she pays with an all-night sprint that leaves her “consumed.” The cost persists: the tile now permanently reframes the tower’s acoustics, foreclosing her former neutrality. Agency is hers; coincidence merely ornaments.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“discover what happens after goodbye”—is signaled early and deepens through pattern accumulation rather than tightening reversals. No live option is foreclosed mid-scene; pressure escalates via imagery density (walls refract → corridors fold → amulet shatters) culminating in conceptual reprice. Agency is present—he times his step—but the storm, not choice, drives shear intensity. Cost is conceptual (loss of compass, of old grief) rather than tactical; sufficient for Accumulative lens but shy of 8.8 threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“mathematics of a fair trade”—tightens when the 2:17 timing error forces the final breach; option set narrows to complicity or abandonment. Cost is her moral absolutism liquefied along with the judge’s. One meaningful escalation beat suffices; coincidence (guard early) complicates rather than rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserving human texture against encroaching void—signaled in paragraph one. One meaningful deepening: lamp’s dip to a lower register accelerates his work while preserving incandescent restraint, narrowing options live on page. Cost legible in “history leaking faster than he could gild,” visible in final extra leaf application. No reversal required under textural lens; density intensification suffices. Could edge higher if external stakes (the silent town) pressed physically into the workshop.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—can erased identity be re-felt through others’ stories—tightens when the archivist realizes they must become the aggregate texture rather than recover a name. One meaningful deepening: the poison label shifts from archive relic to dermal graft, signaling that embodiment is the only closure available. Agency is present in the decision to keep collecting despite the void, but no live option is foreclosed; the cost is conceptual, not tactical. Sufficient for 600-word lyric frame.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve communal soul before privatization—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens through the graffiti gambit: each new tag forecloses passivity. Maya’s agency drives escalation: she scores the pivotal map-glyph that turns random performers into insurgent cells. Cost is legible—she commits to permanent double agency, forever “adjusting her translator’s badge.” A hair more external push (one corporate drone noticing paint wetness) could have sharpened jeopardy, but pressure stays coherent under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—preserve the last pure record—tightens when sunlight arrives and crawlers wake; outlasting the night forecloses retreat with hypothermic cost. Escalation is accumulative: shadow pattern → chemical bloom → mechanical drills; each layer adds irreversible density. Protagonist agency drives every turn; coincidence absent. Cost visible in frozen breath and surrendered summit.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—prevent another reef wreck—signals early and tightens with each horn blast. Middle choice to trust the water-tone north-pulse forfeits fallback time, visible cost on page. Escalation is causal: broken relay → water test → patched wing → launch, each step shrinking margin. No coincidence rescue; pressure stays coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—complete the survey before the thaw—is signaled early and tightens once: empty talons → final walk to vent. The single meaningful turn (condensation spiral confirms coordinates) forecloses failure and carries the visible cost of irreversibly publishing the correction. Agency is legible under causal lens; no escalation dip.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—restore reciprocity between city and land—is signaled in paragraph two and deepens as each footfall either accepts or repeats the original greed. Escalation is textural: dissonance detected at the keystone intensifies the cadence, forcing a quicker, more complex meter that risks final collapse. The tightening is single but meaningful; the price is the irreversible years already walked, felt rather than declared.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—surface alive vs. preserve lost memories—tightens when the gauge drops below ten minutes and again when she must exhale to trigger the exit. Surrender is an irreversible trade-off that forecloses ascent on her own terms. Pressure stays coherent under causal lens; no coin-flip rescue. Cost is on-page (silver stream, dissolved vial) and persistent (rewritten neurons).

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—evade discovery before the bodies are found—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened by the iterative countdown. The final image narrows options to eternal fugitive silence, paying a felt price: he forfeits name, village, and father’s legacy. Agency is narrative rather than physical, fitting the Accumulative lens; convincing air to hold him is the earned reversal. Pressure stays coherent, but because discovery is off-stage threat rather than active pursuit, the peak cost is conceptual, not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—lifelong karmic debt—tightens once: bead pressed into palm forces Julian’s complicity. No secondary reversal, but the single deepening is meaningful and visible (orchard withers, ghost dissolves). Cost is legible on-page; could edge higher with sharper pre-burial resistance from Julian.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—save the canyon from forgetting itself—signals early and tightens through each night’s added stitches; the meaningful deepening is the shift from covert repair to binding the bridge-image into bedrock, foreclosing any return to elder law. Agency is continuous (she pierces, bleeds, decides), and the price is her outlaw status and blood. No external antagonist is needed; internal and environmental pressures suffice. Cost is legible on-page in the final blood-to-ink transfer and her exhausted seated pause.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—restore severed ancestral continuity—signaled in paragraph two and tightens each time she unearths another fragment of diaspora debris. Mid-story deepening occurs when she realizes the trees are literal time-markers; this re-prices her goal from personal closure to collective re-inscription. No external antagonist needed: pressure is accretive loss made palpable. Cost is visible in the closing shadow that stretches across great-grandmother’s root, foreclosing further wandering and sealing her commitment to stay.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—preserve analog secrecy before drone arrival—tightens through because/therefore: CRT glow reveals indentations → chalk grids translate → time compresses → final sealing. One meaningful deepening: chalk pattern shifts from child’s play to cryptographic key, foreclosing digital option. Cost legible: Kael forfeits the ephemeral code forever. Agency drives every turn; coincidence only complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—empire survival via hidden foresight—tightens once when the binary-star tremor of the chancellor’s hands is stitched into the cloth, foreclosing the option to stay passive; the felt price is Mira’s exposure to the captain, an irreversible social cost under Accumulative escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will she speak the apology into the folded moment—tightens once: shard raised → corridor opens → door pushed → words spoken, foreclosing lifelong silence. Cost is visible shard sacrifice and the irreversible death; no coincidence resolves. Pressure escalates under causal lens; option set narrows to speak or forever carry the letters—she pays.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: convert isolated trauma into shared ritual before the child wakes. Tightening occurs when Mara realizes the smudges are not decoration but a collective map—this forecloses the option to dismiss them and raises the cost of translation. Her final act narrows future options: she now carries the lexicon internally. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens; each decoded line increases density until the coral is relinquished.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“can she feel chromatic joy again?”—is signaled in first paragraph and escalates through each coat of light. The deepening occurs when ancient root-glow joins her phosphorescent strokes, narrowing isolation to collaboration; cost is the ephemeral gallery that dissolves, leaving only the palm-sized fresco and the knowledge of sensitivity regained. Agency is present-tense creation, not memory; coincidence (finding film strips) complicates rather than resolves. One meaningful tightening suffices; it lands.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—exchange certainty for curiosity—is signaled early and tightened when echoes return as un-vocalized chords, forcing her to paint sound instead of pigment. Agency is legible: she chooses to leave the coin, foreclosing her old rule-set. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: “her work just beginning” implies perpetual instability. One minor slippage: the garden’s physics never push back hard enough to threaten failure, so pressure feels contemplative rather than risky.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—cognitive freedom vs. surveillance tax—tightens when drone impact forces simultaneous escape/evidence destruction. Agency is active: Elias triggers warp, chooses to stay, crushes seed; price is immediate capture. One meaningful turn suffices; cost is visible, though emotional toll could cut deeper.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—turn personal grief into living beauty—signaled in paragraph four. One meaningful deepening occurs when polyps open as petals instead of stingers, narrowing her option to remain and keep singing; cost is the permanent loss of human mobility as bones fuse. Pressure stays coherent under accumulative lens: each song adds floral mass, physically barricading return. No coincidence resolves; the armistice is literally grown.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve names against silence—is declared early and escalates once: the discovery that a broken tube can momentarily reverse entropy narrows her options to “use it now, lose it forever.” The price paid—tube turns to dust, regret ingested—makes the escalation irreversible. No antagonist is needed; entropy itself supplies coherent pressure. The turn is driven by her agency, not coincidence; luck only complicates through the accidental find, already completed before the scene begins.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—restore trust before transfer—tightens when each tablet vow narrows the option to remain silent. Escalation is her increasing visibility to wards plus dawn deadline; price is explicit (ritual ink bought with months of distilled loneliness). Agency drives every beat: she selects, writes, risks.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—modern output vs ancient restraint—tightens once: industrial upgrade looms, he disables it. Cost is concrete: pension forfeit, seismic legal risk. No reversal, but the single deepening suffocates alternatives, satisfying 600-word escalation threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve lost songs vs. survive detectives—tightens when she decides flight, not sale, foreclosing escape by money. Escalation is a single deepening: detectives’ arrival intensifies pressure; her agency narrows to one irrevocable act. Cost is visible: identity forfeiture, attic left behind. Under Accumulative lens, dust spiral at end reweights stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—“discover why thresholds feel sacred”—is signaled early; pressure escalates through pattern density rather than causal reversals. No visible price is exacted from Elara on the page; the cost is atmospheric loss of certainty. One meaningful deepening occurs when grain = logbook code, but it reconfirms rather than forecloses options. Enough for mid-band, not 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“belonging vs. isolation”—tightens when the facility’s imminent collapse forces cooperation with a ghost. The shared-exhale beat narrows options from solo calculation to mutual vulnerability, escalating under Accumulative pressure. Cost is legible: the ghost’s fulfilled purpose dissolves him, leaving Elara literally rising alone. Could edge higher if the sunrise deadline had compressed choices more palpably across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—why paths disappear—signaled early but pressure remains philosophical; no concrete option is foreclosed. “Before memory fades” functions as clock yet never narrows tactical choices. Cost is conceptual, not felt on page.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can monotony be cracked without leaving fingerprints—tightens once when the music lands and Kael accepts anonymity. Pressure coherent under causal lens; cost (invisibility, perpetual rehearsal) legible. Escalation is single-cycle but sufficient for 750-word scope; no reversal, yet option foreclosure feels final.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—illegal memory preservation—tightens when the dust speck grows heavier, signaling the final phase. One meaningful escalation: the decision to grind dust with tears and tattoo cosmic verse onto skin narrows options irrevocably. Cost is visible (burning cold ink, permanent exile from humanity). No external reversals needed; internal pressure suffices under lyric lens.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—whether to keep repairing or to see value in brokenness—tightens when standing waves complicate simple rings, forcing recognition that pressure creates color. Agency lies in stone-cast and final pickup of toolbox; both foreclose passive retreat. Cost visible in “patterns remained inscribed.” Escalation is single deepening rather than reversal, sufficient for lyric-accumulative design; lacks second tightening to reach 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: can Maya convert private penance into communal rescue? Mid-scene deepening occurs when she recognizes Elias’s frozen state as mirror of her own—choice to speak narrows her isolation and risks re-opening wound. Passing the marble forecloses her monopoly on grief and costs her the relic she carried twenty years. Pressure accumulates under Accumulative/Textural lens via image repetition (burns, cracks, stars) that reweights loss into language.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single dominant stake—preventing timeline collapse—tightens when each decoration pattern raises the probability density; one meaningful deepening suffices, but price is conceptual rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—will she recover the hidden truth—surfaces early. Pressure heightens texturally rather than causally: each relic adds historical weight, narrowing her emotional options. Yet no concrete obstacle (structural danger, rival seeker, physical risk) tests her resolve; the cost is atmospheric, felt but not dramatized, capping escalation at 6–7 band.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“persuade mirrors to show possibilities”—is signaled early and tightens as the borrowed heartbeat nears expiry; singing accelerates, options narrow to “sing faster or lose everything.” Escalation is textural: each lullaby shard adds density until the bell severs the weave. Cost is legible (loss of pulse, painter’s dissolution), though the external antagonist remains abstract (time/bell), muting visceral jeopardy slightly. Still, agency is entirely his; no coincidence rescues or resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—end inherited hatred or keep planting graves—tightens when Elara exposes grave-soil instead of contracts, foreclosing symbolic peace and demanding agricultural interdependence. Mid-scene reversal: general’s laughter collapses into trembling seal, narrowing options from refusal to participation. Child’s thumbprint adds irreversible biological stake. Cost is visceral—ash-laced soil under fingernails, six-decade celestial clock—forcing mutual husbandry under threat of starvation.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve echo of extinct birds—tightens once: drought exposes the nest site, forcing the burial choice. No reversal, but deepening suffices for 750-word scope; cost visible in relinquishing the egg to returning water. Coincidence (storm timing) complicates, not resolves. Agency remains Vane’s throughout; option to keep trophy is foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—extract dissident memories before the household wakes—tightens through corporeal risk: each untwist of temporal filament could trigger an alarm. One meaningful escalation: final thread releases “a crystal bell shattering in reverse,” narrowing options from stealth to irreversible exposure. Cost is visible (phantom voices of failed custodians buzz her fingers) and shapes tactics—she must stay bodily poetic or fail. Pressure coheres under causal lens; no secondary reversal, so ceiling 8.2.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—can Marcus relinquish narrative control—signaled early and tightens once: when he asks “Tell me something true” he forfeits puppeteer immunity. Escalation is Accumulative: each handling of the stick deepens the cost until burning it crystallizes the stance. No reversal, no antagonist; pressure is internal and sufficient. Price is visible: the ashes and cracked dome make the forfeiture irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—witnessing extinction with dignity—tightens as oxygen and butterflies thin. One meaningful escalation: she begins dismantling the oldest tower, trading permanence for absorbed memory; cost is visible effort in thinner air and relinquishment of prior labor.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—rescue forgotten names—signals early and tightens once: the card’s fragility means one wrong tug erases the archive. The meaningful deepening is the rope’s re-weaving; each knot forecloses prior ceremonial use, trading tradition for salvaged identity. Cost is legible in the risk of dusting the card and in the warmth drained from bronze into ice. Agency is gentle but decisive; no coincidence rescues her.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stake is single and dominant: obey the decaying directive or transcends it. Pressure tightens once—the storm and the drug converge to force the choice—but the tightening is purely internal; no external option is foreclosed on-page, so cost is conceptual rather than tactical. Sufficient for this length and lyric mode, yet the absence of a visible external price keeps it just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: preserve empirical self vs. risk everything on cosmic covenant. Pressure tightens once: geometric match forces either dismissal (safe) or vocal activation (irreversible). The tightening is causal—because the ratios align, therefore he must speak. Cost is legible: blood merges with quicksilver, palace accepts tribute, sky reconfigures—options foreclosed, faith spent.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can resentment be unarmed without violence?—is signaled in paragraph two and escalates as the entity’s gravitational hatred warps the sanctuary walls, raising the cost of failure (collapse of neutral space). The decisive tightening occurs when Elias rotates the pin: this single motion forecloses the option of continued grievance by mechanically cueing cellular memory, visible in the entity’s shoulder-drop. Price is understated but present—the sanctuary’s shudder signals Elias is wagering the last refuge between realities on one touch.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—retrieve the escaped dream—signals early and tightens via respiratory synchrony: each inhale contracts fog, each exhale fuses glass. No antagonist is needed; pressure is atmospheric and procedural. The single deepening occurs when the dream turns back, lured by its own architecture—options narrow to capture or loss. Cost is conceptual (boundary erasure) rather than tangible, but legible on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: can Mara relinquish the need to perfect-restore and instead steward a hybrid ruin? Pressure tightens when each pruning cut risks splitting stone—persistence now equals acceptance of impermanence. No antagonist except entropy and her own compulsion; that suffices. Cost is tangible: sap-stained hands, abandoned scaffolding, and the unwritten vow that forecloses permanent repair.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single dominant stake—preserve/understand the orchard—tightens once when the tree’s silver leaf reframes the orchard as self-perpetuating process; cost is legible (eternal bewilderment), but no secondary option is foreclosed, keeping escalation slender.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes tighten from “find the vault” to “re-price knowledge itself”; the middle beat—realising fungi map ventilation—narrows options under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible: her prior expertise devalues, payment extracted in fluent silence rather than blood, but the price still registers as felt forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—recover the twin’s erased name—is signaled early and tightens once when Maya must accept plural identity to pluck the nameplate. The deepening is driven by her agency under the Accumulative lens; cost is legible in the dissolution of the ship and her own name. One beat short of 8.8: no tangible forfeiture (tool, body, time) is dramatized on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—end centuries of war by restoring erased treaty—signaled inside first 100 words. Escalation causal: each re-braid narrows possibility until seal uptake fuses timelines. Cost visible: archival identity overwritten, tower gears audibly shift to new history. No antagonist needed; pressure is ontological.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—generate silence to quell sky chaos—tightens when cracks reveal bedrock discord, forcing Mara from passive search to active inversion. One meaningful escalation: sing-to-cancel, monitored by shifting ice fractures; energy beings’ recoil shows visible payoff. Cost is conceptualized (“hammered repose”) but not viscerally felt by her body; hence stops short of 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—prove pattern prevails over chaos—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tested by the once-every-84-years alignment. One meaningful tightening occurs when the star touches the spire and Elara must complete the circuit; the option to wait another lifetime is implicitly foreclosed. Cost is conceptual but legible: she trades the protective silence she has tended for the uncertain voice of a re-lit world. Under Accumulative/Textural lens the pressure intensifies via ascending hum and star-track, not because/therefore chains, satisfying the lens guardrail.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—preserve versus lose the last private founder memories—is signaled early and tightens as each shadow measurement narrows Elara’s options. The final act of writing with rain forecloses private discovery, paying visible cost under the Accumulative lens. No external antagonist or reversal, but escalating density of memory-voices forces stance crystallization. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“defy the gravity of hopelessness”—is signaled in para 2 and tightened by each luminous footstep that forces defenders’ chins upward. Agency is accumulative: spiral-walking + chant + combustion deepens the pattern rather than pivoting it; still, the final shard-rain materially narrows social possibilities, priced on-page. One meaningful intensification suffices under lyric lens, but a sharper micro-turn could have pushed higher.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will she stay?—is signaled by line 3. Escalation is incremental but causal: each tangential riff (tide-pool death, cicada wings, salt crystals) raises the emotional tariff of her refusal to answer. The tightening is internal; no external antagonist, but the pool’s inevitable recession becomes proxy for time running out, forcing the gift-exchange as visible price. Agency is shared: his relinquishment of immediate answer and her conditional bequest together foreclose the path to tonight’s resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“harvest the gilded hush before the sky slams shut”—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens every minute. Escalation is accumulative: each metallic/ozone silence captured increases the cargo in the doll, making the final sprint riskier. The hourglass of inversion supplies the visible price: linger = irreversible ascent. Agency stays hers: she chooses to trap the maternal breath and accepts the ballast cost when gravity flips.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: turning silence from menace to balm for the grieving architect. Escalation is gradual negative-decibel descent, culminating in 12-minute acoustic vacuum; no reversal yet meaningful deepening that forces passenger surrender. Cost is internal/sonic; could feel sharper with tangible risk to gondola or reputation.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—restore the archive, not the monarchy—is signaled in paragraph 1 and escalates via sunrise countdown and quantum superposition window. One meaningful tightening: the stairway appears only during shield recycle, forcing her irrevocable ascent now or never. Cost is visible: stairway dissolves behind her, foreclosing repeat access; ruby flake darkens, signaling spent purpose. Escalation is accumulative rather than causal-reversal, fitting the lyric mode; pressure intensifies through sensory density and ticking clock rather than external opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—autonomous respiration after relational suffocation—is signaled in Mira’s first whisper. Escalation is accretive: each echo of “burned bridges” tightens the vacuum until the scar-circuit forces a single breath of self-contained air. The final cost is Elias’s return to “loaded emptiness,” foreclosing reunion. Pressure never plateaus; even the starlight “dims as dawn approached,” externalizing the irreversible narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—translate survivor-guilt into survivable form—tightens once, decisively: the bolt’s heat forces the choice to become the vessel. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens: each text shard adds weight, glow intensifies, air hardens—density itself becomes antagonist. Cost is visible and felt: her palm learns “memory of deep-sea containment,” and the faces of failed downlines are etched into the diamond she must forever carry. No reversals needed; the single deepening is sufficient and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—expose mass graves beneath the palace—is signaled early and tightens with each crank rotation that reveals coordinates. Agency is present yet abstract: the “eloquently silent” choice not to speak maintains the acoustic field, a credible tactical restraint. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; the price (dynasty’s erasure) is large-scale but not personally felt by Kael on the page, keeping the score below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“to freeze the wave function of hope”—is signaled early and deepened by each unsnapping that forecloses his isolated path. The mercury spheres showing unlived lives tighten the emotional cost, even though they don’t alter tactical options. Under Accumulative lens, the final still-point is a meaningful cadence shift that reweights the stake with visible surrender. No reversal is required; the single intensification suffices for 8.1.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve evidence of kindness—surfaces by paragraph three and escalates via each unearthed button; every discovery forecloses the option to cull files, tightening her risk. One meaningful deepening: the realization that love can “outlast its own utility” crystallizes her stance and commits her to covert after-hours labor. Cost is visible on-page: overtime solitude, potential discipline, emotional fatigue. Agency remains hers throughout; coincidence (dust ring) only complicates, does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—public memory versus state erasure—is signaled in paragraph one and escalates through each beat: street searchlights tighten physical risk, the tunnel descent narrows escape options, and the broadcast irreversibly widens consequence. Elias’s agency drives every turn; coincidence (the exact dusk angle) is set-up, not rescue. A visible price is paid: the lagoon locks, comrades remain captured, and Elias becomes perpetual fugitive. One further beat of live endangerment inside the lagoon would have pushed this into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.0)
    Single stake—prevent prophecy utterance—tightens via each forming droplet. Mid-story beat where algae dims in “respect” signals escalating pressure. Cost is legible in chest-heaving exhaustion and lifelong return sentence; no option foreclosed beyond tomorrow’s repetition, so plateau just below top band.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—translate the leaf message before the hush ends—is signaled early and escalates through texture: each spiral speeds up, reconfiguring into pictographs that foreclose the option to keep cataloguing. The cost is the loss of Elias’s human form, paid on the page. No coincidences; pressure is situational-coherent. One tightening is sufficient for this length and lens. Could edge higher if an earlier external obstacle (e.g., limited moon-dust) had sharpened the trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single dominant stake—recover the compass to clear her mentor’s name—tightens when the stones refuse her hydrodynamic tables, forcing a live choice: cling to method or dance with chaos. The reversal is crisp: calculation fails, intuition succeeds, and the cost is the lifelong identity of methodical tinkerer—she crosses the threshold literally and symbolically. Pressure escalates under causal lens because each stone’s refusal raises the probability of fatal fall; no coincidences rescue her. The final cadence shift (water’s “song changing key”) signals irrevocable reconfiguration rather than mere survival.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—redeem Kael without violating conservation principles—is signaled early and tightens as equations edge beyond calibrated limits. The midpoint shift from inscription to vocalization of the True Name narrows options, making failure existential rather than academic. Cost is legible: Elara knowingly hazards “causality itself,” and the golden scars permanently mark both bodies. Escalation is textural—rain, heat, and phosphorescence accumulate pressure rather than causal reversals, appropriate to the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—can Elara spring joy from guarded ghosts—tightens once: the umbrella woman’s silence refuses to break until Elara bleeds for her, trading pain for laughter. That single trade-off narrows the ritual from harvesting to catalyzing, and the visible price (blood, sliced fingers) keeps cost legible. No antagonist needed; pressure is internal to the rite and holds until the final golden mist evaporates.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single dominant stake—“solve for mercy”—tightens through sensory escalation: each ultraviolet pulse raises the cost of staying whole. The protagonist’s agency is her refusal to collapse under proprioceptive overload, turning remembered torque into the inverse algorithm of compassion; price is the strap’s burn and the audible click of vertebrae locking into place.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“honor overlooked histories”—is signaled early and tightened when Elara decides to speak Mara’s name, narrowing her option to walk away. Pressure is accumulative/textural: density of remembered sensations (bread, scrubbed hands) intensifies rather than external opposition. Cost is felt in the bridge sway and lens heat, but the absence of external resistance keeps escalation shy of 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“what ceilings hide”—tightens once: the crack reveals the mainspring, foreclosing the option to leave the building unchanged. The price is the ghost’s transfer of vigilance into the machine, visible in the closing hum. Escalation is accumulative/textural: dust layers thicken until the façade surrenders. One meaningful intensification suffices; no reversal needed.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restart time at the price of perfect stasis—is signaled in paragraph two and deepens through pattern accumulation rather than causal reversals. One decisive intensification: the press comes down, whisper shatters, silence fractures; options narrow from eternal now to living storm. Cost is legible in the crystalline order “remembering it was once sand,” a conceptual forfeiture that can’t be undone. No second reversal is needed for this length; the single turn carries sufficient weight under Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—whose narrative of the past will prevail—tightens when Kaelen hazards madness by uncovering mirrors to test his counter-theory. One decisive deepening: shard reveals apology, not domination, forcing public rebuttal to Voss and private ritual change. Cost is credible—social credibility spent, internal grief unleashed. No external antagonist needed; pressure is epistemic and moral.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—sunrise itself—tightens through audible light diminishing in the chip; one meaningful escalation occurs when the stone’s glow confirms his honesty and the tether catches. Protagonist agency is absolute: winding, singing, surrendering the fragment. Midnight’s advance supplies coherent external pressure; no coincidence resolves it. Cost is paid on-stage—the loss of the guiding stone—foreclosing any future reliance on it.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—locate the place where maps end—tightens through each impossible sensory layer rather than external opposition. No antagonist is needed; pressure accrues as gravity, temperature, and time invert, forcing Elara to decide whether to measure or witness. The final Charged Poise forecloses the option to explain, replacing it with embodied wonder at clear cost to her rational identity. Escalation is textural, single-crescendo, but sufficiently legible under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—will she master the wood’s language or impose hers—tightens when storm denies escape, forcing collaboration with natural force. One meaningful deepening: lantern slide reveals knots contain navigation math, foreclosing old assemblage method. Cost is conceptual but legible: surrender of artistic control.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“why bloom in darkness?”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened exactly once: the tri-pane secret flips the meaning of night-bloom from retreat to anticipatory faith. That single deepening narrows Lyra’s interpretive options and forces the over-painting; cost is the irrevocable loss of her earlier melancholy reading. No reversal is needed; accumulative intensification is complete. Coincidence is absent; pressure is coherent under the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—can Elias free the drowned voices without drowning himself?—is signaled on page 1 and tightens with each diary contact. The midpoint turn (he must descend and arrange debris) forecloses passive observation; the final recitation costs his grip on “temporal reality,” a felt price. Escalation is linear but sufficient for 700-word span: possession intensifies → task imposed → identities merge → truth expelled. No coincidence resolves the conflict; his bodily labor unlocks the cipher.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—can meaning survive after magic’s death—tightens once: the temptation to smash-to-restore is explicitly rejected, narrowing options to pure human ingenuity; the price is the permanent loss of wish-ease, felt as lanterns wobble under uncertain friction. Escalation is causal under the lens; no coincidence resolves. One deepening suffices for this length and is cleanly landed.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can emotional residue be archived without being consumed—tightens when the shaving hums inside his sternum, forcing either distance (discard) or immersion (ingest). That binary narrows to irrevocable fusion: he becomes the living cylinder, rotation now synced to his pulse. Cost is conceptual but felt: future ships will navigate by his archived dreams, sealing lifelong solitude. No external antagonist needed; the escalation is density-driven, a single deepening that reweights the city’s emotional gravity.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“reopen what time sealed”—tightens once: the vortex descent forces her irreversible descent/pledge. Cost is legible (eternal entropy labour), but escalation is single-pulse; no secondary narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—how to warn without deafening—tightens once when barometer drops and she abandons the electronic circuit; visible price is the solitary act that ends her era of sirens. Pressure stays causal and personal, no coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake: transform isolation into meaningful surrender. Pressure intensifies via meteoric fragmentation—each streak annihilates non-essential mass, modeling the cost he must pay. Mid-text tightening: “he recognized his own trajectory mirrored” converts custodial exile into deliberate planting, foreclosing the option to leave. The visible price is the forfeiture of anonymity; the lantern glass left glowing is an open invitation to the next solitary keeper, a perpetual vulnerability he now chooses to maintain.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: preserve the mass of unspoken memory. Pressure escalates through accumulating ghost visitations and sensory anomalies; Elias’s agency is the decision to stay and keep the box open—an attention-based renunciation that forecloses departure. Cost (indefinite custodianship) is legible. However, no live option for escape or resistance is dramatized, so tightening is moderate, not severe.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—can Elara keep stealing fragments of linear time?—is signaled in paragraph one. Pressure escalates once: the urn fragment offers “genuine sensation” versus her hoarded increments, forcing surrender. Cost is legible (her palm is cut, her identity archived), but the beat is compressed into a single lyrical gesture rather than a tested tactical trade-off. Sufficient tightening for 600-word Accumulative arc, yet the absence of a live antagonistic force or second tightening keeps it below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—“find beauty in breakage”—tightens when the kite’s collapse forces her to surrender her own prized fragment; the price (loss of feather, alteration of kite) is legible, but escalation is single-note and coincidence-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—finish the embassy before death—tightens through seasonal accumulation; each wrapped branch forecloses recuperative rest. The “six-month clock” is referenced but not tracked month-by-month, so pressure is textural rather than countdown-sharp; still, depleting health visibly alters pace (“worked through spring rains and summer heat”). No external antagonist needed; cancer and orchard resistance supply sufficient friction. Cost is legible: terminal stamina traded for cross-species diplomacy.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—decode the new “chemistry of homecoming”—is signaled in paragraph 2 and deepens through cortisol/dopamine measurements that reweight the abstract question into bodily cost. One meaningful tightening: realization that “preservation itself is a kind of violence” narrows their goal from discovery to refusal of stasis. No antagonist needed; institutional orthodoxy supplies off-page pressure. Cost is legible in renunciation of certainty; options reconfigure under the final image of perpetual questioning.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—will chemistry beat tide—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens through avian soil reports that force precise ratios of bone to salt. Escalation is accumulative: each gull cry increases molecular specificity, narrowing the coachman’s ritual until the last handful seals the wager. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: the reef’s permanent death versus one season’s possible germination; the reader feels the asymmetry even without a failed pod on stage. No coincidence; no abstract peril untethered from the plank he stands on.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—collapse kilometers of loss into centimeters of contact—tightens once: cylinder found → riddle read → leaf unearthed. No reversals needed; the accretive density of scent-memory raises cost at each pile. The final narrowing is ontological: night/dawn riddle forecloses the possibility that Mara is anywhere but under his tongue. Price is paid in exposed solitude when he sings alone.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“map or succumb”—is signaled early and tightens once: the unmoving star forces a choice to sketch toward the hatch. Agency is present in every beat; the cost is felt biologically and temporally. No coincidence resolves; pressure mounts through accumulating sensorial distortion, then crystallizes in the exit image. Meets the 9+ test for agency-driven escalation, but only one main tightening keeps it below top band.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“restore a poisoned history”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens as each chess swap forecloses another decades-old lie. Escalation is textural: density of revealed secrets (rook’s exoneration, bishop’s forgiveness, children’s laughter) progressively reweights the moral ledger until the black-king exchange triggers sky-healing cadence shift. Agency sits squarely with Kael; no coincidence resolves. Visible cost is present—guardian’s dissolution transfers eternal vigilance to Kael’s solitude—yet the price is more conceptual than viscerally felt, keeping it shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—“free the truth or stay safe”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when the cords are cut, foreclosing retreat. The meaningful deepening occurs when the whispering architecture converts her solitary voice into mass audition; the option to retract dies there. No coincidence resolves anything; the sun’s return is a timed environmental constraint, not deus ex machina. Price is paid on-page: permanent exposure, applause that may be threat, and the erasure of her own protective penumbra.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can Vey inhabit pain without erasing it—tightens when substitution fails at the stone; escalation is pattern-deepening (illusion → translation → seeding) rather than successive reversals. Agency is present: choosing to carry the stone upward and press glyphs forfeits the safety of nightly erasure. Cost is legible in the shuddering realignment and the retained ache that now has “space to grow.”

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—tightens as each decoded thread reduces Kaelen’s manoeuvring room within his own narrative. One meaningful deepening: realizing the prince’s fate was pre-determined narrows options from “fix mistake” to “endure truth,” paid on-page. Cost is legible: exile becomes permanent choice, thunder resumes, labyrinth pocketed empty. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no reversal needed at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—unseating fixed history—signaled early and tightened through echo-density rather than external reversals. Kael’s agency is perceptual/creative: surrendering narrative control to Lira’s nonsense refracts the Overseers’ anchor. Cost is poetic but legible: loss of authorship and physical dissolution. One meaningful cadence shift—raw, doubtful lines replace polished verse—qualifies as sufficient deepening under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—conjure meaning before obliteration—signaled in paragraph one and tightens with each gear snap. One meaningful deepening: when the charm empties, the option to retreat dies; no further turns needed. Agency is accumulative: each crater-matching beat consumes finite gold → irreversible commitment. Cost is legible: workshop lost, ashes gone, survival foregone for narrative permanence.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—keep the hidden promise to release the shell—signals early and tightens when the wrong turn forces a now-or-never moment. Agency is renunciation: placing the shell and beginning to paint again forecloses possession of Marguerite’s colors and reopens his art. Cost is legible: he gives up the last tangible fragment and accepts the cave’s claim. One beat of escalation suffices for this length; pressure accumulates via sensory density rather than external opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“prove whispers travel farther than shouts”—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens when Elias risks inserting the cork. Escalation is textural: each rotation of the lens deepens the quiet insurgency; the Maria Celeste’s course-correction is the visible price paid. No reversal, but a meaningful cadence shift from mechanical grind to lullaby resonance. Protagonist agency drives the final image; luck complicates nothing.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—map loss instead of flee it—tightens when lunar clarity allows the decisive solder; gibbous moon stabilizes cognition, narrowing options to “finish or forget.” No external antagonist needed; pressure is situational-coherent via failing hydraulics and thinning memory. Visible price: she forfeits outward rescue for inward beacon, cemented by bronze throb that matches arrhythmic heart.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—recover interior privacy—signalled in paragraph 2. Tightening occurs when the eye is unearthed: hiding it risks empathic exile, yet leaving it invites permanent surveillance. Agency drives escalation: she chooses forbidden ritual, pays with public self-denunciation (“I am afraid”). Cost—lifelong maintenance of fungal cover—made visible in closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—will she remain the lone witness?—tightens when borrowed memories offer an escape route that she ultimately refuses. One meaningful deepening: the discovery that the stranger *chose* to stay converts isolation from curse to covenant. Cost is legible in the flower’s sear and the mirrored gesture that forecloses any future departure. Accumulative lens: each salt-crusted detail accretes until remaining becomes the only possible stance.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—honor brother’s promise before flood traps him—tightens once: 12-minute verbal clock. Agency drives every beat: he kneels, inserts, chooses archive over escape. Cost is visceral: flood licking heels, lifelong entombment as keeper. No reversal after door opens, but the single deepening suffices under causal lens; minor dock for off-stage weather service prediction rather than on-page rising water visuals.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—avoid cosmic unraveling by deciding what sovereignty means—surfaces early; pressure escalates through sensory densification rather than external opposition. The mid-point firefly revelation tightens options: mend or drown; price is her crown and former world. Slight deduction because the cosmic stakes are announced more than tested on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—capture the density of presence—signaled in paragraph one. Single meaningful tightening: the secret’s whisper crystallizes the air, forcing the shell to rotate and foreclosing the option to remain merely nostalgic. Cost is the irreversible conversion of past absence into present mass; the shell’s new weight is legible on-page. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens: each added sensory layer (dawn vials, heartbeat compass) increases density until the whisper breaks the pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will he surrender to fragmentation or distill it into story—tightens when jealousy converts from passive resentment to active lift fuel. One meaningful deepening suffices: the grave’s date forecloses future escape, forcing the aerial reframe. Cost is visible: relinquishment of sequential identity. Accumulative escalation under the chosen lens; no false reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake: can Mara map emotional terrain without scent? Pressure tightens once through the screw’s discovery; it forces a deepening of method rather than external opposition. No visible price is dramatized—she does not lose a client or break a clock—so escalation stays lyrical. Sufficient for 600-word scope but keeps the score sub-8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—loss of manual dexterity versus need to complete inscription—is signaled early and tightens with each scar removed. The held-breath clock forces acceleration; the last sternum scar’s resistance provides the single meaningful tightening. Cost is visceral: smooth skin where crystals grew, plus pages that can never be revised. No external coincidence dilutes pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—deliver apology before orchard demolition—signals in line 5 and tightens with each chainsaw cough at the end. One meaningful deepening: she moves from banishing to reconnecting, foreclosing her old columnist shield; cost is the spent bottle and the column she abandons. Agency stays causal under the theremin dial; coincidence never rescues. The escalation would feel sharper if the “imperfect miracle” risk were tested on-page (e.g., a flicker that almost collapses the form), but the final reconfiguration still carries felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—“unravel cosmic illusions before silence permanent”—is declared early. Pressure deepens by pattern, not causality: definitions crumble, shelves bend, options narrow to blank page. Protagonist agency is largely observational; spiral walking is repeated ritual without visible trade-off or failure risk, so cost feels ambient rather than paid. Escalation satisfies Accumulative lens yet never weaponizes a concrete loss that alters tactics inside a beat.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—does a clock measure anything alive?—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens through backward counting that forecloses the illusion of forward escape. One meaningful deepening: realizing resistance, not flow, is what hydraulic gauges record, narrowing his options to either keep inheriting false time or leave the key. Cost is the forfeiture of the heirloom, visible on the railing. Pressure accumulates under Accumulative lens; no external antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake: whether Maya will defend the border or risk porousness. Escalation tightens once: pointer trembles → she surrenders the tool, foreclosing the sterile-intrusion identity. Cost is felt—her thumb releases the button, forfeiting tactical advantage; persistent constraint is the intact barrier that now must remain passable only by sight. Agency is hers; Eli’s pilgrimage complicates but her decision resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—how to live with uncertainty after medical verdict—is signaled in the first sentence and tightened when she chooses to compute the probability of graffiti meaning. The tightening is textural: each new scrawl increases density rather than narrows external options, but the stake is reweighted when the lantern’s fractured light makes the paradox visceral. Cost is legible: she forecloses the safety of pure theory, accepting her father’s superstition as an allowable shard of light. Slight reserve: no concrete external loss (job, relationship) is risked on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stake is thematic—prove estrangement as garden—not personal; no beat narrows Mara’s options or risks her solitude. Pattern repeats rather than escalates, so pressure is atmospheric, not causal; the cost is vicarious, never felt as forfeiture on her side of the line.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—preserving small moments so the dead may speak—signals early and tightens via twilight deadline. However, escalation is atmospheric, not tactical: salinity shifts are asserted, not demonstrated through a beat that narrows Mara’s options. No credible risk of failure is activated; the flowers close on schedule regardless of her precision. Stakes resonate, but pressure plateaus rather than spikes, holding mid-6.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—Elias’s need to cure his own loneliness while extracting others’ stories—tightens when the child arrives without tribute, forcing a choice: keep the rule or accept grace. The tightening forecloses his collector identity and the cost is legible in the laugh that concedes connection. Pressure accumulates under Accumulative/Textural lens; no coincidence resolves the moment. Could edge higher if the narrative let us feel one concrete loss he now faces (time, anonymity), but the emotional forfeiture is present.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—chart her own emotional depths—tightens when the ring’s pull forces her past warning vibrations into absolute silence, foreclosing external dowsing. Escalation is Accumulative: each absorbed dialect thickens internal density until silence collapses the pattern. Cost is legible (ring cools, she pockets it, future maps irrevocably watermarked). No external antagonist needed; pressure is coherent and sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—free the ships—signaled early. Escalation is the rising heat of the nib and the observatory’s groan as history is scratched; each stroke narrows Elara’s options until the pen is gone. Cost is irreplaceable tool and the permanent knowledge that she can never undo the undoing. Pressure stays causal under the lens; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—translate silence into music before total obscurity—tightens via each empty shutter beat; options narrow from “map quiet” to “perform quiet” to “accept only silence will remember.” One meaningful deepening: when he frames the horizon, the silence becomes “vast, orchestral,” forcing the final sign-language crescendo. Cost is legible: he permanently forfeits human audience. Pressure stays accumulative/textural; no coincidence required.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—resurrect the non-interference covenant—tightens when each artwork forecloses her old tactic of erasure; the Portland mosaic’s “trapped light and warning” visibly prices her new visibility. One meaningful escalation suffices: the decision to heal the vandalized face rather than keep it gouged narrows options from destruction to curation. Pressure stays causal under Hybrid lens; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—conjure Elena—signals in paragraph two and tightens when the harmonic aligns. One meaningful escalation: the lagoon rises into human shape, foreclosing retreat. Agency is percussive; failure costs physical pain and existential confirmation that she can’t stay. Ventilation restart externalizes the irreversible cutoff, avoiding soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—prove whispers outperform shouts—tightens once when Kael reroutes the hospital ship via hush-coded path; the price is exposure risk, felt when auroras flare crimson and loudspeakers die. No reversal, but a single meaningful deepening suffices for 750-word accumulative arc. Agency is present yet diffuse; the network, not Kael, absorbs the cost, muting personal jeopardy. Still, the port authority’s sensor blindness and the passing of the coin show tangible trade-offs under storm pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake = teach darkness to host light without devouring it. Escalation is textural: each shutter recalibration tightens the lesson’s precision; the fish-ripple disturbance tests whether pattern survives chaos, forcing an adaptive micro-turn. Cost is visible in final gesture—guardian lowers mirror, surrendering control of the star-map, accepting that future light will move without them. One meaningful tightening suffices under Accumulative lens; no reversal required.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—whether collective hesitation can be germinated—is signaled early and tightens through each recruited window; the Italian-Game pattern is the single decisive intensifier that forecloses failure and makes the cost of Elias’s solitude legible. Pressure accrues under Accumulative lens; no reversals needed. One visible price: he permanently cedes the carved queen to the stalagmite, symbolizing unending service. Could edge higher if a middle-beat obstacle (skeptic, rainstorm) had threatened the pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—answer the whale or stay moored—signaled in first 100 words. Tightening occurs as spectral fold appears and cable release becomes irreversible; cost is social death plus physical exile. Accumulative escalation via water-language density, pattern break at bone-fusion. No causal antagonist needed; pressure coherent under chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—will the woman inhale sustenance or remain numb—tightens when Elias hands her the sharp-edged bird; risk of further hurt is felt. Escalation is textural: theatrical cadence deepens then drops to whisper, aerating grief without external opposition. Cost (splinter, unmeasured breath) is visible yet modest; pressure sufficient for 700-word frame but not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single dominant stake: reclaim the banned frequency or remain exiled in self-censorship. Pressure escalates accumulatively—each paraphrase brightens a column, narrowing her physical form. The tightening is visible: body blurs, shadow multiplies, option to stay wholly human evaporates. Cost is legible—she scatters into fractal light, irreversible. Agency is interior but decisive; no external antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will Elara barter her treasured painting for a shot at color?—tightens once: the reed must be fired, the canvas must be surrendered. Escalation is textural: each new plant configuration increases emotional density until the single note shatters glass and forecloses the old silence. Cost is legible: Marin speaks, Elara abandons her cure-myth.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—recover communal empathy vs. her urge to diagnose—is signaled early and tightens when she chooses to fracture the pillar, narrowing options from obedient pilgrim to co-author of the archive. Escalation is single but meaningful: the forbidden strike turns passive tour into system override. Cost is present (she will not leave, assumes guardianship), though rendered more imagistically than viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“can we forestall another collapse?”—is signaled early and deepens when Mara reveals the cards now map only past omissions. The tightening beat is her refusal to go “back,” foreclosing Elias’s implicit plea; the price is the slow, uncertain forward path she embraces.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“extract forbidden truth without being killed by pattern-detecting guardians”—signals in line 2 and escalates by tightening guardian proximity each time her gait steadies.  Mid-story reversal: random dance, originally survival tactic, becomes the only key that unlocks data core, fusing external & internal conflicts.  Visible price: veil coated in irreversible bronze dust, shoulders weighted by Empire’s suicide memories; tactics altered (she must keep walking home without repeating a step).  Could edge higher if a living antagonist forced one more adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve the shape of hope—tightens when Elara realizes the shadow is not invader but metamorphosed hope itself; this deepening forecloses the option to delete or fight the shadow. One visible price: the night-long editorial labor that leaves her exhausted at dawn, starlight exhaled around her. Agency is cumulative/textural: each comparison adds density until the pattern break (shadow lifts stone) reweights stakes. No coincidence; escalation is driven by her iterative attention under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—rebuild integrity without self-pardon—tightens once: each object shed and document verified narrows the option to hide again. Cost is visible (scarred tail, social exposure). Under accumulative lens the deepening pattern suffices; no external reversals needed.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will Elias suture or witness the wound?—is signaled early and deepens through pattern intensification: each image (coffee rings, ivy whisper, frost vibration) reweights the cost of keeping the scar open. No external antagonist is needed; pressure is situational/accumulative. The decisive tightening occurs when the hourglass shatters, foreclosing reversal. Cost is legible on-page: he accepts eternal frost-bonded vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—retrieve lost creativity—signaled early; pressure tightens as each meteor narrows the window. Protagonist’s agency is accumulative (trace, map, rest) rather than a single reversal; cost is the cold ground and bodily dissolution/reassembly. Sufficient for 600-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—guarding the archive to keep unwritten futures alive—is signaled early and escalates through tactile difficulty: each wave-function step is a negotiated cost. The midpoint tightening occurs when Kael realizes he must become the distributed spark, foreclosing singular existence; price is felt. Pressure is coherent but single-arc; no secondary opposition surfaces, keeping tension emotionally narrow yet sufficient for 700 words.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—loss of cognitive wilderness vs. external desilencing—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each shard intensifies network damage until the gear-insertion reverses the silence. Agency is mostly perceptive; the single active tactic (gear offer) arrives late but does foreclose the stranger’s pruning. Cost is conceptual (re-tuned perception) rather than tangible; pressure tightens once, sufficient for 600-word scope but shy of 8-band price visibility.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—whether to resurrect forbidden music—emerges with the bolt discovery and tightens at sheet-music reveal. Pressure grows accumulatively: each artifact ups ideological weight; elders’ shaken heads narrow options. Final stance crystallizes when he chooses custodial silence, forfeiting immediate rebellion. Cost is palpable, though secondary to thematic reweighting rather than external consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—truth versus masquerade—tightens when the sigil assembles from ten thousand hidden fragments; the pretender’s options narrow to undressing before the rune. Escalation is textural but irreversible: each peeled layer of stolen royalty increases the cost of remaining disguised.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—why paths vanish—tightens when data gaps reveal social forgetting, not ecological collapse, as the true eraser. One meaningful deepening: atlas fragment shifts from nostalgic keepsake to actionable evidence, forcing the choice to archive it. Cost is legible: she forfeits private totem for collective memory. No reversal, but the single escalation satisfies under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—ensure sacred pattern survives war—signals early and tightens when alignment and spoken words foreclose retreat. Escalation is Accumulative: hum density increases from teeth-rattle to visible shimmer; cost is the irreversible exposure of releasing the pulse. Agency is catalytic rather than combatant, fitting the lull context. No coincidence resolution; dawn timing is astronomical constant, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“evolve tradition or preserve stasis”—tightens once: the decoded thermal sequence forces a now-or-never release with no rewind. Stakes stay personal and legible; no world-saving inflation. Cost is visible on-page: amber splits, pendant lost, Mira’s joints ache, plants’ lightning-chlorophyll feedback leaves her eyes watering. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens via sensory density increase rather than causal reversals, sufficient for 800-word window.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—whether stillness can be cultivated without amnesia—tightens once: freeze thaws into conscious motion, narrowing options from passive endurance to active witnessing. No external antagonist needed; wind frequency serves as coherent pressure. Price is legible: the reopened photo now irradiates without buffer. Coincidence absent; escalation is interior yet irreversible.</question>
    <question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges via vegetal trope: pearl accretion as counter-mechanism to mechanical strike. Final image reframes optimism as scar-tissue luminosity—not denial, but calcified witness. No moralizing; the lighthouse diary entry lets automation indict itself. Ambiguity lingers: will saplings survive next storm? Resonance sticks because answer is embodied, not stated.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—can she see a single true self?—is signaled in para 1 and tightens through each knot she untangles, foreclosing the option to remain passive. Escalation is causal: every released memory increases psychic pressure until the only remaining path is downward. Visible price: she forfeits the safety of surfaces, embracing perpetual ache. No reversal, but one meaningful deepening suffices; cost is legible in the blue-white flame she must forever carry.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single stake: understand why time dilates in crisis.  Middle beat—ink pools instead of soaking—materializes the question into visible anomaly, tightening pressure.  Agency: he uncorks, then surrenders; cost is corporeal dissolution, foreclosing return.  Escalation is density/awe rather than antagonist, appropriate to Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—truth vs complicity—tightens once: the upload irrevocably forecloses neutrality and triggers alarms. Price is legible in the blaring sirens and her waiting arrest. Single meaningful turn satisfies 600-word scope; escalation is causal under chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“grow peace inside falling wreckage”—tightens once: external tower debris accelerates dome fracture while her etched sandbags must still nourish roots. The cost is legible (she accepts imminent collapse rather than take up the pistol), but only one meaningful pressure spike appears; a second tightening would reach 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—capture the goddess echo before patterns scatter it—is signaled early and tightens once: constellations “tumbled into one another, creating bright wounds,” narrowing Kael’s window. Agency is present (zigzag, spike plunge, null-song) with visible thermal and existential cost. Escalation is single-wave rather than multi-turn, sufficient for 700-word lyric mode. No coincidence resolves; the final blank sky is consequence, not deus ex machina.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.7</question><comment>Theme emerges obliquely: translation as mortal theft of transcendence. The feral lullaby image crystallizes the idea that order contains wildness, never stated. Subtext operates in silence pockets and iron heat rather than exposition. Final reconfiguration—godhood rendered into mortal braille—avails multiple readings without moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—inheritance vs. integrity—is signaled early and tightens exactly once: the impossible 1894 photograph collapses her filial loyalty option. Cost is legible: she seals the confession with “blood-colored” wax and laughs at economic suicide. No external antagonist is needed; the pressure is coherent under the causal lens. A second tightening (e.g., legal threat) would overstuff this length, so the single turn suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—silencing twenty-year guilt—tightens when the firmware wails and letters force confrontation. The meteor-hush pressure peak is lyric, not causal, yet the protagonist’s agency to punch through time is explicit; the absence of a visible personal price (memory loss, bodily toll) keeps escalation from cresting into 8.8+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“heal the grotto’s babel before erasure completes”—is signaled early. Escalation is accumulative: each sensory layer (violet dust, ceramic heat, sand alignment) intensifies the acoustic pressure until the spiral disruption tightens options. Cost is the destroyed mandala and pulverized tile; forfeiture is visible on the page. No external antagonist needed; the conflict is situational pressure translated into sensory density.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—keep the wound visible vs. council erasure—tightens once when Kael presses the tessera into the crack, foreclosing the sanitize-versus-pave option. Cost is the perpetual retrocognitive burden they accept; pressure grows via density of overlapping time-visions rather than external antagonism.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: can Julian turn a stranger from suicide with only ghostly echoes?  Pressure accumulates through chromatic density—each spectral encore thickens the chord until the coin catch forces Mara’s binary decision.  Visible price: Julian relinquishes his sole physical relic; Mara abandons self-harm.  Escalation is single-crescendo but coherent under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stake—retrieve pills before neural damage—tightens through somatic escalation: warmer geode → sharper visceral reaction → spiral pattern discovery forecloses the option to stop. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversal needed. Cost is visible: her palms burn, breath catches, and the final cool geode signals exhaustion of the method. Agency stays hers; no coincidences.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—translate abandonment into human-audible memory—remains stable. Pressure escalates by accumulation: each thermal hue deepens the archive’s weight rather than narrowing tactical options. No decisive reversal or trade-off occurs; the final recording is an expansion, not a sacrifice. Cost is existential solitude, but it is confessed rather than dramatized in-scene, keeping tension below the 7+ threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—prevent solstice collapse—is signaled early; escalation arrives via the tightening realization that buttons can remix prophecy, culminating in the visible price of the jar’s silence shattering and cliffs re-settling. Agency remains with Elara throughout; coincidence plays no role.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—redeem or remain condemned—tightens when she decides to vouchsafe the chip; option space narrows from escape to reconstruction. Pressure escalates via because/therefore: her trail lures Marcus → his presence risks exposure → joint coding becomes the only path. One credible loss: the chip itself, forfeited on-page. Cost is legible yet not persistent; no constraint shapes later tactics once surrendered, capping entry below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—ferry only those who truly need reaching—remains abstract; no passenger appears, so the vow is tested by weather and time, not by a living choice. Escalation is textural: storm recedes, fog lifts, gutters quiet, tightening the window for safe passage. Cost is the lifelong vigilance itself, but because no alternative option is ever jeopardized on-page, pressure is ambient, not acute. Sufficient for the length, but lacks a visible trade-off that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“why do some places resist change?”—is signaled in paragraph one and deepened when the thrumming reveals the bees’ temporal net, forcing Kai’s renunciation. The tightening is singular but sufficient: she forfeits extraction and instead becomes another resonant node. Cost is visible in the abandoned glass.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—restore the dark lighthouse—tightens once: the mirrors must be calibrated before dawn traffic appears. Agency is continuous: every oar-stroke forecloses return to the garden. Cost is legible in blistered palms and the irrevocable abandonment of the fire-escape sanctuary. No escalation reversal is needed; the single deepening suffices under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—translate isolation into independence—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens through one meaningful deepening: the realization that coexistence means accepting atmospheric dispersion rather than resurrection. No external antagonist is needed; pressure is situational and accumulative. The final hover of the dial is the visible price/turn that forecloses the old longing. Cost is legible on-page; escalation is single-arc but sufficient for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—will she break her lifelong silence?—is signaled on page 1 and tightens when she lifts the nest: “she could not write another letter for someone else.”
    Escalation is present but singular; once she begins weaving, pressure stays steady rather than compounding; no secondary obstacle or credible loss (time, materials, social risk) surfaces.
    Cost is paid narratively at the end; on-page escalation would punch higher with one mid-build setback.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—stop the cosmic tricksters’ discord broadcast—signaled in paragraph three and tightened when she decides to weaponize the very array they exploit. One meaningful escalation: turning the transmitter past rated capacity, sparks flying, trading equipment life for dimensional anchor break. The cost is on-page (sparks, ozone, building phase-shift) and alters later options—the station may be ruined, the town’s trust already is. No redundant reversals; one decisive because/therefore pivot suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—valley starvation—sits slightly abstract, but the spatial mutiny makes it visceral by threatening to crush her; the organ hymn provides one decisive tightening beat that narrows options to a single heartbeat window, and the cost is paid in permanent psychic imprint rather than blood.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—give the vanished woman a voice—stays front-and-center. Pressure tightens when methodical analysis fuses with emotional exposure; the sketch session itself is the narrowing beat. Cost is felt in the final thaw. No coincidence resolves; the ribbon’s contradiction was seeded early. Could use one more intermediate obstacle to hit 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single stake—restore Mara’s name—tightens when live transmission forecloses Elara’s career safety. Agency sits squarely on her: decode, climb, speak. No coin-flip rescue; the reversal is earned by her voice and the nail’s evidence. Price is on-page: professional exile swapped for ancestral vindication.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—will he repeat the familial predation or exit the spiral—tightens when arranging currency as wards dissuades intruders, turning the train into a trap he must now escape. One meaningful deepening: the moment he sees “the same hunger in investors’ eyes” that once stared from mugshots collapses external/internal conflicts into a single cadence shift. Price is legible: relinquishing the sanctuary and the narrative of escape itself.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—decode inscription to heal grief—signaled in paragraph one. Pressure deepens via pattern recognition: each star-pulse = syllable tightens options from academic puzzle to communal confession. No reversal, but the cadence shift at “she began to write” forecloses solitary path with visible cost: her private archive becomes public lullaby.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“discover what mirrors don’t show”—is signaled early and tightens when the vortex demands she unbend or break. The single deepening (stillness defeats spiral) narrows her options to absolute stasis, costing the seed and her guarded poise. Price is legible in the ash and the final hand on empty vial; escalation coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—re-anchoring time—tightens once: roots release but dark clock starts. Protagonist agency drives every beat (steal clipping, prick finger, clasp scar, step in). Cost is visible—torn flesh, traded immobility for unknown covenant labour—yet escalation is single-stage; no secondary reversal compounds pressure inside the word count.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—retrieve sister’s voice—faces visible tightening: each corridor eliminates retreat, roots foreclose escape, final binding seals forfeiture of his own future. One clear reversal: he enters believing trade possible, exits knowing “some destinies cannot be traded, only shared,” articulated as Conceptual Repricing with sap in his veins. Cost is persistent and on-page: “years” surrendered, mobility erased. Escalation is steady causal compression rather than multiple turns, sufficient for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—professional credibility vs. compassionate mercy—tightens once when Marcus utters “It’s genuine,” trading future appraisals for the kid’s relief. Pressure grows under causal lens: each factual recitation raises the cost of lying. No reversals needed; one decisive tightening suffices. Cost visible in Marcus’s chest-ache and the echo he accepts as permanent.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—understanding transition—tightens through density, not reversals: each textual layer (clay, seed, spores) raises the cost of knowledge. The seed’s crack is the single decisive intensification; afterward, retreat is impossible. Price is legible on-page: Elias’s body dissolves, his last thought a conscious forfeiture of self. Under accumulative lens, pattern-break (seed becoming grammar) is sufficient escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preserve wonder via routine—signaled in first paragraph. Escalation is accumulative: each tide/moon cycle intensifies the need to act before power ebbs. The identities’ resistance supplies middle pressure, but the librarian’s own risk (power failure, personal loss) is implied, not dramatized; cost is borne by the migrants, not the protagonist. Sufficient tightening for 800-word lyric frame.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten from regulatory compliance to moral custodianship; the single deepening beat—delete-key hover→commit—narrows options under the Accumulative lens, but the price (lost career/identity as inspector) is implied more than etched in a sensory after-image.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will she re-enter the current of guilt or stay dammed—is signaled by the graffiti imperative “The current only flows forward.” The single tightening occurs when the coordinates force her to confront the kayak death site; options narrow from cataloguing to playing, foreclosing passive observation. Cost is visible: the taped bellows might split, her sob is audible. Under Accumulative lens, the pattern of decay-to-music intensifies stakes without requiring causal reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are singular and legible: map the unspoken lexicon before dawn expulsion. Pressure tightens when she realizes the watch’s backward ticks are finite propulsion delays—each click is a visible resource draining. The climax is her decision to speak into the watch, trading future linear life for archival omniscience; the cost is felt when the mist “accepts” her, sealing her outside normal time.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single dominant stake—rescue a unique pattern from entropy—is signaled in paragraph two and deepened by each synapse-aligned comb-stroke. Pressure is accumulative: each static-flicker decoded narrows the window before “universal quiet” claims the rest. Yet no reversal or trade-off is risked; the process succeeds exactly as intended, so escalation is aesthetic (density of light) rather than tactical. Cost is conceptual—the dancer’s absence—but not dramatized as a sacrifice Elara might have failed to pay.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: release the relic vs. eternal clutching. Pressure escalates once—from pocket fondness to digging knife—under Accumulative lens; the tightening is the slow recognition that he must plant, not keep. Cost is the forfeiture of the last physical trace. No external antagonist; internal conflict suffices. The late sapling payoff complicates, not resolves, aligning with lens.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake: can Elias keep selling certainty once client’s absolutism poisons his tool? Pressure intensifies via sensory accumulation—chime cadence minor-shift, cloak’s visible shimmer, shard’s rising note—forcing stance crystallization. No external antagonist needed; internal/external conflicts interlace as professional fraudulence meets existential cost. Price paid on-page: cloak released, method revised, “perhaps” admitted—options narrowed, revenue model destabilized.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake: will he transmit usable knowledge before he regresses into null? Pressure tightens as each ripple read is also a future unread; the withheld meanings foreclose his last chance to own them. Cost is legible—he chooses absence so the questions can exist—visible in the line “leaving only his questions behind.” One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversal needed.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—navigation without moving—is declared early. Escalation is a single deepening: realization that stillness conducts the harmonic field. Cost is conceptual (eternal burial) rather than felt on-page; no live option is foreclosed mid-story. Pressure is atmospheric, not tactical; agency is acceptance rather than decision. Meets short-form requirement for one meaningful tightening but lacks visible price that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“prove imperfect life matters”—is signaled early and tightens once: the irregular mist glow vs. algorithmic hum forces the mist-walk renunciation. Cost is visible (certification seals dropped, rescue aborted), but the escalation is single-stage; no second reversal escalates further. Accum/Textural lens: density of warm asymmetry against cold symmetry reweights the stake at the keystone touch. Sufficient for length, yet a tad below the 8.8 gate because the price is more symbolic than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“will the color of sound reveal itself tonight?”—is signaled early and deepens when lantern releases thin the air-water barrier. One decisive intensification: tuning-fork strike → violet bloom; this narrows all prior caretaking into a single synesthetic proof. Cost is legible: Elias accepts perpetual isolation in the drowned library. Pressure stays accumulative/textural; no causal reversals needed, but the chord’s visibility is an undeniable reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—birth next expansion or eternal singularity—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is one-track: isolate prophecy frequency → coins reveal coefficient → final dial-turn; no reversals, but narrowing is coherent under Accumulative lens and the price (permanent amber exile) is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—name the nameless grief or remain paralyzed—is signaled early and tightened once when the atlas ink rises into ice. Agency is renunciation-turned-creation: he chooses to witness rather than harvest, costing him his last relic. No false escalation; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens. Price is legible—atlas becomes stardust, intimacy stays unreachable—meeting 8+ threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“reawaken the memory of sound”—is signaled early and tightened by the measurable drip cadence; each incremental drop narrows her options until the 1460th forces the strike. Escalation is textural, not causal-reversal, but the pattern intensifies stakes by shrinking the remaining time and visible water. Cost is legible: infinite future dawns pledged to an unending vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. oblivion—surfaces with the first photo and deepens as each image contradicts the “precisely humane” myth. Escalation is textural: every revealed artifact adds moral weight rather than narrows external options. The lack of an antagonist or test-of-plan keeps pressure intellectual; cost is civic aftermath, not immediate peril, capping it below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“harmonize logic and intuition”—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens once when starling pattern offers the spiral geometry that textbooks withheld. Agency: she elects to release the flame, forfeiting purely analytical safety. Cost is visible: the wooden horse becomes living, foreclosing her nostalgic refuge. Escalation is Accumulative/Textural: density of stardust song reweights the stake rather than forcing external reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—keep Kael alive—signaled immediately and intensifies as the speck grows. Mid-air buckle revision constitutes the single meaningful tightening, trading release timing for safety; cost is visible in her bleeding palm and the later leap contingency. Pressure plateaus rather than doubles after the revision, nudging it short of the 8.8 band, but the legible price keeps escalation honest.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—defeat emotional numbness—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tested by the clone’s demand for embodiment. Escalation tightens once: from rejection (“You cannot exist”) to synthesis (opening the jar), narrowing her options to either perpetual vacancy or shared embodiment. The price—permanent re-exposure to grief and fear—is legible in the closing tears. Agency drives the turn; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—safeguard creative space—is announced early; escalation is textural (each sketch “merged botany with cryptography”) rather than a narrowing option. No reversal or trade-off is dramatized on-page; cost remains prospective. Pressure is thematic, not immediate; meets mosaic/accumulative standard but lacks a tightening beat that forecloses a path now.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake is the liquefaction of unspoken grief so that laughter can re-enter the house. Each pull of the cord tightens the same stake: silence must be broken down further, at greater cost to Elias’s own spectral integrity. There is no antagonist except the density of grief itself, and every escalation is a deepening of that same texture rather than a new external turn. The final laughter is not a resolution but a release valve whose price is Elias’s dissolution—a visible forfeiture that alters the tactical field forever.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: stay undefined vs. return home. Pendant reappearance tightens choice; interiorizing garden deepens pattern, shifts value from escape to inhabitation. Escalation is accretive, not causal—each swallowing increases psychic density until refusal crystallizes. Cost is existential ambiguity; no external price or foreclosed tactic on page keeps score sub-8.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—interrupt personal obsolescence—tightens via each failed burn; the penultimate degree increase visibly forecloses retreat. Escalation is textural (ash → hollow shell → neural lattice) yet each stage raises the emotional tariff of continued failure. Cost is felt when the crozier’s ashes taste of “stale incense and failed expectation,” a visceral price that shapes later attempts.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single dominant stake—prove silence carries cosmic origin—tightens when conventional amplification fails and the lunar clock peaks. Placing the fragment on the oscillator sacrifices the last fail-safe, foreclosing retreat; price is legible in the towers’ collapse of baseline frequency. No antagonist needed; pressure is temporal and technical.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“merge timelines before infinite isolation”—is signaled by word 150 and tightened once: the child in the yellow coat must be made whole or the pattern collapses. Agency is continuous; every dial adjustment narrows probabilities and costs him permanent exile. No external antagonist is needed; the fracture itself supplies coherent pressure. Cost is visible in the final image: he radios coordinates that “no longer quite matched the charts,” foreclosing any return to ordinary reality.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes—“discover the texture of connection”—remain cerebral; no external or internal obstacle pushes back against the weaving. The only tightening is density of pattern, not a narrowing of options. Cost is paid passively by dissolution; agency is largely ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—escape before suffocation—is declared up front and restated at the end, but the oxygen clock never ticks audibly (no dropping gauges, no student gasping). Center of escalation is the Vega convergence that certifies the vector; tension rises as images merge, rewarded by slate scratch and launch command. Risk is asserted rather than tested: no mechanical doubt, dissenting voice, or past failed sortie shadows the moment. Cost is conceptual—severing from refuge—not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—“protect vulnerable voices”—tightens when the voice turns out to be alive and hiding; archival protection becomes physical extraction. One meaningful escalation: the stereo heartbeat moment collapses two eras into a single choice, foreclosing withdrawal. Cost is legible in the midnight bells and Elena’s silent lead-upward, staking her professional distance against a man’s first daylight in forty years. No extraneous reversals; pressure accumulates cleanly under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“stand by the unremembered”—is signaled inside first 150 words and tightens when Mara physically offers the fleck, narrowing her option to retreat. Phase-transition corridor sequence supplies one meaningful deepening: walls breathe, pressure becomes bridge, claustrophobia shatters—cost is the silence she’ll carry. No coincidence resolves; tide’s return is external clock, not savior. Escalation is accumulative rather than multi-reversal, sufficient for 700-word window.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—save the language before the elder dies—is signaled early and tightens through audible countdown (“accelerated with each passing breath”). One meaningful escalation: she deciphers the bird cipher that converts bone texture to unlock tone, narrowing options from “find any key” to “speak the creation myth now or lose everything.” Price is her own voice, crystallized in the dimming veins.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will she remain observer or become the phenomenon?—tightens when arrowhead ignites and garden responds, forcing the irreversible metamorphosis. Pressure escalates via because/therefore linkage under Hybrid lens; each bodily change narrows escape options. Cost is legible: loss of sun-bound humanity, sealed exit. No coincidence resolves; the final laugh is earned surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—free valley or keep silent—signals in para 2; pressure tightens when first root tears grate, narrowing her option to stay/play or flee. Escalation is Accumulative: each musical phrase adds vegetal insurgence until geometry snaps. Cost is visible—locust shell disintegrates, bridge maintenance ends—yet the price to Elara’s body (exhaustion, injury) is only implied, capping entry to 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—can paper beat code?—is signaled in para 1 and tightens when the bottle’s three-minute half-life is revealed. The micro-turn is the storm release: it narrows options to ‘now or never’ and forces the tactile letter dump. Cost is explicit: three months of rations converted into a single electromagnetic pulse that leaves the bottle “sullen grey.” No reversal is needed; the deepening of absence into connection under surveillance is sufficient escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: transform silence into creative motion. Pressure escalates via sensory layering (bells → mist → song) under Accumulative lens; no external antagonist needed. One meaningful tightening: song activates fragment, foreclosing the option to remain merely listener. Cost legible—he leaves still solitary, pocket humming with future labor.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are singular—rekindle the dormant story—and pressure intensifies via spatial distortion: each step exponentially widens distance, forcing Elena to wager her mapped knowledge against possible infinite loss. No antagonist is needed; the geometry itself narrows options and extracts the toll of irreversible custodianship. Cost is legible in the final “duty complete,” though it leans philosophical rather than corporeal.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—retrieve the dream without trapping it—tightens as dawn narrows the window. Escalation is Accumulative: each ribbon of spectral hue increases the lure’s pull until the dream steps into the paradox. Visible price: Elara forfeits permanent possession; the dream remains “wild,” leaving her chest still aching but repurposed. No external antagonist or reversal, yet the internal constraint (cannot chase, must entice) suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“free an idea trapped behind fear”—is signaled early and tightens once: the fear’s grip loosens only when Vey’s counter-intuitive spin disorients certainty, narrowing options to release or retreat. Cost is legible in the spent ribbon and the implied irreversibility of the freed longing. No external antagonist needed; the singularity of dread supplies coherent situational pressure. A slightly sharper on-page price (ache in teeth vanishes without note) would have lifted it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—recover Lila’s stolen self—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens once: the shift from lifelong observer to ring-enterer narrows options to “act now or forever lose her.” The price is the 30-year stamina Elena has already paid and the risk of self-erasure, but that risk is abstract; no concrete resource is forfeited on the page today. Escalation is present but singular; the story relies on accumulation of detail rather than rising jeopardy. Still, the final image of Lila solidifying provides a legible re-weighting under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—will the shadow develop resilience or remain exiled—tightens through each tea-reading annotation; the spiral pattern visibly forecloses the “break now” option and raises the cost of waiting. Agency is shared: Elara risks false hope, the shadow risks annihilation; both stakes escalate until the hammer’s withheld fall crystallizes Charged Poise. Coincidence is absent; pressure is accumulative deepening, not causal reversal. Price is legible: Elara surrenders her backward defense, the shadow surrenders safe limbo.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—“preserve the color of wonder”—is clear early, but escalation is atmospheric rather than tactical: grayness spreads, children lose color, seed absorbs hues. No meaningful narrowing of options or sacrifice (energy, memory, tool) occurs between inciting image and final planting; pressure accumulates but does not tighten. The ending’s cost is conceptual, not a felt forfeiture earned through earlier trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—ground the twelfth ghost or be crushed by silence—is signaled immediately. Escalation is textural: each loosened knot thickens the silence inside her mask, a deepening rather than a reversal. No secondary reversal is needed under Accumulative lens; the final settling of the last spirit reweights her existence to permanent vessel. Cost is conceptual but legible: she forecloses her own escape into death and becomes the container she once sought to empty.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—interpret what the silence demands—tightens once: discovery shifts to responsibility when she realizes the chapel was buried “not to hide it, but to preserve its profound silence.” This conceptual deepening forecloses the option of full revelation, exacting the cost of permanent incompleteness. Agency drives every step; no reversal, but the single meaningful shift satisfies the short-form requirement under Causal escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“will Julian extract or release the last transmission?”—tightens once when he adjusts the globe to heart-stop frequency and consciously leaves it behind; the external pressure of crushing depth mirrors internal relinquishment, so cost is legible. No reversal overload; one meaningful trade-off suffices for 600–800 words.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“articulate unspoken needs”—is signaled early and tightens when the ghost crafts its silent mouth. Agency is present: Elara’s press-and-song sequence forces the ghost’s materialization and her own onward exile. Cost is conceptual (the duet’s fading), but less viscerally felt than Q2’s closure; no tangible loss beyond melancholy. Escalation is single-wave, not telescopic, fitting lyric-accumulative lens. Enough for high-band entry, but not the top stripe.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake: whether Elara will appropriate the captain’s dual vision of beauty-in-despair. Pressure escalates texturally—each floor adds a descriptive layer that tightens thematic focus—but no concrete option is foreclosed; she simply exits the lift with new knowledge. No visible price (job risk, physical danger) attaches to reading the diary, so escalation feels observational rather than tactical. Sufficient for a mid-6, but lacks a narrowed choice or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—prove that “empty spaces remember” after rupture—is signaled early and tightened once: she chooses archival knotting over signaling rescuers, narrowing outcome to conceptual proof. Agency visible; no coincidence resolves anything. Cost is conceptual, on-page: permanent exile from former “spooled” safety. No visible material loss (food, altitude control) is tracked, keeping score sub-8.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“mirror tomorrow’s sunrise before erasure”—tightens when dawn amber pigment must be mixed to a future color that does not yet exist. Escalation is textural: each recursive stroke narrows the possible gradient until the mural becomes the prophetic sky. Cost is visible: she forfeits the chance to stop demolition, pays in irreversible pigment loss and personal exile. Agency remains tactile—she does not surrender, she finishes.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single stake—find the hidden route—tightens when murmurations mirror the board, forcing the final transcription. No antagonist, but loneliness and atmospheric opacity supply pressure; one meaningful deepening suffices. Cost is opportunity/solitude locked in, legible but soft. Clean accumulative escalation under Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—restart the sky-clock to save the valley—is signaled in paragraph 1 and narrowed to one live option: release the star-essence. The meaningful tightening occurs when uncapping the vial permanently empties it, a visible price that can’t be undone. Escalation is atmospheric rather than antagonistic, but the warming library and turning mirrors make the cost legible under an Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—long-term atmospheric survival—surfaces early and tightens through each dawn message. One meaningful escalation: mirror-angle calibration forces communal labor under threat of solar winds. Cost is conceptual but legible in the final image (fragile vapor shield). Could edge higher if a concrete resource loss (time, water, injury) had been dramatized on page.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—how to midwife the death of everything—arrives word-zero and intensifies by cadence compression: gears slow, hush thickens, melody threads backward. No reversal is needed; the deepening is the shift from warning beam to lullaby. Cost is legible: Elara’s song drains her voice and dissolves the puppet. Could reach 8.8 if one intermediate obstacle (e.g., resistance from the mechanism) had forced a tactical recalibration.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—save strangers before frost—tightens via countdown; each nut placed shortens odds and consumes time. Escalation is accumulative: added nuts → rising glow → bird attention → frost crystallization, all irreversible. One meaningful tightening when Elara triggers tremor plate to shift shadows; the price is exposing her position and losing two birds, but she accepts irreversible exhaustion. Cost is visible: she ends seated on frozen ground, spent, acknowledging tomorrow’s cycle.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—loosen grief’s choke—tightens when foam patterns echo Maya’s scherzo, forcing Elena to reinterpret separation as necessary counterpoint. Pressure escalates via accretion, not reversal; one meaningful intensification occurs when the chrysalis proves “completion, not absence.” Cost is legible: she leaves the shell to the current and commits to a polymer of forgiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—reach narrative genesis before parole snaps—signals early; pressure tightens when parole flickers at the incision. One meaningful deepening: she must forfeit her trade/tools to cross. Cost is conceptual (eternal dispersal) but not viscerally felt on-page, so escalation stays strong, not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—render stored remorse safe—is signaled early and intensifies when bare palms meet frozen coral, narrowing options to “absorb or flee.” One meaningful tightening suffices: the pavilion begins to digest her, forcing total surrender. Cost is felt as ice invades veins, yet the quantitative leap from personal grief-load to world-regret consommé slightly dilutes visceral stakes; still, agency and price remain on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—reunite the valley or freeze in isolation—is signaled early and tightens when the weight’s descent becomes irreversible at midpoint. One meaningful escalation: the first answering steam-whistle tremor proves the harmonic tactic works, narrowing options to full commitment; cost is legible in the grinding gears and her spent voice.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: salvage abandoned dreams before they decay into background radiation. Pressure escalates through density, not reversals: each paragraph thickens the neural rewrite until the mirror angle fuses two lost futures. Cost is declared (“she stood whole among the ruins of who she had been”) but not dramatized as physical, social, or even psychic pain—hence stops short of 8.0 band.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—retrieve 12-digit codes before hour ends—is signaled early and tightened when the seeds recognize her, foreclosing stealth. The price (taking a seed guardian) is visible but deferred; escalation is singular yet coherent under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“will the world speak again?”—is signaled in paragraph 2. Escalation is textural: each crack read tightens the density until the porcelain node amplifies. Visible price: her personal hair bow is sacrificed, scalp implied. No external antagonist needed; pressure is the mute earth itself. The tightening forecloses silence forever—she can never again pretend sound is impossible—so the cost is conceptual and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: can Castian convert exile’s silence into a playable, beautiful re-engagement before the magnetic poles reverse? Escalation is textural—each magnetic tremor intensifies the silence density until the stone literally fissures. The single decisive tightening occurs when he abandons orthogonal logic for the curved knight path; this irreversibly fuses physics and metaphysics, foreclosing a return to his old strategic purity. Cost is legible: the covenant remains eclipsed, but now productively so—he trades certainty for generative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—recover stolen silence through empathic attunement—signaled in paragraph one. Tightening is the incremental frequency hunt; each hertz step (7 → 12 → 4.5) narrows options and raises the aural stakes as fireworks near. Cost is felt: he surrenders his own broadcast frequency, left “cataloging the varieties of silence that persisted beneath the celebration.” No reversal, but the deepening pattern satisfies Accumulative escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—grow the infamous bloom without gagging on its stench—is signaled early. Pressure is atmospheric (sway, stench threat) rather than a narrowing choice; no reversal or trade-off complicates the planting. Serenity-vs-motion is asserted, not tested by an external hitch. Cost is future-threat (“would suffer”), not present-tense. One meaningful deepening (realizing mimicry vs death) reweights stake, satisfying lens, yet escalation stays mild.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—extract the secret of resilience—tightens when gravity inversion becomes a one-hour mortality clock; each upstream kilometre reduces her escape margin. Mid-story deepening occurs when spectral farmers appear: continuation of memory is now pitted against her single-minded sampling, forcing the climactic choice to become conduit rather than pillager. Cost is explicit: the rig’s metal is biologically alchemized, binding her craft—and by extension her mission—to the planet’s mnemonic cycle. Escalation is causal, not coincidental; the arrow tip’s pull intensifies exactly because she followed the water-course to the keystone.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—decode the wind to prevent the next death—tightens when each measurement confirms Chen’s inescapable trap. One meaningful deepening: realizing the containers themselves are baffles, not neutral backdrop, narrows her moral option to witness and record. No false cliffhangers; pressure accumulates via data, not danger theatrics. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: the silence ends filled with currents she can now predict yet never undo.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—prove wonder essential before Council vote—tightens once: from private risk to globally measured “unquantifiable metric.” Agency is continuous: she strikes, positions, transmits. No secondary reversal, but the single meaningful deepening satisfies length norms. Cost is conceptual rather than personal, capping entry into the 8-plus band.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—repair the breach—is signaled immediately and tightens through each note she plays; the driftwood lattice visibly narrows options. One meaningful deepening: the vision of her past hesitation reframes every prior marker into a path she must now walk backward. Cost is felt in the ache of teeth, the retirement of the flute, the foreclosed guardianship. Under Accumulative lens, density and cadence shift escalate stakes without causal reversals.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade>
    <comment>Theme emerges from the particular arc: guardianship is not stasis but endless, terrifying maintenance. The ending’s “promise of storms that would never again break the world” reweights the premise without moralizing. No symbolic convenience; driftwood and flute accrue meaning through use, not assertion. Resonance is built from the concrete failure→restoration cycle.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—derive the emotion equation—tightens once: the cartographer’s arrival offers the final “variable,” narrowing Elara’s option to transposing him or failing. Escalation is causal under the inferred lens; deliberate ambiguity intensifies pressure until the halo transposition exacts the visible price (cartographer lost). Cost is legible on-page: “only the hollow echo of stars.”

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: transform routine deliveries into living wonder. Pressure escalates as pendant vibration + aurora pulses force the choice to linger; each extended encounter germinates flowers, foreclosing the old solitary path. Cost is the courier code’s abandonment, visible in the garden that must now be tended by others.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—prove objects absorb emotion—is signaled in paragraph two and tested through the prism-frost interface. Escalation is textural: each refracted spectral ghost thickens the pattern until the skip-phase sublimation forces a conceptual reprice. The cost (prism burns, widow’s sorrow released) is legible, but the beat is only one deepening; no secondary tightening keeps it from 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.4)
    One dominant stake—reach the vanished daughter—tightens when each failed weave costs blood and years. The seventh recommencement forecloses every remaining option: only self-sacrifice can finish the shuttle’s path. Pressure escalates under causal lens; no coincidence resolves the gap.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—“coax resilience from rubble”—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightened once when the floating arch groans, narrowing the window before gravity storms return. Protagonist agency drives every beat: silk barter, hammer-ritual, root-weaving. Cost is visible in dissolved silk and spent physicality. No coincidence rescues her; the resonance she rekindles is the same ore she once mined. One meaningful escalation suffices and lands.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—map the weight of withheld truth—tightens when she confronts the original sin; the spontaneous cycle accelerates from hours to heartbeats, forcing the renunciation that maps silence instead of escape, price etched in shard-scarred palm.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—preserve the fragile anonymous covenant—emerges with the first toppled cairn and tightens when she re-stacks stones around the sealed jar, narrowing options to “guard silence” versus speak. No antagonist but entropy and exposure; each ghost-touch and dawn minute increases pressure. The decisive tightening is the black-wax seal: she trades voice for safety, paying with permanent anonymity. Cost is legible on the page; no reversal, but a deepening that forecloses speech.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single dominant stake—rescue morning from “blank white glare”—is declared on page one and tightened when Kael risks obliterating the pooled darkness he has hoarded. The beat progression (polish → imprison → release) constitutes one meaningful deepening under an accumulative lens; cost is the permanent loss of those ancient shadows, felt as conceptual price. No external antagonist or reversal is needed; pressure is material density approaching critical mass inside glass. Escalation stays coherent but linear—one slow crest rather than successive turns—keeping it shy of the 8.8 band where sharper trade-offs would live.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—how to let stories stick without erasing self—surfaces early and deepens via color-shift warnings; the final release narrows her future method, paying a visible cost (she gives up the wing-filter). Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens: each sun-trail density increase reweights the danger of absorption. No external antagonist needed; internal conflict suffices. Middle could use one sharper micro-choice that risks bodily complication to push above 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—will she unlock the trees’ witness or keep the system sealed?—tightens once when she realises vials are fertiliser, narrowing her custodial ethic to active stewardship. The reversal is hers alone, with visible cost: she irreversibly empties catalogued sorrow, ending her neutral maintenance role.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—last blossom fades into true death—is signaled early. Pressure escalates by accretion: each folded verse tightens the sonic weave, narrowing possibility to “release the final note or lose everything.” The tightening is visible, but the price (Elara’s dispersal) is revealed only after the release, so the cost clarity lags the escalation beat.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“stay hidden vs answer loneliness”—tightens once: he shifts from bolted to unlatched. The price is legible (he forfeits the invitation and any future claim to exit), satisfying the single meaningful deepening required for short form.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“will the neighborhood remember what it learned to forget?”—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is textural: each garden beat adds density until the bread pudding offers the first shared mouthful, tightening communal obligation. No antagonist needed; pressure is collective amnesia versus Mara’s stubborn cultivation. Cost is legible: relic lost, garden now known, vigilance required henceforth.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“will anyone remember the vows?”—tightens as frequencies flatline one by one under her fingers. Agency is attention/registration itself, renouncing rescue for precision; each decimal she records forecloses the possibility of later repair. Cost is felt: slide warms then clears, leaving only distorted reflection. Escalation is observational not causal, fitting Accumulative lens; yet single vector feels thin—no surprise frequency, no equipment failure to force adapted tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—secure the betrayal recording before sunrise—tightens geometrically: each false-start loop loses minutes while dawn keeps crawling. The agent’s predator-scan and the lieutenant’s added enforcers raise visible price; when Mara exposes the fob as lure, she risks instant violence to gain the last coordinates. Escalation is situational but legible: every choice narrows her hiding geometry and amplifies exposure cost.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—“will the forests let us keep the weather?”—is signaled early and deepens through sensory escalation. One meaningful tightening: forest election crescendo coincides with compass ring awakening, forcing Elara’s stance crystallization. Cost is conceptual but legible: she accepts irreversible guide-role. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes because antagonistic force (forest) remains off-page; still, atmospheric disturbance supplies coherent proxy.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“uncork suppressed creativity”—tightens once when lock repair becomes the first authentic sculpture. Escalation causal: each failed caricature beat accumulates pressure until the child’s question triggers the irreversible repair attempt. Visible cost: she trades human audience for stone music, forfeiting tips and daylight. No coin-flip resolution; agency drives final narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.2)
    One dominant stake—recover lost honesty—tightens when Marcus’s lie wilts the leaves, turning abstract goal into immediate bodily cost. The reversal is micro but sufficient: dishonesty now physically blocks progress. Final access to the vault forecloses the option to keep searching; cost is the perpetual burden of reading every grief.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder in a wordless world—tightens when the final counterweight is set: failure means eternal gray. One meaningful deepening occurs as the wind shifts east and the primary sail activates; no reversal is needed under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible in her stiff fingers and shallow breath, though escalation is single-stage rather than compounded.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: prevent total systemic collapse while surviving inner static. Pressure escalates via density increase—each paragraph layers magnetic flux, root inversion, and memory flood until ignition feels inevitable. Kael-9’s agency is decisive: ignition sequence is self-ordered, not deus ex. Cost visible in twelve charred rows and the scarred dome.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—community memory vs. erasure—tightens when demolition clock meets mailbox opening; Maya’s choice to follow, not force, narrows her tactical options and produces visible communal cost, satisfying one meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—liberate submerged testimonies—is signaled early and tightens once: “Minor Fall” narrows the physical path to vault. Cost is conceptual but legible: regime memory will surface, Elara’s anonymity forfeited. Calm defiance keeps risk abstract; no bodily price or ticking clock raises felt jeopardy higher.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“find where deleted memories go”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when coffee spirals foreclose alternative routes. The midpoint gravity shift forces a stance crystallization: she must dig or forsake answers. Cost is visible: crystalline dust under broken nails, heart synched to a dying whale’s dirge. Escalation is single deepening rather than reversal, sufficient for 700-word arc.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—prevent prophecy’s enactment—is signaled early and deepens as coded whispers grow tactile. One meaningful tightening: release of the wing redirects her quiet cartography from passive mapping to active vacuum, foreclosing retreat. Cost is conceptual—the silence now bears gravity she must perpetually carry—visible in the heavier sleeve at close. Escalation is textural accretion rather than causal reversal, sufficient under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—learn or remain deaf to the building—is signaled on page one; pressure tightens when Elias demands “agreed-upon lies” that cost Maya normal social footing. Mid-story she risks credibility by returning weekly with empty sugar ruse, foreclosing straight-forward living. Final seal press narrows options: she is now inscribed in the structure, ontologically bound. Cost is legible in the mortar’s irreversible inclusion of her name.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—prevent memory’s escape before dawn—is signaled early and tightens with each ultrasonic phrase. Pressure escalates accretively: frequencies stack, flowers silver, shell hums louder, time bruises purple; no false reversals. The protagonist’s agency is the singing itself—each tone forecloses delay. Cost is visible in the garden’s irreversible glow and the salt residue on her palm.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“sever the chain of vengeance with a single perfected forgery”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens once: the wax seal permanently forecloses revision. Pressure is textural, not causal; each drip and ink stroke accumulates until the document becomes irreversible. Cost is legible: her blood in the ink and her anonymity in delivery. Could touch 9.0 if an external consequence (capture risk) sharpened the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—why her sister echoes—tightens when the shell reveals the seed-archive truth, forcing Mira to choose between veneration and exploitation. Agency is hers: she raises the shell, then sings to re-pattern the nexus. Cost is felt: she accepts perpetual guardianship, foreclosing personal absolution. One meaningful tightening suffices; no reversals required.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake: can attention alone keep the world from unraveling? Pressure escalates by Accumulative density: each observed pattern (rain evaporation, spider geometry, firefly sync) adds weight until the torn net becomes the existential test. The final whistle harmonizes with fireflies—amicro-choice that crystallizes her stance at measurable cost: she foregoes further light, accepting impermanence. No coincidence; escalation is internally generated by her accumulating gaze.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can the grove survive once superstition is stripped away?—is signaled by line three. Escalation is incremental-scientific: each reconstructed fragment reveals the failing lattice, tightening urgency. The decisive turn is her decision to build the scavenged resonator; failure would collapse the dome in months. Cost is visible: radiation-blistered hands and the settlers’ hostility that will dog her afterward.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—seed the clouds with ancient complicating shadows—signaled early and tightened once when coordinates replace riddles. Agency is present: unfold aerials, speak counter-words, accept solitude as price. Cost is conceptual (perfect loneliness) rather than tactile; could be sharper if a personal relic were forfeited. Pressure track is coherent under Accumulative lens: storm → charge → shadow release.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—bridge the generational silence—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens when the warped Für Elise forces the jar release; the option to keep archiving is foreclosed. Agency is internal (composition, recording, departure) yet carries external cost (abandoning shelter, facing possible rejection). No coincidence resolves; the sunrise merely frames the irreversible choice. Price is legible: the loft’s glow behind him is the life he surrenders.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single dominant stake—keep the boundary intact—tightens when silence at the tower base replaces earlier distant flickers; the sonic absolution chord is an irreversible trade that spends her composure and re-tunes the key forever. One meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: unyoking from the consortium via perfect timing. Pressure tightens once: the viaduct’s six-minute window forces a single, slow crossing—rush and atoms scatter. Cost is visible: the sanctuary becomes a milestone they can never reclaim. Agency is renunciation/ endurance rather than assault, fitting the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—professional silence vs. moral witness—tightens when the satchel reports prove institutional neglect. Micro-turn: lantern lifted → sound pulse reframes accident as murder-by-neglect. Cost is felt in her trembling breaths and the final weight of evidence bag. Agency is cerebral (camera, report) yet forecloses complicity; could use one more external obstacle to push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—clearing Marcus’s name—ignites early and escalates via the inscribed mainspring. Yet the tightening is external (discovery) rather than a choice that forecloses an option for Elias; he simply vows future action. Cost is conceptual but not yet paid on-page, keeping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—ring the unheard bell—tightens through each transliteration beat; the escalating algorithm outputs force finer gear-etching and risk of workshop “indigestion.” Cost is legible: kaleidoscope shatters, arrow point sacrificed, bell audible only as unpopulated silence. Agency is present but the deepening is more textural than reversive; still meets 8+ threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—prove deletion is a lie—tightens when numbers turn into rescue coordinates, foreclosing her anonymity. Price is conceptual rather than visceral: she loses the comfort of corporate innocence, but the text doesn’t make her pay on-page (job loss, arrest) so cost stays abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—save nomads without destroying the biosphere—is signaled in paragraph one. Tightening occurs when she realizes the mirrors can refract a new geometry; this narrows the choice from burn/don’t-burn to re-align. Cost is present but conceptual—she risks the Council’s silence and the shadows’ strain—rather than a concrete loss that alters later tactics. Agency is high; coincidence is absent; escalation is single, decisive, and lens-coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—the scheduled death appointment—tightens once through the parasol’s warmth and the child-shoe moment; the fold in patience opens, narrowing options from rigid tourist resolve to airy grace, with visible conceptual cost under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: can she reinterpret Marcus’s departure as creative tension rather than betrayal? Pressure tightens once when the burned edge flips from wound to boundary, foreclosing the option of reunion without resentment. Cost is legible: she accepts lifelong distance as the price of mutual maturation. The escalation is a single deepening under accumulative lens—sufficient for this length—but the external world offers no counter-pressure beyond memory, keeping it just below 8.8+ intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve the prophet’s echo—faces tightening desert reclamation; the clearing’s contraction forces the binding song. Agency: spiral entry, mask removal, song delivery; each narrows options. Cost: clearing lost, wisdom stored in impersonal gears, human access foregone. Under Accumulative lens, density shift (pavilion harmonic) reweights stake with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stake—collective healing—is signaled early and escalates as townspeople recognize bodily echoes in the arcs; pressure peaks when the spiral is publicly fixed, foreclosing anonymity. No visible price is exacted from Elara herself, so the tightening is communal, not personal, capping intensity at mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—preserve meaning vs. accept organic mutation—signaled early. Pressure deepens as lichen overwrites “serenity/silence,” but escalation is atmospheric, not tactical; no narrowing options or resource lost. Accumulative lens tolerates this, yet absence of visible price or foreclosed path caps intensity. Sufficient tightening for length, but not urgent enough for 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—capture the sound of aging before forgetting—threads every beat, but escalation is iterative rather than deepening; each loop erases progress without narrowing live options or raising new tactical cost. The tightening is the same forgetting wave, so pressure plateaus instead of compounding. Agency is reduced to rewriting what will be lost again; no credible loss (tool, stamina, social credit) alters next tactics. Closure offers conceptual cost, but on-page stakes never materially escalate beyond the first iteration.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—preserve the unrecorded light before quake destroys the dome—is signaled in paragraph two. Escalation is textural: unlogged photons press the walls, clock spins faster, mirrors vibrate; each layer heightens the intangible weight. Agency is attentive endurance: Elara’s playback of a falling leaf re-tunes the cosmos, foreclosing escape and physically removing her. Cost is absolute—her erasure and the observatory’s transformation—legible in the final six-hour gap and empty tripod.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“execute a flawless goodbye”—is signaled early and tightens when the shard is surrendered. One meaningful deepening: scent of valley storm breaches the sterile altitude, forcing Maya’s hand from violence to need. Cost is legible in the jagged vinyl against dying flesh, but escalation is single-wave rather than compounded.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—free the sealed awakenings—tightens when Elara realizes they were preserved, not punished, forcing her to accept custodianship. Pressure escalates through causal beats: key insertion, backward spiral, syllable-timed steps, pocket-noon rupture. Cost is legible: indefinite labor. Yet the middle contains no live obstacle or opposition; escalation is purely knowledge-deepening rather than option-narrowing, keeping it below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—will Elena repair what superstition broke without erasing the substitute?—tightens once: the radius snap forces her to choose between dissecting the creature and healing it. The choice forecloses her former certainty and carries the persistent price of guardianship over two incompatible truths. One visible tightening is sufficient at this length; the dawn-gold thorns externalize the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“share light without fire”—is signaled early; escalation is textural: each clarified fragment tightens the array’s potential until the pearl blooms. No external antagonist; pressure is her fear of relapse into conflagration. The final radiance forecloses pyrogenic return with visible serenity cost. One meaningful deepening satisfies short-form bar.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will she surrender the last relic of her viral shame to the garden?—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened once: pendant placed on ledge, path foreclosed. The tightening is textural, not causal, perfectly valid under Accumulative lens; the cost is the pendant’s exit from her body and from digital currency. No reversal required; the single deepening is sufficient. Could inch to 9.0 if the garden pushed back (moss over amber?) but the hush itself is the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.2)
    Dominant stake—collect hopes vs end writing—is declared early yet never narrowed; no visible resource spent, no option foreclosed. Pressure is static lyric accumulation; “ephemeral cameos” multiply without complication or rising risk. The sole turn (she will keep witnessing) is epiphany, not escalation. Cost is poetic (“hands empty”) but not tangible, so the tension plateaus rather than tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“restore sacred practices before the land forgets how to yield”—is signaled in paragraph three and tightens when the moon edge touches leaves; options narrow to precise celestial alignment or perpetual bitterness. The single reversal: vine from dormant coil to iron-rod conductor, forcing Elara to sustain song while stories spin. Cost is legible—the village wakes weeping, soil exhales thirty silent years, future harvests now bound to remembered songs—yet the price is communal rather than personal, keeping the score just below the 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—translate heartbeats into navigable maps—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when the phosphorescent drop freezes, narrowing options to “seal or lose.” Escalation is textural: each concentric ring of discarded paper increases pattern density until the cold-fire ignition reweights the stake from “can she finish?” to “can anyone else use this?” Visible price—fingertip frost, exile, the burned-away paper—shapes the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—return cavern’s song—tightens once via the cracked escapement; quit or persist is never fuzzy. Protagonist agency drives each step (mapping, filing, winding). Cost is visible: dawn angle study drains dawn after dawn; the final click releases frequencies months-imprisoned, shifting from emptiness to resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake—harvest sorrow before chaos—never tightens; no new obstacle or fractal escape attempt surfaces, so pressure is flat. The text deepens texture instead of narrowing options; the only “turn” is dawn arriving to end the session, an external cue, not earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: convert absence into usable form. Pressure escalates via accumulative pattern—each droplet, each chisel bite adds density until the option of remaining purely grief-stricken is carved away. The tightening is conceptual but felt; the handle must be strong enough for future kettles, foreclosing the possibility of leaving the wood blank. Cost is conceptual yet undeniable: the handle will always be half-Viktor, half-Mara, never whole again.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will Mara surrender her regret or stay fractured—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when the ghost demands “the specific weight” rather than the collected stories. The deepening is accretive, not causal: each sound-fragment adds mass until refusal becomes impossible; the final trade-off forecloses her old solidity, price unmistakable. One meaningful intensification suffices under Accumulative lens; no reversals required. Could edge higher if a mid-scene tactical loss (camera jam, lagoon surge) had actively tested her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—translate abandonment into life—tightens once via the night-long reroute that risks the last fuel and her internship reputation. No reversals needed under Accumulative lens; escalating pattern of revived subsystems incrementally forecloses the option to walk away. Cost is visible: blistered hands, generator fuel countdown, personal exile from career path. Stakes remain intimate, avoiding telescopic inflation.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—peace with an abandoned musical self—is signaled early and deepens via sensory triggers (mahogany, petrichor). One meaningful tightening: the refusal to wind the metronome forecloses the path back to piano. Cost is conceptual (emptied coat pocket) rather than viscerally felt; escalation is textural, not causal, but coherent under the lyric lens.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—decode mentor’s deceit—tightens when hidden engraving forecloses the temple quest and re-prices pursuit as self-authorship. Agency visible: she tilts dial, walks lock path, pries floorboards; each act narrows prior myths. Cost is cumulative time/labor plus heartbreak in the journals’ “thoughtfully clear logic.” Coincidence absent; pressure coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—keep the storm-calming technique alive—tightens when the last master is dead and only the rope archive remains. One escalation: the glass’s hum signals the weavers’ consent, narrowing options to perfect memorization or permanent loss. Cost is conceptual but felt: Elias now shoulders solitary responsibility for an unspoken apprenticeship. The fisherman’s single nod shows the social transfer is complete, but the price is Elias’s isolation with the seed.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can he finish the “elegy” before the apparition dissolves—is signaled early and tightens when wind ruptures projection; the cost is the irrevocable solo walk back through corridors that “no longer knew her footfalls.” Escalation is textural (density of absence) rather than causal reversal, fitting the lens. No off-stage rescue; the choice to bind the thread is his. Could use one sharper external obstacle to push score into 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—resurrect beauty—signaled in para 3. Escalation is accumulative: each copper coil tightens emotional density until the hatch re-weights possibility. No reversal required under this lens; the cadence shift (shell crack → sympathetic vibration) narrows options: the bird lives, world must listen. Cost is audible and conceptual. Protagonist agency drives every beat; luck absent.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—prove scars can feel again—is signaled early and tightens once when the graft anchors.  Escalation is textural: kelp adherence → prickling return, a single deepening that reweights the stake.  Cost is present (“stubborn hope,” possible infection), but not sharpened into a visible forfeiture; it’s felt but could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“liberate memories before frost seals them”—is signaled early; escalation is textural, each breadcrumb and star-degree heightening irreversibility. Protagonist agency is the calibrated thumb-press that releases the memories; cost appears immediately as the geese break formation and winter advances, foreclosing any second chance. One tightening suffices for 600-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“share light without fire”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when the cavity of past immolation appears. One meaningful deepening suffices: the gear’s shift from power-key to lantern reweights her options. The price is conceptual (she becomes part of the diffuse light) rather than visceral, keeping it just below the 8.8 gate for a sharper felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—discover the shape of collective grief—is declared early but remains conceptual; no concrete obstacle or ticking cost emerges. Mid-story deepening occurs when spectral grandmother orders “retrace the grief,” shifting method from cutting new stone to re-cutting old letters, a micro turn that symbolically links graves but alters no external risk. Stakes do not escalate further; butterflies depart without narrowing his options or exacting a price. Resolution is insight-only; tension plateaus rather than tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single dominant stake—restore temporal balance—tightens when the tide lengthens the pause from two to four seconds, forcing a one-shot calibration. Agency is pure precision: he measures, traces grooves, turns the screw; failure would restart communal chaos. Cost is visible in the forty-year accumulation of names etched in wood. A second tightening beat or live antagonist pressure would have pushed it past 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: decode ancestor’s sacrifice to understand her own compulsion. One tightening: the sovereign case proves decoy, shifting pursuit to textile code—options narrow from treasure hunt to ancestral duty. Cost is legible—she accepts endless caretaking—but external opposition is absent; pressure is internal & conceptual, fitting Accumulative lens. Sufficient for 8+ but not multiple reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—seed regenerative revolution inside seven paragraphs—tightens when each modeled variant is discarded until only the sustainable path remains. Escalation is accretive: density of discarded futures increases pressure, visible in the ink-stained parchment walls. Cost is legible: the lake’s audible crack externalizes the irreversible release of the prophecies into the world.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—end the narrative famine—tightens once: when the pirate broadcast ceases, Elias must risk permanence by locking stories into dust-ink. The tightening is single but meaningful, and the price (perpetual mist, anonymous labor) is legible on the final page.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: transform grief into permanent artifact before memory vanishes. Pressure escalates via each ash handful that narrows future options—once scattered, ash cannot be reclaimed. No antagonist; cancer remains off-stage complication, not resolver. Final spiral tightens stakes to zero: “crystallize a fleeting emotion was to acknowledge it would never return.” Visible cost paid in blood and breath.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. healing myth—signaled early; pressure escalates when cog’s reality collides with councils’ anti-chronometry law, forcing him to choose secrecy or martyrdom. Final choice forecloses surface life, cost legible in rising tide swallowing his archive. No antagonist on stage, but internal and societal pressure braid cleanly. Could use one tactile hint of enforcement (drowned clock-hoarder skeleton?) to make threat visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—braiding hostile voices—signaled in paragraph one. Tightening occurs beat-by-beat as each player subtracts a note, foreclosing the option of assertion. Cost is visible in trembling hands and deliberate silence. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes because the outside war is kept off-page; escalation is tonal, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—clear neural space to plant forbidden memory—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens through synaptic shedding; the eclipse clock provides one meaningful intensification. No external antagonist beyond the regime abstraction, but internal pressure suffices under the chosen lens. Visible price is the relinquishing of borrowed memories and the political risk of dosing ministers. Escalation is single-crest yet sufficient for 750-word scope.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of regeneration-through-ruthless-deletion emerges from image pattern: pruning neurons = pruning rusted iron. Subtext operates in taste-metaphors rather than thesis statements; no final-paragraph moralizing. The conceptual reprice—future knowledge now encoded in state-banquet fruit—carries undeniable social cost. Ambiguity lingers about whether ministers will actually change, but that sustains thematic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stake—understand why houses feel alive—tightens once she finds the crystalline silence; her choice to place the orris root beside it crystallizes mutual recognition, foreclosing mere spectatorship. Pressure is textural: each displaced object adds density until the final moment reweights options. Cost is conceptual but legible: she exits knowing the houses now watch her, a felt surveillance that alters her future “noticing.”

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether to propagate the architect’s regret or let certainty stand—is signaled by word 50 and tightens when Corvin chooses the fissure over ritual. One meaningful reversal: certainty petrifies → doubt liberates, paid for by structural risk of dome breach. Agency is internal yet causative; the ampoule smash is irreversible and prices him with permanent cognitive noise. Cost is legible on-page: “granite heart accommodating the pressure of contradiction.”

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—recover the texture of the missed door—remains visceral throughout, tightening when the die’s flaw is weaponized as the glitch that ruptures perfection. One meaningful escalation: she shifts from climbing to proving, then to renouncing observation, each move foreclosing the previous tactic. Cost is visible on the page: the staircase remains “perpetual and unbroken” behind her, implying eternal forfeiture of any future ascent. Agency is hers; luck complicates (snake-eyes) but does not save.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—can she prove vanished kindness still matters?—is signaled early and tightens through each extinct word she rescues. Agency is present: every stroke costs wakefulness and psychic space; the escalation is the accumulation itself, a deepening density that forecloses the option of sleep. No external antagonist is needed; the pressure is the moon’s swell and her own hollowed endurance. Cost is visible in the “saffron quiet” that settles over her chest and the final gray smudge of dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—rescue cultural memory before flood or forgetting—tightens once: bread initials revealed as encoded map coordinates. That single deepening narrows options from passive cataloging to urgent transcription. Cost is implied rather than viscerally felt: no personal stake (health, relationship, safety) is visibly paid, only labor. Still, the conceptual price—future exile without coordinates—remains legible under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—escape pre-written death—cycles upward pressure: famine stone surfaces → offers key → demands irreversible gamble. Single meaningful tightening at the shaft-fit: proceed and risk non-being, or retreat and accept cancerous fate. Agency drives reversal; no external savior; the price paid is her physical continuity.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“trick fear into revealing its weakness”—is signaled early; paradoxical note mechanic creates meaningful tightening when confession poisons the parasite. Agency resides in the deliberate self-betrayal that forecloses denial forever. Cost is visible: loss of cursed camera, screaming souls released, clasp left in cracked glass.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake: transform lethal storm into chorus or lose the orchard. Escalation is iterative: each fractal strike tightens the sonic net until storm and music lock phase. Cost is visible—rain turns drum-skin, lightning becomes staccato accent—foreclosing retreat. Agency is continuous: she climbs, strikes, names; no convenient off-stage resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—will the watchers answer—tightens once: the sky-crack forecloses passive observation. Escalation is Accumulative: each shell placement layers resonance until the threshold ruptures; the price is the city’s anchorless future. Agency stays with Elara; coincidence only complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—rescuing forgotten aspirations—tightens as each foundation crack narrows her window to record. The act of sealing the final note into stone is the single meaningful turn that forecloses further access, paying the cost of permanent separation from the site. Pressure is accumulative; no external antagonist needed. Could use one earlier tangible loss (broken pencil, numb hand) to raise tactical stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure builds along Accumulative/Textural lines: successive details (power failure, silence, floor tilt, new ledgers) heighten the mystery’s density, not external danger, which is apt for an archivist’s plight. The micro-turn from forgery theory → fragmentary truth narrows future work and costs months of recataloguing; this on-page consequence satisfies the tightened cost test. The blackout timeframe tightens options, though time itself is not aggressively tracked, keeping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—touch the unused potential of her unborn family—signaled early; each tick of the cooling breakers tightens the window, forcing the final data-burn into the geode. Price is conceptual but legible: she trades surveillance-free escape for irreversible knowledge of what can’t be reclaimed.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—decode the frequency of belonging—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens through sensory accumulation rather than causal reversals; the final harmonic saturation forecloses further wandering. No explicit antagonist is needed; desert vastness and oxidized lever supply coherent pressure. Escalation is textural—each gear groan and star increment thickens the stakes until the aperture yields. Cost is visible in the irreversible chip insertion and the bodily vibration that marks him forever.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—measuring the mass of a life stolen—tightens through each carving found; options narrow from denial to witness. Escalation is accumulative: every new wooden year intensifies the ethical gravitational pull. No reversals needed; the deepening density suffices. Cost is visible in raw palms and the watch’s accusatory stillness, though the ultimate price is deferred to tomorrow.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can one life be returned without rekindling war—is signaled early and tightens once: the scout’s shackles hit stone with a sound “like dry leaves,” an audible reduction of geopolitical weight to human fragility. No reversal, but a deepening: the negotiator’s refusal to step back until the brass is transferred crystallizes her stance, foreclosing the option of sterile neutrality. Cost is audible in the chains’ clink and visible in her remaining alone on the parapet.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—can he trade cosmic certainty for grounded imperfection?—is signaled early and tightens once: the moment he opens the compass, sees only grief’s magnetic drag, then sets it down. That single deepening forecloses the old identity with a concrete price. No reversal overload; escalation is accumulative-textural and sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—recover empathy or calcify forever—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened at each tableau she coldly passes, guilt accruing as lung-crushing weight. The final lake baptism is not luck but the inevitable payoff of the baseball’s hidden solvent property. No reversals, yet each wrong turn deepens the cost under Accumulative/Textural lens. Price is visceral: she emerges trembling, “glass that had learned to bend,” foreclosing innocence as an option.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single dominant stake—sister’s return—tightens through each sensory beat; the reluctant metamorphosis forecloses escape, forcing a trade-off (human shape vs. eternal bridge) whose cost is felt on the page as she roots into the luminescent grove.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—reclaim or sanctify the nine lost months—tightens once: the Nine of Shadows card redefines the task from “solve” to “open.” Cost is visceral: the ribcage-memory unfastening spills lived nausea and moth-wing kicks across the glade. Agency remains hers; no coincidence resolves the pressure. The deepening is irreversible—once memory is spilled, retrieval is foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can grief be transmuted into passage for the species’ shadow?—signaled in paragraph one. Meaningful tightening: each photograph’s dissolution progressively lightens Elias, removing retreat option. Cost is visible on-page: his bodily mass dissolves as shadow integrates, foreclosing survival. Escalation is Accumulative—density of grief-filament intensifies until final stitch severs his anchor to material self.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“texture of transformation”—tightens once: releasing the jars shifts from control to surrender, foreclosing any further orchestration. Cost is conceptual (extinction/renewal) rather than viscerally felt on the body, capping escalation just below high-band punch.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—silent revolution’s timing—tightens when blackout reveals the sundial’s secret geometry; protagonist’s agency drives every escalation: extraction of lens, calculation of 23°, painting the quadrant. One meaningful turn: the act of painting re-keys the fortress’s spatial logic, narrowing options for both guards and insurgents. Cost is legible: Elara forfeits her sentinel identity in exchange for tactical advantage, a price crystallized as she “melts back into twilight.”

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“understand the sacred patterns”—is signaled early and tightens when the final alignment forces a pay-or-perish moment. The painted-rock field is the single meaningful escalation that forecloses retreat; cost is the herder’s dissolution. No outside coincidence; pressure is purely situational/accumulative under the lyric lens. Could edge higher if an intermediate beat showed a prior failed attempt or incremental loss.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—transmit truth under censorship—tightens once: lightning flash exposes the negative, proving her father’s prior vigil, turning inheritance into duty. No external antagonist appears, but silence itself gains visceral weight. Cost is legible: she forfeits immediate speech to seed future readers.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can a question be forced into a map—tightens when the duel’s physical pressure becomes the method for reading the dial. One meaningful escalation: Silas’s lunge forces Aldric to wedge the card against bronze, turning combat into collaboration. Cost is legible but intellectual rather than visceral; the stakes never threaten more than missed insight. Sufficient for this length, but lacks a tangible price that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—seeds/tin must reach east wing—is signaled early but never narrowed by external jeopardy; guards are hypothetical. One soft tightening: shift change whispers. No visible price or lost option on the page; consequence is postponed to “tomorrow.” Pressure is situational and coherent yet static; the moon clocks time but does not heighten risk.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—anchor the station or be swallowed by storm—signals in paragraph one and tightens with each compass flutter. Mid-story reversal: frame 144 converts passive decoding into active navigation, foreclosing surrender. Cost is visceral—she spends her last silver light, admits “final performance,” stakes survival on unpracticed chords. Under causal lens, pressure escalates note-by-note; no coincidence rescues her.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve cultural memory—faces visible tightening: monsoon clock, seed’s demand for dream-offering, and the irreversible glow of rootlets downloading heritage. Escalation is textural but unmistakable: each sensory layer (pollen, tremor, bioluminescence) increases the felt price of failure. Protagonist agency drives every turn; no coincidence rescues her. Cost is legible in the closing image of “memories not yet lived,” foreclosing perfect truth.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“find the color of unspoken apologies”—is signaled early; pressure escalates via compass spins and lace shadows that foreclose denial. The final wiring of the cascade bonsai is the visible price/forfeiture that crystallizes her stance; cost is legible, though single-threaded.


== Grader: Qwen 3 Max ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—finding quiet math beneath catastrophe—is signaled early and deepens as Elena shifts from measuring neutron stars to reading dust. The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses attention over instrumentation, foreclosing her old scientific path. Cost is visible: loss of career identity, instruments, and narrative control. Escalation is driven by her agency, not coincidence, under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding her father’s debt vs. discovering his love—is signaled early and deepens when the ledger’s meaning flips. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she reads frost, follows ruts, enters the cave. The tightening occurs when she realizes the fire that destroyed her art also obscured his sacrifice—a costly irony. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure grows via layered revelations, not external threats, culminating in a stance crystallized by earned knowledge, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—translating silence into music—is signaled early and deepens through protagonist agency: each struck fork narrows options (e.g., shallow breathing to avoid disrupting thermal patterns) and escalates emotional exposure. The meaningful tightening occurs when envy (teal/emerald) shifts to warmth (tangerine/coral), altering tactics from grief-mapping to active creation. Cost is unmistakable: permanent deafness, survivor’s guilt, and the labor of rebuilding a sensory language. No coincidence resolves conflict; every progression stems from Mara’s deliberate, embodied choices under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—anchoring the unanchored dead—is signaled early and deepens when Marian realizes burial means nothing if “the earth itself migrated.” The tightening occurs when she steps into the impossible space, accepting that only by occupying the ocean’s logic can she fix location. Agency is clear: her stubbornness becomes “necessary architecture,” and her act of aligning the lens is a decisive renunciation of surface-world futility. Cost is felt: she trades her parlor for eternal silence, weariness lifting only as she assumes perpetual duty.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—community survival under sanctions—is signaled early and deepens through Maya’s escalating risk. The tightening occurs when the girl appears, forcing a trade-off: preserve anonymity or grow the network. Cost is legible: visibility increases danger but enables collective agency. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with each run narrowing emotional and tactical options until the final declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—releasing unused love—is signaled early and deepens through Maya’s ritual act. The tightening occurs when she matches the bridge’s respiration, narrowing options from observation to participation. Cost is felt: her collapse, the camera’s fall, the irreversible dispersal of the tear. However, escalation leans slightly on atmospheric accumulation rather than protagonist-driven agency; the “method” of breathing feels discovered rather than chosen under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—discovering time’s texture—is signaled early and escalates via Elias’s deepening entanglement with the garden’s hyperbolic logic. His agency drives the climax: he chooses to step deeper, triggering disintegration. The cost is unmistakable: total loss of bodily form, identity, and archival proof (photographs dissolve). Pressure tightens coherently under the Accumulative lens, with each step narrowing his human options until only transcendence remains.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—protecting seeds for future planting—is signaled by “preservation was the only currency” and tightens when boots crunch outside. Elara’s agency lies in strategic nonviolence: she decodes, descends, and blocks, all while bound. The scavenger’s choice to retreat proves her method works, making the cost (her continued confinement) both felt and necessary. Escalation is driven by her actions, not coincidence, and the final trade-off—chain above, green shoots below—is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.3)
    The dominant stake—capturing the acoustic signature of broken trust—is signaled early and deepens through Mara’s collection of absences, culminating in the imprint of her own betrayal. Agency is clear: she chooses to activate the forge, press the mechanism, and finally wear the device, each act narrowing options (e.g., using her last strength). The cost is legible in her deteriorating marrow and the “sepia brown” frequency of her regret. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with pressure tightening via sensory and emotional density.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—capturing a soul’s fleeting truth—is signaled early and deepens via the jasmine code and ticking clock. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she decodes, times, retrieves, and interprets. The three-minute limit forces trade-offs (no lingering gaze), and the cost—eternal waiting for her own destiny—is felt in the final bench scene. Coincidence (officer’s absence) is foreshadowed by flowers, not convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—crafting sanctuaries for observing thaw without disturbance—is signaled early and deepens as ice melts and departure looms. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her ceremonial narration and glasswork intensify as isolation grows, culminating in embedding the bookmark as a “promise.” Cost is unmistakable: she must abandon her work before completion, trusting future researchers. Pressure tightens via environmental clock (melting ice bridges), narrowing options to one decisive renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—autonomy vs. manufactured identity—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Kai decrypts the notes using tremors. Protagonist agency drives escalation: every choice (examining the cast, transmitting coordinates) narrows options. Cost is unmistakable: confronting the father risks violence but secures legal proof. Under causal lens, pressure coheres—one meaningful deepening reweights vulnerability from flaw to weapon.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—mapping the endless night through silence—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency: she arranges pebbles, interprets hushes, and internalizes the booklet’s gold. The deepening occurs when she realizes the fort contains “the silence that preceded creation,” narrowing options to total self-sacrifice (voice cessation). Cost is unmistakable: “the booklet was nearly bare now, most of its gold transferred to her palms, her throat, her tongue.” Only flaw: storm’s role as antagonist feels ornamental after midpoint, slightly diluting pressure coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding failure—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: Seven chooses to play, not sweep. This act narrows options (no more passive repetition) and incurs cost (identity dissolution). Pressure accumulates texturally, not causally, but coherently under the inferred lens. The “procedure” isn’t coincidence—it’s the engine, and Seven’s choice activates it.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving institutional integrity versus personal loyalty—tightens decisively when Mara chooses transparency over silence, foreclosing the path of complicity. Pressure escalates causally: discovery of doodles → realization of Julian’s surveillance → confrontation → mutual confession. The cost is felt in Mara’s admission of her own cover-up and Julian’s pocketed lens—a symbol of turned-inward scrutiny. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves tension.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—sustaining the garden through mended deceptions—is signaled early and deepens when the western ivy’s “blooming withering” demands immediate intervention. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her marble placement forces the garden to reconcile lie/correction, narrowing options (only specific marbles work for specific zones). Cost is unmistakable in the garden’s exhausted duality and her empty pouch. Under Accumulative lens, pressure tightens via ritual density rather than causal reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—proving non-linear time—is signaled early and tightens when Kael activates the particle accelerator, narrowing options to success or failure. Agency is clear: his choice to pull the lever drives escalation. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: years of ridicule crystallize into validation, and Dr. Vex’s dawning understanding implies paradigm shift. The magnetic nexus alignment is a live clock that forces action at twilight, making timing tactical, not decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—resolving the century-old silence—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes the stains are “a language, a code.” The meaningful tightening occurs when she positions lanterns per the program’s cues, transforming passive observation into active collaboration. Agency drives escalation: her bow initiates the ghost’s manifestation. Cost is unmistakable: she abandons the only physical link to Vane, accepting that the message was the medium, not the artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—professional integrity amid ecological collapse—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes her “fault tolerance” masked systemic change. The tightening occurs when she connects personal delirium to planetary shifts, forcing her to abandon marginalia for centrality. Agency is clear: her choice to reposition the illustration forecloses denial. Cost is conceptual (loss of epistemic authority) and emotional (auroral sorrow).

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—measuring the cost of sacrificing sixteen to save thousands—is signaled early and tightened through Mara’s deepening understanding of the valve wheel’s significance. Escalation is driven by her agency: interpreting radio calls, advancing alone, appraising the artifact. The moral calculus sharpens at the climax, forcing a trade-off between belief and burden. Cost is unmistakable in the “stone dropped in still water” and the irreversible weight she now carries.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—observing transformation without imposing interpretation—is signaled early and deepens through the keeper’s journey toward the obsidian refuge. The meaningful tightening occurs when she flattens the swan into a map, accepting that the library grows downward, intertwining roots and pages. This reweights her mission from retrieval to witness, with the cost being the loss of fixed knowledge (the swan’s potential return to pulp). Escalation is driven by her agency, though the pressure remains contemplative rather than urgent, fitting the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—restoring wonder in a child closed by fear—is signaled early and deepened through Elara’s restraint and the eclipse’s timed pressure. The meaningful tightening occurs when darkness creates “a pocket of safety,” allowing Milo to risk sound. Agency is subtle but present: Elara chooses the eclipse, opens the locket, modulates her music; Milo chooses to blow, then speak. Cost is felt in his white-knuckled grip and trembling finger—eight months of silence paid forward. Yet the escalation leans slightly on atmospheric coincidence rather than escalating interpersonal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost narrative before total forgetting—is signaled early and deepens when the tapestry fragment reveals the axis as dragon. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she probes, reads, matches weave to diary, transcribes—all narrowing options toward archival preservation. Cost is felt (“tears,” “ash-stained fingers”) and conceptual (bearing collective memory alone). While pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, the tightening lacks a second live option foreclosed beyond endurance, slightly limiting peak-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—Elias’s desire to transpose life into a “major and bright” key—is signaled early and deepens through his unwitting orchestration of spy networks. Pressure escalates accumulatively: each fortune written carries higher unseen stakes, culminating in the knock that forces his final micro-choice (offering the cookie). The cost is conceptual yet undeniable: his ignorance is both shield and weapon, and leaving the island means surrendering the very isolation that made his power possible. Agency is subtle but present—he *chooses* which fortunes to write, whom to give them to—driving the deepening under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving the anchor by unraveling stillness—is signaled early and deepens through Elian’s rhetorical counterattacks, each narrowing the entity’s foothold. Escalation is driven entirely by protagonist agency: his antimetabole, aporia, and palindromic loops force logical paralysis. Cost is unmistakable: the “unraveled stillness” threatens dissolution, and salvation requires exhausting the one pigment into dust. The live clock (“only minutes”) tightens decisions without collapsing into coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—accessing the “unheard symphonies” beneath ordinary life—is signaled early and deepens via the nautilus-memory mapping. The meaningful tightening occurs when the ice cracks, initiating the symphony he’s awaited; this percussive beat forces his shift from observer to conductor. Cost is felt in the abandonment of his former identity as fortune-writer, now seen as “reduction.” Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (his mapping, tracing, aligning), though the transition from reflection to action could be more causally knitted.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—conquering the labyrinth of self—is signaled early and deepens through procedural generation that forces real-time commitment. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to step into void, triggering collapse of timelines. Cost is felt—ghost selves fade, tablet burns, stone slaps echo “centuries of sorrow.” One tightening suffices, but the price is unmistakable and woven into every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—defeating emotional numbness—is signaled early and deepens when Elara feels backward songs as “architecture of anticipation.” The tightening occurs when she touches the needle, stripping “another layer of protective ice,” foreclosing her prior endurance. Cost is unmistakable: tears after months of dry cheeks, heart syncing to reversed rhythm. Escalation is driven by her agency under Accumulative pressure, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving atmospheric truth against political distortion—is signaled early and deepens when the pigeon reveals the quarantine’s failure. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her lateral path, decoding of coordinates, and decision to transcribe despite surveillance narrow options and raise cost. The tightening (authorities suspect Guild monitoring) forecloses safety, forcing her into cultivated solitude. Cost is unmistakable: she accepts being watched, yet writes anyway.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding inherited grief through scent—is signaled early and tightens when the vial appears, forcing Elias to choose between continued caution or confronting memory. His agency drives escalation: removing the stopper activates the perfume, which in turn awakens the ferns. Cost is unmistakable: he trades numb survival for painful, necessary presence, paid in tears and relinquished fear. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—density of sensory triggers reweights his stance.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—choosing between memory and prophecy—is signaled early and deepens when the poet rejects the binary, transforming the conflict into one about the nature of choice itself. Escalation occurs through the protagonist’s agency: laying the rope as offering, scraping sediment, following the rope’s movement. The cost is unmistakable: he accepts that “her syllables had already dissolved into geology and silence,” and his sideways step forecloses both paths while honoring their weight. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with each beat adding textual density that reweights the central dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—freeing trapped frequencies from decayed objects—is signaled by line 3 and escalates organically through Mara’s ritual. The meaningful deepening occurs when the bowl hums and shipwrecks begin to whisper: pressure intensifies not via external threat but through accumulated resonance, narrowing options to one irreversible act—playing the unfinished. Cost is unmistakable: she risks nothing less than redefining silence itself, and succeeds only by accepting incompleteness as the condition of truth. Agency is total; no coincidence resolves the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—experiencing empathy without comprehension—is signaled early and tightens when the grotto’s resonance alters the compound’s effect, forcing Kael to confront the limits of “half truths.” Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: Kael chooses to apply the compound despite known limitations, and later interprets the anomaly professionally. Cost is unmistakable: Kael’s foundational belief in counterfeit purity fractures, altering future tactics (“until all half truths become whole”).

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—elevating invisible labor—is signaled early via the locket photo and tightens when Elias redirects his contingency fund, foreclosing pure profit-seeking. Pressure escalates through protagonist agency: his symphony-hour ritual becomes active fundraising, transforming passive admiration into institutional support. Cost is legible in his identity shift (“no longer merely a seaside merchant”) and the ledger’s closure. Slight deduction because the symphony patrons’ conversion feels implied rather than dramatized; their endowments lack on-page resistance or negotiation friction.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—belonging—is signaled early and deepens via the glyph hunt, which becomes “a grammar of collaboration.” The tightening occurs when the group shifts from searching to building together, foreclosing Kael’s prior isolation. Cost is felt: seventeen cycles of empty baskets, now redeemed. The mute artist’s reveal complicates but doesn’t resolve; Kael’s agency in weaving the bridge drives the climax, satisfying the Situational lens’s pressure-to-stance requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reaching the echo’s origin—is signaled early and tightens via the forty-minute window and accumulating “temporal debt.” Elara’s agency drives escalation: she sculpts time to extend her journey, causing “geometric ripples” and vertical waves. The cost is unmistakable: the giant wakes early, canals drain, and her power depletes. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with each stroke of paddle or brush deepening the price of persistence.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—resolving ambiguous loss through the “mathematics of emotion”—is signaled early and deepens when the water drop creates a new tributary in the ceramic river, altering the pattern. Elian’s agency drives escalation: he aligns the eyes, traces fissures, and interprets vectors. The cost is conceptual yet felt: he relinquishes the need for binary resolution (death/return) in favor of a third way—love as persistent force. Coincidence (the drop) complicates but doesn’t resolve; understanding emerges from his action.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—making invisible voices heard through invisible hands—is signaled early and deepens via Maya’s selective distribution. Agency manifests as attention and endurance: she forecloses personal ownership of the tapes to gift them, paying the cost of perpetual anonymity. Escalation occurs through accumulation, not reversal; each fragment placed narrows her own path while widening others’. The power grid’s instability mirrors but never resolves her tension—coincidence complicates, never saves.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.2)
    The dominant stake—whether understanding requires control or surrender—is signaled early and deepens through Maren’s confrontation with wild vines that outperform her specimens. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses to release the leaf, abandon reconstruction plans, and reinterpret her life’s work. The cost is palpable: admitting fifteen years were “a sophisticated form of blindness.” No coincidence resolves tension; the storm merely reveals what was already true.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving meaning before the tide blurs it—is signaled early and deepens through the exchange. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she seeks the convergence, initiates the trade, and chooses to document rather than possess. Cost is felt in the brooch’s surrender and the mentor’s lost journals now bearing emotional weight. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with each artifact tightening the thematic knot without false resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—Elara’s need to maintain predictive control—tightens when her visions fail, forcing her to relinquish agency. The pilgrim’s arrival acts as catalyst, not coincidence; Elara’s choice to witness (not resist) enables the miracle. Cost is unmistakable: she loses her defining gift but gains a truer form of knowing. Escalation follows the Accumulative lens—vibrations grow “steadily unpredictable” until the cave’s consciousness merges with the pilgrim, crystallizing Elara’s stance in Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—compiling fragments into meaning—is signaled early and deepened when the valve’s psychic residue forces Kael to confront failed signals. The meaningful tightening occurs when he transfers the valve to the widow, transforming private vision into shared context. Agency is exercised through attention and curation, not action, consistent with the Accumulative lens. Cost is felt in the “hollow” faces of returnees and Kael’s own “dull ache of displacement,” though the escalation lacks a decisive narrowing of options beyond emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—accessing the fortress of unspoken truths—is signaled early and tightens when cracks become arrows. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she interprets geometry, follows fissures, and performs the punch. Cost is felt in irreversible validation—the ticket stamped, retreat foreclosed. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, density of pattern (cracks + stars + maps) reweights silence as destination, not absence.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—whether empirical observation can coexist with intuitive resonance—is signaled early and deepens when the comet’s vibration bypasses Mara’s skepticism. The tightening occurs at the tile’s touch, which forces a trade-off: retain intellectual detachment or embrace entangled memory. Her agency drives escalation (transcribing, redesigning), and the cost—loss of her former self—is felt in her trembling hands and final vulnerability. Whale migration acts as a live clock, but pressure stems more from internal rupture than external urgency, slightly muting situational stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—discovering what lies beyond farewell—is signaled early and deepens through Kael’s use of the amulet and navigation of magnetic fields. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: his centuries of plotting culminate in the precise “angle of magnetic declination” that allows entry into the mutiny’s eye. The cost is unmistakable: the amulet shatters, releasing its curse, and Kael permanently relinquishes his last physical link to his lost love. Pressure tightens coherently under the Accumulative lens, though the lack of a tangible antagonist slightly softens external opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—trading secrets for asylum—is signaled early and deepens via Maya’s moral calculus: “how much of a monster's redemption was worth a nation’s most dangerous secrets?” Pressure escalates causally: waiting reveals the guard’s flaw, enabling the breach. The cost is unmistakable—her innocence, her rigidity—and the final act (adding ink to tea) is driven by her agency, not coincidence. One meaningful tightening suffices, and it forecloses her prior moral absolutism.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving human texture against erasure—is signaled early and escalates when the lamp’s hum dips, forcing Elias to work faster while maintaining “incandescent restraint.” This tightening narrows his options: he must finish before the past leaks away entirely. The cost is felt in his physical precision and temporal urgency, culminating in a trade-off between speed and delicacy. Agency is clear: his choices (peeling gold, pressing leaf) directly shape the outcome, and the final image confirms the stakes were real and paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reconstructing selfhood from erased history—is signaled early and tightened through the method of collection, which narrows options to auditory fragments alone. Escalation occurs via density increase: Ukrainian stevedore → customs officer → vanished merchant, culminating in the archivist becoming “the texture itself.” Cost is unmistakable: existence reduced to “negative space,” yet this very limitation fuels the final reconfiguration. Protagonist agency drives every deepening; coincidence never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—decoding what persists after stories end—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s shift from analysis to participation. The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses to play the cello, trading intellectual control for emotional resonance. Cost is visible: she abandons her career identity and leaves the instrument behind. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves the core tension.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving community bonds amid privatization—is signaled early and escalates through Maya’s agency: she doesn’t just resist but reorganizes via graffiti. The tightening occurs when gentrification notices arrive, forcing her to choose between passive translation and active subversion. Cost is unmistakable: she risks corporate expulsion and communal distrust, yet orchestrates collective ownership loopholes. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with each tagged symbol narrowing options toward a fragile, tactical endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving the last pristine impact structure—is signaled early and deepens when Elena’s chemical timer activates, narrowing her window to act. The tightening comes not from external reversal but from internal endurance: she must outlast the night to witness the dawning hush, sacrificing warmth, safety, and hope for a single photograph. Cost is unmistakable: “her curiosity had only served to archive extinction.” Agency lies in attention and refusal to retreat, which forecloses any illusion of salvage.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (prevent another shipwreck) is signaled early and tightens as the Vespertine’s departure looms. Escalation is driven by Mira’s agency: she decodes, patches, recalibrates—all under time pressure. Cost is unmistakable: emotional toll of reliving trauma, physical precision under duress. The deepening comes when corrupted data resolves into a “pure tone,” narrowing options to one decisive act: release.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—verifying the rivers’ origin—is signaled early and escalates through Marlow’s agency: interpreting condensation, walking the ice, transmitting coordinates. The “thaw” isn’t coincidence; it’s the pressure that forces his last chance. Cost is felt: he risks disturbing a sacred equilibrium, and the landscape’s “held breath” implies consequence. The deepening occurs when he realizes the phrasebook’s line is geological instruction, narrowing options to one decisive act.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—restoring shared balance between civilization and wilderness—is signaled early and deepens when the fork shudders, warning of imminent collapse. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she increases pace, shifting from walk to dance, layering rhythms that force the stones to “listen.” The cost is legible: seventeen years of sleepless vigilance, and the irreversible renunciation of reviving the old Vel Moris. Pressure tightens coherently under the Accumulative lens, with each footfall narrowing the path to renewal.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—harnessing the ephemeral before time runs out—tightens decisively when Elara must choose between air and understanding. The escalation is driven by her agency: reaching for the vial triggers the vision, which forces the climactic exhale. Cost is unmistakable: she trades breath for wisdom, survival for communion. Coincidence never resolves; the temple responds only to correct vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes—survival through narrative control—are signaled early and escalate via Elias’s deepening commitment to silence. The tightening occurs when he chooses to hover using “narrative physics,” risking exposure to complete his father’s failed dream. Cost is legible: he sacrifices identity, home, and witness for freedom. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens—each impossibility (aging backwards, doors to yesterday) reinforces the central rule that stories sustain reality—and climax crystallizes this without coincidence or off-stage resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—repaying a karmic debt across lifetimes—is signaled early and deepens through Julian’s resonant awakenings and Eira’s precise application of pain. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: Julian chooses to understand, then to bury the bead. The cost is unmistakable: Eira’s existence dissolves, the orchard withers, Julian inherits both grief and release. Pressure coheres under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with one meaningful deepening (the bead’s pulse triggering ancestral memory) that reweights the entire premise.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.3)
    The dominant stake—saving the canyon from becoming a “cautionary tale”—is signaled by the second sentence and deepens through Maren’s defiance of elders and adoption of dream logic. The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses thread over mortar, narrowing options to those aligned with unconscious paths. Cost is unmistakable: her blood feeds the plate, transforming ink to arterial red. Agency drives escalation—each stitch is a deliberate act of faith—and the final image reweights survival as poetic endurance, not structural victory.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—rebuilding faith severed by diaspora—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s purposeful wandering, which forecloses haste or extraction. Agency is clear: she chooses to collect scattered gnomon fragments, each representing an “interrupted journey,” and rebuilds not for utility but witness. Cost is felt in the dusk-lit labor and the emotional weight of unfinished lives turned to “pale, sweet fruit that no one harvested.” Escalation occurs via accumulation, not coincidence, under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (decoding before encryption) intensifies coherently under Accumulative pressure: time compresses, drone approaches, chalk fades. Kael’s agency drives escalation—juxtaposing envelope against CRT, translating via hopscotch grids—with visible cost (smudged hands, eroded codes). The tightening forecloses digital solutions, forcing analog ingenuity. Coincidence (children’s chalk) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Kael’s expertise unlocks it. Final trade-off—ephemeral message for untraceable delivery—charges the ending with conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preventing the coup through indirect means—is signaled early and tightens via Mira’s embroidery-as-intelligence. Her agency drives escalation: stitching binary stars to read the chancellor’s tremor, purchasing time with silver-thread requests. The cost is felt in her performance of foolishness and isolation; the captain’s arrival crystallizes pressure into actionable knowledge. Under the Accumulative lens, density increases until the armory “error” reweights everything—the conspirators’ moves are legible because Mira’s method narrows probability into precision.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—delivering an apology where silence reigned—is signaled early and tightens when moonlight heals Elara, enabling passage. The meaningful deepening occurs at the clearing: she can witness but not change the past, forcing a trade-off between futile alteration and resonant presence. Cost is unmistakable: seventeen unsent letters burn “against her ribs,” the shard is sacrificed, and she endures the agony of watching Mara die alone—even as she kneels beside her. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (stepping onto deck, raising shard, pushing door) under Accumulative pressure, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—translating collective trauma into survivable form—is signaled early and deepens when Mara deciphers the cast’s “desperate archive.” The meaningful tightening occurs when she realizes the notes form a “collective confession,” shifting her role from observer to ritual anchor. Cost is unmistakable: she carries “the smudged lexicon of fear in her own marrow.” Agency is quiet but decisive—her attention forecloses silence, and her reinterpretation (“seeds, not stains”) reweights meaning under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—rediscovering artistic joy—is signaled early and deepens through protagonist agency: Mara chooses to develop latent film using light-paint, escalating from passive seeker to active collaborator with trees. Pressure tightens when she realizes joy was “exposed and waiting,” forcing a trade-off between clinging to grief or risking renewal. Cost is unmistakable: years of creative silence, now redeemed through effort (“worked faster… mirthful dance despite the weight”). Coincidence (finding fragment) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from her skilled, deliberate action under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—trading certainty for curiosity—is signaled early and deepens through Elena’s surrender to acoustic feedback. The meaningful tightening occurs when she realizes the mural to restore may be “her own perception,” foreclosing her old professional identity. Cost is felt: she abandons pigment-loaded brushes for potential, leaves the nickel as offering. Escalation is driven by her agency—each step awakens a layer—but the pressure remains internal; external stakes are thin, limiting the visceral punch expected at this tier.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—cognitive freedom vs. authoritarian control—is signaled early and escalates causally: planting → meeting → warp → drone breach → capture. Elias’s agency drives every turn; luck (drone confusion) complicates but doesn’t resolve. The cost is unmistakable: his arrest, yet the movement survives. One tightening suffices—a single meaningful deepening occurs when the warp collapses, forcing simultaneous escape and sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—transforming loss into living peace—is signaled early and deepens when lullabies trigger the blossom armistice. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her shyly unstoppable singing alters coral biology, narrowing options (she ensconces deeper) while expanding ecological consequence. Cost is unmistakable: exile, bodily fusion, dissolution of memory (postcard fades). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each cracked note compounds toward reef-wide reconciliation.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving acoustic identity against dissolution—is signaled early and tightens when the caretaker discovers the cracked tube, which introduces a fragile, time-bound solution. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses to strike the tube despite knowing its fragility, accepting inevitable loss for temporary gain. The cost—“foxglove regret” and eventual splintering of the tube—is unmistakable and shapes every subsequent move, culminating in a trade-off between momentary illumination and permanent silence.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—restoring trust through truth—tightens via the “paths diverge by dawn” deadline, forcing Elara’s reckless yet precise ritual. The meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes apology is insufficient; only interconnected promises can hold complexity. Cost is unmistakable: if rejected, the vows dissolve at sunrise, and she endures permanent separation. Protagonist agency drives escalation—no luck intervenes—and the moral calculus (truth vs. safety) sharpens the peak choice.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.2)
    Stakes escalate cleanly: municipal pressure for output vs. ancient design for safety. The seismic tremor raises immediate danger, but the true escalation is cognitive—Elias deciphers the architects’ compassion, transforming maintenance into moral guardianship. His agency drives the deepening: he chooses concealment over compliance, with clear cost (risked pension, falsified logs). The dominant stake—harmonizing conflicting values—tightens until the final bolt secures both floodgate and philosophy.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving lost songs versus self-preservation—is signaled early and deepens when detectives arrive. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses vulnerability over flight, using her dust-mote method to enable Orion’s mission. Cost is felt (“weight... heavy as the books”) and visible in her trembling hands. However, external pressure (detectives) slightly overshadows internal conflict’s causal role in the final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—deciphering sacred thresholds—tightens when the logbook aligns with wood grain, transforming passive searching into active ritual. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she *chooses* to interpret high pressure as “cross alone,” cumulonimbus as “wait three breaths.” The cost is existential: embracing liminality as permanent state. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidences resolve conflict. One tightening suffices, but the deepening from puzzle to sanctuary elevates stakes without sprawl.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—mapping celestial alignment to find belonging—tightens meaningfully when pressure seals threaten collapse, forcing Elara to choose between data or connection. Her agency drives escalation: she initiates the shared exhale, activating the luminous respite. The cost is legible: the phantom’s fulfillment requires his fading, and the facility’s systems return to dormancy after use. Though the external threat (crushing pressure) resolves via ingenuity, it’s earned through prior worldbuilding (“softly ingenious design”) and character choice, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—recovering and understanding fragmented memories—is signaled early and intensifies as gaps (“jagged absences”) challenge Elara’s method. Pressure escalates when she realizes missing pieces aren’t errors but “necessary silences,” forcing a reconfiguration of her purpose. The cost is conceptual yet palpable: accepting that some paths must vanish for others to form. Though driven by reflection, each insight arises from on-page interaction with seeds and glass, satisfying Accumulative escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—interrupting monotony with meaningful wonder—is signaled early and tightens when Kael targets the woman’s specific commute rhythm. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: he deploys the music box, knowing jasmine vines will release scent at 4–5 kHz, triggering her emotional shift. Cost is felt: his mastery demands invisibility; the woman must believe she chose freely. Coincidence (busker’s tune shift) complicates but doesn’t resolve—Kael’s engineering enables the chain reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving memory against state erasure—is signaled early and deepens through Kaelin’s choice to inscribe rather than merely dance. The escalation is driven by her agency: the heavier dust speck prompts the irreversible act of writing. Cost is unmistakable: permanent exile from humanity, bodily transformation, and triggering alarms. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure grows via textual density and ritual intensity, culminating in a trade-off—mortality for eternity—that narrows all future options to cosmic participation alone.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether a life of repair yields meaning—is signaled early and deepened by the stone-throwing method. The tightening occurs when ripples bounce back, complicating radial simplicity into “something richer and more true,” mirroring his acceptance of unresolved complexity. Cost is felt (estrangement, tremors) but not escalated through new pressure; the conflict remains internal and static in action, though rich in reflection. Protagonist agency drives the deepening, satisfying lens requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—translating private pain into universal language—is signaled early and deepened when Maya chooses to speak rather than soothe. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her decision to share Thomas’s story narrows emotional options and forces Elias toward endurance. Cost is unmistakable: “burns that still weep,” “empty box lighter now.” Coincidence (Elias waiting) complicates but doesn’t resolve—their meeting is framed as necessary, not accidental.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—revitalizing failing timelines through “elegant geometry of possibility”—is signaled early and deepens as trial balloons return with data. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: Elara adjusts patterns based on feedback, turning despair from constant to coefficient. Cost is felt in her exhaustion and perpetual readiness, though the absence of irreversible loss or tangible sacrifice prevents full 9+ entry. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with one meaningful intensification—the synchronization of timelines.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving memory against erasure—is signaled early and deepens when Mara uncovers Elias’s guilt and the hidden negative. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: she chooses to descend, to read, to interpret, to carry forward. The tightening occurs when she realizes walls “dream of wholeness,” transforming her mission from mapping to bearing witness. Cost is felt: she inherits Elias’s burden, and the final image shows her weighed down yet purposeful under a changed sky.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—revealing possibilities before the bell rings—is signaled early and tightens as the borrowed heartbeat falters, forcing Elias to sing faster. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens: each verse coaxes more futures, culminating in “cascading possibilities.” Cost is unmistakable—the heartbeat’s return leaves the clockmaker “wondering why they felt briefly infinite,” a poignant conceptual price. Coincidence (the bell) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Elias completes his work just in time.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—ending the forever war through mutual care—is signaled early and tightened by Elara’s choice to use ritual over treaty. Protagonist agency drives escalation: she reveals soil, not contracts; invites child forward; explains biological necessity. Cost is visceral: general’s tremor, commander’s grief, ash-mixed earth. The deepening (peace as imperfect, requiring tending) narrows options to shared labor or starvation, coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving the echo of extinction—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s agency: he engineers the drought, locates the site via cracked earth, and performs the burial. The meaningful tightening occurs when he chooses ritual over possession, foreclosing any scientific or public use of the egg. Cost is unmistakable: “ecological atrocities” committed, tribes evicted, rivers poisoned—all for a private, unverifiable act of reverence. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, intensifying through sensory and moral density rather than external opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—harvesting echoes before conformity scrubs memory—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency: Lys races against drugged contentment, untangles time-threads despite resistance, and endures phantom failures. The tightening is visceral: three minutes to act, threads humming with predecessors’ defeats, snow deepening its “alarming serenity.” Cost is unmistakable—she carries not just memories but the weight of all who failed, stepping into a sanctuary that mirrors her possible fates. Escalation is driven by her choices, not coincidence, under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—ethical responsibility in storytelling—is signaled early and tightened decisively when Marcus chooses to become audience rather than manipulator. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency: his rewinding of the tape leads directly to his descent into the alley, and his surrender to the blind woman forces the climactic realization. Cost is unmistakable: he forfeits his entire method (scripts, stick, perch) and identity (“urbane sophistication dissolving”). The meteor hush externalizes mounting pressure, culminating in a stance crystallization that forecloses his old path with total commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—honoring overlooked histories through impermanent witness—is signaled early and tightens via the live clock of the last migration. Elara’s agency drives escalation: each tower built narrows her options (she must dismantle the oldest to continue), culminating in the irreversible act of leaving post-migration. Cost is unmistakable: she cannot save the species, only dignify its end, and pays with solitude and emotional labor. The “interrupted cadence” deepens from description to structural principle governing both butterfly flight and narrative rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving transcribed memory—is signaled early and deepens when Elara risks destroying the scrap to illuminate it. Escalation is protagonist-driven: reconfiguring the rope braids narrows options (only precise alignment captures light) and exacts cost (emotional labor of undoing ancestral knots). Under Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via cadence shift from stillness to humming potential. Coincidence never resolves; aurora’s role is environmental, not deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—whether to uphold a decaying directive or surrender to a path that chooses her—is signaled early and deepens through the storm’s approach and the ritual preparation. The meaningful tightening occurs when she ingests the compound, narrowing options from passive waiting to active transcendence. Agency is fully hers: she breaks the seal, brews the brew, walks away. The cost is felt physically (unsteady legs), symbolically (melted wax), and existentially (no return to guardianship). Pressure accumulates texturally, not causally, consistent with the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—activating ancient devotion through empirical rigor—is signaled early and deepens when the tile’s proportions match equinoctial precession. Elior’s agency drives escalation: he maps vectors, speaks integers, presses his palm. The cost is unmistakable: blood sacrifice, irreversible alignment with the incoming dynasty, and the end of his frugal isolation. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from his parsimonious preparation meeting geometric necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—teaching resentment to release—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s tactical use of empathy-as-strategy. Pressure escalates as the entity’s gravity threatens to collapse the sanctuary, forcing Elias to act before reality reconfigures irreversibly. His agency drives the turn: winding the pin isn’t symbolic but functional, unlocking resentment via bodily memory. Cost is visible: the decades of scheming, the reopened wound of the music box, and the burden of carrying incomplete peace into a noisy world.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—capturing the dream before it vanishes—is signaled early and tightens via protagonist agency: Elias chooses to merge instrument and craft, risking dissolution of self. Escalation is driven by his breath-matching ritual, which narrows options (he must synchronize or fail) and deepens stakes (consciousness merges with glass). Cost is unmistakable: his grounded body anchors a process that nearly unmoors his mind. Coincidence never resolves; success stems from deliberate, costly alignment.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether to mend human failure through rigid preservation or adaptive acceptance—is signaled early and deepens when Mara finds the forgotten tools instead of her kit. Her agency drives escalation: choosing grafting over restoration, speaking to absent loved ones, securing masonry with resin and wire. The cost is unmistakable: she forgoes contractual redemption for seasonal return, accepting irreversible loss (the silence with her daughter) as part of growth. Coincidence (finding the bag) complicates but doesn’t resolve; her choices do.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—deciphering the forbidden knowledge embedded in the shell—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes it’s internal, not external. The meaningful tightening occurs when she shifts from seeking an object to recognizing herself as the cipher. Cost is visible in her “brightened disquiet” and the surrender of linear agency, though the pressure remains largely internal and philosophical. Escalation is driven by her inquiry, but the lack of external opposition or tangible consequence slightly softens the stakes’ visceral impact.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—preserving unlearned lessons against paradox-induced erasure—is signaled early and escalates through Elara’s realization that her polyglot expertise is devalued currency. The tightening occurs when she must “research the gaps in her own comprehension,” forcing a trade-off: abandon linguistic mastery for botanical silence. Cost is legible in the chrononaut’s fading—he’s not saved but rendered unnecessary—and in Elara’s acceptance that some knowledge blooms only in seasons beyond intervention. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural escalation: density of botanical-semiotic rules intensifies until the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recapturing conjoined narrative—is signaled early and tightens when Maya braids escape/separation threads, foreclosing passive grief. Pressure escalates via memory-altered architecture and fog’s weight, culminating in the choice to grasp not a nameplate but a hand. Cost is felt: surrendering singular identity for plural myth. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from Maya’s weaving.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—ending centuries of war by restoring a lost treaty—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s realization that absence is “presence inverted.” The tightening occurs when she chooses to reconfigure the rope, narrowing options from observation to intervention. Cost is felt in the weight of rewriting causality, though the physical toll is minimal. Agency is clear: Elara’s actions drive escalation, and luck (the alignment) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the rope’s pattern must still be deciphered and rewoven.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—quiet as survival—is signaled early and deepens when Mara realizes she must *conjure* rather than find the bloom of hush. The tightening occurs at the hairline fracture, which forces her shift from observation to action. Cost is unmistakable: her body as instrument, her breath as resource, her future bound to vigilance. Escalation is driven by her agency under Accumulative pressure, not coincidence, and the final stillness carries the weight of sustained effort.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—proving coincidence is coherence—is signaled early and tightens when the prism reveals the Thornwheel alignment, narrowing Elara’s window to hours. Escalation is driven by her agency: decades of collecting “coincidences like seeds” culminate in a high-stakes choice with visible cost (solitary burden, physical strain). The Accumulative lens intensifies pressure through pattern recognition—debris spirals, bird returns—until the cosmic key crystallizes options. Luck complicates (waiting 84 years) but doesn’t resolve; her retrocognition enables translation, not magic.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving the founders’ last memories before they’re lost to time—is signaled early and tightens as the storm intensifies and fog rises. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to measure anomalous shadows, conjecture transformation over death, and finally use rainwater instead of ink, each choice narrowing options (e.g., once recorded, memories “belong to history”). The cost is legible: her preemptive nostalgia becomes literal erasure as she joins the archive. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens—density of whispering voices, shadow shifts, and storm pulses deepen until the Charged Poise of her stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—repealing hopelessness’ gravity—is signaled early and deepens via Elian’s tightening spiral, which narrows options (burning the map to find territory). Agency drives escalation: his chants disrupt despair-pools; his staff-dip ignites the formula. Cost is unmistakable: physical strain (“gravity… in his knees”), tool exhaustion, irreversible destruction of the mosaic. No coincidence resolves conflict—only his serious playfulness.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—whether their relationship survives transition—is signaled early and deepens through Maya’s professional metaphor: “I spend my life in the margins.” The tightening occurs when she reframes the narrator’s silence as part of her decision-making calculus (“I cannot predict what you’ll do with your silence”). Though pressure is internal and lyrical, it escalates meaningfully: from unspoken question to shared inhabitation of uncertainty. The cost is felt—foregone answers, evaporating time—but lacks a concrete forfeiture (e.g., missed opportunity, physical departure), slightly muting stakes under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—collecting the gilded hush before gravity snaps back—is signaled early and escalates through protagonist agency: climbing the forbidden ladder, pressing the doll into shimmering air, racing against churning clouds. The meaningful tightening occurs when she captures the silence, which immediately raises the cost: she must now descend or be lost forever. The visible price—carrying heavy stillness into crushing darkness—alters her tactics and crystallizes her stance. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with time and physics as relentless antagonists.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—whether silence can comfort those who fear emptiness—is signaled early and deepened through Mara’s calibration of acoustic pressure. The tightening occurs when the storm glass clouds, triggering a precise 12-minute window of deadened sound; Mara seizes this to catalyze transformation. Agency is subtle but present: her adjustments aren’t passive observation but active orchestration. The cost is conceptual yet undeniable—the architect must relinquish rigid control (blueprints) to receive solace, a trade-off made visible in her lowered shoulders.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—restoring cultural memory versus seizing power—is signaled early and deepens when Elara chooses stairs over throne. The three-hour sunrise clock narrows options, forcing tactical precision in peeling paint and navigating tunnels. Agency is clear: her sally initiates the climax, and her refusal to claim dominion forecloses tyranny. Cost is legible: the ruby’s purpose ends, the stairway vanishes, and she bears “the weight of ages” alone—no rescue, no shared glory.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—teaching suffocation to breathe—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s “careful burning.” The tightening occurs when Mira crosses the threshold: his plan risks failure, demanding he re-engage without rescuing. Cost is unmistakable: his solitude is the price for her autonomy. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (his past choices enable her present return), and the final trade-off—her departure, his endurance—is coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—escaping or repurposing extractive systems—is signaled early and deepens when Maya realizes “the multiverse ran its own pyramids.” Her agency peaks in volunteering not to the scheme but to transformation, a choice that narrows options (she can’t flee pressure) and incurs cost (bearing all failed selves). Escalation is driven by her interpretation of the bolt, not coincidence, and the quantum promise’s ambiguity forces a stance that crystallizes under Accumulative pressure. The tightening—from harvesting mushrooms to becoming a pressure vessel—is seamless and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—uncovering hidden truth to collapse a dynasty—is signaled early and deepens through the resonator’s activation. Pressure escalates texturally: from static deception to dynamic, fragile revelation requiring Kael’s steady hand. The tightening occurs when the spring winds down, forcing urgent transcription before evidence vanishes—a meaningful cadence shift that raises stakes without new external forces. Cost is legible: the murdered archivist, the buried poets, and the moral weight of truth as both weapon and burden. However, escalation is passive (Kael reacts to mechanism decay rather than overcomes active opposition), slightly limiting agency under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—capturing “the precise moment when potential crystallized into being without losing its infinite alternatives”—is signaled early and deepens through Valen’s choreographed surrender. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: studying diagrams, performing gestures, unsnapping armor—all narrow options toward dissolution. Cost is visceral: each clasp released accelerates reality shifts, culminating in loss of singular identity. The “shivering bliss” of becoming “everything” carries conceptual weight—freedom demands annihilation of the self that sought it.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—whether small kindnesses matter when unwitnessed—is signaled early and deepened through Maya’s discovery of the button pattern. Escalation is driven by her agency: she cross-references files, compiles an index, photographs dust. Cost is felt in her redefined labor (cleaning only after documentation) and emotional shift from broken-hearted to “examined conviction.” The sergeant’s off-stage pressure is coherent; coincidence (dust anomaly) complicates but doesn’t resolve—Maya’s choices do.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving unaltered history against state revisionism—is signaled early and deepens when radio silence confirms betrayal. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he reads puddles, runs, inserts the key. The cost is felt in compatriots’ detention, his solitude, and the irreversible exposure of truth. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies through sensory and symbolic density, not plot turns, culminating in a broadcast that cannot be censored.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preventing apocalyptic melody—is signaled early and escalates through natural phenomena (dew, mist, algae) that embody the prophecy’s encroachment. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his inverse silence counters each droplet’s threat, narrowing options until only one “note of emptiness” remains. Cost is unmistakable: his body heaves, memories wound, and tomorrow’s return is inevitable. The tightening—from memory to suspended dewdrop—is precise, causal under an Accumulative lens, and irrevocable.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—decoding the falling leaves before the hush ends—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes monuments are receivers, not memorials. His agency drives escalation: he chooses to prod the bark, rearrange cairns, scatter seeds. The cost is existential: his humanity dissolves into bark and wind. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies through pattern breaks (leaves reversing descent) and cadence shifts (feverish care → mossy laughter).

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—vindicating the admiral by retrieving the compass—is signaled early and tightens when Elara realizes “coincidence becomes pattern.” The escalation is driven by her agency: she abandons timetables to trust breath and intuition, paying the price of her lifelong certainty. The waterfall’s chaotic stones force a trade-off: control or access. Cost is unmistakable—the surrender of her methodical identity—and the stakes deepen from historical truth to personal transformation, all under coherent Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—redeeming Kael without violating alchemical law—is signaled early and tightens when Elara abandons restoration for kintsugi reconfiguration. Escalation is protagonist-driven: she pushes formulas until they “bend like light,” testing causality’s tensile strength. Cost is unmistakable: her prior caution becomes luminous regret, paid in sleepless labor and acceptance of irreversible change. Coincidence never resolves; only precise, painful application of principle does.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—freeing souls trapped by unexpressed joy—is signaled early and deepens when the umbrella spirit’s confession reveals laughter as cage. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she adjusts strings, offers blood, plays through pain. Cost is unmistakable: bleeding fingers, emotional weight of “luminous ache.” The tightening—from one ghost to dozens—narrows Elara’s path: she must descend again, foreclosing rest. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from her choices under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—discovering the mathematics of mercy—is signaled early and deepens through Elena’s proprioceptive navigation. The tightening occurs when the forest demands “ultraviolet penance,” forcing her to translate trauma into trajectory. Agency is clear: she chooses to stand, to move, to solve for x. Cost is unmistakable—the snapped strap, the scar, the vertebrae clicking like a lock—and directly shapes the final image of walking forward with calibrated mercy.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—honoring overlooked histories—is signaled early and deepens via the nanny’s encoded presence. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to unfasten, invoking cost through loosened “anchors of intuition.” The tightening occurs when she speaks Mara’s name, irrevocably altering memory’s fabric. Yet the price remains conceptual; no tangible resource (time, safety, tool integrity) is visibly spent, slightly muting the cost under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes escalate from professional assessment (“defunct service elevator”) to ontological intervention (“anchor it… keep a door open between worlds”). Maya’s agency drives every turn: she follows dust, breaches the crack, interprets tally marks, installs the mainspring. The dominant stake—time suspended by grief—tightens when she realizes the ringmaster has been winding the spring in death. Cost is unmistakable: she inherits the weight of “unfinished hours,” a burden now buoyant but enduring. No coincidence resolves; only skilled observation and empathetic action alter the haunting’s physics.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—compressing eternity into a living moment—is signaled early and deepened through tactile acts (casting plates, aligning the bottle). Pressure escalates via reality’s “reluctance,” groaning press, vibrating glass. Agency is total: Elara alone initiates rupture. Cost is conceptual (loss of perfection) and felt (cloud-sea storms, shattered stasis), unmistakable in the final rush of “compressed infinity.”

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—how to interpret the asteroid’s civilization—tightens when Kaelen defies Voss and uncovers mirrors, risking madness to prove memory over domination. His agency drives escalation: three storms of observation culminate in demonstrable proof that reshapes the council’s stance. Cost is felt in his isolation, tears, and permanent stay—renouncing departure to become custodian. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—preserving dawn by maintaining the covenant of rust—is signaled early and escalates through a single, decisive deepening: the philosopher’s stone wilts near dishonesty, forcing absolute truth as the price of success. Elias’s agency drives the escalation; his pure intention causes the chip to blaze, directly countering midnight’s advance. The cost is unmistakable: the stone’s dissolution is irreversible, and the world’s survival hinges on one man’s unclouded heart. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative/Textural lens, with each harmonic layer pushing back the dark until the final tilt toward morning.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—finding the coordinates where reason fails—is signaled early and deepens when the compass reveals its true purpose. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to descend, clear the hatch, open vials knowing they’ll “yield only confusion.” The cost is conceptual (abandoning proof) and existential (carrying a truth the world can’t validate). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; each layer of descent tightens the thematic coil without coincidence or soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—reimagining sculpture as conversation with the dead—is signaled early and deepens when the lantern slide reveals “timewoven alliances.” Mara’s agency lies in renunciation: she stops fighting the storm and begins collaborating with it, a meaningful tightening that forecloses her old method of “imposing will.” The cost is conceptual but legible: she surrenders authorial control, trusting the wood’s “accumulated wisdom.” Pressure escalates texturally through the storm’s intensification and the slide’s revelations, culminating in a stance crystallization that feels earned under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding why beauty blooms in darkness—is signaled early and deepens through Lyra’s daily pilgrimage and artistic revision. The tightening occurs when the sexton reveals the window’s triple-layered construction, forcing Lyra to reinterpret not just the art but her mother’s life. Agency is clear: she chooses to repaint, replacing somber hues with golds that “pulsed beneath the surface.” Cost is felt: grief transmuted through labor, solitude endured until it becomes dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—bearing witness to submerged truth—is signaled early and tightens when Elias realizes he must descend to arrange debris. The meaningful deepening occurs when 1963 “bleeds into now” and victims appear, raising emotional and ontological stakes. Agency is clear: Elias chooses to complete the circuit, foreclosing passive archiving. Cost is felt in his eroding temporal grip and the irreversible burden of communion, though escalation leans slightly more on revelation than tactical narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—whether to revive the past or invent the future—is signaled early and deepens when Elara confronts the seductive pull of false comfort. Escalation is driven entirely by her agency: manipulating neural architectures, rejecting easy resurrection, compressing empirical knowledge into the bottle. The cost is unmistakable: she forfeits the ghost of communal joy for the burden of founding a new social contract. This trade-off narrows options irreversibly and reweights the final image with ethical gravity.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—archiving emotional truth—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes the *discarded* shavings, not the recordings, hold the city’s unspoken longing. His agency drives escalation: choosing to ingest the shaving, he immerses in memory-as-method, foreclosing his prior detached scribe role. Cost is unmistakable: he absorbs “ten thousand confessions,” becoming vessel rather than curator. The tightening—from observer to participant—is earned through his own ritualistic practice turned inward.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reopening sealed time through seed inheritance—is signaled early and tightens when the vortex hatches, forcing Elara to act. Escalation is driven by her agency: singing, placing the cap, stepping into the spiral. The deepening occurs when entropy reversal awakens extinct seeds, raising stakes from personal duty to ecological resurrection. Cost is unmistakable: she trades her temporal belonging for stewardship, enduring “borrowed time” with no exit. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from her choices under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving communal listening over mechanical noise—is signaled early and tightens at zero hour. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses the bell despite system readiness, foreclosing reliance on automation. Cost is felt: future villagers must relearn sky-reading, and she risks institutional censure. Pressure coheres under Situational lens; no coincidence resolves conflict—only her craft and conviction.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—finding meaning in surrender—is signaled early and deepens through Elian’s shift from cataloguing to empathizing. The escalation occurs when the brilliant meteor fragments, prompting his intuitive tracing and barefoot dance, which narrows his options from maintenance to participation. Agency is expressed through attention and ritual, not action, yet the cost is felt: he abandons scientific detachment for vulnerable kinship. Under an Accumulative lens, this single intensification suffices, though the pressure remains internal rather than external.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving unspoken words—is signaled early via the box’s “weight that pulled at his ribs” and tightens when ghosts reveal the covenant’s breach. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his observation (“how ghosts paused at certain boxes”) leads to opening the box, which triggers the transfer of memory burden. Cost is unmistakable: he trades potential healing for eternal witness, sitting “becoming part of architecture of abandonment.” The Accumulative lens intensifies pressure through sensory density (light bending, phantom clover) until silence itself becomes the only viable action.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving temporal order—tightens meaningfully when Elara realizes numbers didn’t mutate but evolved, foreclosing her clockwork mission. The deepening occurs at the breach: extracting the shard forces a trade-off between hoarding fragments and surrendering to continuity. Cost is unmistakable: her borrowed-time existence ends, replaced by archived presence. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, though the shift from “stitching order” to “sovereign continuity” hinges on a single revelatory beat rather than layered pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—beauty in incompleteness—is signaled early and tightened when the poet confronts the ruined kite, forcing a choice between illusion (restoration) and truth (reconfiguration). Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she initiates the repair method, binds the feather, and teaches the boy a new way to see. Cost is felt in the kite’s altered flight and the boy’s initial grief, though the emotional price remains lightly rendered. Coincidence (the snapped string) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems entirely from her practiced philosophy.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—remodeling the orchard into an interspecies embassy—is signaled early and deepens as health declines. Elias’s agency drives escalation: each wiring act narrows time while expanding connection. The tightening is meaningful: from grandfather oak to central crown, culminating in bioluminescent communication. Cost is legible in every paragraph—labored breath, steady hands, burial among roots—and shapes tactics until the final chord.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—decoding the “chemistry of homecoming”—is signaled early and deepens through the convergence at the tower, which forecloses retreat into institutional orthodoxy. The meaningful tightening occurs when the four researchers unite, transforming solitary doubt into collective resistance with visible cost: they’ve abandoned careers, comfort, and sanctioned science. Agency is clear—Elara initiates the pilgrimage, others follow—and the stakes escalate from personal hypothesis to shared epiphany. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; pressure crystallizes stance under the inferred Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—transforming tragedy into topsoil—is signaled early and deepens through avian-guided fertilization. Pressure escalates texturally: from seed arrangement to chemical calibration to whispered dialogue with pods. The coachman’s agency is quiet but decisive: he chooses specific ratios, specific languages, specific placements. Cost is unmistakable: the reef is dead, the battlefield scarred, the languages extinct—yet he works anyway. No coincidence; every nutrient mix is earned through linguistic labor, embodying the story’s core ethic: resurrection requires translation.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—translating loss into closeness—is signaled early and deepens through Ash’s three-day search, which narrows options (other dogs abandon the hunt) and raises emotional cost (confronting perpetual grayness). The riddle’s resolution forces a conceptual trade-off: accepting memory as sufficient proxy for presence. Agency is clear—Ash’s unique method enables the discovery—and coincidence (finding the tin box) complicates but doesn’t resolve; his skill decodes it. Deduction only for slight underdevelopment of the “eastern battlefields” as off-stage pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—finding bearings in temporal chaos—is signaled early and tightens when Elara perceives the fixed point, narrowing options to one frequency-specific exit. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: sketching transforms memorial into methodology, altering her relationship to distortion. Cost is unmistakable: three objective years vs. three subjective centuries of isolation. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—amending a broken treaty—is signaled early and deepens through the chess-piece exchange, each swap correcting a lie with tangible emotional cost (e.g., releasing “forgotten laughter of children”). Pressure escalates coherently: the guardian’s threat (“turns your bones to chalk”) forces urgency, and Kael’s physical deterioration raises stakes. The final act forecloses his old identity as thief, replacing it with keeper—a renunciation with visible cost. Slight deduction: the guardian’s cooperation feels minimally resisted, softening opposition just enough to reduce tension at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—truth versus protective lies—is signaled early and tightens when Mira chooses to unbind the ledger despite personal risk. The escalation is driven by her agency: walking patterns spell intent, then action follows. Cost is dual: exposure of erased lives and admission of her own complicity. The penumbra’s shift and sunlight’s arrival aren’t coincidence but environmental response to her choice, reinforcing that stakes are moral and historical, not merely personal. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, deepening through textual and spatial accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—constructing home versus fleeing memory—tightens decisively when the substitution falters, forcing Vey to confront truth instead of bury it. Agency drives escalation: choosing the feather over hands, carrying the stone upward, seeding glyphs. Cost is unmistakable: relinquishing protective illusions, letting grief pool in the chest. The deepening (“home was actually a grammar”) reweights all prior actions under the Accumulative lens, with no coincidental resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—absolution through decoding—is signaled early and tightens when the labyrinth clicks, foreclosing Kaelen’s path of self-punishment. Escalation is driven by his agency: each extracted thread narrows his emotional options until the final revelation. Cost is unmistakable: seven years of exile, the weight of a village’s frozen time. The thunder’s release proves stakes were visceral, not abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—preventing the Overseers from locking a singular history—is clear early and tightens as the spire glows. Kael’s agency drives escalation: first reciting polished verses, then surrendering to raw doubt, enabling Lira’s chaotic amplification. The cost is unmistakable: Kael’s voice fades into the bone. The Overseers’ shouted commands turning into questions shows how the echo system actively subverts their authority, proving pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—conjuring meaning before erasure—is signaled early and tightens relentlessly as the workshop sinks. Each crater-narration deepens pressure, narrowing options: Elara must work faster, risking incomplete repair. The cost is unmistakable: she sacrifices her master’s ashes, her safety, and ultimately her physical world for golden truth. Agency drives escalation—no coincidence; her quilting of memories directly sutures history into permanence under rising acid.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—honoring a promise to complete Marguerite’s work—is signaled early and deepens when the wrong turn escalates pressure, forcing Elias to confront not just memory but the possibility of new creation. The meaningful tightening occurs when he chooses to press forward despite panic, foreclosing retreat to the “empty flat.” Cost is unmistakable: he leaves the shell behind, gifting its colors to stone—a permanent forfeiture that enables his return to art. Agency drives every escalation; luck complicates (wrong turn) but resolution is earned through stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—saving lives through gentleness vs. brute force—is signaled early and deepens when the foghorn fails and fishermen die. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he doesn’t wait for permission; he builds, places, and activates the cork. The meaningful tightening occurs when he chooses tenderness over Voss’s exhausted shouting, foreclosing the path of volume. Cost is visible: emotional exhaustion, risk of insubordination, and the near-loss of the garden. The resolution is earned through his renunciation of noise, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—navigating the geography of loss—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when the censer foot becomes the compass pivot, narrowing options from passive waiting to active construction. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she interprets cryptic instructions, adapts to cognitive tides, and repurposes hydraulic lines into memory conduits. Cost is unmistakable: during new moons she “claw[s] at walls,” and the final choice entails permanent exile from linear time and physical rescue. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, deepening from static endurance to ritualized mapping with each lunar phase.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—psychological safety—is signaled early and tightens when the glass eye is found, forcing Maren to choose between compliance and occlusion. Escalation is driven by her agency: reading discredited texts, preparing the ritual, speaking devastating truths. The cost is unmistakable: she risks exposure, yet gains a fragile sanctuary. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens—each storm gust, each fungal thread deepens the need for silence, culminating in a stance crystallized by action, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—decoding witnessed isolation—is signaled early and deepens through Maren’s investigation of negative space, which narrows options from passive tending to active inheritance. The escalation is driven by her agency: observing gaps, reconstructing farewells, choosing to mirror the gesture. Cost is felt in the boutonnière’s heat and the acceptance of eternal watch; the tightening forecloses escape or forgetfulness. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure grows via textural density, not causal chains, yet remains coherent and stakes are viscerally legible.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—honoring Thomas’s promise before the creek seals him in—is signaled early and tightens relentlessly via the rising water clock. Arthur’s agency drives escalation: he reads ants, places the chip, presses it into the fissure. The cost—potential drowning or entombment—is visceral and shapes every move. Coincidence (the rain) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the doorway responds only to his deliberate act under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reinterpreting prophecy through sacrifice—is signaled early and tightens when Elara commands the chaos to “weave.” The climb itself forecloses return; the cost (earthly power) is paid before the climax. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her “softly commanding” shapes the path and stills the bleeding. Coincidence (Mara’s appearance) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the decisive turn is Elara’s choice to reach into the pool.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—capturing the “density of presence”—is signaled early and deepens when Mira’s whisper crystallizes the air, forcing Elara to choose between recording words or capturing the space between them. The meaningful tightening occurs in that choice: she activates instruments not for transcription but for transmutation, narrowing options to a single, high-stakes act. Cost is visible in the sealed shell (foreclosing further alteration) and the dried palette (permanent etching of resolve). Agency is fully protagonist-driven; coincidence plays no role in resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—distilling chaos into narrative—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes control is lost upon seeing his grave. The tightening occurs when jealousy transforms from resentment into propulsion, narrowing his options to either fragment or soar. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, with clear cost: he surrenders chronological certainty for narrative detachment. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres through internal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming meaning after sensory loss—is signaled early and deepens through Mara’s handling of the screw, which forces her to confront transition as both midwife and clock-repairer. Escalation is driven by her agency: she doesn’t just find the screw; she interrogates its journey, maps emotional terrain visually, and chooses to return it only after understanding. Cost is unmistakable: she trades immediacy of scent for laborious, patient noticing. The “trembling calm” isn’t passive—it’s the tension of endurance with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—completing the transmutation before the storm breaks—is signaled early and tightens as scars spread toward her hands. The held breath is a live clock that narrows options: she must write faster, endure longer. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing childhood chants over academic rigor unlocks the magic. Cost is unmistakable: physical strain, emotional vulnerability (tear), and the risk of permanent loss of dexterity. The final act forecloses her old silence, replacing it with narrative authority.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—delivering an apology before geographic severance—is signaled early and tightens relentlessly via the dawn deadline. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she modifies the theremin, adjusts current, opens the bottle. Cost is unmistakable: shattered vessel, unwritten column, unrecoverable reputation. The “imperfect miracle” deepens stakes by foreclosing full redemption, forcing trade between truth and mercy under accumulating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving meaning against entropic silence—is signaled early and deepens as definitions crumble into dust. The tightening occurs when the dictionary’s entries begin bleeding into one another, forcing the protagonist to arbitrate not just words but the very fabric of signification. Her agency drives escalation: each circuit outward/inward is a deliberate act that narrows options until only unification remains. Cost is unmistakable: the erasure of her own path, the dissolution of language into blankness, and her absorption into the silence she sought to delay.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—understanding time’s true nature—is signaled early and deepens through the counting method, which strips away “the tyranny of tomorrow.” The tightening occurs when the shepherd realizes clocks measure “resistance… the fight of moments against oblivion,” narrowing his options to renunciation. Cost is legible: he abandons the only inheritance from his father, forgoing continuity for truth. Agency is consistent—his backward count is a deliberate tactic that reweights his perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—protecting the network vs. allowing connection—is signaled early and tightened when Eli appears, forcing Maya to choose between defense and openness. The meaningful deepening occurs when she recognizes his intrusion as pilgrimage, not theft, altering her understanding of her own work. Cost is legible: she surrenders her role as guardian, placing the laser pointer down—a visible forfeiture of control. Escalation is driven by Maya’s perception shift, not coincidence, under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reconciling control and surrender in the face of mortality—is established early and tightens through Maya’s choice to seek meaning in randomness despite medical warnings. The meaningful deepening occurs when she recognizes her father’s gambling as “distorted worship” versus her own “discipline” of uncertainty, altering her teaching philosophy. Cost is felt in her physical fragility (“damaged heart beating a cautious tempo”) and intellectual vulnerability (calculating meaning in scratches). Escalation is driven by her agency, not coincidence, though the pressure remains internal and accumulative rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—cultivated estrangement as antidote to dependency—is signaled early and deepens through Mara’s agency: she escalates pressure by spinning the disc faster for the suicidal teen, forcing a trade-off between comfort and necessary isolation. Under the Accumulative lens, escalation reads as cadence shift (disc skips inserting memory gaps) that reweights despair as a “wrong number that could be politely declined.” Cost is unmistakable: Mara sacrifices reciprocal connection (“disconnected before gratitude could anchor them both”), and each caller forfeits the illusion of resolution. The streetlamp handoff—a live clock—tightens decisions, making hangs-ups feel fated yet chosen.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—preserving fragile memory against entropy—is signaled early and deepens when the covenant demands immediate action. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses slowness over speed, documentation over despair, knowing one crushed flower could erase decades of grief. The cost is legible in the curling photograph and her “wet sugar” euphoria—precious dissolution held but not stopped. Coincidence never resolves; physics of proximate causes makes stakes feel inevitable, not arbitrary.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—loneliness as disaster—tightens when the child arrives, forcing Elias to confront his own isolation. The escalation is protagonist-driven: his rumor-spreading catalyzes the network, but the child’s gesture inverts his system, demanding emotional surrender over transaction. Cost is felt in the relinquishment of control (“reciprocity had inverted”) and the admission that he, too, requires relief. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure crescendos via accumulating confessions until the child’s arrival reweights the entire economy of exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—navigating uncharted emotional depths—is signaled early and deepens as Elara moves from mapping others to confronting her own void. The single meaningful tightening occurs at the stillpoint, where silence forces reckoning; this narrows her options from avoidance to acceptance. Agency is clear: she chooses to kneel, press her hands, and map herself. Cost is legible in the “rivers of fear” and “contours of grief” now made visible—no off-stage resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—freeing the colony ships—is signaled early and tightens when Elara realizes certainty would “shatter like glass.” Her agency drives escalation: she chooses “deliberate imprecision” over control, accepting that “confidently uncertain” is the only viable stance. Cost is legible: the pen crumbles, ghost interpreters fade, and she endures solitude. The anomaly’s irregular pulse externalizes rising pressure, and the ships’ emergence confirms stakes were materialized, not merely declared.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to forgotten hours—is signaled early and tightened through Elias’s escalating acts: from measuring silence between gulls to conducting the harbor’s breath. The “three beats” Mara signs narrows options into rhythmic structure. Cost is felt in his deafness, frailty, and the irreversible choice to create in a language only the heart hears. Agency drives every deepening; no coincidence resolves tension.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—rescuing indigenous wisdom from colonial distortion—is signaled early and tightens through each artistic act that filters seekers by intent. Maya’s agency drives escalation: she chooses vulnerability (leaving clues in ruins) over continued destruction. The cost is visible in her trembling hands and soot-streaked tears, and the final act forecloses her anonymity permanently. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with each creation raising the stakes of exposure versus preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—resurrecting Elena through harmonic alignment—is signaled early and deepens via Kael’s drumming escalation. Agency is clear: his rhythm *creates* the apparition. Cost is unmistakable: physical pain (“palms stinging”), emotional rupture (“hand dissipating”), and cyclical futility (“waiting for the next hush”). The facility’s mechanical exhale complicates but doesn’t resolve; victory is ephemeral, earned solely through Kael’s will.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving the whisper network against institutional noise—is signaled early and deepens when the hospital ship’s need forces Kael to entrust the coin to an unformed apprentice. Agency manifests as endurance: choosing to pass knowledge despite risk. The geomagnetic storm isn’t coincidence; it’s the pressure that makes every shout a beacon and every whisper a lifeline. Cost is visible in the young worker’s tentative walk, now burdened with legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—teaching darkness to cradle light without consuming it—is signaled early and deepens through the guardian’s escalating orchestration of light. Agency is expressed through attention and pattern-making; each shutter adjustment narrows possibility into meaning. The fish’s ripple introduces chaos, forcing adaptation—a credible complication that tightens thematic pressure. Cost is felt: the guardian’s lifelong silence, the half-spoken secret never completed, yet the escalation remains internal and accumulative rather than causally urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—creating space for second thoughts—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s quiet coordination. The escalation is protagonist-driven: three weeks of listening, sketching, and precise timing culminate in the grotto ritual. Cost is unmistakable: he gives up the carved queen, his symbolic agency, and descends carrying only memory. The magnetic field doesn’t resolve conflict—it suspends it, making the rebellion one of attention, not victory.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—freedom through vulnerability—is signaled early (“defending that fortress”) and tightens when the whale’s call “pulls at the threads of her carefully constructed life.” Escalation is protagonist-driven: Elara chooses detachment, unlocking not just herself but others’ “guarded hearts.” Cost is unmistakable: loss of livelihood, persona, and terrestrial belonging. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure intensifies via rhythmic repetition (“detach… detach…”) and the scrimshaw’s escalating resonance, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—learning to feel authentic grief after compulsory happiness—is signaled early and deepened when the traveler arrives. Elias’s agency lies not in action but in *method*: he chooses to dramatize care, turning tea into theater to bridge numbness. The tightening occurs when he hands her the bird, foreclosing detachment and accepting the cost of vulnerability. Though coincidence brings the traveler, the resolution stems from Elias’s consistent tactic, not luck, and the remade hush remains a live constraint throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming silenced language through metamorphic art—is signaled early and escalates via Elara’s choice to paraphrase rather than recite, narrowing her options to a single, high-risk act of linguistic transmutation. The cost is legible: her physical form scatters into luminescent shadow. Agency drives escalation—she chooses to step forward, place her palm, speak—and the deepening comes when she realizes the cage was self-made. Under an Accumulative lens, this single intensification suffices, though the absence of a second complicating pressure keeps it just below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—bartering for awakening—is signaled early and deepens when Elara trades her monochrome landscape for furnace access. The tightening occurs when the reed sings not for her eyes but for Marin’s voice, forcing Elara to reframe her desire. Cost is felt: she relinquishes her hope of seeing color, accepting instead the “imperfect” beauty of her own perception. Agency drives escalation—her calculated flora, his choice to speak—and coincidence never resolves tension.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—rebuilding communal empathy through prescribed acoustic environments—is signaled early and deepened when Elara defies protocol to activate dormant archives. Pressure escalates via her discovery of cracks, then intensifies with her decision to strike rather than repair. The cost is tangible: she forgoes return, embracing permanent stewardship. Agency drives escalation; coincidence never resolves. The “artificial pilgrimage” tightens into a test of faith in brokenness over sterile order.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—making grief navigable through “genuinely artificial” memorials—is signaled early and deepens when the young man arrives clutching the water-stained crane. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to project his brother’s birth stars, merging celestial and personal maps. Cost is unmistakable in her isolation and his trembling vulnerability; the trade-off is clear—truth requires embracing falseness. Coincidence (meteor shower arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the breakthrough comes from focused ritual, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding the geometry of collapse—is signaled early and deepens when Mara shifts from prediction to diagnosis. The meaningful turn is her confession: “The cards aren’t predicting futures anymore,” which narrows options to retrospective mapping. Cost is legible in Elias’s “hollow look” and Mara’s renunciation of forward-looking prophecy. Agency lies in attention and measurement, not action, fitting the Accumulative lens; pressure tightens through intellectual revelation, not external threat.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—extracting truth without being erased—is signaled early and tightens when the pagoda appears, demanding chaos to unlock it. The meaningful deepening occurs at the data core: she must *become* randomness to purify history, risking annihilation by the very system she studies. Cost is unmistakable: collapse, weeping/laughing, bearing “the weight of what she learned.” Agency drives escalation—her dance isn’t luck but hard-won tactic from year three’s discovery about the Empire’s rigidity.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving hope before it dissolves—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes the shadow *is* hope’s metamorphosis. The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses not to destroy but to reframe, narrowing options from erasure to curation. Agency drives escalation: her editing forces the shadow to “see itself as guardian.” Cost is unmistakable: the all-night labor, the risk of failure, and the emotional weight of handling another’s lost joy. The stone’s journey from hand to water to suspension embodies the stake’s transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reconciling compassion with self-respect—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s reconstruction of the sanctuary. Escalation is driven by her agency: verifying permits, testifying, shedding symbols of deception. Cost is unmistakable: loss of partnership, complicity exposed, permanent scar of vulnerability. Pressure tightens coherently under Accumulative lens without false resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—retrieving his sister from displaced time—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes closure was the error. His agency drives escalation: he chooses to descend, reads the rings, and touches her hand, each act narrowing options. The cost is conceptual yet undeniable: accepting that some wounds must stay open. Luck complicates (avalanche survival) but doesn’t resolve; the meteor’s impact is backstory, not deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—locating unused love—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes the letters mourn not a person but the self’s unblemished capacity to love. This intensification narrows her task from discovery to precise mapping, raising emotional stakes. The cost is felt in her burdened departure and the theater’s “hushed thunder.” Slight deduction: the escalation relies more on insight than external pressure, which fits the Accumulative lens but lacks a tangible trade-off or forfeiture beyond emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity—is signaled early and tightens through each tracked star, culminating in the necessity of stillness. Protagonist agency drives escalation: she charts trajectories, steps over stones, surrenders deliberately. The cost is felt (hollowed chest, three-year blockage) and crystallizes in the final act: rest is the only viable path, foreclosing frantic effort. Coincidence complicates (aurora’s timing) but resolution stems from her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving unwritten futures—is signaled early and tightens when Kael realizes he must *become* the spark. Escalation is driven by his agency: speaking to the archive, placing the clock, stepping inside. Cost is legible in his renunciation of singular embodiment (“occasionally everywhere” now a permanent state). Under Accumulative lens, the deepening comes via density increase—the dune’s brightening mirrors his commitment—narrowing options to total self-distribution.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving harmonic resonance against philosophical pruning—is signaled early and tightens when Kael chooses to offer the gear instead of resist. The meaningful deepening occurs when he realizes the frontier must be pushed outward, not retreated into—a shift that narrows his options to reconciliation or complicity. Cost is legible: cycles of displacement, the ache of static, and the surrender of defensive isolation. Escalation is driven by Kael’s agency, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming agency lost to anxiety—is signaled early and deepens when the leash breaks. The meaningful tightening occurs when Mara realizes she isn’t searching for Atlas but for her former self; this reframing raises emotional stakes. Agency is demonstrated through her decision to press her palm to the star stamp and later to walk without the leash. Cost is felt in her trembling, unsteady steps and the irreversible loss of old safety protocols.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—whether silence is protection or prison—intensifies through the bellhop’s agency: he risks horror by showing the bolt, then chooses to protect rather than expose. The tightening occurs when sheet music reveals melody’s systematic erasure, transforming personal curiosity into moral reckoning. Cost is felt in the elders’ fear and his acceptance of “frostbitten hope,” and the final Charged Poise crystallizes options: endure silence as vigil, not surrender. Escalation is driven by discovery, not coincidence, under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—legitimacy versus forgery—is signaled early and deepens when the rune assembles, transforming abstract truth into visceral unmasking. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: the titan’s millennia of marginalia culminate in a single coordinated act of revelation. Cost is unmistakable: the pretender loses face, royalty, and historical memory; the titan sacrifices his sanctuary and purpose. One meaningful tightening suffices—the rune’s activation narrows all options to truth or exposure—and coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—discovering why paths disappear—is signaled early and deepens when Elena cross-references bleaching events with shipping logs. The meaningful tightening occurs when she grasps that institutional amnesia, not physical loss, erases navigable futures. Cost is legible: the fossil fuel ban stopped emissions but couldn’t recover lost knowledge. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (data assembly), though the pressure curve is subtle, fitting the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving sacred continuity beneath rebellion’s rubble—is signaled early and deepens through Mira’s shift from cataloging debris to ritual ignition. The tightening occurs when she realizes the lull isn’t cessation but preparation, forcing a renunciation of conventional warfare for ancestral resonance. Cost is legible: she trades tactical relevance for metaphysical stewardship, felt in her solitary stance amid sleeping gantries. Agency drives escalation—her deciphered words and focused light trigger the stones’ response, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether to unseal forbidden evolution—is signaled by line 3 and escalates through plant urgency, script decoding, and thermal calibration. The tightening occurs when Mira realizes the destiny is “not a command but a potential,” forcing her to choose between ancestral stasis and insurgent growth. Cost is legible: she violates sacred prohibition, risking social censure, yet the plants’ chorus validates her stance. Agency drives every escalation; coincidence (the kite’s presence) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the decoding requires her memory and biological attunement.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—cultivating hope amid irreparable loss—is signaled early and deepens when the wind’s frequency triggers a freeze. Elias’s agency lies not in action but in attention: he observes his trauma response like a rare bird, transforming paralysis into perception. The cost is legible: his survival demands daily confrontation with absence. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (choosing to stay present), and the final decision to plant three more saplings reweights endurance as resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming authentic perception—is signaled early and deepens when threads release others’ memories, forcing Mara to confront art as entrapment (“What is a portrait if not a trap for a moment?”). Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: sorting threads tightens reality, enabling the trapdoor discovery. Cost is felt in the relinquishment of control—she no longer paints faces but maps darkness. One meaningful deepening suffices; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding temporal dilation—is signaled early and tightens when the ink reveals localized fields, forcing the tracker’s ultimate choice: surrender to the pattern. The deepening occurs via protagonist agency (he uncorks the vial, steps into the fractal), and the cost—his physical form—is unmistakable in the evaporation. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens; the drone’s stall and wind’s howl externalize internal stakes without coincidence resolving tension. One meaningful tightening suffices, and it forecloses linear existence.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. manufactured war—is signaled early and deepens when the letter reveals scheduled battles. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she accesses networks, scans the letter, and triggers irreversible dissemination. The tightening is meaningful: neutrality becomes treason, preservation becomes provocation. Cost is felt—she knowingly invites neural erasure—and the final image makes the price undeniable: waiting peacefully for capture, surrounded by thawing history.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—cultivating peace in a post-collapse wasteland—is signaled early and deepens through Maya’s ritualized labor. The distant impact escalates pressure not through external threat but internal reaffirmation: she does not flinch, proving her stance is hardened, not fragile. Agency lies in attention and refusal; each pruning cut is a renunciation of inherited violence. Cost is felt in the weight of silence, the unused pistol, the ever-present thorns—peace requires constant, precise maintenance. Coincidence (the tower fragment) complicates but does not resolve; Maya’s response is wholly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—catching the goddess’s echo before cosmic dissolution—is signaled early and escalates as constellations “forget their names” and “tumble into one another.” Kael’s agency drives the deepening: his silence parts sound waves, his plunge anchors the echo. The cost is felt—the garden withers, silence reclaims territory, and the sky is left “blank as a fresh page”—but the escalation leans slightly on atmospheric intensification over tactical narrowing; the rail spike’s power feels discovered rather than constrained by prior rules.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—truth versus legacy—is signaled early and tightens when the orbital contradiction proves the fraud. Eleanor’s agency drives escalation: she doesn’t wait for the journalist but conducts her own proof by contradiction, foreclosing denial. The cost is economic and dynastic, yet legible in the wax seal “color of dried blood” and the presses waiting below. Pressure remains coherent under the Causal lens, with one meaningful deepening (the 1894 photograph disproving the orbit) that forces irreversible action.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reconciling abandonment—is signaled early and deepens when the cabinet arrives. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to read, then activate translation protocols, then tether. Each act narrows options (burning bridges with her past self) and carries cost (emotional exposure, risking temporal collapse). The meteor hush externalizes internal pressure, and the final turn—touching her younger self—resolves the want/fear tension (to reconnect vs. to flee) with irreversible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring communicative harmony in a sacred space—is signaled early and deepens when Mara realizes “the mess was the message.” Her agency drives escalation: she doesn’t wait for revelation but actively decodes chaos via mandala, then disrupts it to create reception. The cost is legible: the tile crumbles, voices are released, and the grotto’s loneliness is acknowledged—a conceptual price paid through irreversible alteration. One tightening (eastern quadrant disruption) suffices, executed with clear protagonist causality.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—how to remember the fire—is signaled early and tightens when Kael rejects both council proposals. The meaningful deepening occurs when retrocognition reveals the name in “negative space,” forcing a trade-off: endure the wound rather than heal or exploit it. Agency drives escalation: Kael’s choice to fit the tessera completes an unintended design, narrowing options to one radical act. Cost is felt: the plaza becomes a site of “warm coldness,” tender but unhealing.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preventing despair’s finality—is signaled early via Mara’s box cutter and deepened when Julian chooses song over silence. Escalation occurs through Julian’s agency: he sings, weaves echoes, offers the coin. The cost is legible: Mara abandons self-destruction; Julian relinquishes his encore craving for transference. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure intensifies via layered echoes and temporal folding, culminating in a decisive reconfiguration of fate without external intervention.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preventing neurological damage via pill recall—is signaled early and deepens when Maya pivots from doubt to action. The meaningful tightening occurs at the radiator: somatic markers intensify, forcing extraction of three bottles, which visibly alters her burden (“weight of her task”). Agency is constant: her devised method drives every turn. Cost is felt in physical strain and emotional toll, crystallizing in the dawn sanctuary shift.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving human emotional residue for future awakening—is signaled early and deepens through Kael’s increasing vulnerability (trembling hands, singing from the map itself). The meaningful tightening occurs when the fossil pulses in sync with Kael’s heartbeat, transforming tool into talisman and raising the cost: Kael must now carry not just data but kinship. Agency is clear: every action (floating, mapping, singing, ascending) is chosen, not circumstantial. The final image crystallizes stakes—Kael becomes the conduit between sleep and return—with the cost of eternal solitude implied in “connecting their solitary consciousness to the sleeping billions.”

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preventing the solstice collapse—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes the prophecy is a “knot,” not a sentence. The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses to unscramble it via button resonance, narrowing options from passive maintenance to active intervention. Cost is unmistakable: the jar’s destruction releases the echo permanently, sacrificing archival control for generative potential. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, with each button hum raising the stakes of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—fixing what’s broken—is signaled early and deepens when Elena chooses surrender over self-preservation. The tightening occurs in her decision to meet Marcus despite knowing he betrayed her; this narrows options to trust or isolation. Cost is unmistakable: she relinquishes her last secret, risking further betrayal. Escalation is driven by her agency (“prudently daring” steps), not coincidence, under a Causal lens where each beat follows from prior choices.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—ferrying only those who “truly needed reaching”—tightens via rising water, vanishing birdsong, and slowing rain, each narrowing the window for action. The coachman’s agency drives escalation: he reads the world through ambient awareness, and his final step onto the craft is earned, not granted by luck. Cost is felt in every withheld crossing, every rewoven vow. Coincidence complicates (storm), but resolution stems from his calibrated perception.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding permanence in a world of erosion—is signaled early and deepens via Kai’s agency: she chooses observation over intervention, presence over possession. The meaningful tightening occurs when she realizes the bees’ collective consciousness wove a net across time; this forecloses any attempt to “fix” or harvest. Cost is legible: she walks away empty-handed, bearing only insight. Pressure accumulates texturally—the thrumming shifts pitch upon her acknowledgment—culminating in a stance crystallization that reconfigures “resistance” as acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—transforming inherited tools into acts of care—is signaled early and deepens when Mara rows past sleeping ships toward a darkened lighthouse. The tightening occurs at the petal’s fall: waiting ends, doing begins. Agency is clear—she chooses to calibrate, not just remember—and cost is felt in the abandonment of her sanctuary. Pressure accumulates texturally, not through external opposition, but through the weight of legacy, culminating in a stance that forecloses retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—translating isolation into independence—is signaled early and deepens through Mira’s ritual, which narrows her options from passive mourning to active coexistence. The stone circle’s hum intensifies pressure, forcing a trade-off: cling to the past or accept the Sky-Singers’ dispersed consciousness. Cost is legible in the “snap” of her old self and the library’s altitude shift, which carries her irrevocably higher. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves tension. Slight deduction because the conflict remains internal without external complication, limiting tactical variance.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether one’s love is legible to the world—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes she cannot write others’ desires until she reclaims her own. The escalation is driven by her agency: she chooses to descend, to build, to remain visible. Cost is unmistakable: seventeen years of silence, the risk of exposure, the eventual weathering of her art. Mara’s return is not coincidence but consequence—the installation draws her precisely because it speaks the language Elara had withheld.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—halting cosmic-induced discord—is signaled early and escalates via pulsar alignment countdown. Elena’s agency drives escalation: she chooses interference despite risk of mob retaliation. The cost is felt (equipment failure, psychic pressure) and alters tactics (overloading transmitter). However, the tricksters’ threat lacks mid-story adaptation, slightly flattening antagonistic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—ending winter hunger by retrieving the irrigation key—is signaled early and tightens via the organ’s hymn: a literal countdown that forces Maren to act before the walls crush her. The spatial mutiny escalates coherently under Causal lens, with each pressure point (pulsing stone, narrowing passage, faltering music) narrowing options until only one precise action remains. The cost is visceral: claustrophobic terror nearly paralyzes her, yet she acts anyway, sacrificing safety for communal survival. Luck (organ music) complicates but doesn’t resolve—she must still execute the exact strike.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—truth versus silence—is signaled early and tightens when Elara realizes detached precision failed her. The deepening comes via her deliberate choice to “awaken dormant empathy,” which alters her method and enables the breakthrough. Cost is legible: emotional vulnerability replaces clinical distance, and the final image carries the weight of complicity. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens; pressure coheres without reliance on external antagonists.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—truth versus sanctioned history—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes the stanzas are predictive coordinates. The tightening occurs at transcription: knowledge forces public action despite professional risk. Agency is clear—she chooses to transmit, reversing exile through testimony. Cost is felt: she stands alone in rot, voice steady but body trembling, as the institution’s silence breaks. Coincidence never resolves; causality flows from decoding to declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—forgiveness through reconstruction—is signaled early and deepens when the scaffold wrap reveals the hitchhiker’s upward trajectory, narrowing Elias’s options from passive mourning to active ascent. The tightening is protagonist-driven: his choice to follow the flutters, then to play, transforms “pixelated amnesty” from degradation to method. Cost is legible: blood, dissolved artifact, and the irreversible commitment to rebuild rather than remember. Coincidence (hitchhiker’s appearance) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the resolution stems from Elias’s dynamically observant agency.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether one can escape inherited patterns—is signaled early and tightened through Elias’s realization that both he and his father “extracted value from movement.” The deepening occurs when he recognizes the spiral, not circle, of repetition, which reweights his entire enterprise. Agency is clear: his decision to leave at dawn forecloses hiding and embraces comprehension. Cost is felt in the quiet surrender of armor for telescope, a shift that alters his future trajectory with palpable weight.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—decoding the temple to heal insomniacs and honor her brother—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes the inscriptions encode universal sorrow. The meaningful tightening occurs at the climax: understanding that healing requires sharing, not solitary mastery. Cost is felt in her brother’s death and her own shift from chronicler to transmitter. Agency is clear, though escalation leans textual rather than causal; pressure accumulates through revelation, not external opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—freeing truth trapped by reflective lies—is signaled early and tightens when the vortex resists Elara’s reach, forcing her shift from force to stillness. Her agency drives escalation: choosing sacred katas over aggression reweights the conflict. Cost is unmistakable: the illusionist’s death, the seed’s hunger, and Elara’s emotional unbending. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from her stance crystallization under coherent magical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—rewriting the broken timeline—is signaled early and tightens as dusk fades. The meaningful deepening occurs when Kael realizes the covenant is “eclipsed,” not shattered, reframing their mission from repair to revelation. Agency drives escalation: Elara’s blood-prick initiates resonance; their joined hands complete the circuit. Cost is conceptual (bearing “temporal scar tissue”) and temporal (“until full dark”), though the physical price of root-release dissipates too cleanly, softening the trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—bartering fate to restore his sister—is signaled early and deepens when the burned card reappears, proving destiny resists erasure. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his initial arson fails, so he descends deeper, ultimately offering his life. The cost is unmistakable: his body bound, his years surrendered, his idealism transformed into rooted stewardship. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens—each root, bone, and whisper tightens the thematic vise without coincidence resolving tension.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—authenticating the past to survive financially and morally—is signaled early and deepens when the boy enters with photo and debts. Marcus’s agency crystallizes in his renunciation of precision for mercy, foreclosing his old identity as appraiser. Cost is unmistakable: he knowingly risks further credibility loss but chooses human resonance over market value. Escalation is driven by protagonist’s internal reckoning, not coincidence, under an Accumulative lens where longing intensifies pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding the physics of transition—is signaled early and deepens when the spores reveal Inanna’s warning: comprehension requires personal completion of the journey. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his recitation triggers germination, which forces his ultimate choice. The cost—self-dissolution—is unmistakable and tied to his methodical preparation. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving migrating identities before they dissipate—is signaled early and tightens at low tide when the librarian must act despite waning strength. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency: it lowers the creel, communicates through gear-grinding, initiates the smelt. Cost is unmistakable: identities surrender restlessness, accepting that “routine need not mean stagnation.” The moon-phase constraint directly shapes tactics (slowness vs. urgency), and the final image bears the conceptual price of lost wandering for enduring wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving connection over survival—is signaled early and deepens when Elara reads the confessions. The “heartbeat of hesitation” tightens pressure: she must choose between duty and empathy. Cost is unmistakable—erasing the bunker risks her career and isolates her further, yet she commits. Escalation is driven by her agency: each object interaction (pearl, shell) intensifies her emotional investment, culminating in a decisive act that reconfigures her identity.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—forgiving herself for her sister’s death—is signaled early and deepens through the graffiti’s map reference, which forces confrontation. Escalation is driven by Maya’s agency: she copies messages, tests the accordion, resolves to visit the coordinates. The tightening occurs when she recognizes the coordinates—not coincidence, but self-guided reckoning. Cost is clear: returning means enduring unmedicated pain, yet the story avoids false resolution; she hasn’t forgiven herself yet, only chosen to face the current.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—documenting the unspoken lexicon before expulsion—is signaled early and deepens when she realizes she’s composing future silences, not just recovering past ones. Agency is clear: her choices (positioning at the nexus, speaking into the watch) narrow options and incur conceptual cost (eternal archivist duty). The six-hour limit creates urgency, and the confidence man’s fate shows the price of failure. Escalation is driven by her insight, not coincidence, under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving authentic provenance against imperial falsification—is signaled early and deepens when coffee stains reveal tomorrow’s confiscation. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she deliberately queries the jasmine, interprets fungal networks, and chooses dissolution over surrender. The tightening forecloses the path of institutional compliance, forcing propagation through roots—a trade-off with visible cost (career, safety, the violin itself). Moral calculus between beauty and safety sharpens the peak choice without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—capturing the last spark before oblivion—is signaled early and intensified through Elara’s methodical pressure on cooling flesh. The single meaningful deepening occurs when the chip glows, shifting from preparation to active capture, narrowing options to one irreversible act. Cost is felt: decades of labor, emotional isolation, and the perpetual burden of witnessing dissolution. Though agency is limited to attention and ritual, it’s sufficient under the Accumulative lens; however, the lack of a tangible trade-off (e.g., sacrificing something personal) slightly softens the escalation’s edge.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—finding contentment after forgiveness—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s realization that peace requires surrender, not vigilance. The meaningful tightening occurs when he chooses to plant the pin, foreclosing eternal mourning and enabling rebirth. Cost is unmistakable: he gives up the relic that anchored his identity as grieving father. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves the core conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—whether moral burdens can be outsourced—is signaled early and deepens when the cartographer’s granite certainty resists Elias’s usual fabrications. The tightening comes via the stained cloak: it can no longer absorb absolutes, forcing Elias to internalize the burden himself. His agency drives escalation—he climbs, unhooks, releases—and the cost (loss of protective artifice) is felt in his trembling hands and altered price (“perhaps, maybe, it depends”). Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, intensifying through symbolic density rather than plot turns.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—transmitting truth across time despite personal dissolution—is signaled early and deepens when he chooses which ripples to follow and which to withhold. The meaningful tightening occurs when he rejects “false rings that spoke of linear time,” narrowing his method to non-linear pedagogy. Cost is unmistakable: he vanishes by dawn, aged into “pure potential,” sacrificing presence for legacy. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves his dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—navigating without moving—is signaled early and deepens when the arrowhead’s pulse quickens, forcing appraisal. The tightening occurs when birds reveal the arrowhead as compass, not weapon, narrowing options to stillness-as-travel. Cost is felt: the skimmer accepts eternal burial as price for harmonic alignment. Though agency is internal (attention, interpretation), it drives escalation under the Accumulative lens, with the pulse’s cessation marking irreversible commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving human imperfection against mechanized efficiency—is signaled early and tightens when Elias spots the keystone. His agency drives escalation: ignoring earpiece corrections, initiating mist walking, excavating the stone. The deepening occurs when he recognizes his “failure” was fidelity to a different value system. Cost is unmistakable: he forfeits his place in society, becoming myth rather than man. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens—each sensory detail (luminance, chisel sounds) intensifies the thematic conflict without coincidence resolving it.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—deciphering luminous vows—is signaled early and deepens when the tuning fork reveals middle C’s color. Escalation is driven by Elias’s agency: he chooses to descend, open the cabinet, strike the fork. The cost is felt in his isolation and the weight of inherited secrecy, crystallized in the line “his wandering purposefully... had never been about maintaining pier lamps at all.” Coincidence (the lantern release) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the revelation comes from his precise, repeated ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—igniting the next expansion—is signaled immediately and deepens via the backwards prophecy’s inversion of causality. Elena’s agency drives escalation: interpreting static, casting lots, tuning the receiver. Cost is unmistakable: eternal singularity vs. rebirth anchored by her doubt-as-medium. The tightening occurs when she realizes static isn’t noise but language—narrowing her options to precise phase inversion.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—naming the nameless fear of loss—is signaled early and deepens through the reaper’s agency: he unfolds the atlas, positions it under light, and performs the crystallization ritual. The meaningful tightening occurs when ink rises into 3D forms, transforming abstract sorrow into addressable entities. Cost is unmistakable: the atlas disintegrates, his beloved isn’t returned, and he assumes eternal vigil. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—density of light/dust/voice motifs intensifies until resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reawakening the ocean’s memory through sound—is signaled early and tightens when Elara realizes restoration requires “memory of sound,” not force. Her agency drives escalation: recalculating drip rates, adjusting for solar warming, choosing coral over metal for the mallet. Cost is unmistakable: her “certain knowledge that miracles did not happen for mediocre mages” clashes with action, and the ending demands eternal vigil (“endless, earnest vigil”). Coincidence never resolves; the seepage increase is observed, not gifted.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—truth versus bureaucratic erasure—is signaled early and deepens when photographs contradict state records. The meaningful tightening occurs when Elias recognizes the distillery emblem, linking personal memory to systemic betrayal. Agency is clear: he chooses to archive, not ignore. Cost is felt in the weight of “resurrection” and the implied risk of defying official history. One flaw: the escalation leans slightly on revelation rather than active resistance, muting tactical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—harmonizing logic and intuition—is signaled early and tightened when the starlings reveal spiral geometry, forcing Elara to abandon linear methodology. Her agency drives escalation: stepping through the veil, offering the horse, releasing the flame. Cost is felt in the relinquishment of scholarly certainty and the emotional vulnerability of reconnecting with childhood wonder. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with each sensory layer deepening the central tension until the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving trust through precise intervention—is signaled early and tightens when Kael appears as a “speck against the stars.” Elara’s agency drives escalation: revising clip angle by three degrees alters trajectory past a rogue thermal. Cost is unmistakable: her entire being is the last thread between Kael and death. The tightening forecloses passivity—she must act or fail—and the price (psychic burden, physical readiness to leap) charges the final catch.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—defeating emotional numbness—is signaled early and deepens when the clone demands vivification, forcing Maya to choose between annihilation, surrender, or synthesis. The tightening occurs when she realizes the battle is “not about possession but about synthesis,” narrowing options to a single viable path. Cost is unmistakable: integrating the clone means flooding her “empty corridors” with love and grief, reactivating pain she had escaped. Agency drives escalation—her trembling decision to open the jar—not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—safeguarding space for genuine innovation—is signaled early and deepens through Maya’s rejection of linear design for biological unpredictability. The meaningful tightening occurs when she commits to the corpse flower’s stench as a non-verbal communication trigger, foreclosing conventional puzzle logic. Cost is legible: she isolates herself further, risks commercial failure, and embraces failure-as-pathway (“failure smelled like death but led to transcendence”). Escalation is driven by her agency, not coincidence, and pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—tending the unspoken to restore familial joy—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s maceration of silence into usable sorrow. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: each pull of the cord tightens pressure, narrows his spectral existence, and alters the house’s atmosphere. Cost is unmistakable: his own dissolution fuels the laughter that returns. Coincidence never resolves; every shift stems from his labor.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—reconciling dimensional displacement with belonging—is signaled early and deepens when the pendant reveals a “wrong” home. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to interiorize the landscape, swallow the call, and collect darkness. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits return, transforming longing into “perpetual midwinter feast.” Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with each action narrowing the path back to rigid geometry.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—interrupting calcified destiny—is signaled early and deepens through Marcus’s agency: each failed iteration narrows options (too hot → ash; too gentle → hollow shell) until he renounces symbolic repair for transformative destruction. Cost is unmistakable: the crozier’s authority is sacrificed to reveal “raw vitality,” and Marcus’s identity shifts from “hopeless alchemist” to creator. Escalation is driven by his successive approximations, not coincidence, and the final turn—increasing heat one degree—forecloses return to old methods with irreversible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—decoding cosmic silence—is signaled early and tightens when Elara discards protocol, narrowing options to a single, lethal method. Agency drives escalation: her inversion of gain stages forces the system to “capture absence itself.” Cost is unmistakable—the towers groan, fields collapse, and predecessors died attempting this. The lunar perigee acts as a live clock, compressing decision space without resolving via luck.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—merging timelines before infinite isolation—is signaled early and tightens when Elias realizes convergence requires synchronizing heartbeats. Agency is clear: his radio tuning drives each turn, narrowing options (e.g., choosing which frequency to prioritize). Cost is felt: passengers exist in fragmented states until he intervenes, and the final shift leaves him permanently altered. Escalation follows Accumulative logic—density of overlapping realities increases until unified pulse rings—but lacks a single decisive trade-off beyond endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—discovering the texture of connection—is signaled early and deepens as Elara weaves herself into the architecture. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: each stitch increases pressure until eruption becomes inevitable. The cost is unmistakable: physical form disperses into pattern, yet “unsettling calm persists,” crystallizing stance as Charged Poise. Rational enchantment demands release, making the eruption feel causally necessary under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—navigating unfolded horizons to survive—is signaled early and tightens when Vega converges, foreclosing delay. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: Mara’s calculations, not luck, yield the vector. The cost is visceral (“benthic city was starving”) and conceptual (abandoning Earth’s tomb). Under the Accumulative lens, the deepening comes through density: starlight fractures, geometries shift, and the chain’s meaning evolves—all narrowing options to one decisive launch window.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—protecting Mrs. Gable’s testimony—deepens into rescuing Thomas, narrowing options when Elena chooses descent over backup. The child’s whisper forces a trade-off: safety vs. immediacy. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; coincidence (hearing Thomas) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the rescue hinges on Elena’s agency. Cost is visible in Thomas’s malnourishment and the forty years of silence, though the DA payoff remains off-page, slightly softening consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—bearing witness to the unremembered—is signaled early and tightened by the 90-minute tidal window. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses descent despite terror, uses the gold fleck to reveal paths, and steps into the chamber knowing it may absorb her. The cost is clear: she trades ordinary existence for eternal resonance with the “crashing hush.” Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens—each phase transition intensifies the weight of presence over rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming identity from digital erasure—is signaled early and deepens as Elara deciphers corrupted memory via ink patterns. Agency is constant: she chooses to interpret, manipulate, and ultimately integrate the ghost. The tightening occurs when heartbeat warmth rearranges ink into code, raising stakes from observation to intervention. Cost is felt: survival shifts from defensive counting to vulnerable trust, foreclosing the path of perpetual proof. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—density of sensory and symbolic detail reweights what “living” means.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—saving the language before the elder dies—is signaled early and tightens relentlessly. Protagonist agency drives escalation: she deciphers bird patterns, navigates the tunnel, and speaks the myth. Cost is unmistakable: time runs out, grammar dissolves “like mist,” and success demands surrendering spoken words for resonant echoes. The curse’s hunger versus her quiet articulation creates authentic tension with irreversible trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—turning bitterness into cosmic laughter—is signaled early and tightens when the phone call forces Elena to confront her rage, triggering metamorphosis. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her confession initiates the arrowhead’s activation and garden’s bloom. Cost is unmistakable—loss of human form, entombment—but the “Weightless Laugh” threat remains abstract, slightly weakening external pressure. Under the Accumulative lens, the deepening of thematic stakes (tragedy as comedy) reweights options decisively at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reawakening wild beauty against mechanical efficiency—is signaled early and deepens when Elara chooses rhythm over melody. Escalation is driven by her agency: faster playing triggers root-shattering and statue paralysis. Cost is visible in the crumbling shell and the irreversible dissolution of order. Though pressure tightens well, the absence of a personal sacrifice beyond the shell slightly softens the price.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reconnecting separated people through physical mail—is signaled early and deepened by the drone border’s cruelty. Marek’s agency drives escalation: he doesn’t wait for openings but engineers one using the storm bottle, paying the price of ration sacrifice and constant peril. The three-minute chaos forces a trade-off: speed over safety, silence over explanation. Cost is legible in every empty slot and the woman’s two-year wait, culminating in a delivery that risks everything for a single envelope.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming silence into creation—is signaled early and deepens when the wrong turn reveals the oasis, narrowing options to engagement or retreat. Escalation is driven by Elias’s agency: his touch unlocks song, which activates the fragment, which reconfigures the space. Cost is unmistakable: thirteen years of muteness crystallize into the lullaby, and his departure implies labor ahead (“tools and timber”). Coincidence (the hidden car) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from his readiness forged in quiet persistence.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—reawakening a dormant narrative—is signaled early and deepens through Elena’s three-year calculation and physical journey. The tightening occurs when she steps into the fold, where distance becomes “simultaneously infinite and traversable,” foreclosing retreat. Cost is conceptual (the irrevocable passage of her grandmother) but legible in the scarf’s transformation. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves the conflict. A visible price would elevate this further, but the thematic weight compensates.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—recovering the runaway dream to fill emotional void—is signaled by line 4 and tightens at dawn, when the dream appears “tentative and flickering.” Elara’s agency is clear: she doesn’t chase but constructs a lighthouse of light, a choice that forecloses brute force or spells. The cost is felt in the “hollow chest” and the risk of permanent loss (“vanish into the archipelago’s whispers forever”), and the deepening occurs when she realizes the dream needs a home, not a cage. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies through sensory and linguistic density, not plot turns, but the stakes remain viscerally legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—freeing an idea imprisoned by fear—is signaled early and deepens through Vey’s dance, which narrows options by destabilizing the singularity’s guard. Agency is clear: her unassuming boldness drives escalation, not coincidence. Cost is felt in the poet’s vanished companionship and Vey’s enduring solitude, crystallized in the “empty ribbon dangling like a spent fuse.” One meaningful tightening suffices, though the price isn’t physically dramatized beyond emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—recovering Lila’s stolen self—is signaled early and tightens decisively at the solstice dawn when “habits break.” Elena’s agency drives escalation: her detection of the ring’s pattern forces the choice to enter it, trading safety for reunion. Cost is unmistakable: she sacrifices her identity as detached folklorist, and the greenhouse’s magic dies with the ring. Pressure coheres under Causal lens—each beat because/therefore the next, culminating in a trade-off (memory for memory) with emotional and metaphysical weight.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—resilience versus comfort—is signaled early and deepened through Elara’s refusal to coddle. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her harsh questions, tea-leaf analyses, and withheld hammer force the shadow to choose readiness. Cost is unmistakable: three weeks of mutual vulnerability, the risk of retraumatization, and Elara’s own confrontation with connection. The final act forecloses exile permanently, with the swing’s stillness marking irreversible change.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder’s color—is signaled early and tightens when gray lands bleach wildflowers and drain children’s dreams. Elian’s agency drives escalation: his creative defense (spinning thorn-blossom patterns) actively narrows options by forcing him to capture essences under duress. Cost is unmistakable: his body grows translucent, exhaustion follows triumph, and the heirloom seed’s activation consumes irreplaceable generational memory. Coincidence never resolves tension; the veil’s thinning complicates but Elian’s skill overcomes it.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—grounding restless spirits by absorbing their silence—is signaled early and escalates through Mira’s agency: each unweaving deepens her burden, narrows her emotional bandwidth, and tightens the sanctuary’s unrest. The cost is unmistakable: by the end, her mask is sealed with silence, and she has become the net. This is not passive endurance but active renunciation—she chooses to carry the quiet so others may rest. The escalation follows the Accumulative lens perfectly: density increases until the final knot surrenders, and the price is paid in irreversible transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—recovering silenced knowledge—is signaled early and tightens when the tear reveals coordinates. Elara’s agency drives escalation: comparing films leads to detecting subsidence, which enables reopening the chamber. Cost is felt in her restraint (documenting without disturbance) and conceptualized in the map’s preserved tear. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens with one decisive deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—accessing the final transmission—is signaled early and deepens into a metaphysical inquiry: “the physics of letting go.” Escalation occurs through Julian’s active calculation of resonance, narrowing options until only one frequency remains. The cost is dual: historical truth stays buried, and Julian internalizes the lesson of release. Agency drives every turn; coincidence (Amelia’s discovery) merely opens the door but doesn’t resolve the core conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to the voiceless—is signaled early and deepens when the ghost’s apology for “mechanical violence” reframes the conflict from expression to reconciliation. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to encode the final message, sings despite disuse, and accepts the ghost’s departure. The tightening occurs when the bolt plate clicks into place, irrevocably activating the system. Cost is unmistakable: her solitude ends not in union but in purposeful separation, charged by the map to other courtyards.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the captain’s hidden truth—tightens as the elevator ascends, each floor raising the emotional cost of understanding. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she actively uses scattered light through the goggles, aligns cipher wheels, and interprets subtext. The cost is felt in her realization that survival requires “studying one’s own pain with curiosity”—a stance crystallized under pressure. No coincidence resolves tension; the spectral key works only because she brings the right object to the right light at the right height.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—validating her emotional cloud taxonomy as legitimate knowledge—is signaled early and deepens when the break forces her to enact, not just theorize, her belief. The tightening occurs when she shifts from observation to knot-tying, foreclosing return in favor of creating “atmospheric memory.” Cost is unmistakable: she trades safety and professional dismissal for solitary revelation. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens—each knot intensifies thematic and emotional pressure without external interference.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—capturing the exact hue of tomorrow’s sunrise before annihilation—is signaled early and intensifies through Elara’s race against time. The meaningful deepening occurs when she discovers the pigment formula via touch, narrowing her options to one fragile, tactile method. Cost is unmistakable: she cannot save the library, only transmute its loss into art. Agency is fully hers—no coincidence resolves tension; the wrecking ball strikes exactly as her sky predicts.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the stranded luminance—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s cross-referencing work, narrowing options to a single route. Agency is clear: her note-taking and observation drive escalation, not coincidence. The starlings’ thinning numbers create a live clock, raising urgency. Cost is felt in her trembling hand and sociable isolation, though the absence of tangible loss (e.g., failed attempts, sacrificed tools) slightly softens the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring the sky-clock to save the village—is signaled early and tightens when the prophecy reveals the reflection chamber. The uncorking act is a meaningful deepening that narrows options: once the seal breaks, there’s no retreat. Cost is visible in the crumbling parchments, generational wait, and physical toll of ascent. Escalation is driven by Elara’s agency, not coincidence, though the stakes remain narrowly focused without secondary pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—long-term survival via atmospheric engineering—is signaled early and deepens when Mara reinterprets Thomas’s messages as technical guidance. The meaningful tightening occurs when the council commits to cultivating ionized gas, foreclosing passive waiting. Agency is collective but led by Mara; cost is visible in midnight labor and emotional vulnerability. Luck (Thomas’s ghost) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the solution requires human calibration, not spectral magic.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—vouchsafing peace at extinction—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s song, which transforms the pane of hush from barrier to transmitter. Agency is clear: her choice to sing, not stop the clock, forecloses resistance and embraces mercy. Cost is felt in the “bruised awe” and weathered body, though the escalation relies more on lyrical intensification than tactical narrowing. The absence of tangible opposition risks telescopic stakes, but the internal pressure of three centuries of calibration grounds the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—guiding lost souls before frost kills them—is signaled early and tightens via time pressure and mechanical bird interference. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she doesn’t wait for rescue but constructs a solution using the blueprint’s logic. The cost is legible: exhaustion, emotional toll of past failure, and ongoing entrapment. The vibration plate and pruning hook reveal tactical adaptation under pressure. One minor flaw: the travelers’ arrival feels slightly convenient, though their presence is earned by the path’s activation, not deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—translating separation into connection—is signaled early and deepens when Elena recognizes the chrysalis as “evidence of completion,” not absence. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: tracing foam leads to insight that reweights her grief. Cost is unmistakable: she must relinquish the fantasy of undoing the argument, accepting it as counterpoint. Pressure tightens once, coherently, under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—freedom vs. servitude under glimmering parole—is signaled early and tightens when the parole flickers at the threshold. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her incision widens because she deepens her measurement of voids. Cost is unmistakable: abandoning bottled moonlight forfeits her only means of survival in this world. The tightening forecloses return, forcing a trade-off between temporary mercy and narrative origin.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—processing stored remorse—is signaled early and escalates through Kael’s agency: she reads pools, digs, breaks ice, removes gloves. The deepening occurs when she becomes the enzyme, subsuming tonnage of regret. Cost is unmistakable: her body as vessel, years of isolation, the pavilion’s depletion. No coincidence resolves this; pressure tightens solely through her choices under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reuniting fractured communities through mechanical and linguistic harmony—is signaled early and deepens via Elara’s empathetically decisive singing. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: her voice modulates dialects to address specific fears, directly triggering elevator responses. Cost is legible: the weight’s descent is irreversible, sealing covenant “against coming winter storms.” Luck doesn’t resolve; her skill and preparation do. One tightening suffices—the shift from silence to polyphonic dialogue—and it forecloses isolation permanently.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming abandoned dreams—is signaled early and deepens through Elena’s method of “forced synaptic plasticity.” The meaningful tightening occurs when she aligns the shard at “thirty-three degrees,” merging her mother’s unlived ballet career with her own stalled research—a moment of agency that reconfigures possibility. Pressure accumulates texturally rather than causally, consistent with the inferred lens, but the absence of external opposition or tangible consequence limits felt cost. Still, the internal stakes carry weight through lyrical escalation and the final burden of becoming a “living archive.”

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—retrieving the twelve-digit sequences—is signaled early and tightens via the one-hour gravity window. Elara’s agency drives escalation: aligning doodle with seeds triggers threshold peak, revealing combinations. Cost is felt in time pressure and cyclical burden (needing to return). Coincidence never resolves; all turns stem from her prism-minded perception and prior choices. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, and it’s executed with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—restoring sound through empathy—is signaled early and deepens via Elara’s methodical analysis of trauma. Escalation is driven by her agency: each bow stroke tests resistance, narrowing options until the primary fissure yields. The cost is felt in the fragility of success—the “subsonic whisper,” not a symphony—and the hedgehog’s watchful presence underscores how much hinges on this single attempt. Coincidence never resolves; tension tightens through embodied precision.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—restoring the Eclipse Covenant through “difficult beauty”—is signaled early and escalates via the moon’s phase clock. Castian’s agency drives the tightening: he chooses curved trajectories over clean diagonals, correlating physics with metaphysics. The cost is conceptual (abandoning mechanistic strategy) and emotional (accepting Mireya’s superior insight). The magnetic reversal deadline forces irreversible action, and the final move forecloses his old self without erasing exile’s price.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—recovering stolen frequencies of understanding—is signaled early and deepens when Elio matches the clasp’s 4.5 Hz, narrowing his path from theory to proof. Agency lies in his willingness to surrender his own frequency, a renunciation with felt cost: tears of “theatrical sincerity” amid public spectacle. Escalation is driven by his tuning attempts (7 Hz → 12 Hz → 4.5 Hz), though the external pressure (fireworks) remains atmospheric rather than causally adversarial.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—cultivating serenity through contradiction—is signaled early and tightens when Elara chooses to plant despite knowing she’ll suffer the bloom’s stench. Pressure escalates via environmental instability (swaying platforms) and biological vulnerability (parasitic youth needs acidic soil). Cost is felt in her deliberate, prayerful movements against chaos. Agency drives escalation: her reading of doodles alters tactics decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—finding the source of resilience—is signaled early and tightens when Kael realizes it’s not biological but temporal. The twelve-minute countdown forces a trade-off: extract nothing, or capture data. Agency is clear: she chooses calibration over greed, altering humanity’s terraforming future. Cost is felt—she leaves the artifact behind—but the escalation leans slightly on revelation over active complication; still, pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens with one decisive deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding the convergence to cultivate foresight—is signaled early and escalates through Maya’s survey, which narrows options from chaotic fog to precise geometric inevitability. The tightening occurs when she reverse-engineers the catastrophe from scorch marks and blast radius, forcing a trade-off: accepting that Chen’s courage was futile against architectural physics. Cost is visible in the “melted aluminum and fused glass” and conceptual in the “terrible inevitability” she now sees. Agency drives escalation; coincidence never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—certifying wonder before midnight—is signaled early and tightens when the amber sheet trembles with “increasing urgency.” Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses the precise moment to strike based on the sculptor’s distant action, transforming coincidence into collaboration. Cost is unmistakable: her body collapses from exertion, and the Council’s instruments register marvel as undeniable data, foreclosing their pragmatic worldview. The deepening occurs when prism-song bypasses rational thought to lodge in listeners’ emotional cortex—a tactical shift that reweights the entire conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—repairing the rift through atonement—is signaled early and deepens via the ghost-scape vision, which forces Mira to confront her past hesitation. The tightening occurs when she realizes the exact missed notes, narrowing her options to a single corrective melody. Cost is unmistakable: three winters of solitude, the burden of irreversible failure, and the surrender of static guardianship. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves the breach.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transposing empathy to derive emotional mathematics—is signaled early and tightens relentlessly as stars vanish. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she engineers the cartographer’s disorientation through deliberate ambiguity, leveraging borrowed personalities and spatial distortion. The cost is visceral: his structured grief drowns in liquid multiplicity, and his identity is absorbed. One meaningful deepening—the feeding of his journal page into the press—transforms abstract theory into catastrophic, irreversible practice.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—transforming routine into sacred exchange—is signaled early and deepens when Elias chooses to pause, narrowing his courier’s path of solitude. The tightening occurs at the archivist’s appearance: his deviation from code initiates germination. Cost is felt (lost efficiency, vulnerability) and visible in the blooming aftermath. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, though the pressure rise is subtle rather than sharply causal—hence just below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—proving objects absorb emotion—is signaled early and deepened through Elara’s precise methodology. Escalation occurs via the prism’s refraction, which forces a confrontation with stored grief, narrowing options to either validate or abandon her life’s work. The cost is felt: the prism burns, the frost vanishes, and the car is “lighter,” implying irreversible change. Agency is fully hers; no coincidence resolves the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—carrying a message across impossible distance—is signaled early and tightens through escalating costs: seven failed attempts, blood as adhesive, self-unraveling as final price. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each recommencement deepens sacrifice until agency crystallizes in Maya’s whispered name and dissolution. Coincidence (rummage-sale box) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the jigsaw edges’ function emerges from Maya’s interpretation. Cost is unmistakable: her transparency seals the void, making stakes visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—coaxing resilience from rubble—is signaled early and tightens at the convergence chamber, where time “narrows to a knife’s edge.” Escalation is driven by Elara’s agency: she chooses descent, lays the silk, strikes the seeds. The cost is legible: the silk dissolves, her hands return empty, and the transformation demands sweat, burns, and self-remaking. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies through cadence shift—from trembling fingers to rhythmic hammer blows that echo like a returning heartbeat—reweighting the stake from personal hope to planetary rebirth.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—discovering the “weight of a withheld truth”—is signaled immediately and intensifies through protagonist-driven escalation: Elara actively steps through the shard’s wound, maps five-dimensional bulkheads, and assembles fragments across universes. The pivotal tightening occurs in the seventh universe, where she learns her mentor chose extinction over exile—a revelation that forecloses her initial goal of undoing his choice. Cost is unmistakable: she inherits his burden permanently, carrying it “like atmosphere.” Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with each cycle raising emotional and existential stakes without reliance on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving the fragile safety of anonymous witness—is signaled early and deepens when the lamp fails, creating a sanctuary for the dead and living. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she rebuilds the cairn, seals the jar, refuses to send the letter. The cost is felt in what she withholds: connection, clarity, voice. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies not through plot turns but through thickening atmosphere and ritualized action, culminating in a stance that forecloses direct communication to protect something more essential.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving memory against amnesiac dawn—is signaled early and deepens through Kael’s escalating ritual: from polishing to imprisoning light to releasing shadow-seeds. The meaningful tightening occurs when his accidental hymn transforms routine into prophecy, raising the cost from maintenance to creation. Agency is clear: Kael’s choices (whispering, bending photons) directly shape outcomes. Yet the opposition (oblivion) remains abstract; no tangible force resists him, softening the pressure despite lyrical intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding narrative magnetism—is signaled early and deepens via the wing’s prismatic shadow, which crystallizes the donor’s lesson. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her daily sun-tracking ritual narrows options from intellectual pursuit to embodied surrender. Cost is felt in the “foreign architecture” of her ribs and culminates in releasing the wing—an act that forecloses ownership but opens receptivity. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each light shift intensifies the central question without coincidence or external interference.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding what the trees witness—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes sorrow is fertilizer, not artifact. This tightening forces her to choose between institutional preservation and organic reciprocity. Agency is clear: she actively deconstructs the system, pours the vials, aligns the sextant. The cost is conceptual and tactile: abandoning quantification for unmeasurable exchange, with visible consequence in the tree’s shimmer and her healed hands.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving the mirror world from true death—is signaled early and tightens through Elara’s ritual: each fold of light “contained a verse of the old sun,” narrowing options to this singular act of weaving. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens; pressure deepens as ghost-orchardists join, transforming solitary song into communal chorus. Cost is unmistakable: the “cold fire” of motivation, the risk of light bleeding into “hungry dark,” and the centuries-long burden of being last memory keeper. Coincidence never resolves; every intensification stems from Elara’s choices.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving solitude while honoring compassion—is signaled early and deepens when the young woman appears, forcing Elias to reconcile opposing impulses. The tightening occurs in his silent decision to leave the invitation, which forecloses direct contact but opens access, exacting the cost of perpetual invisibility. Agency drives escalation: his choice, not coincidence, resolves the tension. Under an Accumulative lens, the pressure crescendos through emotional resonance rather than external threat, culminating in a trade-off that reweights his entire existence.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—resisting the erosion of ordinary sacredness—is signaled early and deepens when Mara bakes the relic bread into pudding, transforming preservation into offering. This act forecloses passive remembrance; the cost is the irreversible consumption of the last tangible link to the bakery. Escalation is driven by Mara’s agency: her “heuristically gentle” gardening culminates in the uncloaking, which pressures others to participate (“the knitter brought honey”). The architect’s sprig of winter wheat embodies the stake’s evolution—from loss to regrowth—and the neighborhood’s subsequent “new vigilance” proves the pressure’s ripple effect.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving meaning before total erasure—is signaled early and tightens when the Fading accelerates from decades to hours, forcing Elara to sample in milliseconds. Agency is clear: her procedural discipline overrides despair, narrowing options to documentation alone. Cost is legible in the dissolving ultraviolet child’s promise and the final flatline—irreversible loss rendered as data. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—thwarting betrayal before sunrise—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency: each false start refines position, culminating in the recording of coordinates. The “truce of hush” isn’t just mood—it’s a live constraint that makes sound currency and silence ammunition. Cost is unmistakable: time pressure (dawn), physical risk (enforcers), and emotional burden (father’s salvation at stake). The deepening occurs when Mara realizes violence follows words, forcing her to adapt tactics—agency driving escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—whether humanity retains its symbiotic weather—is signaled early and tightens when the forests vote. Elara’s agency lies in her participation and skepticism, which the thunder-bearer names as “the final component.” The escalation is textural: each weather-bearer’s arrival intensifies atmospheric pressure, culminating in the forest’s rustling verdict. The cost is conceptual but undeniable—the loss of chrome-and-silence futures for a wild, demanding reciprocity—and the final image reweights what “navigation” means in this new covenant.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—uncorking suppressed creativity—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s realization that performance isn’t creation. The tightening occurs when she chooses repair over resignation, narrowing options to either fix the lock or remain trapped. Agency drives escalation: her mnemonic skill and artist’s hands solve the problem, not luck. Cost is felt in her irreversible departure from the surface, crystallized in the final step through the tunnel.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—retrieving lost words to restore trust—is signaled early and tightens when Marcus’s lie triggers leaf-wilting, forcing honesty. Protagonist agency drives escalation: Aurelia pieces map fragments, navigates steam corridors, uses plates as keys. Cost is legible: three years of searching, trembling effort, societal suspicion. The northern quadrant’s “fear, not water” barrier crystallizes the moral calculus—truth requires courage, not just access.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—preserving awe in a world that discarded it—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s meticulous labor. The tightening occurs when she releases the brake: a point of no return where years of calculation meet natural force. Agency is clear: she chooses to let the world speak through her instruments, accepting the cost of lifelong solitude. Under the Accumulative lens, escalation isn’t causal but textural—the symphony builds through layered vibrations until the final bell suspends time, making the conceptual cost of forgotten wonder unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving the farm’s hybrid life against magnetic entropy—is signaled early and tightens when Kael-9 realizes survival requires embracing fragmentation, not repairing shields. The controlled burn deepens pressure by forcing a trade-off: sacrifice twelve genetically doomed rows to save the master seed bank. Protagonist agency drives escalation; coincidence (magnetic shift) complicates but doesn’t resolve. Cost is unmistakable: “blackened earth,” “scarred but operational” android, and archived terror now “a single accessible module.” Final image crystallizes stakes—“half burned, half blooming”—with chaos contained but never erased.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—uncovering why Elena vanished—is signaled early and deepens when Maya learns she “died still clutching hope.” The meaningful tightening occurs when demolition looms, forcing urgency. Maya’s agency drives escalation: she follows, listens, and offers the locket at the right moment. Cost is visible in lost time, erased stories, and Mr. Alvarez’s lifelong grief. However, the resolution leans slightly on coincidence (Mr. Alvarez arriving with the key just in time), marginally undercutting full protagonist-driven escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—liberating truth encrypted as vulnerability—is signaled early and tightens through three journal entries, each narrowing options via dance sequences. Agency is unwavering: Elara’s rolls of the dice (“The Minor Fall,” “The Major Lift”) drive escalation, not luck. Cost is visible in her exhaustion and the irreversible act of unsealing the vault. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies through density (layered gestures, biological journals) rather than causal reversals, culminating in a deepening that reweights silence as strength.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—recovering what was lost—is signaled early and deepens when Mara realizes memories sediment here. Agency drives escalation: she chooses to descend, pour coffee, exhume. The whale’s death complicates but doesn’t resolve; Mara’s labor retrieves the box. Cost is legible: years of absence condensed into fragile blossoms, now held with irreversible knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—containing a world-altering prophecy—is signaled early and deepens through the summoner’s method: mapping silence becomes damming fate. The escalation is driven by her agency (not coincidence), culminating in a trade-off: she absorbs the weight of averted futures into her own body (“racing heart”). Cost is unmistakable: the crane’s new heaviness, the exhaustion implied in “work complete.” Slight deduction: the prophecy’s coded nature remains elusive, softening the antagonistic pressure just enough to prevent full 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—learning the language of old buildings—is signaled early and deepens through weekly rituals that narrow Maya’s reality toward the spectral. The tightening occurs when she accepts Elias’s death without naming it, trading empirical certainty for architectural fluency. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits conventional sanity (“seeming mad”) to gain communion. Agency drives escalation—she initiates sugar-borrowing, brings her own seal—and the meteor shower’s cosmic rhythm doesn’t resolve but refracts pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—containing the memory before dawn—tightens via protagonist agency: Elara accelerates her work as stars fade, her mechanical precision battling the memory’s resistance. The deepening comes when the memory reveals love as quarantine, forcing Elara to confront her own solitude, which narrows her options to either harden her skepticism or embrace connection-as-strength. Cost is unmistakable: the garden’s tragic radiance marks beauty destroyed to preserve necessity, and Elara’s solitude is irrevocably altered. Coincidence never resolves; escalation is driven by her choices under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—forging peace to end bloodshed—is signaled early and deepens via the obsidian seal’s revelation. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses blood, completes the clause, seals the document. Cost is unmistakable: isolation, guilt, self-erasure (“unlinking herself”). The moral calculus—betraying authenticity to save lives—is sharp, persistent, and paid in full at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—honoring vs. exploiting Echoed Ones—is signaled early and tightens when Archivists reveal preservation motive, forcing Mira to weigh consent against species survival. Escalation is driven by her agency: raising the shell triggers the climax. Cost is unmistakable—she assumes eternal responsibility—but the “webs of intrigue” backstory slightly distances present pressure. Still, moral calculus sharpens the peak choice between competing goods: ancestral reverence versus utilitarian archive.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—exposing the Sovereign’s true fate—is signaled early and escalates through Elara’s agency: interpreting dreams, confronting the ghost, choosing how much truth to reveal. The meaningful tightening occurs when she withholds the child’s survival, forcing the ghost’s hesitation and opening the “window of connection.” Cost is unmistakable: mental exhaustion, invasion of strangers’ subconscious, and the burden of translating ghost-silence into bearable truth. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens without reliance on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving hidden patterns against entropy—is signaled early and deepens as Kaelen notices the firefly-illuminated tear, tying the final knot not for ceremony but for cosmic continuity. The escalation is subtle but decisive: from mending to whistling to realizing her work *is* the pattern. Cost is felt in the quiet solitude, the drying stones, the dimming fireflies—ephemeral beauty demanding constant, unacknowledged care. Agency lies in attention, not action, which fits the Accumulative lens perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. survival myth—is signaled early and deepens when Mara discovers the stillpoint is failing. Her agency drives escalation: reassembling letters enables calibration, which forces a trade-off between preserving faith or enabling survival. The cost is unmistakable: the diamond’s fractures worsen, and the settlers’ fear must be replaced with burdensome knowledge. One tightening—transition from debunker to restorer—narrows her path with emotional and social consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—shaping a new dawn via ancient shadows—is signaled early and deepens when coordinates arrive, forcing Elian to choose between passive listening and active intervention. His agency drives escalation: unfolding aerials, whispering counter-words, projecting shadows outward. Cost is felt in irreversible solitude and the moral weight of complicating rather than stopping the prophet. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: static → poetry → coordinates → clear tone, each tightening the timeline toward solstice alignment.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—reconnecting with his daughter through preserved sound—is signaled early and deepens when the music box triggers memory. The tightening occurs when Elias chooses to release three specific jars, transforming passive hoarding into active offering. This agency-driven escalation narrows his path: he must now seek her or remain forever mute. The cost—leaving his sanctuary, risking rejection—is felt in his trembling hands and the jar clutched like a lantern.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—protecting the boundary between living harbor and dead waters—is signaled early and deepens when Mara realizes static defenses fail. The meaningful tightening occurs when she abandons flight for adaptation, narrowing options to one: vibrational matching. Agency is clear: her repair work accidentally summoned the hunters, and only her voice can unmake them. Cost is unmistakable: physical exhaustion, emotional exposure, and the irreversible activation of the key until the next equinox.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—liberation from the mining consortium—is signaled early and tightened by the six-minute viaduct window, which forces trade-offs between speed and survival. Escalation is driven by Elara’s agency: years of tracking moon paths culminate in precise timing, not luck. Cost is unmistakable: predecessors died from haste; now, rushing would “scatter their atoms.” The revolution’s patience isn’t passive—it’s tactical endurance that reconfigures freedom itself.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—truth versus institutional silence—is signaled early and tightens when Maya finds the satchel. The meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes Elias died not by accident but by bureaucratic negligence, forcing her to choose between protocol and justice. Cost is felt in her grief and the irreversible rupture with her mentor’s legacy. Agency drives escalation: her empirical method becomes the weapon Elias intended.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—rectifying wrongful condemnation—is signaled early and tightens when the inscription reveals innocence. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to seek a second opinion, then commits to action. Cost is felt (“seventeen years,” moral burden) and shapes tactics (meticulous documentation). Coincidence (light breaking) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the repairman’s skill and Elias’s resolve do.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—ringing the unheard bell—is signaled early and tightens when the kaleidoscope shifts from geometry to desperate text, forcing Kip into higher-stakes carving that makes the workshop shudder. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens: each turn of the decoder deepens the yearning algorithm’s urgency, narrowing options until only completion remains. Cost is unmistakable—the kaleidoscope shatters, the arrow tip breaks off, and the bell’s ring travels backward through time, implying irreversible ontological change. Coincidence never resolves; every intensification stems from Kip’s steady curiosity.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. corporate erasure—is signaled early and tightens when Elara links numbers to coordinates. Her agency drives escalation: she follows threads, decodes music, confronts AI. Cost is legible: risking termination, bearing the “weight of their sensed absence.” The rescue succeeds via her broadcast, not coincidence. However, the AI’s abrupt termination attempt lacks tactical depth—it’s a flat obstacle, not a dynamic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake (orchard vs. nomads) tightens via Elara’s agency: she rejects the Council’s binary, using mirrors to forge a third path. Escalation is driven by her choices—selecting frames, aligning reflections—not coincidence. Cost is unmistakable: shadows “writhed with the strain of holding the courageous anomaly,” and the Council’s resonant hum confirms irreversible consequence. Pressure coheres under Causal lens, with one meaningful deepening (fragment warming → understanding reconstitution).

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—learning “the sound of approaching endings”—is signaled early and deepened when the child’s shoe delivers that sound as “surrender,” not violence. Protagonist agency drives escalation: she chooses to trawl, to lift, to listen. Cost is legible in the pink shoe’s absurdity against gray water and the blue-paper appointment now rendered weightless. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—no false turns, only accruing resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—whether love endures beyond physical presence—is signaled early and deepens through Elena’s reinterpretation of “destined mismatches.” The meaningful tightening occurs when she shifts from orthodox pairing logic to embracing productive tension, foreclosing the path of passive waiting. Cost is felt: three harvests of solitude, the charred relic as permanent boundary. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (rediscovering conversation via parallels), though the pressure remains internal; a slightly more concrete external constraint (e.g., impending sale of vineyard) could heighten stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving the prophet’s echo—is signaled early and tightens as the desert actively reclaims the clearing. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: her attention conjures the space, her vulnerability activates the parapet, her binding song seals the transfer. Cost is unmistakable: she surrenders personal possession of wisdom, accepting that echoes belong to the earth. The desert’s encroachment provides coherent pressure, and the final contraction of the clearing forces decisive action without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—transforming collective grief into coherence—is signaled early and deepens as townspeople recognize ancestral arcs in the photos. Elara’s agency lies in arrangement, not intervention; her quiet endurance catalyzes change, fulfilling the Accumulative lens. The tightening occurs when the archive shifts from fragments to a spiral narrative, altering community posture (shoulders relax, bodies lean together). Cost is legible: her work concludes with departure, the case emptied, yet the field remains “sacred”—a trade of personal possession for communal legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving language in a world where meaning grows biologically—is signaled early and deepens as Elara realizes mold spores carry mutated semantics. The meaningful tightening occurs when she shifts from preservation to testimony via placement, foreclosing vocal articulation. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates through textural density (lichen spelling, sonically reflective surfaces) rather than causal turns, culminating in a Charged Poise where silence becomes amplification. Cost is felt: knowledge is now shard-based, legible only at specific angles, demanding new epistemologies.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—capturing the sound before forgetting steals it—is signaled early and escalates through Elias’s frantic notation. The tightening occurs when he reaches the amphitheater: writing becomes automatic as his mind unspools, narrowing options to pure instinct. Cost is unmistakable: success (vibration in sternum) coincides with total loss of meaning. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves tension. The “tidal longing” isn’t passive—it’s the engine of his compulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—harnessing the ephemeral—is signaled early and deepens when the moon’s tidal shift destabilizes time itself. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she climbs instead of fleeing, recalls the leaf instead of consulting manuals, and triggers playback instead of surrendering. The cost is legible: she sacrifices her physical presence, becoming part of the threshold between release and landing. The tightening occurs when she realizes engineering won’t suffice—only memory can stabilize chaos—forcing a trade-off between survival and revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—executing a “flawless goodbye” amid eleven years of silence—is signaled early and deepens when the vinyl shard becomes both threat and bridge. Elena’s agency drives escalation: her hymning alters tactics, transforming static guilt into shared presence. The storm’s upward rain doesn’t resolve but intensifies pressure, making the reunion feel urgent, not fated. Cost is visible: Maya’s endurance forecloses easy forgiveness, accepting beauty in brokenness—a trade-off that reweights the entire encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—retrieving the sealed awakenings—is signaled early and tightens when Elara realizes observation fails and method is required. Her agency drives escalation: she deciphers logs, aligns the orrery, matches her stride to the key’s tick. The cost is felt: ninety sleepless nights, the weight of solitary responsibility, and the acceptance that healing is incremental. Coincidence never resolves; every advance is earned through struggle and precision.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reconciling belief and skepticism through acts of repair—is signaled early and deepens when Elena chooses mending over destruction. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her yearning compels bone-setting, which in turn reveals the real girl’s location. Cost is unmistakable: physical pain (aching bones), epistemological rupture (“rigid, certain, alone” self discarded), and emotional vulnerability (forgiving both species). The tightening forecloses Elena’s former identity while opening a path for lost travelers.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—sharing light without fire—is signaled early and deepens through Mira’s polishing, which becomes a high-stakes spiritual discipline. The tightening occurs when she places the final shard, risking failure or reignition; the cost is her permanent exile from flame and self-forgiveness earned through restraint. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens: each polished fragment raises the emotional and metaphysical stakes. The climax isn’t coincidence but the culmination of months of precise, humble labor.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming narrative control from viral exposure—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s proactive rituals. The escalation is textural: thaw accelerates, water strikes with “precision that suggested intention,” and the pendant becomes a “seed crystal.” Her agency lies in renunciation—offering no more to the ether—and the cost is legible: she trades public absolution for private, spore-witnessed healing. Pressure tightens via environmental cadence, not external antagonism, fitting the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—resisting narrative finality to preserve fragile hopes—is signaled early and deepens through Mara’s refusal to comply with her publisher. The meaningful tightening occurs when she kneels to solemnize, foreclosing her former self. Agency is clear: her cameo method and ritual are active renunciations, not passive observation. Cost is felt in the irreversible transition from author to witness, though the escalation leans slightly more on texture than causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reknitting human-land covenant—is signaled early and tightens when cosmic alignment locks with an audible click, forcing Elara’s irreversible vocal offering. Agency is clear: her song, not luck, triggers growth. Cost is felt: three decades of silence expelled, villagers’ tears marking reawakened responsibility. Escalation follows Accumulative lens—density of golden stories intensifies until narrative threads physically bless the village.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—translating pulse into navigable emotion—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s physical patience. The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses slowness over her craft’s explosive speed, trading efficiency for fidelity. Cost is visible: her fingers tremble, skin bites from cold, and failed experiments are sacrificed. Escalation is protagonist-driven under an Accumulative lens—pressure accumulates via ritual precision until the sealing act reweights all prior effort.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—restoring the Echo Garden’s resonance—is signaled early and tightens through Elias’s daily mapping of reflection angles, which narrows his repair options to one exact tooth angle. The escalation is driven entirely by protagonist agency: his reverse-engineering forces him to confront the impossibility of perfect restoration, accepting scarred wisdom over pristine magic. Cost is unmistakable: nine days of isolation, physical tremor, and the permanent loss of the garden’s original “perfect resonance.” The final turn—winding the mainspring—forecloses the path of passive mourning, crystallizing his stance that wonder must be preserved through reason.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—giving form to formless grief—is signaled early and deepens through the annual ritual’s pressure: entropy threatens dissolution, silence muffles memory, and recursion risks paralysis. Elara’s agency lies in calcification, a narrowing of infinite patterns into measurable weights, which forecloses chaos at the cost of permanent entrapment. The escalation is textural: silence layers, shadows regress, and sorrows accumulate until the loom’s “glacier” grind forces crystallization. Cost is felt in the pouch’s “distinct mass” of regrets—each a compressed lifetime of unspoken pain.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—transforming absence into functional presence—is signaled early and deepens as Mara carves the blank into a kettle handle. The escalation is driven by her agency: she chooses ritual over rupture, shaping rather than shattering. Cost is legible in what’s omitted (no lions, no tent, no body—only the shipped remains) and in the handle’s unfinished state, which forecloses completion yet affirms continuity. The tightening occurs when steam cuts through rain, forcing a pause that crystallizes her resolve to return to work.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—negotiating with one’s ghost to reclaim lost potential—is signaled by line 3 and tightens when the ghost rejects collected stories, demanding personal regret instead. This deepening forces Mara’s pivotal choice: surrender curated fragments or confess her own failures. The escalation is driven entirely by her agency; no coincidence intervenes. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits her present solidity to restore her past self.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—resurrecting possibility from obsolescence—is signaled early and deepens when Maya redirects flows against original design, narrowing options (no return to spaceport function) while creating new ones (greenhouse). Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: each rerouted pump or salvaged rail tightens pressure toward the dawn test. Cost is unmistakable: the terminal can never again serve silver ships, a sacrifice made visible in the spiral gardens replacing departure gates. Coincidence (carnival pumps) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Maya’s choices do.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reconciling abandoned ambition—is signaled early and deepens via Elara’s refusal to wind the metronome, a pivotal tightening that rejects regret’s rhythm. Agency is clear: she chooses surrender over performance, endurance over revival. Cost is felt in bodily ache and emotional lightness. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; one meaningful deepening suffices, executed with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding the architecture of lies—is signaled early and deepens when Mara shifts from seeking treasure to studying deception. The tightening occurs when she realizes her “errant wandering” was necessary, foreclosing the path of blind faith. Agency is clear: her instinctive method unlocks the truth. Cost is felt in the loss of innocence and the physical toll of sleepless nights, culminating in the mud-sinking stride that embodies earned clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserving storm-calming technique—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency: Elias chooses slowness over haste, embodiment over transcription. The tightening occurs at the final knot, where he nearly lost the method last season; now he must coax, not take. Cost is felt in physical toll and deferred utility—he carries a seed that “will grow only when shared,” accepting isolation as price. Fog’s advance acts as a live clock, narrowing his window, though its pressure remains atmospheric rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding healing’s geography—is signaled early and deepens when the Duchess’s projected presence flickers under wind pressure, forcing Elian to write faster. His agency drives escalation: projecting warmth, then racing against dissolution, culminating in the decisive act of binding thread to wrist. Cost is unmistakable: he accepts lonesome survival, trading reunion for the “splendor” of documented absence, paid for in solitude and vacant spaces.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—reawakening beauty in a dead world—is signaled early and tightens through Elian’s assembly of the resonance chamber, which forecloses alternatives (e.g., abandoning the experiment). The escalation is driven by his agency: decades of research culminate in one circuit. Cost is unmistakable: even success births a creature into chains and smoke, and the prince’s trembling hands embody the price of hope. The flaw is minor—the world’s opposition remains abstract, not tactical—but the emotional stakes deepen credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming sensation from fire’s legacy—is signaled early and deepens when Maya grafts kelp to scar tissue, narrowing options to this desperate alchemy. Escalation is driven by her agency: each step (tying coin, submerging) tightens pressure under the Accumulative lens. Cost is unmistakable: surrendering to oceanic uncertainty, risking bodily harm, and confronting her father’s legacy. The red thread lifeline embodies the trade-off between connection and isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—liberating trapped memories before frost seals them—is signaled early and escalates via the geese’s temporal window. Agency is clear: Elara follows breadcrumbs, waits with sidereal patience, and acts at stellar alignment. Cost is conceptual (truth remains buried until spring) but unmistakable. Escalation stems from protagonist’s tactics under Accumulative lens, though the “ticking clock” leans slightly on coincidence (geese pausing).

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—breaking generational patterns of conflagration—is signaled early and deepens when sonar reveals “black veins of shame.” Elara’s agency drives escalation: she reinterprets the gear not as key but lantern, altering tactics. Cost is unmistakable: her dissolution into light forecloses personal continuity. Pressure tightens via environmental feedback (distorted echoes, weeping cavity), forcing her renunciation of possession for preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—discovering the shape of collective grief—is signaled early and deepens when grandmother demands retracing sorrow’s origin. The tightening occurs when Elias shifts from carving new letters to following existing grooves, connecting graves via ribbon: a trade-off that forecloses solitary monument-making for relational weaving. Cost is felt in the shortened ribbon, departed butterflies, and winter ahead. Agency drives escalation; coincidence (migration timing) complicates but doesn’t resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—restoring shared temporal balance—is signaled early and deepens when Elias recalls Sarah’s bakery failing and Thomas missing his wife’s last breath. The tightening occurs during the four-second pause: a live window where error would compound chaos. Protagonist agency drives escalation; he alone deciphers the rake’s inscriptions to calculate redemption. Cost is unmistakable: decades of self-imposed isolation crystallized in “microscopic steps toward restoring shared balance.”

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—uncovering why wealth was abandoned for gardening—is signaled early and deepens through textile decoding. The escalation is driven by Mara’s agency: her fingers “separating tangled fibers” lead to coordinates, then confession, then blueprint. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: she inherits not treasure but responsibility, a life bound to channeling grief. The chess clock’s recurrence tightens time pressure subtly, though a more visceral forfeiture (e.g., sacrificing a personal dream) would heighten stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—whether humanity adapts within limits or collapses into chaos—is signaled early and tightened by the seven-prophecy constraint. Elara’s agency lies in renunciation: she foregoes revolutionary chaos for regenerative change, accepting that her influence must be indirect and delayed. Cost is legible in the “seventeen thousand variants” discarded and the suffocating word limit. Escalation occurs through deepening insight (“innovation required constraints to thrive”), not external pressure, fitting the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—ending the story famine through nonverbal narrative—is signaled early and deepens when musicians weep during rests, proving the method works. The escalation is driven by Elias’s agency: he sings lyrics aloud, triggering the dust’s transformation. Cost is legible: years of solitude, the silent radio, the burden of being the sole keeper of luminous knowledge. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via textural density, not plot turns, and culminates in a reconfigured world.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether grief can be preserved without distortion—is signaled early and tightened by Elias’s ritual: each action (powdering ash, wearing shards) narrows his emotional options. The deepening occurs when he realizes safety was “a mirage,” forcing renunciation of denial. Cost is felt in “three winters of bitter isolation” and the irreversible act of burning the portrait. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative pressure, not coincidence, culminating in a stance crystallization that forecloses hope of reconciliation.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. myth—is signaled early and escalates through Elias’s discovery of the cog, forcing renunciation of surface debate. His agency drives deepening: cleaning the cog becomes rebellion against councils weaponizing confusion. Cost is unmistakable—enduring silence, risking confiscation—and tightens options to underground pedagogy. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with tide-flood raising tangible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming harmony across hatred—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s realization that “true harmony came not by adding complexity, but by subtracting noise.” The escalation is protagonist-driven: Elias teaches the method, then watches students enact it through restraint, each omission a renunciation of inherited grievance. The cost is legible: the miner’s daughter’s trembling hands, the refugee’s family having burned concert halls, and the looming winter outside. This single deepening—subtraction as reconciliation—narrows tactics and reweights every gesture toward closure.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—creating beauty from ruins by clearing neural space for suppressed truth—is signaled early and tightens when Mara releases specific traumatic memories (soldier’s kill, mother’s loss). The celestial alignment imposes a live clock, forcing irrevocable action. Agency is internal but decisive: her meditative will actively prunes synapses, narrowing options from passive absorption to active cultivation. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits accumulated wisdom-as-burden to enable new growth, and the final image shows vines spiraling “with impossible speed,” implying irreversible transformation. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—truth versus systemic erasure—is signaled early and intensifies through Elias’s compulsion to speak. The meaningful deepening occurs when he reveals the drones “evolved,” transforming the malfunction from error to emergence. This insight narrows options: the engineer can no longer view repair as neutral. Cost is legible in the Corporation’s looming threat and Elias’s isolation, crystallized in the final descent where truth is carried away, not contained. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding architectural sentience—is signaled early and deepens into participatory witness, narrowing options from observer to co-creator. The tightening occurs when Maya places the orris root beside the crystalline silence, an act of inadvertent sanctification that reweights all prior noticing. Cost is legible: the houses awaken more fully because of her, altering their behavior (“fence posts would have moved again”) and implicating her in their ongoing conversation. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, with no coincidental resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—whether to propagate a truth that embraces nuance over certainty—is signaled early and deepens when Corvin realizes restoration is less vital than introducing gradient. His agency drives escalation: choosing the flaw over ceremony, shattering the ampoule to thread ambivalence. Cost is unmistakable: the garden’s rigid roots spiral into uncertainty, and Corvin accepts his own complexity as traitor and midwife. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence or soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—capturing the texture of a missed opportunity—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s refusal to descend, her mathematical gambit, and the dice’s asymmetry. Escalation is driven by her agency: writing proofs, factoring regret, accepting observer-dependence. The cost is unmistakable: eternal recurrence continues, but she trades illusion of progress for finite, embodied truth. “Balancedly daring” manifests in her calibrated risk—proofs must be bold enough to break logic yet stable enough not to collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—resurrecting extinct kindness—is signaled early and deepens through each painted word, narrowing Maya’s options to this single lunar window. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: she chooses which visions to render, each act depleting her stamina. Cost is unmistakable: insomnia as necessary vessel, body hollowed for transmission. The tightening forecloses rest, making dawn’s arrival not relief but endpoint with opportunity cost.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving memory before erasure—is signaled early and deepens when the bread map transforms tradition into survival tool. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she gathers elders, interprets symbols, and commits to documentation. The cost is legible: isolation, decaying artifacts, and the looming dam collapse. Though external pressure (beekeeper’s departure, ice dam) is strong, the tightening stems from her choice to “thaw collective memory,” making the stakes visceral rather than abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (escaping inherited fate) is signaled early and tightens via the low-tide deadline. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to mount the stone, initiating reversal. Cost is unmistakable—she erases her biological lineage but vanishes into “absolute uncertainty.” The deepening (realizing descent can be negated at the spin’s center) narrows options to one irreversible act. Coincidence (tide revealing stone) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from her decades of work.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—escaping the photographic curse by confronting maternal guilt—is signaled early and tightens when the advisor reveals the camera “steals final moments.” Mara’s agency drives escalation: she enters the funhouse to “trick fear,” then chooses to unbosom her darkest truth, which directly collapses the curse. The cost is visceral: relinquishing the clasp (her mother’s legacy and insurance motive) and the screaming dead. Fear’s weakness—“nothing left to hide”—is tested through Mara’s voluntary self-exposure, making the resolution causally inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transforming chaos into music—is signaled early and tightens through protagonist agency: her dubbing directly shapes the storm’s behavior. Escalation occurs via cadence shift (from solitary striking to full orchestral collaboration) and deepening (visible harmonics mapping turbulence). Cost is unmistakable: her survival hinges on continuous creation; cessation equals disintegration. Though pressure coheres, the tightening lacks a foreclosed option—she never risks abandoning her mission, slightly softening the trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the watchers—is signaled early and tightens when Elara realizes they’re questions, not guardians. Her agency drives escalation: arranging shells, playing sequences, translating interrogation. The deepening (expedition didn’t die but transcended) raises conceptual stakes, forcing her final choice. Cost is unmistakable: trading the safety of mapping for the peril of becoming part of the pattern, felt in “dread of absolute knowing” and the irreversible stirring of the turtles.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. merciful deception—is signaled early and deepens when Elena realizes Ashford embedded clues. Her agency drives escalation: arranging documents, deciphering parallels, choosing publication framing. The phone buzz forces crystallization, but her choice stems from prior logic, not coincidence. Cost is felt in the “weight” of each sleeper-step and the burden of carrying truth “against her heart”—a tangible, emotional price that shapes the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—rescuing abandoned dreams before structural collapse—is signaled early and deepens as Elara discovers the child’s toy and the architect’s tragic backstory. Pressure escalates through physical resistance (rusted hinges, cold, silt) and emotional weight (interlaced absence), culminating in her decision to embed her final note, which forecloses immediate departure and commits her to return. The cost is felt in her trembling, shivering, and the quiet triumph that carries exhaustion. Though escalation is textural rather than causal, it remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with one meaningful deepening: the shift from measurement to eulogy.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—establishing truthful land ownership—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes the deeds may stem from divergent timelines. The blackout intensifies pressure by removing artificial light and sound, forcing reliance on perception. His agency is intellectual but decisive: choosing to rebuild the catalog around cross-references forecloses the path of singular narrative. The cost—time, labor, and paradigm shift—is tangible, though the external consequences (e.g., who owns what above) remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—transforming grief into flight—tightens decisively when Mira realizes she must fold gems, not glass. This deepening narrows options: only her polished stones hold memory; only origami-crane folds compress loss. Agency drives escalation—each fold requires descending into sorrow while ascending beyond it, with visible cost in her fading body. The final trade-off (self-annihilation for universal blessing) crystallizes under coherent pressure, with no coincidental resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—locating the convergence point of unused potential—is signaled early and deepens through Amara’s realization that she seeks not revenge but confirmation of residual existence. Pressure escalates via the thermal countdown, forcing tactical adaptation (using the geode as interface). The meaningful tightening occurs when calculations resolve not to coordinates of vengeance but of quantum residue, reweighting her goal. Cost is felt: five minutes before AI surveillance resumes, and the geode fractures accepting data—a physical toll for metaphysical access.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—decoding the frequency of belonging—is signaled early and deepens through physical struggle (pulling the lever) and intellectual tension (aligning star trails). Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens: each step tightens calibration, narrowing margin for error. Cost is felt in bodily strain and emotional vulnerability, though the absence of tangible loss (e.g., tool breakage, time pressure) slightly softens price. Coincidence (chip matching sketches) complicates but doesn’t resolve—agency remains central.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—measuring the weight of a withheld truth—is signaled early and tightens when Elias finds the final carving, forcing him to confront the unbroken lineage he tried to sever. The meaningful deepening occurs when he shifts from passive sifting to active witnessing, narrowing his path to restitution. Cost is visible in his raw hands and tempered regret, though escalation leans more on accumulation than causal pressure. Still, the stakes feel viscerally real, not abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—securing a prisoner exchange without reigniting violence—is signaled early and deepened through the negotiator’s lunar timing and symbolic gestures. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: the synchronized footsteps, clinking shackles, and thickening mist narrow the window for success. The cost is felt in the scout’s chains and the unspoken grief of the northern delegate, though the escalation leans more on atmosphere than decisive tactical reversal. Still, the protagonist’s agency drives every turn, and the price of failure hangs palpably in the air.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reconciling broken identity with navigational failure—is signaled early and deepens via the utility-pole method. The tightening occurs when Elias chooses poles over stars, narrowing options to terrestrial truth. Cost is felt in revoked license, divorce, and the compass’s abandonment. Agency drives escalation: his choice to follow poles, then leave the compass, crystallizes his stance without coincidence resolving tension.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming empathy before becoming a feelingless killer—is signaled by line 3 and tightens through each failed tableau, culminating in the lake’s demand for surrender. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: Mara chooses to descend, consults clippings, and ultimately throws the baseball. Cost is unmistakable: physical weight of guilt, tears for victims, and permanent neural rewiring. The labyrinth’s moral crossroads force trade-offs that narrow options toward vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reforging a bond beyond death—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s reluctant metamorphosis. The tightening occurs when she pours the spices, irrevocably committing to transformation; the cost (permanent stasis) is legible at closure. Agency is clear: her heartbeat conjures, her choice initiates the bridge. Though the method borders on mystical convenience, the emotional calculus—love as “violent becoming”—grounds the escalation in credible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming or sanctifying lost time—is signaled early and deepens when the Nine of Shadows reveals the true task: opening, not solving. The meaningful tightening occurs when Elara shifts from seeking retrieval to performing sanctification, foreclosing the path of resentment. Cost is felt in the “ache with sweetness” at her sternum and the irreversible acceptance that motherhood transforms time. Agency drives every escalation; no coincidence intervenes.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—integration of collective trauma—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s confrontation with his own shadow. The meaningful tightening occurs when he accepts his capacity for harm, which directly enables the stitching act. Cost is unmistakable: his physical dissolution. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, though the “locked dimension” remains abstract until the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding transformation’s texture—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s realization that his poverty was preparation. Agency lies in release, not control: each jar opened narrows his options (he cannot reclaim the bugs or his past) while aligning with cosmic forces. Cost is unmistakable: he trades life for legacy, anonymity for posthumous purpose. The escalation is driven by protagonist choice (opening jars) under Accumulative pressure, though the volcano’s “invitation” slightly leans on coincidence rather than pure character-driven narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—sparking a silent revolution—is signaled early and deepens when the blackout reveals the sundial’s true geometry. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she doesn’t wait for opportunity; she completes the coded angles by touch. The cost is conceptual yet undeniable: the fortress’s foundational timekeeping is subverted, permanently altering perception of order. Coincidence (blackout) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the victory is earned through preparation.

    Dominant stake—deciphering time’s patterns despite physical law collapse—is signaled early and tightens relentlessly. The herder’s agency drives escalation: he designs the topological harness, places the final stone, steps into the field. Cost is unmistakable: dissolution of self. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each detail (migration routes, prime numbers) deepens the central conflict without coincidence resolving anything.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—transforming inherited silence into testimony—is signaled early and escalates through protagonist agency: deciphering the negative, recognizing the shared vigil, choosing to write. The meaningful deepening occurs when the storm clarifies the photograph, forcing Elara to accept her role in a lineage of resistance. Cost is unmistakable: physical exhaustion, the surrender of pure silence, and the risk of future seizure. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with no coincidental resolution.

    Dominant stake—turning questions into destinations—is signaled early and deepened through the duel, which serves as both combat and collaborative calibration. The meaningful tightening occurs when Aldric uses superior torque to create space for the needle alignment, narrowing options to a single interpretive act. Cost is felt: breathlessness, physical strain, and the surrender of solitary interpretation for shared purpose. Agency drives escalation; coincidence plays no role.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserving knowledge and hope against erasure—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s narrowing window of identity coherence. The meaningful tightening occurs when he admits his molt is imminent, forcing Marcus to act before recognition fades. Cost is legible: Elias may forget his purpose, yet they proceed anyway, accepting that loss as part of resistance. Agency is clear (Elias chooses to deliver the tin despite knowing he’ll vanish), though escalation leans more on emotional weight than tactical shift, fitting the Accumulative lens but missing a sharper physical consequence.

    Dominant stake—finding refuge from atmospheric decay—is signaled early and deepens when the storm approaches and the station trembles. Elena’s agency drives escalation: her “strategically creative” modifications enable decoding, and her unplanned encore alters fate. Cost is unmistakable: three years of longing, the broken clock’s resurrection only after correct frequency, and the physical toll of “desperate hope.” Pressure tightens coherently under Accumulative/Textural lens, culminating in a trade-off between surrender and defiant persistence.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving cultural memory before monsoon—tightens as rain approaches and roots race toward the aquifer. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she plants, dreams, sings, and interprets, each act narrowing options (e.g., choosing doubt over certainty). Cost is felt in her luminous uncertainty and the ever-present risk of corruption. The monsoon isn’t coincidence; it’s a live clock that forces the final song and crystallizes her stance on evolution vs. preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—navigating the “color of unspoken apologies”—tightens when the compass compels Mara to the cliff, foreclosing avoidance. The deepening occurs when lace instructions reframe pruning as release, altering her tactics. Cost is visible: she must confront Elias’s unsaid words and her own silence, crystallized in the bonsai’s windswept cascade. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens—each sensory encounter (lace, compass, ocean) reweights remembrance until the final stance emerges.
