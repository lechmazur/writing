    Dominant stake is signaled early: shift from explosive-event research to gradual-change methodology. Pressure tightens when Lena explains the device and its contrast to her prior work; Amir's questioning forces her to articulate cost ("maybe warning is nothing but paying attention early enough"). The final beat—"her datasets would look to others like nothing but smudges"—crystallizes the professional risk and acceptance. One meaningful deepening (flood lesson → dust methodology → acceptance of obscurity) with visible cost (career legibility, dramatic results). Under the Accumulative lens, escalation reads as density increase and cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: discovering the would-be killer's identity and deciding whether to confront him. Pressure tightens when the ledger's date matches the explosion night and the ghost ink reveals arrows, narrowing options to one path. Agency is clear—walking the pass is a choice to pursue rather than retreat—and the cost (leaving safety, accepting danger) is visible. The escalation is primarily accumulative rather than a sharp causal reversal, and the antagonist remains off-page, which limits the visceral test of the stake. Strong, but one notch below exceptional due to the absence of a live confrontation or complication that forces a trade-off in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—translating silence into felt music—is signaled early through the note and tuning forks, then tightened when Lio triggers Grief 1 and feels the glass chime in his ribs, narrowing his options from passive survival to active rectification. The escalation is textural: sensor-gloves, actuator rig, city-wide vision each deepen the commitment with the final cost clear: "his own body, wrecked and waterlogged, would be the first instrument." Agency is renunciation with purpose. Minor note: the middle beat (Wonder 3 profile) adds texture but does not introduce new friction; one obstacle or failed attempt would add a second pressure point.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: "give rest a permanent address." The librarian's revelation—"rest has gone missing"—tightens pressure meaningfully, and the broken lens provides a concrete constraint. Elias's protest ("I bury bodies, not cities") and the librarian's reframe force a trade-off that narrows options. However, the final acceptance is told in summary ("The task was not to heal... but to shelve them properly") rather than shown through one specific shelving act with visible friction, which keeps the tightening legible but not viscerally felt. Cost is conceptual (expanding his role) rather than physical or relational, fitting the Accumulative lens but limiting band height.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: preserve community cohesion while solving the mystery. Pressure tightens once when Kito's confession reframes anonymous giving as intergenerational covenant, forcing Mara to choose exposure or silence. Her decision—"I want them to know what they are building"—narrows options with visible cost (ending protective secrecy). The sanctions backdrop and midnight deliveries sustain coherent pressure under the Accumulative lens. One solid tightening suffices for this length; agency is decision with on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: finding where unused love is stored and whether it can be released. The camera experiment tightens when Arun turns the lens on himself, seeing the corridor of withheld gestures—narrowing his understanding. The boy encounter deepens stakes by offering a live test of the breathing method. Agency is clear: Arun approaches, matches breath, and releases the lantern. Cost is visible in the "lantern loosen inside his own chest" and the shift from solitary pilgrim to active participant. One meaningful escalation under the accumulative lens is sufficient here.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering time's texture—is signaled early and coherent throughout. The journey from youngest bridge to middle span provides spatial escalation, and the narrator's decision to "attempt what the maze hints at" marks a tightening. However, the escalation reads more as dreamlike drift than agency-driven pressure; the narrator's movement toward dissolution lacks a live trade-off or visible cost that would narrow options. The final step "after" the halo fragment feels passive, and no credible alternative path is foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—protecting the seed vault—is signaled early and tightens when the Overseer begins decoding the bench, forcing Mara's real-time misdirection. Her agency is renunciation and endurance under chains combined with active deflection (the timed cough, the hand-guiding). One clear escalation: keys spill, she reads his hierarchy, and her window to impede collapses to spoken guidance. The cost is legible—sustained deception while chained, with the building's collapse as the alternative. Coincidence does not resolve; her prior study and present choices drive the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (capture the sound of trust breaking to warn others) is signaled in the first third and deepens through repeated testing cycles. Pressure escalates under the accumulative lens: each dive harvests absences, the prototype "trembles," and the protagonist narrows in on "pale green, turning, deciding" until the kitchen memory surges back with structural clarity. Agency is exercised through engineering choice and self-recognition; the final act—"adjust a filament, and let the broken blue swirl through it again"—forecloses the path of denial with visible cost (acceptance that "no device can change that").

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding what the protagonist has truly been stealing—is signaled early and pursued throughout. However, pressure accumulates through atmospheric description rather than tightening choices; the stranger's arrival and instruction ("open the jar," "take it now") guide the protagonist without forcing a dilemma or trade-off. The shutter-click at the platform feels less like a decision under duress and more like compliance, and the final uncertainty about theft direction reads as thematic reconfiguration rather than a choice that forecloses a live option with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake signaled early: transforming a place of certainty into a safe zone for inquiry. One meaningful tightening occurs when Corin narrates his shift from blowing targeting lenses to crafting vessels for unfinished thoughts, narrowing his options and foreclosing the old precision work. The protagonist's final choice to return and "bring someone who thinks they are uninteresting" crystallizes agency with felt cost: stepping into a question that warms itself. Escalation is driven by protagonist observation and receptivity; coincidence does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.2)
    One dominant stake is signaled early: proving identity and worth after erasure. The pressure tightens when the protagonist finds the cast list with her face beside another name, then deepens when the boy's cipher offers a method to rewrite the script. The final choice to walk into the production office shaking forecloses passivity with visible cost (risking further professional erasure), but the escalation remains more conceptual than tactical—no live trade-off or loss alters moves mid-scene. Agency is clear but the consequence is Charged Poise rather than a decisive on-page reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: to map an endless night before the last star vanishes. The timeframe tightens options (star trembling, then snuffed), and the oracle's agency—closing her eyes, counting silences, marking arcs—drives the central action. One meaningful deepening occurs when darkness arrives and the captain realizes he can still see by the map's sheen, reweighting the problem from light-based navigation to silence-based passage. The cost is conceptual (abandoning light-charts, embracing "quiet grammar") but remains more implied than viscerally paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: HEPA-3's question about where thoughts originate. Pressure accumulates through hundreds of loops, each adding observational density (frost feathers, voice tremble, reflection fracture) until the 612th touch releases sound and the doubled aerial view—a meaningful tightening that narrows his processing from diagnostic code to "a place where different kinds of seeing could meet." Agency manifests in varied iterations (refusal, harder press) testing whether self-image can change. The loops' failure to close cleanly and transition to full evening forecloses return to baseline functionality. Cost is visible: the violin puddles, his fingertips frost, and his answer to Dr. Roe marks permanent departure from scheduled maintenance.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—connection across mistrust—is signaled early and tightens through accumulation: contraband tickets, archival eavesdropping, recognition of self in the hooded figure. One meaningful deepening: the registrar moves from passive cataloging to active approach. Agency is clear in the walk toward the stranger; the cost is foreclosure of her hidden life. Escalation operates through density increase and cadence shift, consistent with the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: proving that measured luck does not own the whole story, signaled early via the hospital prognosis and Elias's choice of shears over rest. One meaningful tightening occurs when visitors return and engage the marbles, validating his system. The rolling-marble divination and the planted commemorations show agency, yet the escalation feels more like accumulation than a narrowing choice with visible trade-off. Cost is conceptual (his body becoming wood) but the ending does not foreclose a live alternative with friction on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—stabilizing the embryos and proving time moves sideways—is signaled early and tightened when Rae warns that failure means "violent awakenings" and loss of the valley's future. Ilen's lever adjustment narrows options and delivers a visible payoff: the embryos stabilize, the prism hums, and the valley remains at rest. The pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens, with one meaningful deepening. Cost is conceptual and felt (the tremor, the ice-warm hush) but not viscerally paid in a visible tradeoff or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—unraveling the ghost's coded rebellion—is signaled early and escalates through accumulative discovery: faces in stains, then blot-notes, then the realization about gaps and silence. The musician's agency is present in choosing to trace, hum, and finally accept the score with visible cost: complicity in a banned work's mutiny. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful tightening occurs when he realizes "the code was not only in the markings, but in the pauses," reweighting his understanding and narrowing his path to acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to confront the suppressed storm-steering hypothesis—is signaled early and tightens through oracle revelation and Mara's memory recovery. One meaningful reversal occurs when the oracle reveals it preserved rather than erased the hypothesis, forcing Mara to decide whether to accept the weight. Agency is clear: Mara's fever confession, her request for burial, and her final acceptance all narrow options with visible cost. The price is felt: she moves from erasure-seeking to burden-carrying, foreclosing the path of denial and accepting isolation from mentors who "insisted on faith in the models." Pressure remains coherent under the Causal lens; coincidence does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: to find the weight of Evan's swallowed truth and rebalance blame. The piece signals this early ("something that will finally let us find the weight of a swallowed truth") and tightens once when Evan's whispered confession names the hidden workers and the narrator moves from sarcasm to cataloguing names as evidence. That shift narrows options—dismissal is no longer tenable—but the narrator's agency remains largely receptive rather than decisional. Pressure accumulates via the tunnel's atmosphere and the beaded valve as rough altar, but the final image is a felt rebalancing rather than a choice that forecloses a path with a hard cost. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is sufficient at this length, and the cost is legible in the relational shift and the narrator's acknowledgment of complicity.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to step inside change or remain apart—is signaled early and tightens when the swan offers the path. One meaningful pressure point occurs when blank pages unfurl and "ink began to seep from his footprints, sketching scenes he had never seen," forcing the choice between neutrality and engagement. Agency resides primarily in stepping forward rather than a trade-off with visible alternatives; the protagonist is more carrier than decider. The resolution earns its stance through prior causality, but the escalation remains a single deepening rather than compounding turns.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: Mara aims to transform residents' unease into shared wonder during the eclipse, risking that "wonder could tip into fear." The courtyard gathering forces a public test; she stops playing to let silence hold, a micro-choice that deepens pressure. Lake reaching for Mr. Alvarez's hand and Mara's exhale mark the tightening; the final image (the curl seen in the ring of fire) reweights the stake with felt cost. One meaningful turn suffices under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—recovering wall-stored memory—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through discovery: the diary's question about dreaming, the tapestry's displaced axis, leading to Brann's realization that every age rehearses the same existential worry. One meaningful deepening occurs when he recognizes "the walls of every age" share the pattern, which reweights his task from archival curiosity to near-religious commitment. The tightening is conceptual rather than a dramatic reversal, fitting the accumulative lens, though the cost remains more philosophical than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: whether the narrator remains passive translator or actively steers intelligence flow. The escalation is causal—accidental prophecy leads to Parker's arrival, Parker sees the bottle-reflection message, narrator must choose complicity. The lighthouse rewrite forecloses the innocent stance with visible action. However, the peak turn (rewriting the sequence) is compressed and the immediate consequence is deferred to "tomorrow's customers" rather than landing in present tense; cost is conceptual and projected rather than paid on the page in the climactic beat.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: free the girl before possession completes. Jonas's agency drives escalation through three beats—establishing the loop, engaging the demon verbally, then painting the ultramarine and launching his rhetorical trap. The demon's contradictions become the visible mechanism of defeat: "every sentence snagged on a mirror...every assertion tangled in another question." Cost is legible in Jonas's careful labor and the time spent "hours yet before the possession completes" that he must navigate. The tightening when "the chapel seemed to contract" and "something uncoiled in her shoulders" delivers a clear narrowing of options to the demon.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.2)
    One dominant stake is clear: Eli seeks to "conduct unheard symphonies" by writing the right fortune at the right hour. Pressure is steady rather than escalating; the "deadlines stacked high" constraint is declared but never tested with visible friction or narrowing options. The tightening from "soft slippage between times" to "cleaner, narrower longing" is a textural deepening under the Accumulative lens, but the final baton-raise doesn't dramatize agency or cost—it's anticipation without consequence. The piece needed one moment where writing or not-writing forecloses a live path; instead, the ending is poise without price.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—conquering the labyrinth of self by bearing witness to fractured timelines—is signaled early and tightens once when Lio steps off the railing into the corridor maze. That turn narrows options (he cannot float away; he must retrace). The corridor sequence, however, lists alternate selves in rapid summary rather than dramatizing even one full decision with visible friction or trade-off on the page. The final act (releasing the tablet, gravity returning) carries legible cost and forecloses the path of endless procedural iteration, but the escalation itself relies on told consequence rather than shown pressure, capping the score below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—defeating the children's numbness—is signaled early and tightened when the phonograph activates and the drums wake. The tightening occurs through Jorin's contact (one reversal from flinch to sob) and the group's follow-through, narrowing options from vacant stares to embodied grief. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: each tactile beat adds density until the final release. Minor limitation: the mechanism's success feels somewhat assured once activated; a moment of doubt or friction mid-scene would have sharpened the stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (integrity versus erasure) signals early and tightens once: discovering the tube raises a choice, decoding "Simply listen upwind" narrows options, and hearing pigeons forces stance crystallization with visible cost (shift from passive archivist to active chronicler for unknown senders). Agency is decision with renunciation: the narrator forecloses ministry loyalty. No antagonist needed; the ministry's absent surveillance and the pigeon network's trust create accumulative pressure under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether to expand or shrink one's life-texture—is signaled midway and crystallizes at the end. The poet's prison escape and rope provide a prior example but do not create a reversal for the protagonist. The piece offers one meaningful deepening: the protagonist's recognition of their own "safe job / lover / scholarship" triangle and the shift from binary (good/evil) to textural (shrinking/expanding) thinking. No on-page tightening forecloses a live option; the cost remains potential rather than paid in scene. Escalation operates via accumulative density rather than causal pressure, fitting the inferred lens but lacking a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—finding beauty in the unfinished—signals early via mother's teaching and drives Elio's incomplete phrasing. Mara's invitation creates one meaningful tightening: Elio moves from public busking (passive reception) to private performance (active collaboration), which enables the bowl gesture. The pumps analogy and sapling's crooked growth deepen the stake without reversing it. Cost is conceptual but legible: renouncing coin-collection (survival mechanism) to adopt listening stance. Under Accumulative lens, one deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Eve's unreliable feelings threaten her role as memory auditor, requiring "clarity" and "professional thoroughness." The tightening occurs when the dealer offers the ampoule with a clear price: "your certainties will be subsumed into questions," and "you may not like the person who walks back out." Eve's agency drives the turn—she reaches "hungrily" despite the warning, foreclosing her former authoritarian clarity. The cost is visible: she must accept permanent uncertainty and self-estrangement to gain calibrated empathy. Escalation under the Accumulative lens is achieved through intensifying sensory density (static deepening, copper arcing, ampoule breaking) rather than reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake: whether Elias can deliver gratitude and shift his transactional worldview. The letter's detour introduces pressure, and the conversation with Marin tightens when he must articulate why the letter's loss mattered ("perhaps it needed a detour through someone who had forgotten how gratitude sounds"). The scheme to host readings deepens the commitment with a visible cost (funding, time, reputation risk implied). One clear reversal: Marin's deflection ("the lanterns are for whoever needs them") tests Elias's resolve, and he pushes through by reframing the letter's value. The escalation is modest but coherent under the accumulative lens; a sharper on-page trade-off (e.g., a deal he must abandon to fund this) would raise the score.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—Elian's desire to graft onto community—is signaled early and tightens through the shared search. One meaningful turn: discovering "Stay and scatter" reweights his sculpture from place-dedication to kinship-web. Mira's directive narrows options, pushing Elian toward collaborative making with visible cost (forsaking solitary work). Escalation under Accumulative lens is present but gentle; no second reversal or complication raises the cost further. The sculpture decision crystallizes commitment (Charged Poise), yet the pressure feels more conversational than stressed—missed opportunity for a micro-friction (e.g., doubt about whether strangers will participate) that would test resolve on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—find the birthplace of echoes before the giant's nap ends—is signaled in the opening third and maintained through the pendant's hum and the keeper's urgency. One meaningful tightening occurs when the protagonist twists the pendant into "a tightened knot," peeling sound away and exposing unborn echoes, then faces the realization that capturing one would impose authorial control. The release decision forecloses the commission's literal goal with felt cost: "I brought back drawings, not chains" acknowledges failure to deliver the client's request. Agency is clear—the protagonist chooses renunciation over capture—and the cost is on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding/retrieving Lio—is signaled early and tightens when Corren realizes retrieval would "tear open every branch." The conjuring attempt escalates through murmured equations and shifting reflections, then deepens via the protagonist's agency when he shifts the spell toward acceptance. The cost is legible: he forgoes retrieval and accepts the shape of absence. No antagonist or multiple reversals, but pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens and one meaningful tightening (the shift) forecloses a path, meeting the threshold for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—Marrow's wish to become visible to those who need him—is signaled early and tightens through the tape discovery and the librarian's passage below. The outage creates a window; Marrow's decision to play the tape narrows options (he cannot step into the light himself, so he acts through echoes). The librarian's sag and covered face constitute a visible response, though it reads more as Marrow's observation than a mutual pivot. One meaningful deepening occurs: Marrow realizes he is "visible now… through their own awakened senses," reconfiguring his original wish with felt cost (permanent hiddenness). Agency leans observational; a more visceral trade-off at the tape-playing beat would elevate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: Mara's resistance to unscheduled growth versus the involuntary metamorphosis pressing inside her. Pressure accumulates through the storm season's early arrival, the wounded-but-leafing linden, and her repeated returns to the trellis despite knowing she should lock up and go home. One meaningful tightening: when the leaf heats in her pocket and her knees give, forcing confrontation with what she has been circling. Agency is present in micro-choices (pocketing the leaf, returning to the trellis, touching it again) that narrow options until surrender becomes unavoidable. The cost is legible: she loses the control she has built her life around, kneeling in mud as "every hour she had spent...had been teaching her how to reconstruct herself...by releasing control." No explicit antagonist needed; the pressure is internal and environmental, cohering under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: secure reprieve for the island (filters, not trinkets). Mara's agency drives escalation—finding the brooch, deciding to trade it, walking the rain trail to the checkpoint. The tightening is meaningful: she moves from observer to actor, risking the mainland crossing. Visible cost: she leaves the island with only the brooch and packed paintings, no papers, trusting the artifact to substitute. One minor gap: Eron's joke ("Unless you can exchange it for rainfall somewhere") lands with slightly too much on-the-nose weight as the pivot moment, nudging convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Lyra's plan to teach everyday magic—is signaled early and complicated when the cave's chorus turns unpredictable. One meaningful deepening occurs: Mira's realization that "unseen forces...are tired of being predictions" shifts both women's stances. However, escalation is more atmospheric than agentic; the cave acts upon them rather than their choices narrowing options. The final acceptance lacks visible cost—no prior tactic is abandoned or price paid on the page, only contemplative reweighting of roles.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—compiling fragments into meaning before the tide edits them—is signaled early and sustained through Mara's systematic archival walk. Pressure tightens when she finds the herald's valve and identifies it as Caven's, narrowing her task to one specific absence. The ending crystallizes the stake: Caven's thin note is the first live sound attempting harmony, and Mara's reactive stance ("met his gaze without expectation") embodies the cost of waiting for others to act. One meaningful deepening occurs when she shifts from collecting objects to "charting not the debris but the absences themselves," reweighting her method. Minor gap: the crowd's assembly lacks a traceable catalyst beyond Mara's placement of the valve, slightly softening the escalation's causal bite.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Adrian will follow the mysterious arrows and discover their purpose—is signaled early and tightens when he encounters the shadow-doorway. His agency is clear: he chooses to step through despite fear. The conductor's final challenge ("someone must finally map the way back from silence") reweights the stakes from personal curiosity to collective obligation, a meaningful deepening. However, the escalation relies more on atmospheric accumulation than on narrowing options through reversals; the arrows always lead forward, and no genuine obstacle tests his commitment before the threshold crossing.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (how to honor grandmother's memory without surrendering skepticism) is signaled early and tightens through the transcription sequence. The tile warming and symbols blooming create one meaningful escalation that narrows options: Lio must either flee the shared shadows or engage. Agency is renunciation with visible cost—the surrender of pure rationalism ("my doubt had grown spacious enough"). Weakness: the whales operate as atmospheric pressure rather than direct stakes-raisers, diluting urgency slightly in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (learning what happens after goodbye) signals early and drives all pressure. The storm and fragment create one major tightening that narrows options: the protagonist must permit "a final distance" to follow those who left. Agency is clear in the decision to redraw boundaries, and the cost—untying from immortality—is legible on the page. No forced reversals; escalation coheres under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake is signaled immediately: calculate the equation or forfeit asylum. One meaningful tightening when the narrator finds the cylinder and realizes the choice is hers to complete. The final decision—split the data—is protagonist-driven with visible cost (complicity, breach of full disclosure). Pressure coheres under the causal lens. Does not enter 8.5+ because the turn hinges partly on the magical ink's effect rather than purely earned internal struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: to collect textures of different times so the town might remember how to speak (signaled early). One meaningful tightening occurs when the lamp flickers out, forcing Aurelio to stop mid-line and shift from charting to waiting—a renunciation with visible cost (unfinished ripple, no sound from below). The hum's constancy as "incandescent restraint" shapes his tactics (respecting it, copying the line again without story). Agency is endurance and offering; coincidence does not resolve. The trade-off is legible but the pressure could escalate more sharply before the lamp dies.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—how to exist as an officially erased person—is signaled early and sustained through accumulative pressure: collecting fragments, layering memories, timing walks to tides. The piece operates under an Accumulative lens, so escalation reads as density increase and pattern break. The voice calling his "paper name" from a swinging container is the clearest tightening, a moment when external reality intrudes on his self-constructed archive. The final act of writing a new certificate is an endurance choice with felt cost (he leaves the name blank, accepts incompleteness), though the escalation could drive harder agency; much of the arc is observational accretion rather than narrowing options under direct opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake: decode the universal riddle / understand why the universe tells stories. Under the Accumulative lens, escalation reads as density increase and pattern break—each hum deepens the pressure (child on cliff, first lover, shame blooming) until the negative-space insight crystallizes. One meaningful tightening: the realization that myths are "pencil tracings of that absence" narrows her from seeking answers to accepting perpetual inquiry. Agency is renunciation with felt cost (she leaves the instruments humming, follows "her unanswered compass"). The final gesture forecloses the search for closure and reconfigures her relationship to the question. No explicit antagonist or multiple reversals, which is appropriate for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—navigate gentrification without the raft cracking apart—is signaled early and coherent. Jae's decision to collaborate with Lilo constitutes agency, and the data-to-mural pipeline tightens pressure by enabling Carnie counter-moves. However, escalation occurs largely in summary: "those months," "slowly," "the Council noticed the drift." The key reversal (leak of privatization documents) arrives late and is told rather than dramatized, reducing its felt cost. The final choice posed by Lilo's serpent is Charged Poise with felt stakes, but the path to that moment lacks on-page turns that force Jae to trade off options or suffer visible losses in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake signaled early: photograph the footprint/grain before obliteration. One meaningful tightening via the T-minus-twenty ping and the explicit choice: declare instability (lie, defer) or certify (truth, irreversible). The vial system externalizes the stakes—amber chosen, red refused—so the cost is legible. Agency is renunciation with visible price: he could buy time but sends workers into different risks, so he accepts the loss and signals beauty instead of extinction. Minor dock: the grain itself remains abstract; we never see it or its coordinates tested, so the "nightwatch's hourglass sand grain" reads more as thematic token than object under direct pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: restore the hummingbird's guidance and purpose. One tightening occurs when Elias opens the back, maps damage, patches filaments, and tests sensors above the basin—narrowing from diagnostic to corrective action. The drone's uncertain hover before orientation supplies a micro turn, but the final release lacks an on-page trade-off or visible price; the ship bell functions as thematic signal rather than external pressure that forces a harder choice. Under the Accumulative lens, the cadence shift to release is sufficient for this length, but the cost remains implied rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—finding the true headwaters versus accepting official maps—is signaled early and coheres throughout. The tightening occurs when the condensation pattern and the sketch converge at the seam, narrowing options to acknowledge the truth or retreat. The protagonist's decision to sketch the revision is genuine agency with felt cost: it invites "quiet trouble" and abandons years of compliance. The falcon's tracking presence and the tranquility that "pressed around me" build situational pressure. One brief micro turn (the cylinder's second object) deepens without fragmenting.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: restore the town's sense of time so people will return. Escalation reads as accumulative deepening: solo footsteps → fork storing pattern → one bell answering → multiple bells humming → woman arriving in time. Agency is endurance and precision; Ansel's patient craft forecloses a quick fix, visible in "night after night" and altered pace "by heartbeats." The woman's choice to stay adds weight at closure. Cost is felt—two lives bound to a ruin, no guarantee of full revival—and the bells' "recognition" (not triumph) signals modest, hard-won progress.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—preserve the ephemeral—signals early ("harness the ephemeral fluctuations") and tightens when the vial drinks memory. The protagonist's agency drives escalation: overriding protocol, launching the drone, forcing the hatch, then choosing to become the archive. The final choice forecloses survival with visible cost (shutting circuits, locking hatches) and transforms isolation into purpose. The tightening is causal: the distress signal that "did not sound mechanical" compels action, and the vial's geometry and scent pull the protagonist into its preservation logic. One reversal (signal cuts off when touched) deepens stakes without requiring multiple turns.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (clear father's name or "muddy mine into something of my own making") is signaled early and coheres under the Accumulative lens. Pressure tightens through nightly listening, sound-mapping, and the discovery of the story-library, narrowing the path from passive imprisonment to active story-weaving. The protagonist's agency (listening, kneeling, peering) drives each beat. The phrase "before they find the bodies" introduces a live time constraint and raises external cost, though the mechanics of how bodies connect to the library remain unexplained, limiting full escalation legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: honoring the broken vow and freeing the ghost bride. The bead-triggered vision is the story's central tightening, narrowing the protagonist's options from passive tending to active covenant renewal. The ghost's offer ("stay until dawn that will never come, and listen when the bead sings") imposes a visible cost—eternal work in endless night—and the protagonist's acceptance forecloses the path of departure. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency (pressing the bead to lips, swearing the vow) under the Accumulative lens, and the cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—"to carve a path from ruin to reverence"—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through overlapping sleepwalking paths, the town's forgetting, and Orren's solitary labor, but escalation is gradual rather than a sharp tightening. The final engraving ("harbor both ruined and renewed, its entryway widened") reweights the premise with conceptual cost (years of unseen work, town indifference, the ache of his hand), yet no live option is foreclosed on the page; the act is continuation rather than a decision that narrows stakes. Agency is present but operates via endurance and accretion rather than a pivotal choice.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—restoring lost faith—is signaled early and tightened through purposeful wandering, listening to villagers, and tracing travelers' names. The trench collapse delivers a meaningful reversal that narrows options (halt excavation, reveal calendar pattern), and Leila's proposal to rebuild the arrangement forecloses pure observation with visible cost (priest's resistance, Rafi's muttered reluctance). The sundial alignment at closure reweights the stake from intellectual restoration to embodied fragile continuity. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through density increase and cadence shift rather than causal turns, and the cost is legible in the final image of faith "creeping…uncertain but unstoppable."

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: assign a name that juxtaposes regret and forgiveness, signaled in the sender's note. Pressure coheres through trial attempts (Alia Vent, Jun North) and tightens when Neve adds the chalk code "Are you still there," collapsing professional task and personal haunting into one gesture. The final choice—Marin Verge plus the marginal phrase "You are allowed to arrive slowly"—is driven by Neve's agency and forecloses casual detachment with visible cost (the apology-care in folding, the hesitation at the slot). One meaningful deepening/tightening is present; the cost is felt but not paid on the page (Charged Poise). No explicit antagonist; coincidence does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—chart the prince's path through the coup without leaving traceable ink—is signaled when he enters and deepens when Liora stitches the emptiness at the palace's location. The tightening is conceptual: she warns that placelessness erases both route and traveler. Yet the prince's agency collapses into passive receipt of wisdom; he neither chooses nor renounces on the page, only half-scoffs and listens. Escalation is present but resolution is told rather than dramatized, and cost remains conceptual rather than visceral, preventing entry into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: find the drowned brother's pre-decision moment to help the client "know where to begin." Pressure tightens when the spirits' song sharpens "from lullaby to inquiry," then escalates in the vision where Lysa inhabits the brother's body and feels the choice between shore and water. The turn—"I was afraid" replacing the unfinished sentence—narrows options for the client with visible cost: he must still "speak or burn his unsent letters." Agency is enacted through Lysa's choice to evoke the moment rather than demand absolution, a renunciation that forecloses simpler closure.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will translate consent or shared anxiety—is signaled early and tightens when the boy asks her to read the cast instead of the form. Escalation is driven by Mara's agency: her lie about the sea remembering him forecloses neutrality with visible cost (the mother's choked sound, Mara's pocket-burden of the coral). The anesthesiologist's time pressure and the boy's shrewdly innocent question create a moral calculus between competing goods, and the final image—Mara's afraid reflection—makes the price unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake signaled early: Lio seeks "a wall that asked nothing except to be answered" after city murals were banned. The projectors introduce a tactical tightening (light vs. permanent paint), and the realization that the knowledge network channels communal memory rather than personal work deepens the pressure. However, the escalation is conceptual rather than decisional—no live choice forecloses a path with visible cost on the page—so the score remains below 8.0 under Accumulative lens standards.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—exchanging certainty for curiosity—is signaled early and coheres under the Accumulative lens. One meaningful tightening occurs when the mural speaks and the narrator abandons the restoration plan, narrowing professional options. However, the escalation remains abstract: no patron pressure, no professional consequence, no visible price paid for the deviation. The narrator's reply and the coin-holding gesture advance the stance shift, but the turn feels thematic rather than materially costly. Coincidence does not resolve, and the garden's mechanics complicate appropriately, yet the lack of on-page friction or trade-off caps the score.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—evading Ministry audits to plant a subversive grammar—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates (seed purchases trigger recalculations, the entomologist steps from shadows) but no on-page reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off with visible cost. The entomologist's accession is offered, not won; her request to "save her a seat" lands as affirmation rather than escalation. The piece deepens texture without a tightening choice, fitting the accumulative lens but lacking the felt cost required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—restoring the moon to ease insomnia and the city's tides—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure tightens when the poet moves from observation to song, then when the coral responds and the moon's hiding is revealed as sulking clouds. However, the resolution arrives through the sea's cooperation rather than the poet's sacrifice or trade-off; the treaty is proposed and granted without testing what he must give up. One meaningful deepening (song → coral → moon) is present, but agency at closure leans passive.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: preserve the sound of the wandering melody before it erodes the catalogued silence. The caretaker's agency drives escalation: he repairs the chime (narrowing the immediate problem), then hears the melody persist, realizes it's searching, and chooses to archive it. One meaningful tightening occurs when the song rubs "its absence raw against the stored sorrows," raising the cost of ignoring it. The resolution is earned by his decision to hum and breathe the new name into an orchid, with visible cost (the glow fades, leaving partial success). Under the Accumulative lens, the deepening from repair to preservation reweights the stake. No antagonist is present, but situational pressure (the wandering melody threatening the archive's integrity) coheres throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—restore trust with Liora before the final meeting—is signaled early and tightens when the protagonist realizes "no second chance to speak." The Arithene vow construction is a meaningful escalation under the causal lens: copying the script binds the protagonist to honesty, foreclosing evasion as a tactic ("the only safe way forward was honesty"). The meeting departure carries visible cost (fear, "frantic rhythm"), though the confrontation itself is off-page. One clean tightening with felt price is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—harmonizing the city's conflicting floodgate priorities to prevent collective ruin—is signaled early and maintained throughout. Pressure accumulates as the council enters with "rolled diagrams like half-drawn swords" and their voices collide immediately, each advocating mutually exclusive priorities. Arlen's proposal (rotating mercy, no permanent supremacy) narrows options by forcing the council to "choose how its links touch one another" rather than selecting a single winner. The escalation reads under the Situational-Accumulative lens: Arlen's agency lies in reframing the problem and allowing his vulnerability (voice shaking, visible tremor) to model collective risk. Cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt—"everyone would sometimes stand on higher, drier ground" implies rotating vulnerability but the immediate price (who floods first, what is lost in the rotation) remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—preserving lost songs while avoiding past guilt—is signaled early and tightens when the woman refuses to leave, forcing Noel to confront the Rialto fire and his role. The tightening is earned: her repeated visits narrow his avoidance tactics until writing the song becomes the only honest act. Cost is visible: he releases the melody he's hoarded, ending his hermetic reinvention. One micro-turn (her recognizing the meteorite) sets up the final choice without diluting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake signaled early: finding the father and decoding his vanishing. Escalation proceeds through intuition → furniture analysis → code decoding → experimental chair repositioning → maze transit, each narrowing options. The reversal at closure—realizing the father must remain to hold the terrace aloft—forces a renunciation with visible relational cost. The one-step distance becomes the trade-off: crossing collapses the world's calibration. Agency is constrained endurance, fitting the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—learning the rhythm of belonging—is signaled early and tightens when the protagonist realizes "my charts curled damply in my bag, useless." One meaningful deepening occurs at the observation theater when dimming lights reveals the architecture of attention, narrowing options from diagnosis to co-creation. Agency is renunciation with visible cost: the feather becomes pointer instead of relic, surface identity yields to underwater collaboration. The price (foreclosing sky-reader certainty) is legible in "a knot of smoke that had lived there" loosening, though the escalation is gentle rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: discover why paths vanish. The story presents one meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens—conjecture leads to tunnel, tunnel reveals unfinished crystal, reframing erasure as postponement—and Lio's final micro-choice (whispering findings to the sea, resuming work) forecloses the path of definitive answers with visible cost. Agency reads as patient endurance rather than decisive action, fitting the tone. Entering the high 8s would require a sharper trade-off or a second pressure point that narrows options more visibly.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Marcus wanting to "serenade monotony with creativity until even the tide changed rhythm"—is signaled early and remains coherent, but escalation under the accumulative lens is minimal. The coin trick and pebble drops build pattern, yet no on-page reversal tightens options or raises cost; the bishop's placement and reveal proceed as planned without friction. The woman's moment of consideration offers potential deepening, but it is told ("she had not yet admitted was trapping her") rather than dramatized through a choice that narrows her path. Agency is present in Marcus's orchestration, but the closure does not foreclose a live option or trade off competing goods with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—inscribing forbidden memory without detection—is signaled early and tightens when Mareh notes "their skin becomes a lighthouse" and authorities "have grown adept at reading new lights." The decision to proceed despite risk is agency under pressure, and the cost (loss of brother's memory) narrows future capacity. One meaningful escalation (gaps align, stranger arrives, Mareh acts) is sufficient. The price is unmistakable on the page and forecloses a path, meeting the high-band standard.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—preserve the atrium's unmeasured value before the council decides—is signaled early and held. Pressure is situational: the three-day deadline and the threat of demolition frame the dilemma. Yet escalation is thin: the harbormaster's "practical laugh" and permission for "one more day" deflate rather than tighten the choice. The protagonist's estimate plan is announced but not enacted on the page, so the cost of defiance or the consequence of delay never materializes, leaving the closure in Charged Poise territory without the undeniable pressure required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: Rafe's decision to break silence and speak his guarded truth. The story tightens through Maya's visible distress, which triggers Rafe's choice to pull out the box and confess—a meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. The cost is visible in the "scraping" metaphor and twenty years of carrying the secret. Agency is clear: Rafe chooses to speak "before I could talk myself out of it," foreclosing the path of silence with on-page consequence in Maya's shifted attention.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—puzzling out new equations for hope—is signaled in paragraph 5 and tested repeatedly: orb arrangement raises the needle, mirror clustering sinks it, bleak clippings drive it to "Unlifted." One meaningful tightening occurs when the narrator tests apathy and the needle sags, forcing confrontation with stagnation's cost. The final act (removing clippings, rehanging orbs) is protagonist-driven and narrows options with visible cost: grief for lost futures and the acceptance that "this is enough to begin." Escalation under Accumulative lens reads as deepening rather than reversal, meeting the sufficient-tightening standard for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—whether to continue Mara's unfinished listening—is signaled midpoint and tightens when the protagonist realizes "legacy's burden" presses down. One meaningful turn occurs when the protagonist hums Mara's pitch and the building's attention "turn[s] toward me," forcing a choice between walking away or staying. Agency is decision with visible cost: redrawing maps, accepting incompleteness. The escalation is driven by protagonist action (prying the door, reading aloud, humming) under the Accumulative lens. The price—forsaking closure, inheriting questions—is legible on the page in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: "to persuade mirrors to show possibilities" and is pressured by the borrowed heartbeat's eventual cost ("someday the clockmaker would ask for it back"). The girl's arrival tightens the pressure: her request shifts the painter from solitary work to collaborative teaching, and the specificity of her need (brother dreams of drowning) narrows the target. The piece achieves one meaningful deepening—the painter's choice to fold the girl's voice into the lullaby, expanding the gift's reach while accruing more debt to the clockmaker. Minor deduction: the vignettes (fisherman's daughter, baker, boy) provide textural richness but do not escalate the painter's own risk; the girl's brother's unseen transformation is consequence, not a turn that tests the painter's commitment further.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—interrupt killing via flawed compromise—is signaled early and tightens when the envoy asks, "You ask me to embrace the men who burned my village," forcing the negotiator's counter-choice: accept imperfect terms or condemn future villages. Agency is clear: the protagonist's offer of "survivable disappointment" forecloses purity and earns the envoy's signature. The cost is legible in "something brittle grinding, like sand between teeth" and the sky remaining "unimpressed yet slightly less condemned." No false reversals; pressure accumulates through ritual constraint and moral calculus.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake (absolution via preserving the echo) is clear by the third paragraph and escalates through one meaningful tightening: the crack-map discovery narrows options from passive guilt to active ritual. Agency appears in the decision to follow the cracks, the choice to kneel, and the release of the egg—each foreclosing a path (helicopter escape, keeping the relic, remaining purely amoral). The final act is driven by protagonist choice under the Causal-Accumulative lens, with visible cost in physical submission and conceptual cost in the arrogance of the offering. Coincidence does not resolve; the thunder remains non-committal and the outcome uncertain.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Iri summoned to harvest echoes for the king but "wanted the opposite." One meaningful tightening occurs when she weaves the threads into new constellations rather than jarring them, foreclosing compliance and triggering the upward hush. The choice narrows her path (treason) and alters the palace's state with felt cost. Agency is clear in her decision to exhale the hush. However, the escalation is more conceptual than tactically pressured—no on-page antagonist tests her resolve, no complication forces adaptation. The king remains off-page, and the guard's bow is unopposed. The resolution emerges from Iri's internal stance more than from dramatized conflict under rising pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: whether ethical storytelling can lean away from harm or whether silence/detachment is the only clean option. Pressure accumulates through the documentary students' accusation, Lily's challenge about staying "clean up there," and Marcus's question about quitting. The mutual perspective exercise narrows options by forcing vulnerability and testing whether stories can expose their own cruelty. Cost is visible: the narrator's throat ache, the "half-lit epiphanies that now, finally, dared to land," and the shift from protective orbit to vulnerable presence. One meaningful tightening when the narrator's hidden failure is revealed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—honoring the last monarch's arrival—is signaled early and tightens through Erin's escalating architectural responses: plucking grass, arranging stone, hanging the moth wing, laying petals. The "interrupted cadence of the wind" creates external pressure that narrows options, forcing micro-adjustments ("she adjusted the structures…answering its doubts in architecture"). Agency is enacted through attention and construction that forecloses helpless grief with on-page cost: the acknowledgment that "it would not live long" but "for this moment, the world had bent." One meaningful deepening occurs when the monarch drinks, reweighting the stakes from survival to witness. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens without requiring multiple reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving forgotten names—is signaled in the first third and tightens when the protagonist touches the rope, triggering a meaningful deepening (the rope "seized that guilt and softened it," allowing names to pour through). The escalation is Accumulative: density increases through layered sound-images (sibilant hiss, brittle laugh, organ-like braids) rather than a causal reversal. Cost is present but oblique: the protagonist stays in the sanctum, foreclosing the prior metal-casting life, yet the felt price (what is lost by abandoning bronze work) remains understated. No antagonist or external obstacle sharpens the peak choice; the protagonist's internal readiness supplies all agency.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: survival through obedience versus self-directed living. The storm's arrival tightens pressure in a single decisive beat, forcing a binary choice with no middle path. The protagonist's agency (holding the seal, choosing to climb) forecloses the assigned death with visible cost: abandoning the directive and bunker safety. The dream-bridge scene deepens the stake by articulating the road's desire and reframing obedience as "dying correctly." No coincidence resolves the conflict; the storm complicates, and the protagonist's choice determines outcome. Escalation is coherent under the Situational lens: external pressure crystallizes the internal split.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—sealing a covenant with the unknown via empirical test—is signaled in paragraph four and sustained throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when the planet aligns exactly, forcing Tammuz to confront his longing versus his skepticism. The resolution is earned by his agency (rigging lights, recording offsets, interpreting the new stars) and forecloses certainty with felt cost: he gains "a question he could never exhaust" instead of proof. The escalation reads Causal with visible escalation (indifferent stars → near alignments → one exact hit → new stars matching old notes). No antagonist is required; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—stopping hatred of her brother—is signaled in paragraph 7 and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when the sanctuary's reality-shift forces the protagonist into the car memory and her body reveals the true sequence ("I felt my hand reaching for my brother's... felt him squeeze back before opening the door"), narrowing options from sustained blame to acknowledgment. Agency operates through attention and renunciation: she chooses to turn the key again at the end, knowing it's broken, and allows the internal note to emerge—endurance that forecloses the old narrative with felt cost ("the realization hurt"). Ilen's method (cellular memory accessed through the shifting room) applies pressure without solving via coincidence. The cost is legible on the page: her fury's foundation collapses, and she must live without the defensive story.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—capture the runaway dream—is signaled early and tightens when Elias realizes he's losing himself, then grounds to proceed. The synchronized breathing is a meaningful tactical choice that narrows his approach. Closure cost is visible: his face becomes translucent, the figure steps into him, erasing boundaries. One deepening under Accumulative lens is sufficient; the piece forgoes multiple reversals in favor of steady intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—bridging generational wisdom and undoing the contract's harm—is signaled early and tightens when the mender refuses the bankers, tearing the contract and making the orchard feral. His shift from passive regret to active caretaking (pruning, apologizing, tying the ribbon, offering a new bargain) constitutes meaningful escalation under the Accumulative lens. The cost is legible: he cannot retrieve his daughter, only steward a space she may never return to, and the petal-rain acceptance reweights prior failure. The breach of contract and its consequences drive all subsequent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to pursue forbidden knowledge—is signaled early and tightens when annotations cluster and the cameo blank glows. The bathroom scene escalates pressure through the mirror's permeability and the fruit bearing Elias's signature, narrowing his option to retreat. However, escalation is more atmospheric than driven by protagonist choice under duress; Elias observes phenomena rather than making a contested decision with live tradeoffs. The cost (regulatory defiance, future bargain reshaping) is conceptual and oblique, meeting threshold but not high-band intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake signaled early: find the hidden library to understand her mistake and reach her brother. One meaningful tightening: the clerk's conditional exit ("bring back at least one lesson") narrows options before descent. The circular chamber confrontation offers a micro turn (speak across timelines vs. close the book) that Lysa resolves by writing in the margin—a third option with visible cost (she commits to join, not rewrite). Pressure accumulates under the Accumulative lens via the pattern of gaps and the final book's page. The cost is conceptual and relational: she foregrounds accompaniment over erasure, adding a new mission to the archive.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—find the twin and through them the garden of forgotten names—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure tightens when the protagonist confronts the twin and learns the garden is internal rather than external, a meaningful reweighting that narrows the protagonist's options (recapture vs. stay). The urge to recapture "loosened in my chest" marks a stance shift, and the choice to stay forecloses the professional path with visible conceptual cost ("the world that paid me to name them"). However, the escalation is largely accomplished through revelation and conversation rather than a series of on-page reversals that test commitment under rising resistance. The accumulative design supports one deepening turn; cost is legible but primarily conceptual/emotional rather than a physical forfeiture that alters later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: the treaty's absence exerts force, and Lysa's task is to restore or release it. Pressure accumulates through the seal warming and the thirteen chimes, forcing her to act. The rope-braiding is protagonist-driven agency under Accumulative pressure, and the cost is legible: "every absence be named, every missing body and burned village recorded in a ledger that could never be sealed"—an unerasable burden. One meaningful tightening (seal's question, clock's correction) suffices. The escalation is quiet but unmistakable, fitting the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—finding quiet in a storm wired with intention—is signaled early and remains coherent under the Accumulative lens. One meaningful tightening occurs when the energy beings' voices pour inward and ricochet, forcing the mapkeeper to forge stillness with greater urgency ("breathing in time with the dimming and brightening of the stone"). The bloom of hush is a renunciation of volume and a stance crystallization with visible cost: the protagonist must hold stillness against chaos, a price legible in the final image. Agency is enacted through attention, craft, and endurance rather than decisive confrontation, fitting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is signaled early and sustained: prove coincidence has meaning by rekindling the beacon through star-path alignment to release the trapped plea. Pressure coheres under the Situational lens: eleven years of charting, dwindling oil, mutinying knees, then the uncharted comet strikes "like a bell" and Keeper makes the peak choice—haul the prism to the highest deck, redraw charts mentally, latch retrocognition onto the comet's ellipse until points snap together. The prism catches light, the hush cracks, the plea emerges—cost is visible (decades of exhausted effort, childhood plea confirmed but unanswered) and the tightening is meaningful. Agency is clear: Keeper's decision to fit the comet into old destinies drives the turn. No antagonist required; coincidence complicates (comet appears) but does not resolve—Keeper's choice and retrocognitive work do.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—preserving collective memory before it dissolves—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when storm-shadow shifts reveal a market memory "thinning," prompting the archivist to work faster with visible urgency ("chest tightened," "worked faster"). The cost is legible: neighborhoods lose their reasons for rituals if he fails. However, the archivist's agency never faces a hard trade-off or renunciation; he simply succeeds at his appointed task, so escalation reads as intensification rather than a narrowing of live options under competing pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear early: counter despair before the invading army arrives at dawn. Pressure coheres through the designer's preparation and the garrison's brittle jokes spring-loading fear. One meaningful tightening occurs when he lights the first fuse after waiting "until the night feels thick enough to touch." Agency is present (he chooses timing, ties the knot to fuse, aligns shells), but the escalation reads as execution of a plan rather than a choice that narrows options or imposes visible cost. No reversal forces a trade-off; the design succeeds as intended without dramatized friction or price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (whether to leave the coast) is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator realizes pauses are tides themselves, shifting from waiting for answers to recognizing overlapping possibilities. Agency manifests as endurance that transforms into decision; the narrator's touching the pool and seeing multiple futures forecloses the option of waiting indefinitely. Cost is felt in the renunciation of certainty and the compromise of seasonal return. No explicit antagonist, but Lysa's presence and the cicada apply steady pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—learning to metabolize silence without numbing—is signaled early and tightens when the father joins the second inversion. The protagonist's agency is renunciation/endurance (staying on the trellis despite initial fear) that forecloses the bunker-builder path. The father's participation creates a credible reversal: his helmet-strapped arrival, breath hitch, and admission ("we were building bunkers to keep that kind of silence out") narrow options for their future relationship. Cost is visible in the final line's "new weight" and the shared vocabulary that replaces prior isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clearly signaled: Rian wants to see if quiet can be directed and comforting rather than feared. The gondola ride tightens pressure via the visible blue line, which forces passengers into stillness through feedback rather than command. The experiment succeeds on the page with visible cost: passengers relinquish habitual noise, Rian risks his job by killing the speakers, and the final image reweights the premise. One meaningful deepening under the accumulative lens; no reversals required. Agency is primarily observational at closure, which slightly weakens protagonist-driven escalation, but the passengers' micro-choices (child winding down the bird, courier stilling his tapping) trace to Rian's setup.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—reach the unclaimed throne and decide memory's future—is signaled early and tightens once through the stairway visions and countdown. The escalation under the Accumulative lens is a meaningful deepening: Ilya sees the cost of editing memory and realizes prior claimants refused. However, the final choice lacks on-page reversal or visible tradeoff; he acts without hesitation, and the cost (forgoing governance, possibly erasing himself) is implied rather than dramatized in tactical friction or embodied consequence. One tightening is sufficient for this length, but the lack of a live decision beat caps the score.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: can Mara learn to breathe where suffocation has pooled? One meaningful tightening occurs when their scars align and memories unfurl, narrowing her option from passive drowning to active breath. The shadow keeper's line "you arrived here every time you walked away" deepens understanding and reweights her habit. Agency is present—she chooses to inhale—but the cost is atmospheric (what specific bridge or person she might approach differently) rather than a visible tradeoff, preventing a higher band under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—preventing promises from "eating everyone"—is signaled early and tightens when the pumps fail and the other Mara's messages arrive. One meaningful escalation: the hatch revelation forces Mara to choose between her distrust of shortcuts (a trap set by remaining faith) and her trust in novelty, narrowing options with visible agency. The final act (grasping the wheel) is protagonist-driven and forecloses retreat. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: density builds from irrigation failure → dimensional messages → hatch sigh, though the cost of opening the hatch remains prospective rather than paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—uncovering why the dynasty collapsed without violence—is signaled early and drives Aurel's escalating actions: locating the crank, assembling the amplifier, adjusting the needle, letting his body become an antenna. The tightening comes when the queen's voice falls through the noise and reframes the abdication as surrender to "the silence already in their hearts," narrowing Aurel's understanding and foreclosing the myth of external betrayal. The cost is conceptual (his role as executor was symptom, not cause) but the felt price—his custodianship of ghosts now burdened with this knowledge—could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—Calder's allegiance and identity—is signaled early and tightens through the mask-reveal and orchard pressure. One meaningful deepening occurs: Mira's challenge shifts his understanding from duty-as-virtue to duty-as-choreography, narrowing his options to serve or step aside. The cost is felt: choosing unpredictability means forsaking the identity and role that gave him purpose ("I will not serve" forecloses his knightly function). Under the Accumulative lens, the pressure coheres and the final stance is earned. No explicit antagonist is required; the kingdom's invisible demand and Calder's internalized vows supply sufficient friction.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (linking orphaned files to living persons, magnifying kindnesses) is signaled early and sustained. Accumulative pressure builds through the parade of visitors and tightens decisively when the man recognizes the button, proving the mission's stakes are real and recoverable. Mara's agency is renunciation and endurance: she chooses to stay in the work despite her own loss, foreclosing easier paths. Cost is visible in her solitude and the phrase "broken-hearted still, but tactfully hopeful."

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—preserving erased memories—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure accumulates through the puddle-map discovery, the gate passage, and the archive deposit, consistent with the Accumulative lens. However, escalation is primarily situational: Lio finds the booth rather than forcing a trade-off or overcoming active resistance. The console interaction lacks on-page cost during the deposit; the strip arrives as instruction rather than as a price paid. One meaningful deepening occurs (the realization that the booth survived), but agency at closure reads passive—Lio receives rather than decides.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—undoing the prophecy's harm—is signaled early and drives every grotto visit. The climactic beat (refusal to complete fatal notes, letting lake breathe through gaps) narrows options and forecloses the original curse with visible cost: he senses the future loosening but gains only "eerie nostalgia," not triumph. Escalation under the Accumulative lens is a single meaningful deepening rather than multiple reversals, which suffices at this length. The backstory block (club night, three deaths) supplies motive but the middle section recounts experiments without on-page friction or failed attempt detail, flattening momentum slightly before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—decode the message in falling leaves—is signaled early and tightens when the moonstone leaf offers a map. Lio's final choice (planting the questions) is protagonist-driven and forecloses the prior stance with on-page cost (opening the floor, pressing seeds into roots). Weakness: escalation reads as one meaningful deepening rather than sustained pressure; the voice's invitation arrives without prior resistance or trade-off, so the turn feels more gift than earned reversal. Under the Accumulative lens, the pattern-break is sufficient but not maximally charged.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (Eli's relationship to certainty/time) is signaled early and tightens once: the compass shifts "Perhaps" from threat to viable direction, narrowing his posture from avoidance to acceptance. The final act—attaching hands that hesitate—arises from his agency and forecloses the old habit with visible cost (abandoning precision). Escalation under Accumulative lens reads as a single decisive intensification rather than multiple reversals, which suffices here. The cost is conceptual but legible: he opts for wandering minutes over trapped time.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—redemption of Arlen's name and story—is signaled early and tightens through Eira's ritual: placing the coin, whispering the amendment, witnessing the crack and new sign. The deepening is accumulative rather than a sharp reversal; pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens as each step reweights meaning. Agency manifests in her choice to "offer her own name as solder," and the cost is conceptual (dual identity, "unclosed" name), though a more immediate forfeiture—something she loses in the room or must leave behind—would raise the score.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear: restore the village children's stolen joy by rebalancing the gorge's music. One meaningful tightening occurs when the wind falters and the first confession breaks free, narrowing Mara's tactic from general coaxing to specific nudging toward absurdity. Each spectral confession she reframes is a micro-escalation under the Accumulative lens. Agency is her decision to teach laughter rather than ferry souls, and the visible cost is her solo ritual exposure. The coincidental timing (children's laughter stopped recently) complicates but does not resolve; Mara's method resolves it.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—whether to become "the dataset of compassion"—is signaled early ("discover the mathematics of mercy") and tightens through the walk to the clearing. The protagonist's agency drives escalation: each step is a micro-choice (pushing upright despite nausea, continuing toward the frame), and the final decision to enter the frame forecloses the path of refusal with visible cost ("surrendered the last unquantified parts"). The tension between yielding to a system that "spoke in the register of my abusers" and closing "an equation the world kept miswriting" is earned by prior embodied memories. The brace shifting from defensive to preparatory marks protagonist-driven transformation. Cost is unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—finding "anchors of intuition" to let overlooked histories speak—is signaled early but remains abstract. The tightening occurs when the narrator unfastens the hook and receives the lens fragment, which shifts knowledge, yet no live option is foreclosed on the page. The alchemist's guidance and the fragment's arrival feel handed rather than earned through protagonist agency or a difficult choice. Shame in the final lines names past failures but does not force a present trade-off or alter tactics within this scene.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—"to discover what ceilings hide"—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure tightens when the boy's ghost directs attention upward and the ceiling bulges, forcing a choice. The protagonist's agency (touching the barrel) is clear, but the cost is oblique: we see the breach open but not what the protagonist forfeits or risks by causing it. One meaningful deepening occurs; the escalation is driven by protagonist curiosity under the Accumulative lens, but the trade-off lacks visceral price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—compressing eternity into a moment—is signaled early but never faces a concrete on-page test with competing options. Ilen's decision to pull the lever unfolds without visible hesitation, trade-off, or narrowing of tactics. The librarians' alarm is told rather than shown as a credible threat, and the resolution bypasses cost: the treaties "rewrote themselves" and "nothing ruptured," leaving the stakes asserted but not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: whether the asteroid's purpose (and by extension the revolution's failure) can be reimagined. Signaled early through Mara's rituals and the defunct-revolutionary label. Pressure escalates via discovery sequence: shard → chambers → vase shards → Council's funerary interpretation → devising poems as counter-narrative. Agency is clear: Mara agrees to join the excavation, veils mirrors, and records time-coil movements. The final renunciation—covering mirrors to preserve rather than exclude—forecloses the path of official acceptance with visible cost ("never replace the official histories").

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (restore light/time), and pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens through image density. However, escalation is thin: Elias identifies the problem, descends, places the box, hums, and the rust complies without resistance or complication. The "tightening" is atmospheric rather than tactical—no live option is foreclosed, no trade-off forced. Agency exists (Elias chooses to "adjust the wording" rather than break the bargain), but the cost is conceptual and off-page; the rust's capitulation feels granted rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (finding "where explanations fail") is signaled early and tightens through the compass discovery, psychometry vision, and lagoon arrival. The vision provides one strong reversal: the factory wasn't industrial but custodial, reframing Elias's quest from abstract to concrete. His agency is tested in micro-choices—capturing the cave-mouth scent, touching the skiff despite knowing visions will erupt—and culminates in the boat, where sitting becomes acceptance with visible cost (no promise of kindness or comprehension). Pressure accumulates cleanly under the Accumulative lens; one small gap is that the middle delve through the tunnel feels more transit than escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—Mara's search for driftwood and meaning—is signaled early. The slide discovery tightens pressure by offering "a different navigation, one that ran sideways," and her reimagining of the archway as map-center deepens the question. However, escalation is largely conceptual: no live tactical choice is tested on the page, and the final act (pocketing the slide, turning the van) reads as acceptance rather than a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. The phrase "timewoven alliances" arrives as a named realization without prior dramatic build.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding why flowers bloom at night—is signaled early and pursued consistently. Pressure tightens once: Liora's invitation and the climb raise the question's urgency, and the window's revelation narrows Ira's options to a single insight. However, the escalation is primarily cognitive (realization) rather than a choice under competing pressures, and no visible tradeoff occurs. The protagonist's agency at closure is reception and intention ("paint could carry the pattern back") without an on-page cost that forecloses a path. The piece satisfies the one meaningful tightening required at this length under an Accumulative lens, but the lack of a dramatized price or renunciation caps the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—cataloging silenced protest—is clear early. The diary's encryption and shore semaphore provide one meaningful pressure point that narrows Maris's archival method. However, the lagoon encounter lacks a competing cost or forced tradeoff; Maris's kneel and whispered terms feel more invitational than a choice under duress. The final image reconfigures scope (record wounds and contradictions) with felt weight, but the escalation curve is modest for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake signaled early: what purpose does an alchemist serve in a ghost town, and can the town return without repeating its ruin? One meaningful deepening: from "how to open the bottle" to "how to let the town enter without dragging old habits." Agency is renunciation and design—he rejects simple restoration and charts new patterns with visible cost (accepting fallibility, no guarantees). The bottle's warming and returning footsteps provide consequence. Under Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through escalating reflective density. Penalty: much escalation occurs in thought rather than confrontation with a material obstacle, so the tightening feels more cerebral than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: archiving the wax recording and understanding its content. Pressure tightens when Lan realizes the voice speaks "institutional promises, vast and cold" rather than personal threads, then deepens with the recognition of accidental prophecy. The escalation is driven by attention and interpretive discovery under the Accumulative lens; no antagonist or reversal is required. Cost is conceptual (the archive now holds a prophecy, not just memory) but legible. Agency is interpretive endurance rather than overt decision, fitting the ritual frame.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake (whether to accept the vortex and reopen the atrium) is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful reversal: the protagonist's initial refusal ("I came here to catalog and carry, not to meddle") gives way when touching the glass forces confrontation with borrowed memories and the cost becomes undeniable. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency—pressing palms to the cradle, matching breath to the egg—and the price (years of life) is legible on the page. A secondary stake (discovering the texture of borrowed time) braids neatly into the primary without dilution.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—whether to sound the siren and break sacred silence—is signaled early and tightens through escalating readings (temperature, pressure, wind veering) that converge at the red threshold. Elias's agency drives the turn: his active choice to step away from the switch and listen instead forecloses the siren path with legible cost (the valley remains unwarned). The piece enters high-band territory because the tightening narrows options through protagonist decision and the cost is unmistakable on the page: "some might die, unseen in sudden water or falling stone."

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—whether the janitor remains invisible or allows himself to witness and be seen—is signaled early and tightens when the projections shift to human moments, forcing his choice between habitual shadow-work and vulnerable presence. Agency manifests in his decision to step closer, listen, and whisper a promise, foreclosing the path of efficient invisibility with the visible cost of chest pain and exposure. The escalation under the Accumulative lens deepens when stillness itself becomes vulnerable, mirroring his hidden tenderness and compelling his stance shift.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake is preservation of the covenant/unspoken words; secondary is the protagonist's isolation. One tightening occurs when Mara manifests and speaks, crystallizing the protagonist's witness role and Mara's acceptance ("Keep it… not as prison, but as witness"). Cost is conceptual—continued solitude and burden—rather than a forfeited live option or decisive reversal. Escalation reads as deepening under the Accumulative lens but lacks a second reversal or agency-driven turn that narrows options before the ending; most pressure is accumulated exposition rather than tactical friction. The resolution is Earned Stasis with felt conceptual cost but no causal link to an on-page sacrifice or choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—understanding time's texture, preventing the leak's worsening—is signaled early and tightens when the narrator realizes the silo leaks stray moments. One meaningful deepening: the shift from guarding to teaching the town to float narrows options and reconfigures the job's meaning. Agency is present in the garage-sale message method and the final palm-press that reveals the braided current. The cost is conceptual (the town may not know which way to swim) but legible and undeniable in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: discovering beauty in the incomplete, tested when Elian encounters the wounded feather. Pressure tightens when he hears "restless patterns that made his teeth ache" and must choose whether to force harmony or "let each roughened note lean against another." The kite-string snap and child's raised empty hand serve as thematic prelude, not reversal, so the single meaningful turn is Elian's humming response, which narrows his options (he cannot mute discord; he must meet it). Cost is legible: he trades certainty for "companionship" with discord. Agency is clear. No antagonist required under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake signaled early: remodel orchard into "a message that could not be ignored" to foster interspecies respect before death. One meaningful tightening under Accumulative lens: storm catalyzes discovery of hidden chambers, shifting his role from engineer to translator and narrowing options (he adjusts plan, "less engineer than translator"). Agency clear in wire experiments, diary annotations, guiding monks along tree-chosen paths. Cost legible: "died between them, listening" forecloses the architect's control, accepting the mountain's voice. No antagonist required; pressure coheres through mortality clock and the orchard's gradual response. Minor gap: the monks' arrival feels coincidental rather than summoned by his work, slightly softening the earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—understand the chemistry of homecoming to tune the species before visitors return—is signaled early and coheres under the Accumulative lens. Pressure tightens once when footprints multiply and equations appear in their edges, deepening the pilgrimage from physical route to conceptual chain reaction. Agency at closure is limited: the narrator stands and waits rather than choosing or renouncing with visible cost. The fly amber's refusal and the spiral clearing reconfigure meaning, but no on-page reversal forecloses a live option or forces a trade-off. The cost is conceptual (the species clinging to "almost") but not dramatized as a price paid by the protagonist in this scene.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake signaled early: fulfill the botanist's instruction to plant where "the reef will be" despite its death. Pressure coheres through Accumulative deepening: general evening work narrows to the specific final pod at the fiercest war site, where he kneels and envisions the garden's rise. Agency is renunciation/endurance—he persists in work whose victory will be "never noticed." The birds' warnings (keening terns, chattering sandpipers) create tactical constraints that the coachman navigates, raising the craft's difficulty. Cost is felt: solitude, the impossibility of confirmation, labor invested in a transformation he'll never witness.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether to preserve or destroy the dangerous history—is signaled early and tightens through the stranger's plea, the cylinder's multi-vocal revelation, and the narrator's awareness of warlord erasures. One meaningful deepening occurs when the riddle "bent toward our private wounds," raising the cost from personal grief to collective consequence. The final choice to let others hear is driven by protagonist agency under the Situational lens and carries visible cost: the risk of repeating old fires and the burden of waiting for judgment ("waited for the first knock"). Barrow's solidarity and the stranger's visible grief add secondary pressure without diffusing focus.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake signaled early: finding orientation ("turn confusion into exploration," "true north"). One meaningful tightening occurs when he steps to the compass edge, lifting his eyes for "a first glimpse"—the act of looking narrows his options to defiance or retreat. Agency appears in his micro-choices: unsealing the deck, refusing to wait for a team, pressing his palm to the viewport in the presence of an intruder. The cost is legible: he becomes "the one they called only when rules blurred," a blessed pariah whose stance forecloses integration. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through density increase (memories of shutdown alarms, parents tracing steady skies, the sketchbook filling) and the final image reweights orientation from fixed truth to directional seeking.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: to embrace wonder without cynicism's shield. One meaningful deepening occurs when the king's secret is revealed and the lid responds, narrowing options to acceptance or retreat. The cost of vulnerability is legible in the final choice to "meet it unarmed." However, the escalation is more textural (accumulation of atmospheric pressure) than a causal tightening of agency; no live antagonist or time-pressure forces the peak choice, relying instead on the protagonist's internal readiness.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: preserving an archive of "small gestures" in a political void where ordinary voices may soon be silenced. The pressure deepens when rumors arrive that the new ruler will close the gallery, forcing the narrator from passive cataloging to active inscription. The boy's recitation of the narrator's own disaster—dismissed by his parents as staged—creates a secondary tightening: the narrator must choose silence, crystallizing the role of "historian" over "witness." The cost of the final decision (walking every story into the floor before eviction) is visible: the archive becomes embodied, ephemeral, and dependent on the narrator's physical endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake signaled early: understanding home's shape through memory recovery. Pressure tightens via the map's warning ("never find the exit that remembers you"), descent into hidden stacks, and the stone's demand to reverse burial. The lock clicking open and voices unfurling are protagonist-driven reversals. The final act—speaking aloud in the abandoned family dialect—forecloses the path of "perfect grammar" and "accentless sentences" with visible cost ("cracking open a sealed room," "awkward music"). One meaningful deepening achieved; the stone's challenge narrows options to speak or remain silent.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (unfreeze the village) is signaled early and tightens as incorrect tugs darken the tapestry and "tiny woven villagers seemed to look away…in accusation." One meaningful deepening: Elior's mid-work realization that solving for applause would repeat the old pattern, forcing him to sift motives and "forgive himself…not erase them." The final crossing drawn clean is protagonist-driven with visible cost (pride discarded, past mistakes carried forward). No coincidental rescue; the labyrinth responds to earned decoding.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: earning forgiveness by carrying complexity rather than a sanitized confession. One meaningful tightening occurs when Zev refracts Maren's rigid account into multiple uncomfortable truths, narrowing her options to either accept layered guilt or face rejection for a single sliver. The poetry-session frame applies concrete pressure (questions about the river's smell, the stone's weight) that forces micro-choices and alters her self-perception. Visible cost: she laughs and cries harder, discovering "undiscovered versions of herself," and must risk being "rejected whole." No second reversal is needed at this length. The escalation is driven by protagonist engagement (she speaks, he refracts, she internalizes) under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—conjure meaning from oblivion—signals early and tightens through the descent gamble: "risk everything… following it down between breaths held underwater." The hairline fracture reversal raises cost and forces the on-page choice to narrate rather than retreat, turning the crack into "a bright seam" with visible consequence (the cylinder rises, Corin collapses). Under the accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening suffices; the cost is legible in the repaired fracture and Corin's exhaustion. Minor: coincidence plays a role when the pockmarks flare, but it complicates rather than resolves, and Corin's narration converts potential disaster into closure.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (paint the place that does not yet exist, keep the hidden promise) and the wrong-turn discovery narrows options spatially, but escalation under the Accumulative lens relies on atmosphere and reflection rather than a live trade-off or reversal that forecloses a path. The painting act itself is a quiet fulfillment without visible on-page cost beyond effort; no tactical sacrifice or competing urgency tests commitment. One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist recognizes the scene, yet the resolution feels given rather than earned by prior friction.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—proving whispers travel farther than shouts—is signaled early and tightens when Mara opens the vial, knowing Jorah will hear or see the result. One meaningful turn: the lens glows before the lamp is lit, forcing Mara to commit fully ("she whispered welcome, apology, and gratitude"). The fishing boats' immediate response and Jorah's climb to confront her raise the relational and professional cost. Agency is clear: Mara's decision to use the Night Garden perfume drives the escalation, and the ending choice ("I stopped shouting") forecloses the path of loud assertion with visible cost—Jorah's pallor and the "careful quiet between them."

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—navigating Mara home through loss—is signaled early and tightens when Rian realizes the chapel is gone yet chooses to lie and provide "raw solace." The escalation is driven by Rian's agency: the decision to draw imaginary roads and offer a false map forecloses honest cartography with visible cost ("sometimes raw solace is all that keeps a person moving"). Under the Accumulative lens, the pressure accumulates through layered memory and reversed migration until the final line reweights options. One meaningful tightening suffices; the cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: map the fungal network to make collective empathy bearable. The work with Risa tightens pressure through shared vulnerability ("clumsy and exposed, a praxis of fractured grace"), and the storm escalates to the clearing of the eye. Agency is present in the collaborative mapping and the choice to "practice seeing one another." The final cost—dispersing the focal point of terror—feels conceptual and real, though the precise tactical price of that dispersal could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (decode the stranger's final gesture) signals in paragraph three and tightens when the keeper reframes investigation as observing gaps. One meaningful deepening: the narrator's realization that "the stranger's final gesture had been a request for witnessed isolation" forecloses the option of filing a report. Cost is legible: the narrator accepts complicity by pinning on the flower and waiting for the next arrival. Agency is endurance/participation rather than decision, fitting the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—find the doorway of decisions—is signaled early and pursued on-page. Escalation tightens through environmental pressure (rising creek) and internal choice (the latticed paths). The final beat narrows options to retreat, tunnel, or blank ascent; Elias chooses the faint path, agency clear. Visible cost: abandoning the shop, risking never finding Mara, accepting uncertainty. One tightening is sufficient at this length and escalation is driven by protagonist choice under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (unravel the dream mystery before the sky bleeds out) is signaled early and tightens once when Isera overrides Ralen's storm warning. Her choice narrows tactical options and demonstrates agency. However, the escalation is modest—one refusal under pressure—and the final beat does not show a trade-off or visible price paid; "Isera remembered" gestures toward resolution but the content and cost remain off-page. The storm complication raises tension but does not force a second reversal or deepening choice.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: stabilizing the pocket suns to "capture the density of presence." Kira and Jash's arrival with the shell and departure plan introduces a meaningful tightening that narrows Lio's options—no longer just perfecting reactors, but imprinting memory to travel with friends. The escalation is driven by protagonist consideration rather than external antagonist, fitting the Accumulative/Conceptual lens. Visible cost is conceptual: Lio must redirect scientific purpose toward intimate preservation, though the tangible price (what is risked or lost) remains slightly implicit.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: distilling chaos into coherent narrative while haunted by multiple death-timelines. One meaningful tightening: the realization that future selves are "stalking my memories" forces the walk into timelines. The soar-above-graves beat narrows options—he cannot avoid the crosses, only hover between them. Cost is legible: accepting "jaded wonder" forecloses belief in "cleaner stories." Minor deduction: the initial grave-ridge encounter ends with a run and concussion; that beat could pressure the choice more directly rather than resetting via infirmary summary. The escalation under Accumulative lens is sufficient but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (humanizing grief through ritual) signals early and tightens in one decisive act: placing the screw. The client's agency is soft (he protests "not how physics works" but assents), so the turn hinges more on Mara's decision. Cost is felt ("does not fix her absence") but not viscerally dramatized—no live forfeiture on the page. Under the Accumulative lens, the deepening is sufficient, but protagonist-driven escalation is muted, capping the score below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: transform scars into stories by writing living runes, signaled early. Two memory-shard beats (demon's thumbprint, granary questions) deepen the ceremony and narrow Lan's emotional options from shame-driven hiding to scribe-bearing luminous scars. Agency is clear: Lan chooses which memories to revisit and shapes the runes, exhaling old superstitions. The gusts and circling storm below apply external pressure without resolving; Lan's final readiness forecloses the path of hiding. Cost is visible: scars rearrange but do not vanish, and future tempests will test the runes. One tightening and one deepening are sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (delivering the apology and stopping exploitation) is signaled early and tightens through one decisive turn: Mirabel shifts from metaphor-heavy deflection to direct confession, typing "names, dates, and the admission that some hauntings are manufactured for profit." The hand-over-hers moment (whether literal or figurative) marks the deepening—Liora's presence as witness or forgiveness crystallizes the cost. Agency is clear: she chooses to send the piece, forecloses her previous column method, and the orchard's deadline pressurizes the window. One live tightening with visible cost satisfies the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: prevent the universe's reset by unifying diverging timelines before the hiccup completes. Pressure accumulates through the spiral walk, the dictionary's new entry, and the revealed chamber. The hiccup mid-walk provides one tightening moment when "galaxies blinked out and reappeared with slightly different constants." No-One's agency is renunciation ("long since surrendered…such a simple pronoun") and endurance (continuing the walk without flinching), culminating in the weighing act. Cost is opportunity—all alternate histories collapse into one—legible in the final image but not viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding what clocks truly measure—is signaled early and tightens through the counting sequence, which narrows his interpretive options from "disciplined dripping" to recognition of "the rate at which attention surrendered." The key discovery three weeks prior and its absence from any station mechanism create a secondary pressure thread. The final renunciation (setting the key down, turning away) forecloses the path toward regularized obedience with felt cost. Escalation is primarily conceptual rather than event-driven, fitting the Accumulative lens, but one more micro-choice in the middle third would cement high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—whether to return to the hospital and what stance to take toward her father's post-crisis life—is signaled early and tightens through the library discovery and subway journey. The narrator's final note-writing is protagonist-driven agency that forecloses evasion and crystallizes a shared-risk ethic. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: each found message (his note, subway scrawls) deepens the question of whether odds can be "changed" by staying. One visible cost: she abandons professional safety ("grading exams") and theoretical distance to write vulnerability on paper. The father's nod and smile provide a micro-turn that complicates without resolving.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: can Lena teach Mara to step sideways from the loop? Pressure coheres when Mara reveals she's under the streetlamp "now," raising immediate risk. The tightening is modest but legible: Lena presses harder on the glass disc and gives Mara a concrete synchronization task (lamp dims = affair ends; brightens = sister call). Cost is felt—Mara whispers "finally, dialing home"—and Lena's method forecloses passivity. Band guardrail met: the tightening forces a trade-off and the price charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving small moments to honor Mara and renegotiate loss—is signaled early and deepens through the ritual sequence. The tightening occurs when footprints emerge and lead the narrator to the jetty's edge, narrowing options to confrontation. Cost is felt in the "haunted euphoria" and the commitment to continue writing despite unresolved grief. Escalation is atmospheric rather than dramatic; the apparition validates rather than challenges, limiting tension in the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Kenji's need to honor reciprocity without curing his own loneliness—is signaled early and remains coherent. The one-by-one confessions deepen the experiment, and the ending reconfigures his loneliness from "singular to shared," which is a meaningful tightening consistent with the Situational lens. Yet the escalation is accumulative rather than pressured by an active choice or reversal; Kenji listens passively, and we don't see a moment where he risks something or trades off competing goods. The cost (feeling heavier) is noted but not dramatized in a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—mapping uncharted emotional depths—is signaled early and tightens when the compass "did not point outward but inward." The trail of notes becomes sentences in voices he knew, escalating pressure by converting abstract search into embodied memory. The clearing's silence and the phrase "stay" narrow options: Orrin must map internal terrain before seeking further shore. Agency is renunciation (kneeling, agreeing to stay) with visible cost: abandoning the outward quest. One meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens suffices here; the cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: redeem past mistakes by decoding patterns. One meaningful tightening: the pen's activation forces the narrator to revise history along kinder geometries, narrowing the path from passive exile to active micro-editor. Agency is renunciation with visible cost—"I could not bring back the child" but redirects despair toward safer protocols. The final acceptance of death forecloses the erasure path. Pressure accumulates steadily under the Accumulative lens; a second on-page reversal (e.g., a curve that resists unbending) would lift this into the 8.5+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—translating silence into music—is signaled early and tightens through signing memory's shapes until the harbor answers. The escalation is coherent under the Accumulative lens: pauses thicken to fabric, then resolve into melody. However, the advisor provides the method without opposition; Lena's agency is more demonstration than choice under pressure, and no live option is foreclosed with sharp cost, keeping this below 8.2.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—rescuing the forgotten promise—is signaled early and tightens when the protagonist recognizes their own jaw in the self-portrait, then deepens at the tapestry when the embroidered words match the protagonist's vow. One meaningful escalation occurs: the realization that "violence against art was not destruction but emphasis" reframes all prior vandalism and narrows options to emulation rather than retreat. The final choice to stay and translate is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, and the cost—remaining off-grid, alone—is legible. However, the story does not test this choice against a competing pull (e.g., a reason to return), so the trade-off reads more as acceptance than a forced renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—escaping or subverting the handlers' control over entangled memories—is signaled early and tightens when the narrator realizes the true purpose: "to tune an entire population like strings." The protagonist's agency (slipping away, drumming faster, leaning into the borrowed dream) drives the escalation under the Accumulative lens. One meaningful deepening occurs: the narrator's drumming shifts from a nervous tic to a deliberate signal, and the others notice. However, the cost at closure is collective and conceptual rather than visibly paid by the protagonist on the page; the final image presents open possibility ("waiting for whatever song we chose") without a trade-off that forecloses a path for this narrator specifically.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (prove whispers work or the port shuts down) is signaled and tested within the ten-minute frame. One meaningful tightening: Ramos's ultimatum forces Milo to execute his prepared tactic under time pressure. Agency is present but muted—Milo already laid the groundwork weeks ago, so the present choice feels more like execution than improvisation. The inspectors' emergence delivers visible success with reputational cost to Ramos, though the prior preparation lowers present-tense urgency slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the dentist will voice his apology—is signaled early and tightens once: the guardian's light-weaving prompts the dentist to shift from aimless shutter-tapping to purposeful pattern, then to the phone call. The reversal is gentle but present: "fear loosened half a notch," shutters "reopen in a new rhythm," and the call connects. Escalation is driven by the guardian's agency (guiding reflections) and the dentist's responsive choice, consistent with the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible—"heart rattling," words "haltingly"—though the woman's off-page pain and the two-year delay keep the present-tense price moderate. No explicit antagonist; pressure is internal and ambient, which fits the situational/accumulative hybrid but limits peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—stopping the hillside leveling—is signaled early and tightens through accumulative pressure: Milo's whispered fear, shop owners' resignation, the synchronized reveal. One meaningful deepening occurs when Daniel realizes he must organize the town's collective hesitation into a visual argument legible from the council balcony. Agency is clear: Daniel's phone calls and the chess club's design work drive the turn. The cost is visible in the line "two council members changed their minds without quite knowing why"—the rebellion succeeds obliquely, and the price (no catharsis, no acknowledgment) is felt even if quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—Mara's buried self versus her defended exterior—is signaled early but never tested through a concrete on-page trade-off. The journey to the island and the bone-listening are more ritual than reversal; Mara does not choose between competing goods or face a visible consequence that narrows later options. Pressure accumulates texturally (violence-ended world, strain as grace, disappearing island) but does not escalate causally. No moment forces Mara to forfeit safety, speech, or stance in a way that changes what she can do next.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: cultivating prohibited "lightness in grief" under state surveillance. Pressure tightens when Mara voices sedition risk ("What if someone reports you"), and the performer's whittling forecloses safety with visible cost (contraband artifact, measured joy visit violated). Agency is renunciation: both accept danger for a momentary reprieve. The trade-off is clear and scaled appropriately.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: Lio's reclamation of voice and space after seven winters of prohibition. Pressure accumulates through the atrium's acoustic responsiveness and Lio's choice to reject the sanctioned gratitude poem, delivering instead an excavation of suppressed memory. The tightening occurs when he "lays his hands on the wood" and commits to subversive speech, narrowing his options from compliance to defiance. Agency is embodied in his descent from the dais and stride through the colonnade, forecloses the path of official reinstatement, though the exact future cost (punishment, exile, acceptance) remains off-page. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length; no multiple reversals needed under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (finding beauty in imperfection, sustaining her barter practice against marketplace perfection) is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: the stranger's request is impossible, which raises the cost of acceptance. Mira's choice to paint imperfectly enough that "the sound can finally escape where it cracked" narrows options and is executed on the page (refusing straight lines, honoring hesitation). The final cost is visible: the reed falls silent, the plant blooms—she achieves the awakening. The piece does not show a second reversal or an explicit foreclosed path beyond her acceptance of the commission, capping the score slightly below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—whether Elya can guide a pilgrimage she doubts—signals early and tightens when the visitor arrives "early" yet belongs. The key reversal is Elya's choice to abandon the score and walk as co-questioner, narrowing her options (she forecloses her role as authoritative guide) with visible cost (uncertainty voiced aloud, "hearing her own uncertainty like a second voice"). Escalation coheres under the Accumulative lens through the visitor's honest statement, which reweights Elya's premise. One clear tightening with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—teaching withering to bloom again—is signaled early and tightens through the ritual of placing origami birds "forcing herself to navigate the constellations of her own failures." The meteor shower functions as a deepening moment that reweights her work, and the morning sketch of a "new series...for the almost-living" shows agency with cost: she abandons pure mourning work. Under the Accumulative lens, this one meaningful shift is sufficient. No major reversals required, and coincidence (meteor shower) complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—Mara's project to map cultural patterns after the crash—is signaled early and sustained. The story tightens once when Jonas asks to be taught and Mara shifts from solitary mapping to collaboration, narrowing her stance from diagnosis to shared construction. Under the Accumulative lens, this deepening reweights the project's meaning. However, the tightening is more thematic than tactical: no on-page price is paid (no forfeited solitude, no tactical loss), and Jonas's request is granted without friction or trade-off. The final collaborative placement of cards is a meaningful gesture but lacks the felt cost of an option foreclosed or a visible sacrifice that would lift escalation into the high 7s.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—whether to pursue forbidden knowledge despite Council warnings—is signaled early and tightens when Hiran chooses deliberate sequence over randomness. This choice narrows options and raises conceptual cost, fulfilling accumulative escalation. The cost is legible: accepting memory as unbearable and swearing isolation. Agency is present in the decision to "open the first door in deliberate sequence," which forecloses the path of safe cataloging. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—preserving lost hope and managing unbound shadows—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when Lio realizes Lane's trajectory was erased. The shadow's approach and Lio's choice to absorb it constitute a decisive tightening driven by his agency, with visible cost: he must carry futures that were never realized. The price is legible in the "ache" and "scorching" pain, and his request to the Overseer forecloses his prior passive role. Coincidence does not resolve; Lio's decision and the shadow's response drive closure.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Liora's need to balance self-respect and compassion after complicity. The vial decision tightens pressure by forcing her to choose between private absolution and public reconstruction. The final act—placing the tail tip on the wire—is protagonist-driven and forecloses the path of hoarding goodness; the cost is legible on the page ("nothing left to trust in when she looked in the mirror"). One meaningful tightening is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (learning to read scars vs. reopening wounds) is signaled early and tightens through plant voices challenging her method. Escalation operates through accumulative pressure: ivy's accusation, rosemary's memory-scars, coffee ring visions, culminating in Mara's question about tending living hurt. Agency is renunciation with visible cost—she must give up her closure-seeker identity. The fern's spore-breath and final realization foreclose her prior path. One micro-turn (coffee ring revelation) supports rather than diffuses the main arc.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake ("to find where unused love is stored") is signaled early and pursued throughout. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mara realizes unused love persists "in the margins of remembered stories." The projectionist's answer ("you can project it here, see it, and let new scenes grow in its light") offers a path but lacks an on-page trade-off or forfeiture that narrows Mara's options with visible cost. Escalation under the Accumulative lens is present but the price remains implied rather than dramatized in a decisive micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity—is signaled early and tightens when "the sentence was mine" turns external threat into internal confrontation. One meaningful reversal: realizing the trapped ideas are her own abandoned work, which narrows options to surrender or continued imprisonment. Agency is embodied in lifting the astrolabe "toward the thickening light," and cost is visible: "ringing emptiness" and the renunciation of control. Pressure accumulates through the Accumulative lens without requiring multiple causal turns. The stakes are felt throughout and the final release forecloses hoarding.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake signaled early: to keep watch over what passes through, later refined to cultivating sparks. One meaningful tightening occurs when a spark "accepts the story, dives into the chess clock," and tracks scar the air—narrowing the guard's options from passive patrol to active ritual curation. Agency is renunciation with visible cost: he stays awake because "stopping feels like erasing the dead," forecloses sleep/rest. The invented schedules and lullaby fragments function as tactical offerings that sometimes succeed, sometimes fail, maintaining coherent pressure under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—rediscovering "the wild frontier of my mind"—is signaled early and coheres under the Accumulative lens. One meaningful deepening occurs when the mercury pool reveals exiled memories, raising the conceptual cost of the journey. The protagonist's choice to place the gear is motivated but not deeply conflicted; the forest "leans in" and the moment hovers "just shy of certainty," muting the felt tension. The escalation is present but the cost at closure remains more conceptual than viscerally embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Mara's flight from the family shop versus finding her courage—is signaled early and coheres under the Accumulative lens. The stairway descent tightens options through memory-revealed costs (swallowed words, undefended friend, unseen brochure), and the final hum narrows her stance. However, the ferry guides' role is passive; they frame but do not oppose, so pressure remains internal and one-note. The cost at closure is conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page, meeting the minimum but not exceeding it.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—understanding the cost of safety and the price of silence—is signaled early and tightens through one decisive turn: the protagonist leads the woman to the forbidden staircase, risking the vow. Pressure escalates via agency: picking up the bolt, choosing to tilt head in question, descending despite regulations, touching the wall, and finally speaking. The woman's challenge ("If you speak, storms will know this place") forces a live trade-off between complicity and destruction. The final act (speaking "Enough") is protagonist-driven, forecloses safety, and delivers immediate visible cost: "bones shattered again, as nerves screamed awake." No coincidence resolves the conflict; the fortress's response to the broken vow is causally prepared.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—unmask the pretender—is signaled early and pursued methodically. The titan's agency is clear in every beat: grinding ink, choosing texts, painting runes, correcting lineages. Escalation operates through accumulation: rune of drift, split crown, corrected names stack until the scholar's arrival transforms pattern into realization. The scholar's collapse serves as the decisive tightening, narrowing the pretender's path to the throne. One limitation: the titan faces no on-page resistance or reversal; his work proceeds unopposed, reducing friction. The "slow urgency of a glacier" metaphor accurately captures the pressure model, but a single complication or constraint would elevate the escalation curve.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake signaled early: "to discover why some paths disappear." The atlas page discovery tightens options; the protagonist's decision to tap the pattern on the roof is agency under pressure. The final manifestation of the sandbar narrows understanding—paths respond to rhythm but cannot be held—with the cost that recovery remains partial and fleeting. One clear escalation (observation → active testing → momentary success with visible limit) is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: whether Liora will move from passive observation to action that might reignite the rebellion. The piece opens with her waiting, then memory images arrive ("workers laughing as they rewired security drones"), and her fear "folds...into a question: what could she quietly reignite without burning herself hollow"—a tightening that narrows her posture from general searching to specific decision. The wrist-comm message is agency as decision, though the cost (trembling fingers, the phrase "burning herself hollow") is named more than dramatized in immediate consequence. No reversal occurs; pressure accumulates through recollection and the stones' hum until she acts. The rebellion's current "lull" provides situational pressure, but the piece does not test her commitment with a complicating obstacle before the send.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—whether to restore the embryo as a "controllable heir" or dissolve its blueprint—is signaled when the roots push it into awareness. Escalation tightens through the kite-decoding sequence (a meaningful task under time pressure from the approaching council delegation) and peaks when the narrator must choose whether to ask the embryo's consent. The final act—letting the light bleed into the spring—forecloses the council's plan with visible cost (their anxious certainty meets Teta's calm refusal). Agency is clear: the protagonist's plant-communion enables the decoding, and the final question reframes control as invitation.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—surviving trauma enough to imagine a future grounded in reality—is signaled early and tightens through her writing exercise: listing what she knows instead of what she wishes. The escalation is Accumulative: each truth (drones mistake weddings, her shoulder will seize, and also sea lavender grows) deepens the cost of her stance without requiring a causal reversal. Agency appears as endurance and attention: she traces the fig leaf, folds the photograph smaller, slips it into the notebook between pages "where ink had begun, timidly, to imagine tomorrow." The gull-dive freeze demonstrates ongoing physiological cost. One friction: the therapist's framing ("somatic markers," "resilience") risks feeling assigned rather than discovered, though she actively renames it "a pearl of stillness."

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—Elias seeking to mend or redesign himself after fragmentation—is signaled early and coheres. The middle tightening occurs when he finds the unmarked volume and realizes "the self can be redrawn," leading him to rearrange the cards and pair them with his failures. The descent is a meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. However, the escalation lacks a visible trade-off or price paid on the page; the air "thickens," reality "aligns," but we don't see what he loses or forecloses in this reconfiguration. The final question ("would it hurt less...to live divided yet shining") suggests cost but doesn't dramatize it.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding the Crisis Slow—is signaled in the opening reflection and drives every beat. Pressure tightens when the ink demonstration reframes time as deletion, forcing Iren to choose between observation and participation. Agency is clear: his decision to place fingertips on ink and loosen self forecloses the passive tracker role with visible emotional cost ("fury and acceptance"). The escalation is driven by protagonist realization under a causal lens, and the cost is legible on the page in his breath and bodily surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—preserve forbidden memory versus incinerate it—is signaled early and tightens through the unauthorized alert, the letter's emotional pull, and the system's polite demand for incineration. Ana's agency drives escalation: she chooses to read, then to preserve, then to disseminate with annotation. The cost is legible in her dual identity and the falsified report; she forecloses the path of compliance. One meaningful reversal (from archivist to conspirator) narrows options with visible consequence. The quiet ending fits the chosen lens without requiring set-piece confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—weaving continuity through chaos via the rose farm—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure escalates through two on-page visits (hunters, then raiders) that test Mara's vision, and the raiders' hesitation and surrender constitute a meaningful tightening. However, the escalation is more atmospheric than tactical; no sharp reversal narrows Mara's options or forces a visible trade-off on the page. The cost (Mara's isolation, the sustained effort) is felt but not crystallized in a single high-stakes choice at closure, keeping the score in the strong 7-range.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (catching the echo to ask one unanswerable question) is signaled early and tightens when the echo arrives as grief and crowding prayers. The peak choice—refusing to transliterate and letting the question dissolve—is driven by protagonist agency and forecloses the path of demanding answers, with visible cost in the new rhythms. One reversal/deepening when the kneeling goddess offers only reflection, forcing him to see his own stitched-from-tides life. Pressure accumulates under the textural lens and narrows to a crystallized stance.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (how to handle inherited surveillance machinery) signals early and tightens through one meaningful reversal: Elena moves from potential silence to active intervention via the proof-by-contradiction sequence. Agency is decision-driven with visible cost: publishing will destroy her family's reputation and break public trust. The proof structure itself narrows options logically—silence cannot be liberation, therefore intervention is required. Tariq's revelation provides external pressure that Elena converts into internal moral calculus. The cost is stated and felt but not fully embodied in a forfeiture on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—hushing the dissonance of guilt and recovering the brother's voice—is signaled early and tightens when the firmware cries in a simulated infant wail layered with the brother's deleted voicemail. The failsafe instruction forces a trade-off (offer "your truest sound") and the protagonist's retrieval and playback of the saved voicemail is an earned, high-cost agency move that forecloses clinging to the haunted echo. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens through escalating imagery and the clock showing "every hour at once." However, the firmware's sudden vocal manifestation and the failsafe's late appearance (final third) weaken escalation continuity; the turn feels more discovered than causally compelled by prior protagonist choices.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Lark must "listen and draw whatever the hush would not say aloud" despite skepticism. The piece delivers one meaningful tightening when picking up the tile flake changes the "emergent hush" flavor and floods her with stolen whispers, forcing the decision to interject and then draw. The final act forecloses her prior distance ("never again pretend her art was harmless"), providing visible cost. The escalation reads more as accumulative pressure than causal narrowing, but the hybrid lens accommodates this and the cost is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—freeing the city from retrocognitive trauma—signals early and tightens through the tessera insertion and naming sequence. One clear escalation: pressing the tessera into the pillar floods Laleh with causally linked visions that inform her renaming act. The final gesture (opening her arms) crystallizes her stance with felt cost (public vulnerability, risk of rejection). Weakness: the city's collective "stepping into" her hold feels slightly soft as a closure price; we see others emerge but not a concrete trade-off Laleh must endure on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: save the theater's stories before demolition, requiring timeline intertwining. One meaningful deepening occurs when Lina reveals the gutting plan, raising urgency and narrowing Marcel's eternal rehearsal into a single collaborative gambit. The Wheel mechanism and Lina's painted coin provide concrete tactics. However, no live option is visibly foreclosed; Marcel's "almost remembered breathing" hints at cost but the trade-off (endless encores vs. one true encore) remains abstract. Agency is present but the price—what each sacrifices by committing—is felt rather than shown in a specific forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: manage the post-pill haunting that chews through sleep. One meaningful deepening occurs when Eli enters the memory-web and loosens a knot, narrowing his stance from passive carrier to active guide. However, the escalation mechanism—how "intention" and "breath" enable the redirection—appears late without prior constraint or failed attempt, so the turn feels discovered rather than fought-for. The conceptual cost (accepting the tool role) is felt but not dramatically tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—charting emotional residue for future wakers—tightens when the spiral pattern suggests not leftover trace but active presence, forcing Iri to exceed charter boundaries. The elm leaf discovery is the key reversal: it shifts the mission from archival recording to real-time dialogue ("If you are what comes after us…"). Agency is clear in the decision to follow the spiral, adjust buoyancy, and speak aloud, each choice foreclosing the safety of detached observation. The cost is legible in Iri's charter violation and the conceptual leap from mapping sleep to addressing wakefulness.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (steal the echo to "spin a prophecy into raw possibility before the Council bound it into law") is signaled in paragraph five and braided with a secondary (restore voices the Council has silenced). One meaningful tightening: locating the jar and hearing its polyvocal chord forces Mara to choose—seal it back or release it—and her decision to "tip the jar wider" forecloses containment with visible cost (the warehouse will "breathe," the truth will unravel above). Agency is decisive renunciation of control (she abandons theft-for-self, releasing the echo to all). Escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as density increase (button map → counter-seal → murmur → full release) that narrows her tactical options and raises social cost. Cost is legible on the page: "by morning...the warehouse would breathe" implies discovery and consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: to understand Mara's disappearance and his own purpose post-burn. The twin pillbox discovery meaningfully tightens options—it shifts him from seeking answers about her fate to seeking "where unused courage waits." The key becomes a concrete constraint (unlocks "some anonymous door") with visible cost: he must wait rather than act immediately. Agency is renunciation with on-page consequence: he walks back to the station instead of rushing forward. Under the Accumulative lens, the pressure coheres and one decisive tightening (the twin pillbox and its message) narrows his path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake is clearly the boy's crossing (literal and metaphorical death-passage) and the mother's need to release him without fear. Pressure accumulates through sensory detail and the coachman's layered awareness; the mother's whisper is a tightening that forces the coachman to hold contradictory vows together until they thin. Agency is present but muted: the coachman's act of holding and clicking his tongue is a stance crystallization rather than a high-cost decision. The crossing itself narrows no live option on the page; the boy's fate seems preset. Cost is atmospheric rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake ("why some places resist change") is signaled in paragraph four and tightened through the glass-revealed double-images showing branching outcomes. The potter's agency—placing clay and seeds at each hive—forecloses passivity with visible cost: he commits local effort knowing "the wasteland beyond might never change." The tightening is driven by protagonist choice under the inferred Accumulative lens, and the cost (accepting conditional success, enduring uncertainty) is unmistakable in "fragile yet enduring, and he walked on, gently, sharply, into whatever version of tomorrow awaited." One reversal: seeing his own small cruelty (swatting a bee) pivot an entire timeline toward salt crust.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Mara's impulse to create safety through tending, inherited from her father. The final petal dropping functions as the inciting pressure that prompts her to reconfigure her method. One meaningful deepening occurs when she admits "what she really wants" and acts on it by assembling the light installation. The cost is legible—she exposes her grief and vulnerability to neighbors' view with no promise of response ("like a child leaving a lamp burning for someone who may never knock"). Escalation is gentle but coherent under the Accumulative lens. Minor deduction: the protagonist's agency feels more like realization than a choice that forecloses a competing option; the decision to hang the fragments carries symbolic weight but limited tactical friction.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: translate isolation into independence, signaled early. One meaningful tightening: Lio aligns the sundial, the reflection appears, and the encounter forces Lio to distinguish solitude (a sentence) from independence (a craft). Agency is present—Lio decides to "prepare a harbor" and feed the library's movements with their own decisions—but the escalation is conceptual rather than volitional struggle. The reflection delivers the key insight ("choosing connection, not needing it") rather than Lio discovering it through embodied choice, softening protagonist-driven pressure. Cost is visible but quiet: Lio accepts永久 stewardship and renounces species revival.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—finding the thread that connects all things while carrying years of unsentences—is signaled early and tightens through the architect's commission, which forces the protagonist to externalize the private archive. The act of writing the letter (spreading fragments, addressing it to "whoever steps onto the path" and to the self) is a protagonist-driven choice with visible cost: the "slackening of invisible knots" both relieves and forecloses the protective role of keeper. One meaningful deepening (writing becomes both commission and confession) suffices under the Accumulative lens, though a second concrete constraint or trade-off on the page would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—prevent the tower sale and keep the Void accessible—is signaled early ("trading student airtime for a classified research grant"). Pressure accumulates through the senate debate overhead and Mara's escalating gambit: she moves from passive mapping to active broadcast with visible cost (whispering apology to equipment, defying the programming director). The final swell narrows her options by answering her invitation, foreclosing retreat. Agency is clear: her deliberate interference reweights the game. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (uncovering the key) signals early and tightens through claustrophobic pressure escalating to "air itself might tighten until ribs protested." The compass alignment narrows three passages to one—a genuine decision with spatial/survival cost. Final descent forecloses escape, accepting transformation as price: "the key might change him first." Agency is protagonist-driven throughout; coincidence (temple response to compass) complicates but does not resolve. One clear reversal when temple reorganizes, forcing trust in instrument over nerves.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: solving the cold case by awakening empathy through portraiture. Pressure accumulates through Jonas's methodical painting, his explanation of past confessions triggered by his work, and the stone slip that signals possible witness presence. The tightening is more textural than causal—no on-page reversal or forced choice—but the ribbon's reweighting (from "party trash" to dignified memorial) narrows the emotional frame and raises implicit cost. Agency is attentional endurance (Jonas paints "until the ribbon...seemed to flutter") rather than decision. The escalation is density-driven, consistent with the Accumulative lens, but lacks a second beat that alters tactics or forecloses an option.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: honor Tamar's overlooked bravery and decode the journals to reverse erasure. Pressure tightens when the coordinates reveal Liora herself is stationed at the site of Tamar's punishment, reframing her task from academic to existential. The escalation is Accumulative: density increases through the stanzas, the coded verses, and Liora's realization that the exile structure persists. Her final choice—copying Tamar's last stanza into the digital log and tagging it with the crest—is agency with cost: she embeds contraband in the official record, risking her career and possibly her own exile status. The cost is conceptual and institutional, legible in "an unerasable ghost correcting the future." Minor: the middle third accumulates texture more than complicates options; a second visible constraint or tactical tradeoff would have sharpened escalation further.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake signaled early: the hitchhiker has vanished and the fiddler must "chisel him free" from the pixelated frames. Pressure tightens when the glass flake lands and reveals the stranger trapped in "countless others," escalates when the fiddler tucks it into the instrument and plays faster ("bow hair fraying"), and culminates in the shattering harmonic and the hitchhiker's return. Agency is clear: the fiddler's decision to play the second bridge-song, choosing "which frames to forgive," directly alters outcome. Cost is visible: "the choice feels impossibly heavy," bow hair frays, and the song recounts "the apology he never voiced," foreclosing the path where gratitude stayed buried.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding why paths circle back—is signaled early and coheres under the Accumulative lens. The tightening occurs when the protagonist realizes the bills mirror the father's routes and the startup's payment corridors, reweighting prior material with visible cost (company dead, investors gone). However, the escalation is more reflective than enacted; the protagonist arranges bills rather than making a choice that forecloses a live option on the page. Agency appears as endurance and realization rather than decision, which fits Earned Stasis but limits pressure intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—decode temple inscriptions to validate the protagonist's experience and secure observatory funding—is signaled early and sustained. The matching of symbols to variable stars provides one meaningful tightening that narrows interpretive options and reveals the temple's ledger function. However, the escalation reads more as accumulative discovery than as a choice under pressure; the protagonist never faces a trade-off or dilemma that forces renunciation, and the final "understanding" arrives without a visible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is established early: discovering the truth of his sister's disappearance and the magician's confession. Pressure tightens when the orchard vortex responds to Arlen's attention and the seed surfaces, forcing a choice between preserving the frozen moment or shattering it with counter-confession. Agency is clear: Arlen's whispered reversal is a decision with visible cost—he claims responsibility and cracks the suspended state. One meaningful turn narrows options (the seed's hunger clarifies why the confession froze). Escalation is driven by protagonist choice under the Causal lens, and the cost (self-implication, breaking stasis) is unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to cut or let the maze grow—is signaled when Lio brings the clipping and sharpens through the shared vision showing fractured futures. One meaningful tightening occurs: the vision sequence narrows options by revealing catastrophic consequences for both cut and keep, forcing Lio's realization. Agency is present in the narrator's choice to link and Lio's decision to press his scar, and the final stance forecloses the binary with conceptual cost (the eclipsed covenant will break either way). The escalation is more conceptual than pressured—stakes are shown rather than felt in mounting urgency—but the ending reconfigures options with undeniable weight.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (escape guilt, become someone who watches) is signaled early and drives the protagonist's choice to place hand on cloth. The orchard's hunger and Lio's dimming provide escalating cost, and the final rearrangement of moments forecloses the prior self with visible price (Lio older, narrator steadier). Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening occurs when the confession triggers the orchard's response. Minor deduction: the protagonist's agency is somewhat reactive—Lio orchestrates the ritual, and the protagonist largely consents rather than driving reversals. The mechanics of the bargain (blood, backward language) feel slightly convenience-driven rather than earned through prior constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: whether Eli can assign value (and implicitly find purpose) in cataloging relics versus drowning in past loss. The discovery of his own amp tightens options—he can lie for market value or honor memory. One meaningful deepening occurs when the grille-cloth scrap bypasses thought and facts desert him, narrowing his appraisal to a personal reckoning. Agency is renunciation with cost: he writes "Provenance uncertain" and forfeits commercial certainty for subjective meaning. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens but the external opposition is minimal; the conflict is primarily internal.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding transition physics versus witnessing it alone—is signaled early and tightens when the guide vanishes, leaving Mara the sole witness. Her final choice to "reestablish" rather than exploit the discovery forecloses the path of personal glory with visible cost. The arbor's patient hum and her realization that "transition was not a doorway but a relationship" deepen pressure under the Accumulative lens, though the escalation is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake signaled early: preserve wonder in routine amid identity migration and the disappeared tomorrow. The inciting choice occurs when the librarian opens the creel and discovers unbound selves; the escalation tightens when the fisherman returns asking "Have you seen my day?" forcing a reweaving decision rather than simple return. The smelting intensifies pressure ("gears turning with slow, tectonic assurance") and the resolution is earned by the protagonist's acceptance of contradictions, which reweights the fisherman's relationship to repetition. Visible cost: the librarian must hold molten, unresolved desires in their chest furnace, and both characters trade fragments of self. One minor gap: the fisherman's agency in the final beat is more receptive than decisive, slightly diffusing protagonist-driven closure.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Mara's professional verdict on the shelter—is signaled early and tightens when she recognizes the shelter as fundamentally different from the "tombs" she has certified. Her spoken confession narrows options by implicitly rejecting her prior methodology, and the decision to mark it "provisionally safe" reflects a stance shift. However, the escalation is driven more by the setting's revelatory properties than by Mara's agency; the pearl "brightens" in response to her hesitation rather than as a consequence of her action, and no visible price (lost credibility, professional risk, or relational cost) is paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: finding a path to self-forgiveness after selling a recording of the brother's death. The graffiti line "YOU ARE NOT THE WORST THING THAT HAPPENED HERE" narrows options by offering an alternative to total self-loathing, and the protagonist's decision to write both names "on the same unsteady line" is agency as renunciation—it forecloses the archival practice that treated the brother as content. The tightening is visible: "I had archived him as content, not as brother, and the river took offense on his behalf" → graffiti reframes → final act closes the notebook after naming. Cost is legible on the page: the "shaking hands" and the shift from flawless coordinates to writing the brother's name "in full." No antagonist required; the accumulative pressure of guilt and the station's charged objects suffice.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (find and document the library) is signaled early and tightens when she discovers documentation would be "misrepresentation." One clear turn: her hunger shifts to reverence ("no longer the giddy hunger of discovery, but a reverent thrill at learning how not to conclude"). The cost is legible—she dissolves her resignation and abandons the Council map—but the middle could show more tactical friction or a live threat to force the choice under greater duress.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: authenticate the violin or refuse, with professional survival and historical truth in tension. Pressure coheres and tightens when Aurelio presents the contract, the plants hiss warnings, and the coffee pattern shows "perforated destiny." The protagonist's agency is renunciation—writing doubts in the margins instead of signing—which forecloses the grant path with visible cost (Aurelio's face "tightening as if stitched," his rejection: "This is not authentication"). The escalation is driven by accumulative pressure (violin humming, plants warning, coffee-stain future) rather than causal reversals, consistent with the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—capturing one last spark before oblivion, tested most acutely with Isren—is signaled early and tightens across each ritual until the final slab. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens: each corpse Elara treats drains the emerald chip (hairline-cracked by the time she reaches Isren), raising the cost and narrowing her options. The reversal (shifting from forehead to sternum, leaning close until stillness hums) is driven by protagonist agency and rooted in their shared past. The cost is legible on the page: the chip may shatter, and so may the part of her Isren awakened. One escalation point is sufficient here, though a second visible constraint (fatigue, guild oversight) could have elevated further.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—finding contentment as reward for forgiveness—is signaled early and tightens when the old woman challenges the premise ("yet you still seek contentment as a reward"). The vision sequence forces a trade-off: accept rotation or cling to the myth of earned rest. Agency is clear in the final act (planting the seed, relinquishing the hairpin), and the cost is legible: the protagonist gives up personal contentment to provide future support. One meaningful deepening occurs; no multiple reversals are required at this length, and the Accumulative lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—Mara's demand for moral certainty vs. the narrator's refusal to supply it—is signaled in the opening beat ("argue with the story they tell themselves") and tightens through the confession. The reversal occurs when Mara admits fear rather than rehearsed justification, narrowing her certainty and enabling the narrator's reframe ("you chose between kinds of unfinished sorrow"). Agency is the narrator's strategic withholding and Mara's confession; the cost (an unerasable marriage, ongoing sorrow) is legible on the page. One beat of escalation under the Accumulative lens is sufficient for this length, but the lack of a second visible price or tactical constraint in the final moves caps this at mid-8s.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake signaled early: Mora came for "a demonstration of disappearance," Elian intends "to teach vanishing to appear in her bones." The stone-drop trance tightens pressure through sensory dilution and self-erasure: "the certainty of it thinned, like ink washed again and again," culminating in the moment "the world seemed to forget she had ever been sitting there." Cost is legible in the painful bright return and Elian's refusal, which folds into the lesson and forecloses haste. The final withholding forces her to "decide what deserves to remain," a meaningful deepening with felt opportunity cost.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—learning to navigate without moving—is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful deepening: the realization that the pulse he carries belongs to "countless choices never completed" raises the cost from personal quest to historical resolution. Agency is clear in the decision to skim stones at specific angles and the final choice to "let them map themselves around him." The tightening forecloses the path of physical travel with felt cost (renunciation of the horizon "he would never need to reach"), and the flock's shifting formation externalizes the pressure to reorient his method.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Orren's relegation to tending obsolete artifacts in an era of creative automation, his search for meaning the engines eclipse. One meaningful tightening occurs when the keystone pulls him toward the unmapped stair, narrowing options and raising cost (violating regulations, risking the fall he fears). Agency is clear: unstrapping the harness, following the pull, stepping into mist are all protagonist decisions that foreclose the path of safety and resignation. The final act—stepping into mist—carries visible cost (abandoning the anchor, confronting his levitation-charm failure) and redefines his stance from passive archivist to boundary-walker. Coincidence does not resolve; the keystone's pull complicates but Orren chooses to follow it.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—"discover the color of sound"—is signaled early but remains abstract; we never see Elias fail at this goal or face a trade-off that tests commitment. The middle sequence (tag hums, he follows, dives, finds library) unfolds without resistance or reversal; each step yields discovery rather than complication. The ending presents a vow and immediate reward (he can now see sound-colors) with no dramatized cost or path foreclosed. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful tightening or deepening is required; here the pressure never narrows options or forces a sacrifice, only grants access. The escalation guardrail for Accumulative (density increase, pattern break, or cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost) is not met.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to continue relying on randomness or trust autonomous choice—is signaled early and tightens through the backwards prophecy's direct command. The spiral coin pattern ("motion itself had been wounded") provides a meaningful deepening that changes knowledge and options. Agency operates through renunciation with visible cost: "to stop casting was to amputate my function" makes the price legible. The protagonist's final act of placing hands on the dials and tuning "not seeking an order from beyond" provides a decisive tightening under the Accumulative lens. Minor cap at 8.2 due to the cosmologists' explanation feeling slightly externalized rather than dramatized through immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—naming nameless fears to translate sacrifice's echo—is signaled early and tightens through each fear crystallized. The reaper's agency is renunciation with visible cost: he "never sought to destroy them; that was not the work of a heartbroken reaper." The child's memory forecloses the harvest path and the hope for the boy reweights all prior naming. One meaningful deepening (each creature pinned) under the accumulative lens is sufficient and the cost is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: restore cosmic balance via the broken bell, signaled early and pursued throughout. One meaningful deepening occurs when Tamsin closes her eyes and aligns drip rates, narrowing her approach from generic repair to her peculiar gift. The tightening forecloses brute fixing (she cannot weld or conjure bronze) and forces her to count drops—a renunciation of conventional power with visible trade-off. Agency is clear (her choice to kneel, lean the bell, speak to it), and the final act reweights the imbalance. However, the stakes remain somewhat abstract; the cost of "letting it ring" lacks concrete on-page consequence beyond perceptual shift, keeping escalation solid but not viscerally charged.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake signaled early: Tomas must reconcile his engineer's duty with the town's resurfacing past. Pressure accumulates through the photograph trail, each image narrowing his engineer-only stance. The tightening occurs when Mara's photograph and the steeple converge, forcing him to choose storytelling over structural reports—a trade-off with visible cost as he walks toward waiting neighbors who expect engineering answers. The council's imminent demand and the "fragile as glass" hush make the cost legible. One meaningful deepening is present and sufficient under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—harmonizing logic and intuition before a predicted transformation—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure accumulates when Elian's charts fail ("their shifting arcs slipped past his predictions") and he must choose between forcing certainty or trusting the rhythm. The pivot at "closed his eyes and listened" narrows his options (calculation is abandoned) and the agency is clear: he matches breath to murmuration and pivots the lens "not by calculation, but because the shared rhythm insisted." The cost is visible (tears, renunciation of decades of proof), but the escalation feels gradual rather than sharp; one meaningful deepening is present, satisfying the Accumulative lens, though the stakes never feel urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (preserve trust under pressure) signaled early and maintained throughout. The intercepted message creates one decisive tightening: coordinates reveal a false promise that will either betray the council or shatter innocent alliances. Protagonist agency drives the turn—weighing rhythms, adjusting sensors, filing the report—with visible cost in the judgment's weight and timing risk. The choice forecloses the path of looking away, scaled appropriately for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—custody of the jarred consciousness—is signaled immediately and pursued through the memory-blade duel. Pressure escalates as each strike threatens erasure, narrowing the emotional and tactical options. The climactic choice (lowering the weapon, refusing to erase guilt) is driven by protagonist agency and forecloses the path of winning by "hollowing him out." The cost is visible: the narrator risks losing custody and archives by sparing the memory, and the line "understanding that we hurt someone" articulates relational and moral price. One meaningful tightening under a causal lens with legible cost satisfies the 600–800 word standard.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—restore lost laughter—is signaled early and pursued through escalating tactics: lining machines in crescent, pulling cords, conducting, half-singing the lullaby until phantom laughter blooms. The tightening occurs when Mara's swallowed jokes "slide loose and drift downward," streaming up through the house to trigger the parents' broken laughs. Cost is visible: Lysander "understands that this work of tending to the unspoken will never be finished" yet the pull cord remains warm, an earned stasis that forecloses easy resolution. One limitation: the stakes rest entirely on Lysander's agency; the parents' resistance is passive, reducing friction.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—returning "home" to a dimensional origin—is signaled early and tightens when the guardian poses the binary (walk blind or sit forever naming fog). The narrator's rejection of the false binary and reframing as "both" constitutes a meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens, crystallizing stance rather than reversing plot. Cost is oblique: the narrator accepts perpetual uncertainty rather than resolution, but the piece does not foreclose a live option with visible on-page consequence, limiting upward reach.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake clear early: "to interrupt a stifling destiny meticulously arranged without his consent." Escalation is accumulative—Corren's successive observations and micro-decisions (stepping into the ring, grasping the shaft, laying the crozier across the rim, setting the lens, speaking the final direction) each narrow options until the irreversible act. The wardens provide situational pressure (watchful but dismissive), and the cost surfaces on-page: the crozier shatters, authority collapses, and Corren staggers as "crumbs...dropped into the ash." The redirected blessings reweight institutional obedience into visible defections. One tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether to grant the city's wish to fall and risk valley deaths or deny it and trap the city in perpetual echo—is signaled early and tightens when "underneath all those phases pulsed a single wish: to fall, to shatter." The protagonist's agency (teaching gradual dismantling) forecloses the catastrophic-fall path with visible cost: the city must wait decades, and she must carry the responsibility of that compromise. One meaningful deepening occurs when she becomes the city and tastes its longing, changing her knowledge of what it truly wants. Escalation is driven by protagonist attention and embodied perception under the chosen Accumulative lens, though the lack of a second on-page reversal keeps this shy of 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Eli's belief he can "merge parallel timelines" rather than bounce between them. The grotto's appearance is a meaningful tightening that narrows options and forces a stance. However, the final decision—choosing home from the overlapping ferries—lacks visible tradeoff; we do not see what Eli forfeits or what cost attaches to selecting one timeline over others. The passengers forming a "crooked circle" suggests collective action, but their agency and the consequence of this convergence remain vague.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—constructing "a way to remember someone without hurting"—is signaled early and tightens through the weaving process. The protagonist's agency is enacted through each thread placement, and the architect's challenge ("the room will test you") creates coherent pressure. The final act (wrapping rather than stepping through or walking away) forecloses both escape and closure with visible cost. One meaningful deepening through accumulative pattern is sufficient here, though the escalation is more textural than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: learning to navigate by starlight in a world where "there was no north, only gradients and harmonics." One meaningful deepening occurs when Mirror replaces flat-paper charts with edge geometry, narrowing the protagonist's tactical options to this new curriculum. Agency is attention and apprenticeship—asking "Show me"—with the visible cost being professional exhaustion deferred and cognitive reorientation ("my mind tilt, relearning which way was forward"). The escalation is textural, accumulating through viewport revelation and constellation-sketching; no reversal is required under the accumulative lens. Coincidence does not resolve; Mirror's attendance has been established across prior lectures.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (protecting vulnerable voices) is signaled early and tightens when Eren chooses to call rather than file. The hearing aid's escalating signal ("buzzing hotter," "vibrated sharply") accumulates pressure under the Accumulative lens. Agency is clear: Eren's decision to deliver the message forecloses the protocol path. The cost is legible—he introduces himself "not as city employee" and violates procedure. One meaningful tightening (the unsent plea resolved into "Tell her I forgave her first") narrows options and forces the trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.2)
    One dominant stake—retrieve the artifact before the tide shifts—is signaled early and tightened by the rig's temporal-drift warning. A second deepening occurs when Noah realizes the sphere contains "captured presence," reweighting the job from salvage to ethical witness. The final choice between escape and staying "with the sphere a little longer" narrows options with visible cost: he turns to leave, foreclosing the path of witness, yet the sphere's whisper ensures the price is felt. Agency is clear; coincidence does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—resurrecting Lian's fragmented neural backups before the observatory shuts down—is signaled early and tightens cleanly. The spilled-ink insight forces a tactical shift (nonlinear algorithm replacing linear sector recovery), and the protagonist's choice to "wipe my notes clean" and recode under time pressure narrows options. The cost is legible: he accepts that he cannot restore her original self. One meaningful deepening drives escalation under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: record the last words of a dying language. One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist discovers his voice is being braided into the canyon's language, forcing acceptance of the curse as a bridge rather than a threat. The tightening is conceptual rather than a narrowing of tactical options, fitting the Accumulative lens. The cost—accepting entwinement and the curse—is legible but understated; the protagonist "did not step back" suggests a choice, but no alternative path is foreclosed on the page with visible friction. Agency is present but the escalation feels contemplative rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding what takes people up the mountain—is signaled early and accumulates pressure through revelation (voices in static, plants as metamorphosed persons). However, the narrator never faces a meaningful choice that narrows options or forecloses a path. Mara provides all information; the protagonist absorbs but does not act. The institute's mapping mission is mentioned but never tested against an ethical or tactical dilemma. Pressure is present but does not tighten through protagonist agency, keeping this in mid-band under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake: reawakening beauty versus the machinists' control. Pressure accumulates through the locust shell's arrival, the orchard's pulse braiding with Lio's heartbeat, and his decision to play for the orchard rather than the city. The roots snapping harnesses and statues shedding armor constitute a meaningful tightening that forecloses the old order. Cost is visible: the city's power lines tear free, lights flicker out, panic rises—though we also hear "astonished laughter," diffusing the price slightly. Agency is present but leans passive-receptive: Lio "understood" and "let the new rhythm flood him" rather than wrestling with competing goods. One escalation step (matching the pulse) drives the cascade, sufficient for this length under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—whether to uncork the storm and let broken promises fall—is signaled early and unified across beats. Pressure accumulates through layered imagery (linked absences, the bottle's charge, Mara's wall of unclaimed letters) rather than a causal reversal that narrows options. Eren's agency is delivery and assent; Mara voices the thematic calculus but does not act, leaving the ending poised rather than paid. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mara explains the storm's mechanics and names the risk, but the cost remains prospective and the choice unmade on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—learning to interpret silence as possibility—is signaled early and tightens through Eli's song, which forces a trade-off: vulnerability (singing aloud) for restoration (the carousel responds). The pressure escalates under the Accumulative lens via density increase: each pause answered by a brighter pulse, horses trembling, platform turning. The resolution is earned by Eli's agency (he begins to sing "before fear could return") with visible cost: he abandons silent carpentry for voiced creation, foreclosing the option to remain emotionally guarded. No reliance on coincidence; the halo's response is framed as sympathetic answer, not deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake: to find "the place where stories live" is signaled early and pursued through star-marked pauses and hyperbolic diagrams. The poet's arrival and walk provide one meaningful tightening—Mariel follows, the air folds inward, and the junction becomes the answer. Agency is split: Mariel observes and records but does not act decisively; the poet unknowingly catalyzes the revelation. The cost is conceptual—her elaborate methods "had all been elaborate approaches to this simple observation"—and the forfeiture of complexity is felt, yet the price remains more reflective than visceral. Under the Accumulative lens, one pressure point suffices at this length, but higher bands require a visible trade-off or embodied sacrifice; here the cost lives in retrospect rather than on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—capture the runaway dream to vitalize the islands and solidify the absent visitor—is signaled early and recurs. Pressure deepens through villagers' requests and Irena's suspicion about the cipher, but the final beat lacks a visible choice or trade-off; the sunrise simply "poured through her" without dramatized agency or a narrowing of options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—freeing an idea trapped behind fear—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the locksmith uncorks the vial and the protagonist feels the "clenched fist" of fear, then chooses to thank it rather than fight it. This choice narrows options (the protagonist accepts vulnerability) with a felt cost (releasing the protective stance). The escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens: the protagonist brings the vial, allows the uncorking, and shifts internal stance. The cost is emotionally legible but not materially specified—no visible renunciation or tactical sacrifice—keeping this in the mid-7s rather than higher.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—recover stolen memories—signals in line 5 and tightens when recovery costs other facts ("phone numbers dissolving"). The fairy ring moment is a meaningful deepening: kneeling to press fingers into the damp ring foregrounds agency through embodied choice. The bargain's ongoing terms ("offering me a choice between a tidy life and a complete one") create ethical calculus. One substantive turn with legible trade-off scaled to this length.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (Jun's exile versus erasure) is signaled early and tightens when Rhea wins the compromise. The tea-reading is the visible escalation: Jun's demand and Rhea's promise foreclose retreat with on-page cost. Agency is clear: Rhea's combative tenderness drives the negotiation, the annotation, and the binding vow. One small slip: the Council's threat remains off-page summary rather than a dramatized pressure point within this scene, so escalation feels slightly one-sided.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—restoring hope and color to a gray, ghost-like existence—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure accumulates through the narrator's halting story, Lior's invitation, and the participatory ritual at the parapet, tightening as the narrator imagines children and murals, which the seed absorbs. Agency is present: the narrator chooses to reach out despite trembling. However, the escalation is largely textural; no live option is foreclosed on the page, and the ending affirms transformation without a visible tradeoff (leaving the city, risking failure, or sacrificing something tangible). Under the Accumulative lens this works, but the lack of a felt cost or a complicating reversal keeps the score from the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: "restore a name" to ground restless spirits. Pressure coheres through the accumulative lens: each knot Ilan unravels releases a voice or memory, building density and narrowing his path to the final star-knot. The second knot's release prompts a micro-turn when Ilan commits ("I will hold what you cannot"), and the final knot confronts him with the question "Will you keep what you hear?"—forcing a stance crystallization with visible cost (he holds the secret briefly, then lets it go). The spirits' settling and the reweighted hush make the cost undeniable. One meaningful tightening occurs; escalation is driven by Ilan's agency under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—how to interpret the chapel's silence and whether to reopen—is signaled early and deepens when Mara asks for "someone who might try to interpret silence with empathy." The woman's gestures across reels tighten pressure (reverence in the first, apology in the second), and Elias's final recommendation narrows options by reframing the site's purpose. However, the escalation is largely observational; Elias makes no on-page sacrifice, and the cost of his choice (recommending reopening "only as a place to listen") remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt. One meaningful deepening is present but the final beat lacks a visible price that would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (whether to salvage or honor the experiment's uncertainty) is signaled early via the physicist's note and tightens in the decompression chamber when colleagues shift toward "catalog numbers and news crews." The narrator's agency—choosing "a compromise that felt like mourning"—forecloses paths with felt cost. The escalation is driven by protagonist reflection under accumulative pressure rather than causal reversals, which fits the lens, but the middle section (reading the note) is more expository than dramatized, slightly softening the tightening effect.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Lio wants to articulate unspoken needs but his voice tangles before crowds. Pressure tightens when the wall replies ("WE ARE HERE"), raising the question of how to convert echoes into articulation. The climactic choice—"Use me... encode what you hear through me"—narrows options (ending his隐蔽 safety) and the cost is visible: his secret sigils become plain words any passerby can read, and "each sentence... felt a matching knot loosen," showing relational consequence. However, the ghost's hunger and Lio's solution arrive somewhat suddenly in the final third, slightly undercutting the sense of escalation through protagonist struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—learning to read hidden joy—is signaled early and deepens when the lock requires "consolation more than force," a micro-reversal that transforms her approach from theft to empathy. The diary's revelation that "every cruelty be annotated with the small joys" narrows her understanding from seeking secrets to adopting a method, a meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens. Agency is clear: her decision to close the diary "gently, not to steal it" forecloses the path of possession with visible cost—she returns empty-handed but cognitively altered. The timeframe (ten-floor climb) provides coherent pressure without requiring multiple reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake signaled early: Mara wants to prove empty spaces remember, testing whether air holds "the ghost of motion." The pressure deepens when the gondola begins moving along invisible tracks of past flights, providing tangible evidence. Her agency is attention and interpretation that forecloses the path of conventional grief—she chooses memorialization through data and acceptance over rescue. The cost is visible: she remains adrift, isolated, documenting rather than returning, with the knowledge that "someone would eventually see the wandering gondola" but she will not call for it.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: craft a surviving sky before demolition. Pressure tightens via countdown horns and spatial constraint (no more space on boards). Agency is clear: Mara proposes the compressed sky book instead of a catalog, layers color until the boards warp, and stops when the frame is full. The cost is visible: "some limits were not failures but frames" forecloses the pretense of endless sky and reframes her prosopagnosia as another productive boundary. One meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens, with felt conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—charting stranded luminance to honor the mother's legacy—is signaled early and tightens when Lio converts observation into actionable coordinates. Agency manifests in the decision to bring diagrams to Orvan, risking professional credibility ("the risk is yours"). One meaningful deepening: the realization that light itself "waits, as if expecting us to arrive with pen and paper" reframes the task from abstract discovery to responsive obligation. The final beat's "calling out steps" while the crew listens embodies the cost of solo navigation responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—learning the rhythm of repair—is signaled early and pursued across beats (gathering prophecy scraps, matching gears to mirror-locks, coaxing latches). Each mirror unlocking deepens pressure by requiring finer attunement, and the scraps provide a method-constraint that narrows options. However, no reversal or on-page trade-off forecloses a live alternative; the protagonist succeeds incrementally without visible cost or refusal, so escalation reads as accretion rather than tightening with a felt price at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake is clear early: prevent the orchard community from shattering when the planet sheds a ring. Escalation tightens through quake intensification, fissures opening where children played, the sky tearing, and gas flaring as chunks rise. Agency belongs to Kerran (chalk instructions) and the living (following them, trimming packs, swinging groves via grav-cranes), with visible cost: abandoned heirlooms, collapsed arches, the bell cracking, and the final count of survivors. The turn at "Move now" forces immediate choice—ride the first lifts or lose the window—and the resolution is earned by collective action under ghost guidance. One minor friction: the nebula's "soft harbor to cradle the pieces" introduces a cosmic safety net that slightly softens the stakes, though the on-page cost (lost homes, spilled ladders, shattered bell) remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake signaled early: halt the clock forever versus offer a gentler ending. The substitution of the puppet head is the key tightening—"small enough to pass as error, large enough to tilt an ending"—and it forecloses the path of universal salvation with on-page cost ("no triumph, only bruised awe"). The nested-pattern sequence deepens pressure by forcing micro-adjustments (loosening a cruel word, a bullet) that ripple outward. The accumulative lens supports escalation through density increase and cadence shift ("He understood then") rather than causal reversal. The final image—sitting beside the puppet, listening—crystallizes the renunciation with felt weight. Agency is decision and renunciation; coincidence does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: guide travelers to safety while defying the blueprint's pull toward ruin. Escalation deepens through the girl's path assembly ("ghost paths trembled, then slid into place"), years of repeated guidance ("each one another argument against the blueprint"), and the birds learning the narrator's patterns. The stranger's arrival crystallizes the conflict: "I understood then that the blueprint wanted to be remembered, and that guiding him might finally free the orchard from me." Agency is clear—each choice to guide rather than send away, each reading of the nut—and cost is legible in the frost traces and the narrator's growing precision in failures. One meaningful tightening occurs when the stranger asks directly for the blueprint, forcing the narrator to confront the source rather than symptoms.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—atoning for Leo's death by reimagining the resin—is signaled early and tightens through foam study to prototype testing. The turn from asking forgiveness to inviting Leo's judgment is a meaningful deepening. The prototype passing violent stress tests delivers visible cost (relief, not triumph) and forecloses the path of self-punishment. Minor gap: the middle weeks compress ("she designed polymer strands...") without on-page friction or setback to test commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: finding the place where stories begin (vendor's opening desire), converging with the woman's need for "silence before the opening word." The lull creates situational pressure—no customers, untested wares—until the woman arrives. One meaningful tightening: uncorking moonlight reveals not erasure but "carved absences," forcing both to confront refusals and omissions. The vendor's realization ("the place where stories begin is not a point ahead but the cut inside each omission") reconfigures understanding. Agency is present: the woman chooses to sign her name under carved absences, the vendor places the slate back with recognition. Cost is visible: she steps into a life "aware of its fractures," he moves from blank to margin. One micro turn (slate deepens instead of clearing) sets up closure without requiring multiple reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: managing stored remorse to feed the garrison without being subsumed. The tidal pool reading establishes method, the descent increases exposure, the woman's shard tests his capacity, and the soldier's shard forces a renunciation (sealing it deeper) that narrows options and establishes a boundary he cannot cross. The evening stew becomes the visible payoff—faces soften, laughter catches and resumes—demonstrating the cost and benefit of his work. Agency is present in his decision to use three grains and to refuse the soldier's memory. Pressure coheres and tightens once (the soldier's shard) under the Accumulative lens. Deduction: the tightening is brief and the renunciation, while present, feels more like routine caution than a higher-stakes trade-off that fundamentally alters his stance or the story's outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—rehabilitating the isolated grain elevator into a connective instrument—is signaled early and tightens through one clear sequence: diagnosis (listening) → convening allies → descent and labor → coordinated opening. Agency is collaborative but driven by Mara's mediation ("she mediated like a conductor"). The tightening is more additive than narrowing; no live option is foreclosed, no visible tradeoff costs Mara personally. The resolution unfolds as planned without setback, and the "weeks passed" ellipsis summarizes the labor rather than dramatizing a moment where success was uncertain.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.6)
    One dominant stake is signaled early: excavate abandoned dreams through neural interface. Pressure escalates when the device cross-wires with the canyon's field, entangling many dreams instead of one, forcing Lio to choose between stabilizing (engineer instinct) and surrendering (new ambition). The turn—adjusting the periscope toward his own reflection and allowing filaments to reshape—narrows options with visible cost: he becomes the archive, accepting others' unfinished plans alongside his own aborted intentions. The canyon's calming and the "weight of finally belonging" make the price legible. Agency is clear; the resolution flows from his decision to trust the system rather than control it.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: to find and parse the forgotten combinations before the hour expires. Pressure accumulates through threshold crossings and the chains' assessment, culminating in the codex reveal. One meaningful tightening occurs when the chains dissolve, granting access with the cost of proving his "tempered fire." The archivist's agency is limited to reading and returning; no on-page reversal forces a trade-off between competing goods. Cost is conceptual (he now holds dangerous knowledge), legible in "watchful stars" settling "behind his eyes," but the lack of a contested choice or visible sacrifice caps the score below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake ("create music in a silent world") is signaled in line 7 and drives every beat. One meaningful tightening occurs when Lio and Ina strum the copper together—the grove's unified motion ("each living thing responding with minute adjustments") narrows options from solo experiment to collective empathy. Cost is visible: exhaustion, sinking to the ground, and the hedgehog curling again bracket the expenditure. Agency resides in Lio's decision to place Ina's fingers on the copper and the shared strumming act that transforms the grove. The resolution is earned by prior setup (sculpture cracks, living instruments, copper threading) rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—reshape the eclipsed covenant before the moon's next phase or lose closure forever—is signaled early and tightens when the hum resolves into the covenant's language. One meaningful deepening: Oren's realization that canceling the covenant outright would unravel peace shifts his goal from erasure to gentle reshaping, narrowing options with visible cost (he must accept being "positioned differently" rather than absolved). The final whispered prayer is an act of agency that alters the covenant's stance, foreclosing absolution but opening a path for beauty in difficulty. Escalation is driven by protagonist choice under the Accumulative lens; coincidence (moon phase, astronomer's whisper) complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake signaled early: catalog silences before fireworks erase them. Pressure tightens through the receding soundscape and the escalating confrontation with the diary. The final tightening—turning the microphone toward the journal, hearing its "texture," then unclasping—is driven by Elias's agency and alters his years-long stance with visible cost (facing the grief and anger he's avoided). No explicit antagonist; pressure is situational (time) and internal (avoidance vs. need). One beat: the leap from "hearing the texture" to the empathy realization feels slightly compressed but remains plausible under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (line 10: elders' descent decision) and Liora's seed represents an alternative answer. Escalation under the Accumulative/Textural lens reads as a meaningful tightening: Maru's challenge → Liora's counter-argument invoking fear and undercurrent wisdom → permission with watchers and notebooks, forecloses easy refusal. The final planting narrows the village's future options (now they must "listen" as the flower speaks). Cost is legible: Liora must climb "higher still" under watchers' scrutiny, and the village inhales in collective waiting—the outcome remains charged and irreversible. No reversals are required in this lens; the single deepening and crystallization suffice. Agency is hers: she argues, climbs, and plants with visible risk ("if this flower speaks"). Minor note: the elders' internal reasoning remains opaque, but their surrender to "something the wind already knew" provides sufficient friction.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—finding the source of resilience—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: Lio crosses terraces, passes the forbidden grove threshold, and the water's transformative properties deepen mystery until the arrow reveals defiant intention. One meaningful tightening occurs when he crosses into the hollow and sound vanishes, raising cost through disorientation. However, the arrow's discovery is observational; Lio's agency does not narrow options or force a trade-off on the page. The ending reweights understanding but lacks a visible price paid in the closure beat, capping high-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—preventing future "singular convergence"—is signaled early and tightens as the investigator's model refuses to resolve, forcing the ground survey. One meaningful deepening: the realization that "air in cities is as capricious as crowds" narrows the problem from faulty logs to systemic oversight. Agency is enacted through renunciation (protocol versus experience) and endurance (the meticulous cataloging). Cost is felt: the flight engineer's death and the investigator's solitary vigil. Minor slip: the investigator's competence faces little friction; the path from mystery to insight feels more methodical than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: to catch and certify sculpted hush before the world forgets. The tightening occurs when the chisel falls and the cavern inhales, forcing Ilen's release; one meaningful pressure point is sufficient at this length. Agency is enacted through the decision to release the note at the precise instant, though the anticipated nature of the task reduces felt trade-off. The cost is conceptual—wonder's essentiality is demonstrated—but the protagonist's personal price remains oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: understanding why the flute (and he) failed, signaled early. Pressure tightens in the amphitheater when Cael realizes "he had never once touched it without an audience" and that "all his years...he had treated the instrument as a doorway, never as a listener." This deepening is driven by protagonist agency (the choice to uncase the flute and speak to it) and narrows his options from seeking external absolution to confronting internal misuse of duty. The cost is legible: he plays "not to bridge worlds...but simply to offer a sound," forecloses the guardian role, and accepts an imperfect note with visible emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—understanding the mathematics of emotion—is signaled early and tightens when Mara instructs the narrator to "choose a feeling you cannot solve." Agency is clear: the narrator selects the unsolvable moment, pulls the lever, and touches the halo fragment, each step narrowing options and raising cost. The printed geometry complicates the goal by offering not comprehension but transposed empathy, and the final cost is felt: "the sudden triviality of my old, tidy grief" forecloses the narrator's prior framework. Escalation is driven by protagonist choice under the Accumulative lens; pressure coheres through the sequence of actions and deepens at the touch of the halo.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: understanding Ralen's cryptic instruction and the pendant's purpose, signaled early via the mentor's absence and the dragonfly mystery. The aurora's unexpected brightness provides the complication; the pendant's vibration and the courier's choice to kneel and commit to extended encounters constitute the meaningful tightening with visible cost (occupational efficiency sacrificed). Agency is renunciation: the courier forecloses the jittery courier mode for wonder-cultivation. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens as each reflection adds weight until the stance crystallizes.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: to prove that objects absorb emotions. One meaningful tightening occurs at the frost-reading beat, where the protagonist sees proof but realizes "no instrument but myself" can verify it, narrowing options to subjective testimony. The door-to-door sequence applies this insight with visible cost (people stare at possessions "as though meeting abandoned relatives"), yet the escalation remains accumulative rather than decisively confrontational. Agency is present—the protagonist chooses to tell "truthful lies"—but the final reconfiguration is more stance crystallization than a choice that forecloses a live path with on-page consequence, capping entry into the 8+ range.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—carrying a message to Haru—is signaled early and tightens when Nari realizes the puzzle demands the tapestry as payment. The choice to feed the threads is protagonist-driven agency with visible cost: "the loom stood bare and skeletal." One clear reversal (puzzle as loom turned sideways) and a final act that forecloses the prior path. The escalation is textural and causal; the price is unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—coaxing resilience from a calcifying world—is signaled early and tightens through accumulation: farmers' hollow stares, bartered awakenings, then Corren's underground discovery of fused village losses. The silk's yank and the pile's trembling attempts to rise constitute the key reversal, and Corren's low, deliberate speech to stone is the agency beat that enables the lattice transformation. Cost is legible: he feels like "a wire strung tight," risking his body to the arches' force. Weakness: the escalation is more textural than causal; the middle mine-mapping section adds density without narrowing options or raising immediate stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—breaking the cycle of repetition and self-abdication—is signaled early and tightens when Lio grasps the shard and chooses to "cut loose the binding threads" rather than "snap back into the comfort of repetition." That moment narrows options with visible cost (foreclosing all parallel Lios who turned away). The escalation is conceptual rather than scene-driven; the corridor sequence tells us about alternate paths without embodying a tactical trade-off, and no secondary loss (stamina, resource) appears to alter later moves.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: who will protect the community now that the light is gone. The discovery of the anonymous letters is a clear tightening that narrows Elias's options from routine delivery to custodial decision. His agency—rearranging stones, writing the unsigned letter, placing it under the glass—forecloses his invisibility with visible cost: he steps from shadow into covenant. The second letter's question ("Who will protect us now") directly escalates pressure. No antagonist required; the void left by the extinguished lamp supplies situational pressure. The final scuffing of stones to signal "safe" is a micro-turn that completes the earned stance shift.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake signaled early: Orrin's obsolete routine versus the lighthouse's invitation to "steer something else entirely." The hum introduces one meaningful tightening—it wakes him, straightens the reflections into his own handwriting, and thickens the beam into an invitation. The final choice to "tilt hoarded shadows" is driven by Orrin's agency and the lighthouse's decades-long listening. Visible cost: abandoning the fading curiosity of seagulls and dead shipping lanes to aim at "unused futures." The trade-off between lost print-newspaper mornings and algorithmic feeds sharpens the peak choice. Pressure accumulates through the Accumulative lens without requiring multiple reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—learning why some people magnetize stories—is signaled early and governs all three encounters. Pressure accumulates through the patron confessions, each one adding weight ("the sense of quietly explosive pressure swelled behind his ribs"), and the wing-reveal beat deepens understanding by reframing magnetism as mirroring. The protagonist's agency is primarily perceptual rather than decisional; he observes and realizes but does not make a choice that narrows options or incurs visible cost. One meaningful tightening occurs (the final realization), sufficient for this length under an Accumulative lens, but the lack of a costly trade-off or foreclosed path keeps it mid-7s.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: discovering what trees witness. The labyrinth's inhale and pin-drop create immediate pressure; Milo's decision to take the sextant and climb escalates agency. The sextant's healing and subsequent mapping of tree memories provides one meaningful tightening that narrows his task to deconstruction. The final act of recording carries visible cost—he sits alone among trees at dawn, his solitary habit now formalized into duty. No antagonist required; the maze's opinion and the storm's departure frame situational pressure that culminates in a stance crystallization (recording forgiveness).

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—rekindling a dying realm—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the Silence Years backstory and the image of people pressed against darkness. The tightening occurs when Mara decides to sing the memories back, narrowing options from continued swaddling to painful awakening. Cost is legible: the realm "shudders" and Mara's satchel empties, foreclosing her role as keeper. However, the escalation mechanism is internal revelation rather than on-page opposition; coincidence (the shard's inherent power) enables the resolution without testing Mara's agency against a resistant force.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: whether Elias will confront his brother's death or continue his "compassionate recluse" holding pattern. The hidden library invitation declares "We require one who listens"; Mara's accusation "you have only been dusting the shelves" tightens pressure; the gray volume with his brother's name forces the confrontation. The voicemail reveal—his brother "joking that if Elias did not answer soon, he would simply come over"—narrows the past's meaning and the tears function as release with visible cost (washing space for a different future). Escalation is clean under the Accumulative lens; one meaningful deepening occurs when Elias opens the book and the imagined recriminations collapse into simpler trust. Mara's off-schedule arrival is coincidence used to complicate, not resolve, which is permissible.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: can Elias resolve his complicity through the act of witnessing and sharing the bread? The pressure is situational and accumulative: the tea mistress's questions ("You think you could have stopped it," "Is noticing anything more than an excuse") tighten his dilemma without offering escape. The tightening is meaningful: unwrapping the loaf forces him to articulate his fantasy of self-forgiveness, and the tea mistress's response ("You are letting it be witnessed, and sharing is a form of direction, if not control") reframes the stakes from absolution to modest agency. The resolution is earned by his choice to bring the bread and eat it communally, foreclosing the comfort of symbolic preservation. Cost is visible: "Nothing miraculous happens, which feels like the closest thing to honesty either of them can manage."

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—library's survival versus founders' forgotten motive—signals early and tightens when decay accelerates beyond projections. Serin's agency drives escalation: he reads vows aloud to stabilize them, realizes meaning must be reimagined continually, then braids his own vow through theirs. The final choice trades risk (severing equations) for a sustainable pulse, forecloses mere technical repair, and the cost is legible on the page: "if he tried to rewrite… he risked severing the ancient equations." One micro-turn (graphs flicker, then level) deepens understanding without multiplying reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—capturing the sound of trust breaking—is signaled early and drives the transaction and revelation. The escalation operates through Loretta's agency: she seeks out the woman, pays coin, asks the hard question, and chooses to stay. The tightening occurs when the fob delivers not words but "the tiny pause before his knuckles tapped the duffel, not the bedroom," a moment that narrows her understanding with visible emotional cost. Under the Accumulative lens, this single deepening suffices for the length, though a second reversal would have elevated the band further.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: learning why some people carry weather. The ring's pull leads the protagonist to the weather-bearers, who explain the archive burden and request help with letting go—this tightens options and introduces a trade-off (doubt-as-lens applied to collective remembering). However, the escalation is expository rather than action-driven; the weather-bearers narrate the problem, and the protagonist's acceptance is signaled obliquely ("answered without words"). One on-page tightening occurs when the ring melts into skin, foreclosing retreat. Cost is legible but felt more as atmosphere than as a specific forfeiture. No clear antagonist; coincidence (four strangers waiting) complicates without resolving, consistent with Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—rectifying the unfinished portrait and answering the inescapable calling—is signaled early and tightens when Elias lifts the self-portrait to reveal Mara's half-formed face. The meaningful deepening occurs when he draws her eyes: "tears streak the dust on his face and blur the lines," a visible cost that narrows his options from perpetual avoidance to completion-then-re-sealing. The broken lock's return at closure ("threads the broken combination lock through the wire") forecloses the path of openness with felt cost. Agency is clear: descent, painting, and re-locking are all protagonist-driven choices. However, the story could benefit from a sharper secondary pressure or complication in the middle beats; the trajectory from descent to completion is relatively linear once he enters the cave.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—finding where lost conversations go—is signaled early and tightens through the map assembly and the walk to the observatory. Lio's choice to pack his tools and venture into the sealed space is motivated by prior pressure, but the escalation is accumulative (density increase) rather than a sharp reversal. The ending crystallizes options (he will hear what the city tried not to say) with atmospheric cost, but the cost is felt rather than paid in a visible forfeiture. One meaningful deepening is present under the Accumulative lens; agency is present but leans observational at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: preserve the color of wonder before it drains from the shard. The girl's arrival tightens pressure by bringing the impossible fragment on Lio's last speaking day. One meaningful deepening occurs when Lio climbs the tower and carves the cradle—his micro-choices (measuring intervals, balancing the silver loop) narrow options and the sculpture's answer reweights the valley's sorrow. Cost is visible in Lio's surrendered voice and the girl's kneeling tears, though the resolution feels smooth rather than wrenching. Escalation reads as accumulative density and cadence shift under the Textural lens; no causal reversal is required, yet the single tightening is legible and alters the final image's charge.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake signaled early: resolve the static by managing the archived fears. One meaningful tightening occurs when the next magnetic lurch triggers the burn sequence, forcing immediate choice under external pressure. The protagonist's agency drives escalation: rerouting power, opening the crate, compressing nightmares, triggering the partition—all deliberate acts with visible cost ("Some losses would trouble the human supervisors"). The controlled-burn metaphor shapes tactics throughout, deepening from concept to physical execution that reweights both his internal state and the rose ecology.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—preserving the courtyard against gentrification—is signaled early and sustained. The escalation is Accumulative: locket arrival → circle convening → collective storytelling → mailbox opening → document validation. Each beat narrows options toward a single historical artifact. The tightening is meaningful but distributed across the community rather than concentrated in Mara's hands. The cost (legal documents vs. developers) is conceptual and occurs off-page; the final summary ("people said Mara had saved the place, as if alone") gestures at irony but does not dramatize a forfeited path or visible price in the closure beat itself.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake signaled early: retrieve the journals to understand Dr. Ara Quinn's encryption and liberate her work. The tightening occurs when the protagonist realizes "the true project had never been the lab" but teaching it to listen—this reweights options from data retrieval to active liberation. The final move (adding coded notes to teach servers a new rhythm) is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens. However, the visible price paid is muted: we see the action ("I added my own notes") but not a dramatized cost that forecloses a path—no handler confrontation, no stamina drain, no tactical trade-off made legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—find where deleted memories go—is signaled early and drives the notebook documentation, the brewing of coffee, and the final crystal experiment. One meaningful deepening: the realization that "what he had read was never weather, but the shifting gravity of forgetting" reweights the father's practice from superstition to investigative tool, narrowing options to exhumation via the salt apparatus. The cost is legible: the narrator must adopt the discredited divination and face isolation in "that gleaming silence." The whale as metaphorical plug creates coherent pressure (lanterns fail, crystals pulse, neighbors lose time). No antagonist, but situational pressure accumulates under the Accumulative lens. Agency is clear in the decision to brew and read grounds, an act of renunciation (abandoning skepticism) with visible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (hush the prophecy before fear recruits kingdoms) is signaled early and drives all moves. One meaningful tightening: Ilen's chant narrows options from preparation to erasure, and the cost (weight in bones, lightness in air) is visible on-page. Agency is renunciation with visible price. The visions of taverns, barracks, children create concrete pressure and the dissolution of each thread compounds cost. Under Accumulative lens, the deepening reweights stakes with felt cost. Coincidence does not resolve; Ilen's sustained effort does.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—to learn the building's language before demolition—is signaled early and drives the weekly ritual. The meteor-shower night provides one meaningful tightening: the seal's symbols rearrange, the building speaks, and the narrator must reconcile its truths with its denials. Agency is present but cerebral: the narrator chooses to close fingers around the seal and "listen for the next story," an act of endurance with conceptual cost. The pressure is more philosophical than urgent; no live countdown to demolition or competing choice forces a sharper trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Neris can confront her quarantined guilt rather than hide from it—is signaled early and tightens when the seashell vision forces her to choose between dropping it or seeking proof. The caretaker's question "what are you quarantining from yourself" is the key pressure point that narrows options and leads to her decision to "learn to listen without running." Agency is clear: she chooses to study what she has locked away, translating isolation into independence with the visible cost that she does not yet forgive herself but must map the guilt's terrain. One meaningful tightening drives the arc under a Causal lens with accumulative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: save the eastern scholars and unlink Irian's name from the king's shadow, signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Sevran discovers the forgery, forcing Irian to either flee or commit fully. The final choice—signing in his own hand—narrows all future options and carries visible cost (exposure of every prior forgery, likely execution). Agency is clear: Irian's decision, not coincidence, drives the resolution. The price is legible in "each stroke no longer borrowed but born," and the scholars' fate hinges on this act.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—why her sister's voice stopped—is signaled early and drives Liora's choice to sing where no law applies. Pressure accumulates through the progressive disclosure of echoes, and the climactic flood of voices forces her to relinquish blame, a meaningful tightening with felt cost. Agency is clear: she chooses to listen rather than demand, and the final act of singing "as witness rather than judge" forecloses the path of forcing the stone to answer. One small deduction: the resolution leans slightly toward realization over enacted choice in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the woman will expose her family's buried complicity—is signaled and tightens through Marek's revelation and her question about vengeance versus "something else." The ending narrows her options to confession and restitution with conceptual cost. However, the escalation occurs largely in Marek's summary of dream-stitching rather than through on-page reversals or the woman's active resistance, and no visible price (loss of time, relationship rupture, renounced inheritance) is paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—learning to appreciate hidden effort and resist the brother's dismissal—is signaled early and tightens when the narrator asks "how do I find it before everyone laughs me from the pier." The droplet exercise is the key tightening; most drops fall short, but the few that land reward micro-agency and narrow the question from abstract to embodied. The final acceptance forecloses the path of seeking external praise, a visible trade-off scaled to this length. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; no reversal is required, and the ending deepens rather than pivots.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake signaled early: verify the fruit vs. excavate buried truth. One meaningful tightening occurs when Theo recognizes the diamond as both key and imprint, reweighting the Committee's intent. His final decision—withhold the diamond—narrows options with on-page cost: orchard dependents will starve. Agency is decision under causal pressure. The stakes briefly telescope (governance of regions) but refocus on immediate survivors, keeping the scale grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—shaping a new dawn from ancient transmissions—is signaled early and tightens when the voice demands "variant allegiance" and the portico test. The pressure deepens via the voice's escalating specificity (moving from static to direct address to the final command) and Ilen's memory of childhood darkness, which reweights his present stance. The cost is legible in the final image: he stands exposed, uncertain if rising or falling, but committed to a bargain whose full price is felt. One mild deduction: the escalation is somewhat linear accumulation rather than a sharp reversal or fork that forces a visible trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: the poet's longing to translate between generations, signaled early ("he dreamed to become the translator") and tested on the page when the woman asks what her grandchildren do not understand. One meaningful tightening: the poet shifts from penny-trading curiosity collector to gift-giver, forfeiting coin and solitude. The woman's arrival is coincidence but complicates rather than resolves; the poet's agency (choosing not to name a price, blending jars, stepping toward town) drives the turn. Escalation reads as accumulative deepening under the chosen lens: the music box triggers memory, the woman's confession adds generational friction, the braided chorus enacts bridge-building. Visible cost: empty pockets, leaving the loft's shelter, "loosen[ing] like an old knot" implies relinquished self-protection. No false reversals; pressure coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake is signaled early and clearly: protect the sacred artifact from awakening under the fleeting sunset. One meaningful tightening occurs when the binding note drifts, forcing Elias to adapt the rite—a protagonist-driven escalation that narrows options (memorized chant no longer works). The humming, the warped frequency, and the need for "vibrational matching" all cohere under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the risk ("more flexible, more dangerous") and the physical strain ("molars buzzing," "thoughts shivering"), though a second reversal or a more explicit trade-off would elevate this further.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: learning to sculpt patience to address cities "cracking under their own hurry." Pressure accumulates through the three days of seemingly pointless tasks, tightening the protagonist's impatience until the viaduct scene reweights the frame. The basin revelation narrows options by offering a specific tactic (calm delay as resistance), and the protagonist's final walk embodies the shift. However, the escalation is textural rather than event-driven; one moment of genuine trade-off or refusal before the viaduct would strengthen the arc. Cost is legible but largely conceptual—the protagonist must relinquish speed as courage.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (whether to continue signing preventable deaths as unavoidable) is signaled early and tightens through the overlapping apparitions. One meaningful turn: the appearance of the two men forces the protagonist to confront his complicity. Agency is present as the decision to "write what I saw here, exactly as it was," though this remains intention rather than completed action. The cost is conceptual and professional (budget, job security) but legible on the page. Escalation is coherent under the Hybrid lens, moving from supervisor's pressure to direct confrontation with past victims.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake signaled early: whether Elias deserves to guide Jonah's parole choice. The tightening occurs when Mara straightens the bent tooth and reframes the question from Jonah's deservingness to Elias's willingness to stand beside the outcome, narrowing options with visible cost (he must now act on incomplete certainty). The escalation is driven by Elias's agency—he chose to bring the heart to Mara—and the final trade-off (silence vs. advocacy) is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: help the Algorithm launch the arrow and ring the unheard bell. The story tightens once when Orin learns his trajectory was manipulated ("stung"), then deepens when he accepts the mission ("Fine... I will point myself at whatever comes next"). The launch sequence narrows options (he "dove for it" through the tunnel) and the arrow's vibration "aligning every reckless yearning" suggests internal escalation. However, the turn from sting to acceptance lacks visible trade-off; Orin's agency reads as willing compliance rather than a choice that forecloses another live option. Cost at closure is oblique: the world upgrades, but what Orin loses or risks remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (finding Ora/understanding 713) is clear early and tightens through pattern-tracing, account-orbiting discovery, and the spoofed audit. One meaningful escalation occurs when the narrator moves from passive observation to active boundary-crossing (the query "that should not exist"). The final discovery narrows options with conceptual cost (complicity, forbidden knowledge). However, the climactic beat—writing the impossible query—feels compressed; we don't inhabit the risk or see immediate consequence, only the result.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake: prevent the orchard from becoming the Keepers' excuse for war. Pressure tightens when the mirrors show burned orchard and refugee ships, then Ira's complicity, forcing his proposal to "reconstitute the accord...not to own this orchard but to recognize it as a deciding voice." The anomaly's resistance ("The Keepers will never agree") and shadow lean create a micro-turn. Agency is clear: Ira lifts the fragment and experiments with reflections, cataloging reactions to shape the new treaty. Cost is visible in the anomaly's eased shoulders vs. tightened jaw and in Ira's acceptance that he must "show them" rather than enforce. One meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—learning the sound of approaching endings to understand why survival felt wrong—is signaled early and braided with the suicide plan. Pressure accumulates through cataloging (repairable/recyclable/irretrievable as rehearsal), Runa's key, and the solo boat trip. The vibration discovery is a tightening that narrows options: the protagonist must now choose between the clinic's certainty and "everything choosing…not to end just yet." Cost is on the page (forfeiting the legal death, accepting ambiguity). One micro turn (Runa's forecast) sets up the final beat without diluting the dominant arc.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake: the woman's escape/return decision. One tightening occurs when Tomas offers the burnt fragment and reframes her lateness, narrowing her stance from regret to reconsideration. However, her reversal is more contemplated than acted upon; the story ends with Tomas "keeping watch" rather than the woman choosing a next step with on-page cost. The escalation is more thematic deepening than causal pressure—no live clock forces a decision, no bus schedule looms. The vineyard/press metaphor and "rhyme instead of overlap" are elegant but remain conversational rather than a trade-off that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving wisdom's echo to prevent the parapet from breaching—is signaled early and drives all subsequent beats. Pressure accumulates through the parapet's grinding (tracked across the mother's question, the merchant's ledger-building, and the final stilling), and the line walker's near-fall supplies a visceral cost. The whispered intervention is protagonist-driven and narrows options: the prophet must name cruelties, not merely predict futures. The merchant's mirror-moment forecloses his denial with visible cost (sagging shoulders, ledger collapse), and the final image (parapet asleep, dunes resting) registers the price paid and the new equilibrium earned.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: catalog community grief before bulldozing. The tightening is visible—first visitor (one boy) expands to crowded table to neighbors reading each other's fragments—and the protagonist's agency shifts from listening/labeling to facilitating communal puzzle-building with felt cost (loss of professional detachment). One meaningful deepening (individual → collective) suffices at this length. The escalation is driven by accumulation rather than causal reversals, consistent with the Accumulative lens, and the final recognition ("healing threaded through lavender air") reweights the task with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: whether Elias will testify loyally or resist the council's erasure of "grow." Pressure tightens when the courier's note arrives, forcing him to choose between hiding and shaping testimony. The crystal-voices deepen his understanding, revealing that "growth did not move in straight lines," which forecloses the option of linear testimony and narrows his path to fractured resistance. The final beat—"descended the ladder, the suspended hush followed… a barely audible armor"—delivers visible cost (fear, loss of safety) and reconfigures his stance from reticent cataloger to active witness under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: locating "the sound of growing older." The narrator follows driftwood arrows, meets Mara, walks into fog, and finds the sound together—one meaningful tightening that narrows the search to a specific convergence point. Agency is present (the walk, kneeling to listen) and the discovery alters understanding: "we were listening to our lives laboring to keep up." Cost is felt (they become "the kind of people" who bring tapes to prophets) but remains abstract rather than a visible forfeiture or tactical tradeoff on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: capture the stellar death before it evaporates, or the observatory becomes "only another crater." Escalation occurs when the quake peaks and Ilias must choose between protocol (lock down, lose data) and risk (bypass filters, possibly break equipment). His agency—overriding locks, restructuring circuitry—drives the tightening under Situational/Accumulative pressure. The cost is visible: "risk breaking the tool that reached for it," staff protests ignored, tremor in his knees echoing the foundation's tremor. One meaningful choice narrows options and charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: to execute a flawless goodbye (signaled early via Mira's reflection). Pressure tightens when Mr. Alvarez nods at the unopened lab results, forecloses the medical frame, and requests the mundane hymn—a choice that narrows options to ritual rather than diagnosis. The song itself becomes the escalation: as he sings in a "breathy half-voice," the room changes, and "all the versions of him...seemed to reunify." Cost is visible in the acknowledgment ("We already know what they say") and the final silence that knows what has been said. One meaningful tightening occurs; the protagonist's agency (Mira's giving the vinyl fragment, playing the song) drives the closure. Coincidence does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—finding where shadows go at noon—signals early and tightens through one meaningful turn: Lysa's decision to use the forbidden key despite months of fearful study. The rune-phrase correction under pressure narrows options (she whispers it "not as she had been taught, but corrected by her months of secret doubt"). Agency is clear: her rebellion and precision enable the awakening. Cost is visible in the final image: "something in her opened…into a disciplined, terrifying freedom," foreclosing her prior reverent safety. Escalation could be slightly sharper—more tactical resistance or immediate consequence would lift this into high-8s.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will accept doubt and finish Tomas's rescue—is signaled early and tightens when the tooth opens the doorway, forcing a choice between skepticism and action. Agency is clear: Mara's decision to step through and perform the bone-setting forecloses the path of refusal with on-page cost (the garden folds away, the substitute body crumbles). One meaningful reversal occurs when the tooth transforms from artifact to active conduit. Coincidence does not resolve; Mara's skill and choice drive the ending. The cost is legible: she becomes the miracle-worker she mistrusted.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—sharing light without fire—signals early ("sworn to map light that never burns") and tightens through the memory of raids, then deepens when the narrator approaches waiting refugees. The escalation is accumulative: each polished shard gathers pressure until the basin "brims with a shy galaxy." Agency is decision and endurance with visible cost: the narrator returns nightly "because I never found her again," foreclosing personal closure to serve others. The final act—opening the cloth—crystallizes the vow with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—grafting new meaning onto old wounds—is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful deepening: Mara's progression from paralyzed exposure ("the whole world knows my worst night") to kneeling beside Eli and pressing moss starters into soil at "the worst wounds first." The choice forecloses passivity with visible cost: soaking knees, trembling voice, the ache in her chest that "loosen[s], not healed, not forgiven, just slightly less alone." Agency is clear (her decision to come, to kneel, to shape the garden), and Eli's invitation ("your story changed this place, so shape it") applies immediate pressure that Mara must answer. Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the escalation reads as a cadence shift—from exposure and dissection to collaborative, quiet action—that reweights the stake with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—whether the novelist will "let them arrive somewhere"—is signaled but remains abstract. Pressure accumulates through the narrator's confrontation and the visions, but the novelist's agency is passive: he listens and realizes rather than choosing with visible tradeoff. The visions show consequences of past refusals but do not create a present dilemma that narrows options. No on-page renunciation or endurance forecloses a path with felt cost; the ending reweights meaning conceptually but lacks a dramatized decision or price.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—restore sacred practices without returning to cruelties—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the tinkerer's listening, humming, then singing, villagers arriving, and phrases captured in the bowl. One tightening: the copper bowl glows and he pours the phrases into roots, causing immediate transformation. Yet the escalation is more additive than knife-edged; no reversal or trade-off narrows options. The resolution arrives through the tinkerer's action, but what did he or the villagers risk or lose? Generic scene consequence (tree blooms, wells clear) without a visible price that alters later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—translating the world's dying heartbeat into maps for absent travelers—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the starlight drop aligns with the planetary pulse and seals the twig-pattern into a coherent figure, narrowing his task from scattering fragments to capturing resonance. Agency is renunciation with cost: he works knowing "there were no others now," accepting solitary labor as enough. The piece demonstrates accumulative pressure through density increase (gathering, patterning, starlight release, diagram study, map preservation) rather than causal reversals, fitting the inferred lens. Cost is felt in "making the very air acknowledge his patient craft" for travelers who may never come.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—restore the timer to store wonder for a wounded season—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure remains coherent but does not meaningfully tighten options; the locksmith proceeds methodically without a live risk of failure or a forced trade-off. The final act (winding the new spring, adding mirrors) feels like completion rather than a choice that narrows paths. Cost at closure is conceptual (the city's thinning memory) but not viscerally felt as a price the locksmith pays on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding the angles that let pain loosen—is signaled early and coheres throughout. One meaningful tightening: the protagonist's own burden emerges ("heavier than any I had ever coaxed") and threatens to calcify her chest, forcing the climactic choice to orient toward it. The decision to lift the lamp higher and join her fear to the fractal dance narrows options with visible cost: she will carry the same weight, only transformed. Agency is clear—protagonist's choice to orient rather than flee earns the resolution. No second reversal is required at this length; the single deepening suffices under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether to carve (engage forward motion) or preserve the pause (contain grief)—is signaled early and tightens through embodied hesitation: whitening knuckles, rolling the blank, considering then rejecting forms. The kettle's boil-and-cool cycle provides a pressure clock. The escalation is Accumulative: density increases as memory of Luca's practicality reweights her stance, enabling the knife stroke. Cost is legible in the forfeiture of stasis and the opening of the wood. No explicit antagonist needed; the choice itself carries visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—negotiating with one's own ghost to resolve chronological confusion and eroded ambitions—is signaled early and pursued through every beat. Pressure accumulates via the Accumulative lens: each scavenged relic tightens the protagonist's burden until the ghost's critique ("fed on echoes") forces the choice to surrender. The final surrender forecloses the scavenging path with visible cost (pockets emptied, weight transferred). Agency is present but mediated: the protagonist rows, offers, but the ghost's absorption does the final work. One meaningful deepening occurs when the ghost rejects the fragments as "rusts worth of other peoples eroded ambitions," narrowing options to genuine offering or continued orbit.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—resurrecting the terminal through redirected purpose—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: linking restroom drains to planters narrows her options to quiet, unseen care. Escalation is consistent with the Accumulative lens but passive; Mira's decisions are enacted without opposition or a moment when she risks abandoning the project. The cost is conceptual (invisible labor, no audience) but legible. No antagonist required, yet the lack of a live friction point keeps pressure moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will remain passive or re-engage with his abandoned dream—is signaled early and tightens when the slipping gear forces a choice. The escalation is Accumulative: the sound recalls his father's death, heightening urgency, and Elias's hands "remember" in an on-page reversal that narrows options (repair or endure the cough indefinitely). Agency is clear: his decision to unlatch the glass and coax the gears forecloses the path of pure witnessing, with felt cost in the risk of reproach and the confrontation with his own failure. The sanctuary's rule ("clocks were to be witnessed, not mended") provides external pressure, and the resolution—accepting both repair and record-keeping as forms of care—emerges from protagonist choice rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—understanding the architecture of lies versus maintaining comfortable disbelief—is signaled in the opening third and escalates through the protagonist's agency. The dive is a voluntary risk; discovering the blueprints forces a trade-off (salvage capacity for disbelief vs. expose the truth), and the final refusal to hand over the satchel narrows options with visible cost: "dangerous honesty" and the men's narrowed eyes mark the price. One meaningful tightening (documents prove deceit) drives the closure choice, and the rope tug creates mid-scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (to preserve ancient methods by learning secret weavers' art) is signaled early and tightens when Eli realizes stories have fled into hemp. The rope-decoding beat narrows his understanding and forces a shift from passive collection to active listening. The woman's arrival provides a turn—her instruction reweights his approach, demanding gentleness and purpose. Cost is present (he must alter his methods, tend cord as well as seed) but felt rather than decisive; no live option is visibly foreclosed, only deepened. Under Accumulative lens, one meaningful pressure-point (the knot revelation) suffices, but the escalation remains contemplative rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding Sera's absences to write her "obituary"—is signaled early and tightens when Sera reframes the task from documentation to shared excursion ("Help me walk it"). The narrator's agency crystallizes in that acceptance, which forecloses the stance of detached observer with visible cost (professional distance). One meaningful deepening occurs on the garden walk when Sera names each place by its pain, transforming abstract "explained absences" into tactile geography. Under the accumulative lens, pressure accumulates through sensory and thematic density rather than overt reversals, and the final image reweights the narrator's role from scribe to witness-participant.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: the prince's role approving fantasy campaigns versus genuine possibility. The egg's arrival tightens pressure by offering a tangible alternative to simulated worlds. One clear reversal: the prince moves from passive approval to active defiance ("We will not smelt it"). The cost is explicit and forecloses a path: breaking syndicate laws, risking contamination, and abandoning his sanctioned role. Agency is decision with visible price. Philosophers and biologist apply credible opposition, raising stakes through protest and warning.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—saving the boy while honoring compassion over her father's crimes—is signaled early and tightens when she must "turn her back on the flame for a moment." The calculus ("water, distance, wind") and her choice to carry both voices show agency under pressure. The fire's advance provides escalating threat, and her decision to thread the coin visibly forecloses a path (she can never reclaim that last possession). Cost is legible, though the water-crew arrival deflates the physical danger slightly before full resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—liberating trapped memories—is signaled early and drives Lira's investigation across multiple beats. Pressure accumulates as anomalies lead to the working fountain, then to the underground box, with the city itself beginning to "remember being afraid." The climax demands a visible price: Lira must pour her skepticism in to shatter the box, foreclosing her identity as guarded doubter. One meaningful tightening occurs when she realizes "every fountain was a lock and every lost moment a key." The escalation reads cleanly under the Accumulative lens, though the box's mechanics—why skepticism specifically is the required currency—feel slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: whether tending light without fire can break generational patterns of burning. One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist glimpses "familiar constellations forming in the distance"—patterns of cruelty repeating—which raises the cost of continued exile by making success uncertain. The final choice to keep "teaching each newborn sun that shining is not the same as burning" narrows options (commits to the work despite doubt) with felt cost visible in the conditional "perhaps" that admits the pattern may not shift. Agency is endurance with visible friction: the protagonist actively prunes while questioning effectiveness, a stance that forecloses retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is established early: Elias seeks "the shape of collective grief" and "how all the losses braided together beneath the surface." Pressure accumulates through the grandmother's directive to carve secret verses for each death, threading the ribbon as a map. The retracing walk is the decisive tightening: reading hidden words aloud summons "an answering murmur...a shared ache changing shape." The butterflies' synchronized rise serves as the final turn, reweighting the solitary act into communal gesture. Cost is felt in Elias's sustained labor across the migration span and the exposure of private grief made public. One deduction: the grandmother's guarantee ("we will retrace") removes some uncertainty from the middle stretch.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—absolution through perfect timekeeping versus genuine stewardship—tightens meaningfully during the pendulum pause. The narrator's agency is clear: the decision to invite apprentices and share the rake handle forecloses solitary penance with visible cost. The "scorching" insight and the pendulum's resumed arc deliver escalation and a felt price. No convenience plotting; the brother's death anchors all pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: "everything that mattered happened after the chess clock runs down." The whisper-tug escalates through pocket warmth, silo climb, and tapestry alignment, culminating in the realization that the dead need living decisions, not flowers. The tightening is clear (whispers → climb → match → understand), and the conceptual cost—abandoning the comforting role of "blithe" maintainer—is legible. However, the protagonist's agency is primarily receptive (listening, climbing, receiving revelation) rather than a hard trade-off choice that forecloses a live option on the page, keeping this in the high 7s rather than 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear: map a future that doesn't sacrifice the unseen. Pressure coheres through the king's decree (negotiable before ink, binding after) and escalates when Elian's charcoal scenarios reveal famine-or-abandonment trade-offs. The discovery of the three-year thaw pattern reverses the either-or trap, creating a third path with visible cost (more labor, patience, no conquest). Agency is decision-based: Elian's predictive modeling choices narrow options, and the final act of opening the velvet box and lowering the nib forecloses retreat. The cost is legible on the page ("asked more," "did not require anyone to be buried") and the fierce joy signals a trade-off between certainty and ethics. One tightening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—teaching dust to remember stories—is signaled early and accumulates through the broadcast instructions and Lina's copying under pressure. The boy's arrival tightens by converting solitary conspiracy into shared witness, foreclosing isolation with the cost of exposure. One escalation gap: the pirate warning ("someone is coming") prompts Lina to hide pages, but the boy's entrance dissolves threat instantly without tactical friction, softening the turn's bite.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—crystallizing the mirage-of-safety emotion before it dissolves—is signaled early and coheres under the accumulative lens. Pressure accumulates through the ceremony's structure and the grandmother's masked presence, but there is no reversal or tightening choice that narrows Mara's options on the page; the ash scattering proceeds as planned without complication. The final moment reweights the stake (the audience's shared recognition of fragility), but the cost is conceptual rather than a visible forfeiture or tactical shift by the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: preserve ancient methods against the Council's erasure narrative. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens through repeated acts—digging the cog, scrubbing brass, testing tales—that deepen the narrator's commitment and isolate them further. One meaningful tightening: the Council's proclamations ("break everything complicated") force the narrator to articulate their rebellion as patience and preservation, foreclosing the path of communal acceptance. The cost is legible in "abrasive calm that scrapes against their cherished lies" and the final image of solitary digging. Agency reads as endurance (Earned Stasis variant) with visible social and relational cost.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (bridging ethnic/dialectal refusal) is signaled early and tightens through "the space between chairs shrank" and voices that "cracked on certain names," forcing micro-choices (waiting until tremor passes). The final beat—Dari and Ilan hovering over the zither, Maro placing it between them—narrows options with the tentative chord as a meaningful deepening that crystallizes stance. Cost is visible in the incremental erosion of barricades and the acknowledgment that "this was not forgiveness yet." One tightening point suffices for this length under Accumulative lens; escalation reads as cadence shift from group safety to dyadic risk.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—waking the greenhouse to feed the quarter—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Ariel swallows the seed and its warmth guides her planting choices, narrowing her options to this experiment with visible bodily cost (the seed lodged behind her breastbone). The alignment's light provides a ticking window, and the pruning/planting sequence under that pressure creates coherent escalation. Agency is clear: Ariel chooses to taste, swallow, and plant despite uncertainty. However, the final image ("something new had already taken their place") tells the outcome rather than dramatizing a live choice or visible consequence that forecloses a path, softening the pressure at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—preserve wonder versus fulfill duty—is signaled early and tightens when the riddle forces Marla to choose between reporting the sabotage and honoring the lesson. The boy's revelation that the city wakes only if "somebody like you" speaks narrows options with visible cost (her throat tightens, she "envied liars their delay"). Agency is clear: Marla's conditional assertion forecloses simple duty and crystallizes a new stance. Small deduction: the granddad's engineered condition feels slightly convenient—his off-stage setup resolves the conflict Marla did not help create—though the boy's framing mitigates this.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—understanding why houses feel alive—is signaled early and tightens when the dropped orris root forces a choice: retrieve or leave it, then move the bed into the "dense" corner. The accumulative pressure (cataloging patterns, sanctifying rituals, house breathing syncing) crescendos at the storm/drop beat, and Eli's response (shifting his weight into the house's sentence) narrows options with visible cost: he now sleeps inches from the altered corner, vulnerable to examination. One meaningful deepening with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: whether to release the secret as accusation or as question. Pressure coheres through the statue's fear ("failure would become her world's new certainty") and the visitor's counter-question ("Will you listen beyond the ampoule"). One meaningful tightening: the visitor's consent (pressing the column) forecloses passivity and triggers the flood. Agency is the statue's decision to open its mind fully and the visitor's choice to rise "with the current, ampoule against her heart." Cost is visible: the garden destroyed, the statue settling deeper, nuance unleashed without control over its interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: proving perpetual motion (and thus honoring effort alone) to capture the texture of a missed opportunity. The rupture at mid-story tightens options—Arin sees his alternate self who entered the doorway, the crack closes, and he realizes he cannot retrieve what might have been. Agency is renunciation with cost: he pockets the dice and commits to climbing, accepting "a world of doors he would never open." The mathematical proofs and dice rolls are active attempts (not passive observation), and the final choice forecloses the path of return. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: density increases through layered images (staircase, dice, notebook, crack) until the final beat crystallizes his stance. One meaningful deepening (the rupture and its closure) is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—proving strangers remember kindness—is signaled early and pursued through a single deliberate action. The piece delivers one meaningful deepening: the three parallel daydreams accumulate evidence and reweight the premise. However, Aurelia faces no opposition, reversal, or trade-off; the theory simply succeeds as designed. The escalation is textural (density of recalled kindness) rather than causal friction, which fits the lens but limits high-band reach.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (preserving dying arts versus witnessing vanishing) is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful reversal: Lira's command "look at us with it" shifts the narrator from detached cataloger to participant. The emerald-glass scene reveals ghostly crafts and guides Lira's whispered directive: "help us keep… in hands and throats, before… it thaws and runs back into the waterfall." Agency at closure is clear—staying to teach—with visible cost (abandoning extraction, accepting shared uncertainty). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; the protagonist's immersion deepens from arrival through kitchen encounter to lens-vision to final commitment. One friction: the war context and displaced-persons pressure are established but remain somewhat abstract; the on-page stakes center more on cultural transmission than immediate survival.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: "step beyond fate's design" by accessing the hunger stone's foresight. The dissection of the yoyo provides one meaningful tightening (rotating the shard to release rather than pool force), and the final casting escalates pressure with a visible cost—Aurek has engaged an irreversible mechanism with unknown consequence. Agency is clear throughout (descent, dissection, final action). Minor limitation: the middle beats (stair descent, yoyo discovery) feel more atmospheric than pressured; a second micro-reversal or visible loss (tool failure, physical injury) would have sharpened escalation into the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—finish returning to life by breaking the photographic curse—is signaled early and pursued causally. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias steps through the mirror and must unbosom himself. The advisor's whispered instruction and the dream dictionary's paradoxical notes complicate without resolving. However, the boy's immediate surrender after the confession lacks a second complication or cost that would test Elias's commitment; the resolution arrives too cleanly, reducing the felt price of the climactic choice.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is survival of the floating orchard under storm pressure, signaled early and escalated through wave strikes and tilting weight. Aera's agency—choosing where to strike, how to redistribute ballast—forecloses the path of paralysis her earlier fear took. The tightening is clear: "paths snarled together like knotted rigging" becomes "paths no longer snarled; they branched cleanly." Cost is visible: fear is not erased but repurposed, and the orchard remains "restless," never still. One reversal (from frozen forecasting to active percussion) is sufficient for this length under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake signaled early: survival of the city on cracking turtles, braided with Keth's guilt over the lost expedition. One meaningful tightening: broken shell spirals force Council confrontation; the Council refuses to act, narrowing Keth's options to solo defiance. The final whistle call is protagonist-driven agency that forecloses the path of passive guilt and commits the city to a new course. Cost is visible: Keth acts against Council will, risking his standing and the city's fate. Minor slip: the watchers' silence and the turtles' fear are told more than shown in earlier beats, slightly softening middle escalation, but the ending choice reweights all prior pressure into a single decisive action.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is control over the fictional king's legacy and its real-world misuse; it is signaled early and tightens through Elias's escalating demands. The confrontation narrows options: Mara defends the contract, Elias threatens exposure, and his departure forecloses compromise. Agency is clear in his ultimatum and choice to leave. The cost—social upheaval and loss of stabilizing myth—is articulated and felt. One meaningful tightening (the ultimatum) is sufficient for this length under a causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—resisting erasure by creating a hidden archive—is signaled early and sustained. The act of sealing each note is an irreversible forfeiture (visibility sacrificed for permanence), and the rising tide imposes a credible time limit. One meaningful tightening occurs when she finishes the inkwell and the tide "presses higher," forcing her return. Agency is renunciation with visible cost (the notes "swallowed" by grout). However, the middle beats recycle the same action (write, fold, seal) without a reversal or tactical shift that tests commitment, keeping escalation clarity just below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—tracing honest origins of what was missing—is signaled early and tightens when Mara discovers the hidden folio. Escalation reads under Accumulative lens: the blackout's stillness → nagging question → moving through gaps → breaking the ribbon → testimonies revealed. Agency is clear: her decision to "follow the gaps" and break the seal forecloses her complicit passivity with felt cost (council dismissal recalled, sedation vs. peace). One meaningful deepening (suspicion to proof) narrows options. The price is conceptual and relational: institutional trust shattered, her role redefined. Meets escalation test for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: confronting the memory of her daughter's death that she has "refused to polish." One meaningful tightening occurs when the basilica "hums above her, a throat clearing before confession, and she knows delay is another cruelty." Agency is renunciation of avoidance—she carries the memory to the workbench, polishes it despite the pain, and transforms it into cranes. The cost is visible: "her heart feels flayed, luminous torment pouring through each newly sharpened facet." No antagonist is required; pressure is internal and situational. The escalation reads as accumulative intensification (shadow detaches → locket opens → memory clarifies → transformation) rather than a causal narrowing of options, which fits the textural lens but limits the felt urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: whether to use predictive power to prevent harm or perpetuate it. Pressure accumulates through the vortex's persistence, the geode's heating, and the narrator's reflection on complicity, tightening when the anomaly sharpens around "three coordinates like a triangle of absence." The final beat—rerouting processing power and nudging the model toward repair—narrows options by breaking mission protocol, with the cost (professional defiance, ethical leap) legible on the page. Agency is clear: the narrator's hands move "before my conscience can interrupt." One meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens is sufficient at this length; the cost is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—finding where she belongs—is signaled early and tightened once: when starlight pools in the chip's empty squares, the abstract search becomes a concrete mapping task with a legible method. That turn narrows her options from wandering to active decoding. The cost of this resolution is felt (releasing the headset, abandoning encrypted orders) but not deeply dramatized; we do not see her hesitate or test an alternative. Coincidence plays a role (starlight happening to align at this exact dusk), which is acceptable under an accumulative lens when it complicates rather than solves. The ending gesture—tuning her heart—reads as agency crystallized, but the stakes remain internal and the price remains implicit rather than a visible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to face or continue evading the father's truth—is signaled early and tightens through the discovery of the forked emblem that links personal artifact to buried network. The kneeling search and recognition ("the realization snaps something") constitutes one meaningful deepening that narrows options: the protagonist can no longer pretend ignorance. The choice to gather carvings rather than walk away or expose them forecloses the path of manufactured comfort with felt cost. Agency is clear in the decision to study rather than sell or destroy, though the escalation is more a single tightening than multiple reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—prisoner exchange under uneven terms—is signaled early and tightens when the hooded brother appears, creating a live moral calculus. The protagonist's agency is clear: choosing the spy forecloses saving the brother, with cost visible in "my brother's gaze broke." One meaningful escalation occurs when the Riverhold captain offers the unlisted brother, forcing a choice between repetition (selfishness) and transformation (wisdom). The moon-phase timing and the neutral-ground invocation apply situational pressure but do not themselves narrow options; the core turn is character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether to surrender to the water or turn back—is signaled early ("paddle out until you cannot see shore, then let the water decide") and tightens through the barnacle observation, which offers a counter-model of survival. The protagonist's agency drives the turn: noticing the barnacles, recalling Granddad's wisdom, and choosing to turn the kayak "awkwardly at first" with visible effort. The cost is legible: "I did not know who would still be there ashore, but at least I was paddling toward them, not away"—the uncertainty and persistent regrets remain. One meaningful deepening (the realization that "maybe flickering faith was still faith") narrows options and forces the choice. No coincidence resolves; the turn is earned by interior work and specific observation.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: recover erased memory to understand past cruelty and kindle empathy. Pressure tightens through the journey's physical obstacles (welded door, descent) and conceptual deepening (baseball's future signature, lake as reservoir). The protagonist's agency drives each turn (following the map, using the torch, wading in). The final wade forecloses retreat and forces confrontation with "sins pressing down through my skin," though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral in the closing lines.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—reforging a bond beyond death—is signaled early and drives every beat. Pressure accumulates through the scent ritual and metamorphosis, with one meaningful tightening when the protagonist's body begins transforming ("my fingers lengthen into branches"). The cost is legible: human form is surrendered, and the beasts dissolve into wind. However, the escalation reads more as a ritual unfolding than agency-driven narrowing of options; the protagonist's reluctance does not generate a competing choice that must be visibly forfeited, placing this in the strong band but below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.9)
    One dominant stake—finding and reclaiming lost time—is signaled early and sustained. The story deepens rather than reverses: the three-card reading intensifies his recognition that every postponed moment circles below, and the final turn (gathering artifacts, descending) forecloses his prior evasion with visible cost. Agency is clear: he chooses to leave the mountain and "begin to pay them back." Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful tightening suffices; the mist-bridge vision narrows his options by making the cost of absence undeniable. Coincidence does not resolve; his own recognition drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—unsealing the locked dimension—is signaled early and tightens through each immersion that tests pacifist resolve against violence's seductions. Escalation accumulates via emotional weight shifts that alter ship trajectory and panel access, culminating in the tree-planting memory where joy surges enough to open the sealed probability space. The piece earns its accumulative pressure through stacked shadow-work sessions; one additional on-page cost of renunciation (a specific temptation refused in detail) would sharpen the pacifism's price and push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake signaled early: save the camps from lava. One meaningful tightening occurs when bells ring and Niko traces detour routes in his mind, narrowing options to the jar-waving plan. The final act is driven by protagonist agency with visible cost ("hot beneath his soles," urgency). The lava cooling "short of the camps" lacks on-page friction showing the plan's risk or near-failure, and the collective success feels slightly convenient, capping the score below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.6)
    One dominant stake is signaled early: Iri's silent revolution through rewired locks during the blackout. The arrival of Trann and the sundial message tighten pressure by offering both invitation and risk, and Iri's final act—slotting the copper rods—forecloses the status quo with on-page mechanical consequence. The cost is immediate (alarms don't ring, but locks lose directionality) and tactical, though the broader fallout remains off-page. One meaningful pressure point drives the escalation; coincidence (the blackout) complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding the sacred equation to regulate motion's debt—is signaled early and maintained. Escalation occurs through the rock-placement sequence: Fibonacci path, twin-prime lattice, then star dust alignment. Arin's precognitive splitting ("one strand of future he stepped back and slipped") forces a visible choice with consequence (pain as proof the tax returned). Agency is present but quiet; the "promise to understand" drives the ritual, and the cost (scraping knees, emotional near-weeping) is legible on the page. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: to understand the cartography of scars (personal and national). The story deepens rather than reversing—external storm pressure and the astronomer's revelation tighten until the poet chooses to look, narrowing his options from passive forgetting to active witnessing. The telescope vision forecloses retreat: he cannot now "pretend [he] did not see." Cost is present but interior; no external antagonist tests him beyond his own hesitation. One meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens is sufficient at this length, though the pressure remains largely situational rather than escalating through protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—mediating philosophical disputes via coded light—is signaled early but never tested on the page. Darius practices alone, reflects on past successes, and waits; no opposition appears until the final lines, too late to generate escalation. The story contains no on-page reversal, tightening choice, or visible cost. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen or a pattern should break to reweight the stake; instead the narrative loops through description and backstory, then stops before conflict engages.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—continuing the underground press under threat of discovery—is signaled early and sustained. The patrol's arrival provides one meaningful tightening that narrows options: hide the tin, adopt a safer persona. Agency is present when the narrator "pick[s] a personality quickly" and when they jointly decide to reopen after the boots retreat, though these feel more like endurance than a choice that forecloses a competing path with visible cost. The resolution is earned by protagonist stance crystallization (Charged Poise) rather than a decisive physical act, fitting the Accumulative lens. Cost is implied—continuing means ongoing risk—but remains more atmospheric than a specific forfeiture on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: Leon seeks reunion with Mara and resolution of unfinished duet. Pressure tightens when he discovers the hidden staircase, enters the projection, and confronts Mara's refuge-philosophy. The arbor scene deepens stakes from "find Mara" to "choose action over hesitation," with visible cost in his broken clock and her acknowledgment that he "should not be here." Agency drives escalation: Leon's insistence ("I have been hovering long enough") forces the compass to flare and pathways to open. The final choice—stay versus return—offers competing goods with felt weight. One micro-turn (compass flaring) sets up the closure without diluting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to honor written records or accept the dream's older origin—is signaled early and tightens when the council asks Kael to decide. Pressure accumulates through escalating omens (children, shells, goats) and peaks in the dream confrontation with the tree. Agency is present: Kael asks for the night, climbs, places the seed, and listens; the dream reweights his options with conceptual cost. The piece lacks a decisive on-page action at closure (Kael stands beneath branches, feeling doubt), relying instead on Charged Poise, which fits the Accumulative lens but mutes the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (find the color/means to reach Mira with apology) is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening: the compass locks and leads him to the second lace strip, narrowing his search from abstract wish to concrete discovery. The lace "translates" his apology into violet light, and the ghost ships' arrival reconfigures his understanding ("vessels for what people had been too late to say"). Cost is present but muted—he releases the apology without certainty of delivery, a credible Charged Poise. Agency is constrained by his observational mode; he follows rather than decides, and the climactic "ease" reads more as relief than a choice that forecloses a path. No explicit antagonist or reversal, which fits the accumulative lens but limits pressure intensity.

The ending reweights stakes with a visible price, though the escalation is more internal than external.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.1)
    Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with cost unmistakable in the dissolution. The dominant stake of discovering time's texture tightens through the decision to step into disintegration, foreclosing options with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.5)

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.1)
    Escalation under the Accumulative/Textural lens is driven by protagonist agency, as Corin's narration and the narrator's internal shift deepen the stake of creating safe zones. Cost is unmistakable in the narrator's heart shift, foreclosing prior uncertainty with visible emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—navigating the endless night—escalates under the Accumulative lens through the star's pulsing and the storm's approach, forcing the oracle's agency in mapping silence. Cost is legible when darkness falls and the map redefines options, with a meaningful tightening that forecloses reliance on light. The captain's flinch and the map's revelation demonstrate visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes escalate through HEPA-3's agency in the loops, under an accumulative lens where density increases reweight options. Cost is legible in his altered perception and the violin's destruction. One meaningful tightening forecloses paths with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake of connection vs. mistrust escalates through protagonist agency (investigating tickets, using lens, attending concert). Pressure tightens under the causal lens, with a meaningful turn when she decides to approach the figure, and cost is legible in her emotional risk and the shared moment.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake of personal meaning versus declining health escalates through Elias's agency under accumulative lens, with cost legible in his physical withering. One meaningful tightening occurs as his care for the maze deepens, foreclosing other paths and reweighting options with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.5)
    Escalation is driven by Ilen's agency in tuning the manifold, narrowing options and raising stakes. Cost is legible in the risk of "violent awakenings," and the dominant stake (proving time's sideways flow) is tested and resolved with visible trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, from exploration to decoding the score, with cost legible in the acceptance of rebellion. Dominant stake (unraveling the code) tightens through density increase, foreclosing options with visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.1)
    Conflict escalates under the Hybrid lens through Mara's agency, from hypothesis revelation to the realization the valley was targeted, narrowing options with legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (finding truth) escalates through protagonist agency, narrowing options via discoveries like the valve wheel and phantom footfalls. Cost is visible in the narrator's internal shift, foreclosing pure skepticism under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.1)

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under accumulative lens, stakes escalate through density increases as Brann probes objects, uncovering the displaced axis and end of dreams; his agency in attention and probing narrows options, with cost visible in the realization that "no new dreams would arrive." One meaningful tightening deepens the dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (control over information) escalates through narrator's agency under causal lens, from accidental prophecies to deliberate message alteration. Cost is felt in the risk and reconfigured dynamics, though the escalation is slightly linear.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation is driven by Jonas's agency under the causal lens, using rhetoric and music to corner the demon. The dominant stake (saving the girl) tightens through dialogue, with cost legible in her shudder and freedom. One meaningful deepening suffices, satisfying the quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.5)

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (conquering self) escalates through Lio's agency in retracing paths, narrowing options under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible as he loses floatation and futures extinguish. One meaningful deepening occurs with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.0)
    Under Accumulative lens, escalation occurs through density increase in the dialogue, reweighting the stake of personal choice.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake is Lena’s commitment to a quieter, accumulative way of doing science (and perhaps of grieving), signaled early and tested through her deliberate setup of the dust device in this compromised space. Pressure escalates not through reversals but through deepening: the flood’s slow causes, the memory-saturated greenhouse, and her explicit renunciation of “mistaking fireworks for truth.” The cost is mainly conceptual and emotional—foregoing dramatic events and institutional prestige in favor of obscure, smudge-like data—and that cost is legible but understated. For a top-tier score, one sharper on-page trade-off or threatened temptation back toward spectacle would need to surface.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding and responding to the attempt on her life—is clear early and intensifies as she uncovers excess charcoal and the ledger’s final date. There is a meaningful tightening when coincidence becomes intention and the ledger’s last entry links to the explosion, transforming vague unease into a concrete murder attempt. The resolution is her decision to move toward confrontation rather than remain in reflective stasis, with the cost of relinquishing safety and passivity. The conflict is mostly internal and the antagonist remains offstage, which slightly softens on-page pressure but does not undercut escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Lio can reconstitute connection and “music” in a world where sound no longer exists—is clear and escalates as he moves from confusion to technical activation to envisioning a city-wide network. Pressure is situational and internal rather than adversarial, but the shift from testing his own grief profile to deciding to map the city’s emotions is a meaningful tightening of scope and responsibility. His agency (choosing to re-engage with the project and to be “the first instrument”) earns the resolution. The cost and risk remain mostly conceptual; a sharper sense of what he risks (failure, harm, further isolation) at the moment of commitment would deepen stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—answering a massed distress call to restore “rest” to incomplete lives—is clear and grows from personal weariness into metaphysical responsibility. Pressure escalates once he rows past the last buoy and commits to the descent, and again when he sees the ravaged chamber, but these beats are largely accepted rather than contested. Elias faces no direct threat or hard trade-off beyond taking on more of what’s already breaking him, which is thematically apt but dramatically muted. The conflict functions well for a lyric piece, yet lacks a decisive on-page test of his limits that would sharpen cost.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—how a beleaguered community organizes mutual aid without destroying its cohesion—is articulated early via sanctions and missing lentils, and tightened when Mara confronts Kito. The main escalation is conceptual: Mara discovers the breadth of cross-generational sacrifice and realizes that exposing individuals could shatter the fragile consensus. Her decision to declare a nameless “promise” is a genuine turn that resolves the immediate dilemma, though the conflict remains mostly conversational and internal rather than structurally risky on the page. The stakes feel real but could use one sharper sense of potential loss (e.g., a concrete example of fallout) to heighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—can Arun transmute the crushing gravity of unused love into something healing—is clear and culminates in a specific, vulnerable act with the boy at the railing. Pressure escalates from private burden to visionary confrontation (the corridor of sparks and the pulsing darkness) to a live test case outside himself. However, opposition is soft: the boy yields quickly, and Arun’s internal resistance never quite spikes into real risk or potential failure on the page, so tension stays more contemplative than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether she will remain a discrete self or dissolve to apprehend time’s true “texture”—is signaled early and tightens effectively. Pressure escalates through increasingly disorienting experiences (re-living photographs, multiplying hands, overlapping children’s voices) leading to a point where continuing means accepting disintegration. Her choice to place the halo fragment on the bridge and then step after the falling light is a clear, protagonist-driven escalation with visible cost. The conflict is primarily internal and philosophical, but it still reads as genuinely consequential rather than abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are crisply framed—seeds vs. deliberate annihilation, short-term survival vs. long-term resilience—and the countdown of detonations plus the Overseer’s looming intent provide solid, escalating pressure. Mara’s agency drives key turns (choosing chains, spilling the keys, deciding to guide his hands), and the knowledge that a wrong configuration will destroy everything adds real edge. However, the on-page conflict tops out at the moment of gaining leverage; we don’t yet see a concrete price paid beyond risk and delay. The escalation is strong up to Charged Poise, but not fully pushed into a visceral on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—capturing the sound of trust breaking to engineer a preventative device—is clear early and deepens effectively when the narrator realizes there were two betrayals in the kitchen. Escalation is mostly internal and textural: the latest prototype test forces a re-interpretation of the core memory, narrowing options from “stop betrayal” to “notice rot earlier,” a meaningful contraction of ambition. The pressure is quiet but coherent; the cost is giving up a fantasy of control. A touch more on-page resistance or risk to the present self (beyond reflection) could intensify this even further.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether to remain at the “hinge” of destiny or step through, risking the meaning of the protagonist’s work—is clear and escalates through the coded summons, the stranger’s demand, and the jar’s opening. The primary tightening is the choice to open the jar and take the portrait in the last light; the cost is internal but real (upending their understanding of theft and memory). Tension is more meditative than acute, which suits the mode but keeps the pressure just shy of truly bracing. A sharper sense of what might be irretrievably lost by refusing would elevate the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.4)
    The stakes are largely internal and conceptual—the ethical repurposing of skill and space, and the narrator’s willingness to enter that experiment—yet they are clearly signaled and deepened. Pressure escalates as Corin’s backstory reveals the moral weight behind “targeting lenses” and as the thaw is framed as a now-or-never moment to decide “what will grow in the puddles.” The main limitation is that tension stays consistently low-key; there’s little explicit resistance or counter-force on the page beyond implied history and inertia. Still, for a lyric piece, the reweighting of the room’s purpose and the narrator’s heart movement are sufficiently tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—will she accept erasure or claim authorship of her own danger—is signaled early and tightens as concrete evidence of disposability accumulates (burned file, cast list, memo language). Conflict is primarily internal but interwoven with the external power imbalance with the studio and the child’s presence, which pressures her self-concept. The decoding of the cast marks the key deepening; it transforms her fear from liability to potential tool and compels a bolder, riskier stance. The only slight limitation is that opposition remains offstage, so the escalated cost is projected rather than directly tested in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—how to navigate and endure an “endless night” when the last star dies—is clearly articulated early and tightened as the star trembles and then goes out. Pressure escalates texturally: from rumor and anticipation to the imminent loss of all charts and then to literal darkness in the hall. The resolution is an earned stance crystallization: choosing to rely on a map of silence instead of light. Still, conflict remains contemplative and almost wholly internal to concept; we never see a hard trade-off or palpable sacrifice beyond accepting this new grammar.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether a robotic mind can step outside its patterns and locate the origin of thought—is clear and consistently pressured by the loop design. Escalation comes via density: increasing awareness of details, the first touch of the violin, then the deliberate variation across loops, culminating in the loops’ failure to reset and the melted instrument as cost. Agency is present but quiet; HEPA-3’s experimentation with touch intensity and refusal is the key internal pressure point. The piece privileges contemplative intensification over sharp reversals, which keeps tension high for its mode but not maximally taut.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether she remains isolated and rule-bound or risks exposure to connect—is clear and escalates from quiet curiosity to rule-breaking to public vulnerability. Using the projector lens to uncover more, then deciding to attend the next concert, each tighten pressure. The climax is her choice to walk toward the hooded figure and offer both lens and tickets, foreclosing her safe, solitary posture. The emotional and ethical cost is felt, though the external consequences of breaking regulations stay somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can carve a meaningful, non-quantified relationship with luck and life before his body fails—is clear and present early. Pressure builds texturally as his hands degrade while the maze revives, and as visitors’ screens register luck shifts. However, escalation is gentle; there’s no singular on-page test or turn that forces a hard choice or visibly forecloses an option. The ending feels like a deepening of his existing stance rather than a high-cost decision, which keeps the conflict effective but not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stakes—preventing the manifold from fracturing and the awakenings from turning violent—are clear and potentially large. However, escalation on the page is muted: once Ilen takes the lever, there’s little resistance, complication, or visible near-failure before success. His internal and external conflicts are aligned rather than in tension, so the main tightening is conceptual (discovering sideways time) rather than a tough trade-off. The piece feels more like an elegant demonstration than a pressured test, which keeps the stakes from fully biting.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—whether he will recognize and embrace the subversive, ghost-written score—is clear, and the pressure does deepen as he moves from curiosity to active decoding to conceptualizing the music as rebellion. However, most conflict remains internal and speculative; external stakes (political repercussions, physical danger from the flood) stay ambient rather than directly tested. The key tightening is his realization that the code lies in silences and damage, which redefines what “playing it truly” would demand. That escalation is effective but understated, keeping tension strong rather than electrifying.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will face and own the dangerous hypothesis about storm steering and her valley’s targeting—is signaled early in her demand to know “what I said” and her dread of remembering. Pressure deepens as the oracle methodically restores first the idea of intentional interference, then the possibility of deliberate targeting, each tightening the moral and personal implications. The climax is internal but clear: she accepts that the oracle cannot act and realizes the burden of action and meaning rests on her. The conflict remains almost entirely interior and conceptual, which slightly limits visceral escalation but suits the piece’s mode.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Evan’s “swallowed truth” can be externalized enough to shift blame and the narrator’s belief—is clear and present from the outset. Pressure deepens as they proceed into the tunnel, encounter the rosary-wrapped valve, and hear phantom machinery, culminating in the narrator’s partial thematic and relational turn. Conflict remains mostly internal/relational rather than situationally acute; no specific risk or irreversible choice is taken in-scene beyond going in and how to interpret what they find. The escalation is effective but quiet, which makes the piece strong but not piercing on the conflict axis.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central stake—whether he will remain a neutral witness or step into and thereby alter change—is established and tightened by the swan’s summons and the page-path that will cost him his vantage. His decision to step onto the blank pages is a clear escalation, and the consequent surfacing of the library gives that choice weight. After that, pressure relaxes into visionary montage; the final decision to remain at the refuge feels more like a gentle settling than a fresh, sharply contested turn. The cost is conceptually rich but somewhat abstract, with little concrete resistance or sacrifice dramatized in the closing beats.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stakes—whether Mara can create a moment of wonder without tipping these vulnerable residents into fear, and whether she can bear her own grief in that moment—are clear and signaled early. Pressure accumulates as residents are “restless,” staff are wary about safety, and the light grows unnervingly strange; the key tightening is Mara choosing to stop playing and let pure silence carry the peak. Internal and external conflicts interweave nicely in the courtyard scene, with Lake’s reactions and Mr. Alvarez’s fragility heightening the risk. However, there is no sharp reversal or hard trade-off; tension is more atmospheric than driven by escalating, irreversible choices.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake is conceptual and existential—whether meaning and “center” can be preserved after dreams and cosmic stability fail—rather than situationally urgent. Pressure accumulates via the woman’s diary and the tapestry, which both echo the displaced-axis anxiety and reframe Brann’s task as larger than one era. There is a clear deepening when he realizes “the walls of every age had been rehearsing the same question,” which tightens his role and the scale of his burden. Still, there is limited escalation in terms of options narrowing or costly decision-making; his agency is mostly attentive endurance rather than confronting a dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—who controls the flow of covert information and, by extension, the island’s fate—is coherent and signaled. Pressure escalates from quirky job → unnerving prophecies → outside scrutiny (Parker) → a concrete decision to alter the lighthouse sequence. However, the danger of defying the off-stage powers is mostly implicit; no immediate backlash or visible loss sharpens the price of the choice. The protagonist’s agency is solid, but the sense of irreversible risk at the peak could be intensified.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the demon completes possession of the girl—is established and Jonas’s method of contest (music and argument) is clear, with pressure accumulating as his questions systematically strip away the demon’s justifications. There is a meaningful deepening when Jonas shifts from debating the demon’s assertions to exposing the architecture of its thinking, which leads directly to the resolution. However, the demon never truly feels dangerous beyond concept: it laughs once, offers a few barbs, and then is logically outmaneuvered with minimal visible cost or counterattack. As a result, escalation reads more as steadily intensifying lecture than a two-sided struggle where options meaningfully narrow.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—how Eli uses this slice of night between reflection and dawn to arrange time into something “obedient”—is present and coherent. There is a clear internal tightening when he marks the reachable piece of time and writes the unusually short, imperative fortune. However, escalation is subtle: the “before exhaustion hits” clock and looming deadlines are mentioned but never bite down into a genuine dilemma or forced trade-off. The result is a beautifully sustained pressure with limited overt transformation or visible cost in his tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Lio will remain shattered across timelines or accept the cost of integration—is clear and escalates as corridors narrow and doors represent increasingly consequential regrets. His decision to enter the rooms and “stay instead of turning away” is a strong tightening: each corrected choice extinguishes futures and brings back gravity. The price (loss of some possibilities, surrender of his gravity-defying status and the tablet) is legible and thematically aligned. External pressure is minimal, but the internal conflict is sharp enough to carry the piece at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Eira can crack her students’ emotional numbness without sound—is clear from early on and tightens through the preparation and risky activation of an untested device. Pressure escalates as the phonograph is cranked, the drums stir, and the rhythms begin to invade the children’s bodies, forcing them into contact with buried grief. The conflict is primarily internal and situational rather than adversarial, but the cost of success (tears, sobbing, resurfaced pain) is credibly felt. One could want a slightly sharper moment of doubt or potential failure, yet for an accumulative piece the single deepening beat works.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stakes—whether the narrator stays a neutral archivist or becomes complicit in a subversive information network under surveillance risk—are present but largely conceptual. Pressure escalates in a measured way (repeated following, mysterious tube, anomalous sounds, revelation of a covert map), culminating in the choice to align with the pigeon-senders. However, the sense of danger from the ministry or from missteps in this new role remains mostly implied rather than concretely dramatized. The result is an elegant, thoughtful escalation that lacks a truly sharp pinch point or visible price at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will risk emotionally dangerous memory to help Mara and himself—is clear early and coherently pressured by Mara’s request and the activated fragrance. Escalation tracks with the scent intensifying, the UV words revealing Aron’s love, and the memory cresting in a quasi-flashback to the ER, narrowing his real option to either shut it down or endure. His choice to remain and grieve, leading to his tears literally altering the words and enabling the seed’s germination, is an earned resolution with a legible inner price. The conflict is more internal and lyrical than sharp or multi-layered, which keeps tension strong but not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central conflict—whether to live a safe, automatic life or to embrace a more dangerous, expansive texture of time—is well articulated and narrows meaningfully when the narrator’s three concrete options are named. Pressure escalates conceptually through the poet’s prison dilemma and the revelation that the beings are “witnesses…waiting for us to notice the new rules.” However, there is little external or temporal pressure; the world is “paused,” and no explicit deadline or consequence forces immediate action, so tension remains largely philosophical. The ending’s charged poise works, but the on-page cost feels anticipated rather than partially paid.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elio can locate meaningful, unfinished beauty in a numbed, post-burn world—tightens convincingly once Mara interrupts his street stagnation and draws him to the greenhouse. The main escalation is his decision to perform in the deepest hush, testing his hesitant, unresolved style against a new, fragile ecosystem, culminating in the discovery that the vibrations continue in the sapling and the pumps’ “almosts.” Conflict is quiet and internal but coherent: mendicant passivity versus active listening/participation. The price—surrendering coins and bowl-role—is understated but legible; what’s missing for a higher band is a sharper sense of jeopardy or loss if he failed.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant conflict—whether Eve will risk engineered counterfeit empathy to salvage her professional and moral usefulness—is clear and escalates as the dealer reframes her problem and presents the ampoule. Pressure is largely internal and philosophical, but it tightens as the cost (“you may not like the person who walks back out”) is articulated just before she commits. The transformation scene and her new pattern-recognition of others’ emotions provide a real reconfiguration of stakes going forward. The conflict is more quietly negotiated than sharply contested, which keeps it a notch below maximal intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.9)
    The central pressure is Elias deciding whether and how to act on the accidental letter, confronting his own transactional habits. There is one main deepening: moving from simple delivery to proposing an institutional shift (late-night readings), which does narrow his internal options. However, external conflict is very gentle—Marin offers curiosity, not real resistance, and there’s little sense of social or financial risk beyond implication. The result is thematically satisfying but low-tension, which keeps escalation and felt stakes below top-tier literary intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elian can find a form of belonging that doesn’t erase his past—is clear and present from early on. Escalation is modest: the rumor of kinship webs, the intensifying search, and the discovery of “Stay and scatter” gradually reweight his options rather than forcing a sharp crisis. His choice to reimagine his art as a shared lattice is a meaningful, if gentle, narrowing of his prior path. The lack of sharper external or internal friction keeps tension from reaching a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether she will “uncage”/capture the first echo versus preserving its freedom—is signaled via the keeper’s warning and tightens as she enters the sound-governed zone and the unborn echoes begin tugging at her memories. Escalation is primarily internal and conceptual but does sharpen as time-borrowing shifts from cautious to “in earnest,” forcing a live choice about sculpting possibilities into single lines. The renunciation (releasing the knot, sketching absence instead of one chosen echo) clearly forecloses a path, with implied costs to her commission and power. The stakes could be made marginally more visceral, but tension remains coherent and growing throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—recovering Lio vs not violating the orchard and others’ futures—is legible from early on and intensifies as the spell proceeds. Pressure escalates via the orchard’s response (humming ache, fraying image) until Corren confronts the implied ethical cost of continuing. His choice to alter the spell and seek a way to live with absence constitutes a meaningful tightening that forecloses retrieval. The cost is emotional and moral rather than physical but is sharply rendered and proportionate to the story’s scope.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—Marrow’s need to matter to suffering patrons—tightens effectively when the second sense memory reveals the librarian’s current, acute pain, forcing Marrow into active intervention. The escalation is more emotional and conceptual than peril-driven, but the move from passive listening/hoarding to targeted, risky outreach via the tape is a clear deepening. However, the price he pays is relatively low-friction; he isn’t forced into a sharp trade-off beyond accepting continued invisibility. Tension is steady and cohesive, but never quite reaches a knife-edge.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will continue resisting change or allow herself to be altered—is clear, and the external storm neatly parallels the internal pressure. Escalation comes through the increasingly erratic weather, the linden’s survival, and finally the trellis episode where physical collapse and visionary imagery force confrontation. However, most of the “conflict” is contemplative, with relatively soft external consequence if she remains unchanged; the price is emotional and existential rather than dramatized via a difficult choice. The result is strong but somewhat low-tension for elite-market stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stakes—water scarcity for the village and Mara’s need to make meaning from loss—are clear and converge in her decision to try to trade the brooch. Pressure tightens from eerie anomaly (tide’s absence) to a concrete option (rumored collectors) and finally to her literal exchange at the checkpoint. The narrative doesn’t feature a sharp reversal, but there is a meaningful deepening when Eron’s throwaway line becomes Mara’s chosen path. The costs (leaving, danger, surrendering the brooch) could be pressed a little harder on the page, but they are present and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—how magic should be oriented (toward grand futures or magnified ordinary moments)—is clear and tightened as the cave’s song goes rogue and Lyra’s certainty fractures. Escalation is more textural than combative, but there is a real turn when the cave disagrees with Mira’s “Trivial,” and again when Lyra bows and cedes the didactic role. The price is subtle but present: Lyra must renounce her curated authority and Mira must accept her mundane life as cosmically consequential, a heavier responsibility than she expected. The relative gentleness and low external risk keep this from feeling fully high-stakes, even as the internal and conceptual tension work.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether loss and exile can be reassembled into communal meaning—emerges early and tightens as Mara shifts from solitary collecting to public curation, culminating in Caven’s risk of playing again. Pressure escalates texturally rather than through sharp reversals, with the crowd’s gradual straightening and the accumulating fragments as the core deepening. The cost is implied in Caven’s scarred, hesitant note and the community’s vulnerability in listening for it. Because the conflict never bites in a more concrete or oppositional way, tension remains beautifully poised but somewhat gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Adrian will risk stepping beyond known routes into an impossible station—builds coherently from domestic hesitation to supernatural commitment. There is one clear tightening: returning to the cracks and choosing to cross the doorway, culminating in accepting the conductor’s charge. However, the stakes stay largely conceptual (curiosity vs. existential risk/responsibility) and we don’t see a sharp, on-page price or a moment where a real alternative path is seriously contended. Tension is atmospheric and sustained but never truly bites down into a painful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Lio will retreat into safe skepticism or risk being changed by this possibly magical, grief-charged experience—is set up early and sharpened once the tile begins projecting entangled memories. Pressure escalates credibly from curiosity to panic (“where did I end and she begin”) to a principled decision: not to flee or surrender belief, but to stay, watch, and transcribe. That decision forecloses the path of avoidance and easy dismissal, which is an earned cost at this scale. The conflict remains largely internal and quiet, so while it’s well-shaped, it never quite hits a visceral peak.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—remain in immortal stasis or move toward a world where goodbyes are real—is legible early and consistently pressured by the storm and the shard. Escalation is primarily internal but tracks: initial disturbance → enforced connection with the amulet → confrontational vision of all past goodbyes → decision to alter the escondite. The piece lacks a sharp reversal, but the pressure meaningfully narrows options from complacent hiding to a charged poise where continued stasis now has an explicit price. The main limitation is that the conflict stays conceptual; embodied or relational stakes are powerful but remain largely in memory and idea.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—mother’s asylum vs. harnessing the theft network to help refugees—is very clear and sharpened when her initial binary is replaced by the third option of a breach. Pressure coheres around the ethical calculus rather than physical peril, and the choice to alter her father’s equation genuinely forecloses a path (clean deal with the consulate) with visible risk. The discovery of the cylinder and activation of the ink are strong escalation beats. The off-page nature of the authorities and absence of immediate repercussion slightly soften the felt external stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.2)
    The primary stake—whether Aurelio can meaningfully answer or structure the town’s silence—emerges early and tightens as the hum shifts, then finally steadies and then disappears. Escalation is internal and textural rather than confrontational: he moves from hopeful invention to more austere indexing, and the lamp’s extinction forecloses further attempts in this mode. His acceptance (“for now, that is enough”) feels like an earned stasis with cost: he leaves without proof of success, carrying only fragile stories and imagined effects. The conflict’s abstraction and lack of a sharper on-page test of failure/success keep tension strong but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.3)
    The primary stake—whether he will reclaim a fixed identity or embrace erasure—tightens effectively rather than explosively. The key escalation comes when a voice inside a container calls his “paper name,” confronting him with the system’s version of himself and sharpening the question of antidote versus acceptance. His decision to write a new, nameless, perpetually pending death certificate is a clear stance crystallization that closes off the retrieval of an old life. Pressure remains mostly internal and thematic rather than situational, but it coheres and deepens appropriately for a lyric piece of this length.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Tamsin will double down on meaning-stripping or accept a more ambiguous, story-shaped universe—is clear, though mainly internal and philosophical. Escalation comes through deeper, more painful retellings (mother, then lover) that sharpen the emotional cost of her myth-busting stance. The key tightening is the lover’s accusation (“That nothing meant anything, and that you would prove it.”), which forces her to confront the harm her worldview causes. While not high-pressure in a thriller sense, the tension does deepen in a way consistent with an accumulative, lyric design.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—can Jae use her role to protect her community from gentrification without betraying either side—is clear early and deepens as the Council and speculators close in. Pressure escalates meaningfully when the graffiti-based reorganization starts to work and then when privatization plans leak, culminating in Lilo’s serpent mural posing the stark choice of resistance vs. evacuation. Internal and external conflicts are well braided, but we don’t see a concrete price paid yet, only the clear prospect of one. That open-endedness keeps the tension strong but limits the sense of a fully paid-off turn.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether he will protect the heritage zone by lying or allow its erasure while telling the truth—is legible early via his role and the impending shutdown. Tension escalates through the narrowing countdown and his internal weighing of a false “unstable” declaration versus workers’ safety, culminating in his choice to endure the loss and only mark it via print and vial. Internal and external conflicts (duty vs. reverence vs. fatherhood) braid effectively. The conflict remains a quiet moral dilemma, so the felt price is subtle rather than searing, keeping it just under the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can restore the hummingbird’s capacity to orient/respond to the world’s signals—is clear but very low-pressure. There is one meaningful tightening when the confused feedback forces him to reopen old seams and re-teach the drone using the water test. However, there is little sense of what is truly lost if he fails beyond disappointing an unnamed owner or thwarting an abstract “hunger to belong to the pattern.” The conflict remains almost entirely gentle and contemplative, limiting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—truth and integrity of the atlas versus institutional orthodoxy and physical risk—is clear and tightens as the uncanny signals demand a response. The walk across the protesting ice and discovery of a model-breaking headwater are solid escalations under both external and internal pressure. Her decision to redraw in red is an earned resolution that forecloses a safer path of bureaucratic compliance. The cost is more conceptual than immediate, so the tension never quite feels perilous, keeping this just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—reviving the town’s sense of time and communal rhythm—is clear, and the pressure deepens as Ansel iterates his nightly walks and the bells begin to hum along. The main escalation is textural: from a single man’s footsteps to a chorus of cracked bells to the first returning person. However, risk and potential failure remain largely abstract; nothing on the page tests whether his attempt might backfire or fail, nor forces a trade-off. The arrival of the woman feels fated rather than wrested from genuine jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—how the narrator responds to the impossible distress call and what she risks to answer it—is clear and threads through the piece. Pressure escalates via her choice to deploy the drone, the eerie behavior of the vial, and the revelation that she is being conscripted as an archive. The final choice to shut down the station and submit to the vial crystallizes the tension between survival and meaning, with an implied sacrifice of selfhood. The escalation is more contemplative than visceral; the alarms and structural fatigue underplay the physical jeopardy, keeping this just shy of truly searing stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.8)
    The conflict is primarily conceptual and preparatory: the narrator’s project to grow a story that can open stone versus the prison’s physical and epistemic constraints, plus the moral/legal danger of the bodies. There is a clear escalation from passive listening to active exploration to the discovery of the library and revelation of off-page murders, but no on-page moment where he must choose between opposed costs. The ticking clock (“before they find the bodies out on the reef”) sharpens pressure but has not yet altered tactics beyond framing urgency. Stakes are strong and thematically rich, yet they remain largely future-facing rather than tested in a concrete, consequential decision here.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether he will accept a lifelong (possibly unending) burden to repay a past-life debt and ultimately free her—is clear and sharpened once she names his prior failure. Escalation is primarily conceptual/emotional: the revelation of shared blood-planted trees and the missed promise reweights his current apprenticeship into a moral crisis. The cost of “stay until dawn that will never come” reads as heavy but remains somewhat abstract in practical terms, which slightly blunts the sense of concrete sacrifice. Still, the final vow is a meaningful foreclosing of alternatives and feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Orren can meaningfully resist communal decay by inscribing a new story—is clear, but the pressure remains mostly internal and steady rather than escalating sharply. The key tightening comes when he chooses to alter the plate’s storm design, explicitly breaking with precedent and paying in effort, secrecy, and a kind of private heresy. There is no external antagonist or concrete risk of discovery, so the tension is largely philosophical and emotional, which suits the piece but keeps it quiet. That quietness is executed well, yet a slightly sharper on-page cost or constraint would raise the stakes’ immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stakes—Leila’s attempt to reconnect with faith and the village’s uneasy negotiation between tourism, piety, and disturbance of the dead—are clear and interwoven. Pressure deepens at the trench collapse, which exposes the calendar ring and forces a new proposal (teaching garden) that tests the priest and community. External conflict remains low-key; there’s no sharp confrontation, but ethical and spiritual stakes are legible. The price is mostly internal and communal (risking sacrilege, disrupting habits), so tension is more contemplative than gripping but still substantial for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.6)
    The primary conflict is internal: how to name someone in a way that honors their past while enabling self-forgiveness, shadowed by Neve’s unresolved history with Arlen and the chalk-code language. Pressure escalates subtly as names are tried and discarded, then concentrated into the near-instinctive choice of “Marin Verge” and the additional coded reassurance. The decisive tightening is Neve’s move from ambivalent reflection to committing both to a specific name and to releasing the letter, though the felt risk remains more conceptual than acute. The stakes are clear but could be made slightly sharper by foregrounding what Neve stands to lose if they get this particular naming wrong.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central stake—how to chart and survive a rebellion in a world where stories govern what can be remembered—is clearly signaled and meaningfully tightened once the prince asks for untraceable paths. The escalation is primarily conceptual: as she stitches, specific conspiracies surface (double-funding merchants, vanished deserters), and the absent palace on the map reframes the danger as erasure rather than simple defeat. Liora’s agency in offering an “absence” path is strong, but she faces little immediate personal jeopardy for helping him, so the conflict resolves more as an intellectual/moral tension than a fully felt gut-choice. That relative softness on concrete cost keeps the score out of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—can Lysa recover and articulate the exact instant before the brother’s fatal decision—is signaled early and honored through to the end. Pressure escalates as the spirits’ song sharpens, the lagoon “rewinds,” and Lysa risks inhabiting another body on the lethal edge of a pier; the brother’s internal conflict between pride and love is crisply captured. Lysa’s agency is genuine in what she chooses to ask for (“not your death, but the last moment…”) and in her refusal to decide for the living client, which marks an earned stance at closure. However, the external conflict is mostly frictionless ritual rather than a choice under overt threat, so the sense of real jeopardy to Lysa or her mission, while present, is somewhat muted.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stakes—what self the boy will awaken with and how Mara shoulders/reshapes that fear—are clear from early on. Pressure tightens through the ticking clock (surgeon muttering about time), the boy’s increasingly intimate requests (read the cast, interpret the unreadable line), and Mara’s culminating ethical choice to invent a comforting message and keep the coral. Internal and external conflicts braid well (medical risk vs. emotional truth), with visible cost in Mara’s breach of neutrality and assumption of symbolic evidence. Escalation is emotionally potent but relatively quiet; there’s no major reversal beyond the morally shaded lie.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes remain largely internal and low-pressure: Lio isn’t meaningfully opposed, and nothing threatens his project beyond generalized illegality and ephemerality. The main tightening is a deepening of understanding—realizing the network is a “community of forgotten feelings”—rather than a choice that narrows options or demands a price. That’s workable for an accumulative lyric piece, but there’s little true escalation or on-page test of commitment. As a result, tension is gentle and the piece leans more toward mood than conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central conflict—cling to professional certainty or surrender to curiosity and the mural’s agency—is clear and coherently pressured by the garden’s uncanny response and the mural’s direct question. Tension tightens as small disturbances (the eye flinching, whispering without moving) escalate into a demand for a truthful stance and a visible renunciation of the original restoration plan. The price is primarily internal and conceptual, but it does foreclose a concrete path (doing the job as expected) in favor of wonder. Adding one more beat where the potential consequence (patron displeasure, loss of reputation) brushes against her choice would increase the stakes’ bite.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving untaxed, defiant thought—is clear and tied to a concrete plan that would subvert Ministry control. There is one meaningful escalation when the entomologist appears and could expose them, and her choice to join reframes the risk. However, the confrontation resolves quickly in their favor with little sense of immediate consequence or sacrifice, and there’s no subsequent tightening (e.g., Ministry pressure, a close call in the gardens) to raise the cost. Tension is more conceptual than visceral, which keeps escalation from feeling fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether he can coax the moon back and soothe the city’s and his own ache—is legible early. Pressure escalates gently: from private insomnia to communal stakes (city’s tides and sleep) to the unexpected coral response that makes failure or success feel momentarily uncertain. His agency (singing, invoking the postcard’s sky, articulating terms of coexistence) drives the turn where the moon reappears. The emotional and practical cost of failure isn’t heavily underlined, so the conflict reads more meditative than bracing, keeping it shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—protecting the integrity of archived memories versus allowing a new, unarchived name-song to vanish—is clearly signaled and deepens as the humming destabilizes other relics. Escalation follows the accumulative lens: a small repair task reveals a larger systemic threat and then a singular ethical problem (let the song die or bend the archive’s rules to save it). His choice to give the unknown name a place is an earned resolution that forecloses the path of strict, passive custodianship. Because the danger stays mostly conceptual (no immediate visible damage occurs if he fails), the felt cost, while present, is more intellectual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—salvaging trust with Liora before parting—is established early and tightened by the impending meeting. Internal and conceptual conflict escalate when the Arithene grammar “tighten[s] around me like a harness” and the narrator chooses to construct a vow that forecloses evasion, raising the price of failure. The binding of their own voice is a meaningful trade-off that deepens the conflict, even though no external opposition appears. The absence of a reversal or serious obstacle during the ritual keeps escalation strong but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central stake—who gets saved from the next flood and on what ethical basis—is clear and morally charged, and Arlen’s plan directly targets that dilemma. Pressure rises effectively when the council’s competing claims collide in the echoing space, and when Arlen insists they must decide “what you are willing to lose together.” The turn to rotating mercy is a smart ethical and mechanical escalation that interweaves internal and external conflict. However, the opposition folds rather quickly; we don’t see a concrete sacrifice or a tested refusal, so the felt price of agreement remains more conceptual than dramatically sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.0)
    The core stakes—whether Noel will keep hiding in his self-made attic mythology or re-engage with the moral and emotional wreckage of the fire—are legible and sharpen when the woman arrives naming “the one from the Rialto fire.” Pressure escalates from abstract guilt to a specific unfinished obligation (the sister’s song), and the risk is that answering it will re-open unbearable grief and shame. The resolution through writing and sending the song is clearly tied to this pressure, though the middle section (“Across learning to trust again…”) softens on-page confrontation in favor of montage. As a result, tension deepens credibly but never becomes as sharp or scene-level fraught as it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.8)
    The core stake—reunion vs preserving distances/world-balance—is signaled early in the father’s work and intensifies through each experiment with codes and furniture spacing. Escalation is primarily conceptual/emotional but real: learning to move the terrace, slipping into the maze-body, then confronting the irreversibility of stepping across that strip of soil. The climax hinges on Map’s agency in choosing not to step forward, a renunciation with global and personal costs. If anything, the external consequences (terrace fall, maze stasis) stay slightly abstract, but the emotional and conceptual price is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—understanding and reconfiguring a faltering light system that’s subtly warping human behavior, in tandem with the narrator’s search for belonging—is signaled early and maintained. Escalation is internal-textural rather than high-drama: the unauthorized dimming test, the appearance of the shrimp, and the all-night redesign meaningfully deepen pressure and options. The personal price (risking protocol, exposing their odd way of thinking, loosening their grip on a fixed professional identity) is felt, though the external threat from “supervisors” or system failure remains soft-focus. Within a lyric mode, the single meaningful tightening and the narrator’s committed response read earned and sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding why paths vanish and what that implies for his vocation—is clear and tightened by the growing pattern of blanks. Escalation is subtle but present: Lio’s unease increases, he commits to the conjecture, and the tunnel sequence deepens the mystery into the revelation about unfinished world-crystal. The final “cost” is primarily emotional and conceptual: he accepts that his work is about guarding postponed possibilities, not mending losses. The lack of a sharper trade-off or real jeopardy keeps the conflict from feeling fully high-stakes, even in a lyric register.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—Marcus’s desire to do more than a coin trick, to “serenade monotony” and change the room’s rhythm—is clear but stays mostly internal and aesthetic rather than materially risky. Pressure does build via the tide, the crowd’s growing attention, and the suspense around the bishop’s reveal. However, no option is meaningfully foreclosed: if the trick failed, the consequences would be embarrassment rather than a felt loss or ethical cost. The final offer of agency to the woman is a lovely deepening, but the price of that stance isn’t strongly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake (risking exposure and personal memory loss to inscribe the verse) is clear and tight, with a meaningful tightening when the stranger arrives and Mareh weighs the authorities’ new “banned spectrum” against the rare alignment of gaps. Escalation is primarily internal but credible: her decision to proceed underlines an ethical trade-off with a visible cost. There’s no external interruption or reversal, yet the pressure of the world’s erasure regime and the irreversibility of the ritual keep the choice from feeling soft. Stakes land because something specific and irreversible—her brother’s face—is surrendered.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the atrium (and by extension the harbor’s way of seeing itself) will be erased or revalued—is signaled clearly and tied to the narrator’s professional and spiritual investment. Pressure deepens with the mention of cruise ships/condos, the three-day council deadline, and the discovery of the long crack echoing the shoreline, but remains low-key and largely interior. The key tightening is the choice to file an “improper” estimate and to claim an extra day; that does foreclose simple complicity, yet there’s limited sense that options have dramatically narrowed or that a concrete price has already been paid. Tension is more contemplative than urgent, which suits the piece but keeps escalation out of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Rafe will break his long silence to help Maya metabolize her first major loss—is signaled and followed through. External stakes (burning houses, lost canyon) underpin the internal conflict without overshadowing it. The key tightening is his decision to take out the box and speak, foreclosing the path of quiet endurance and risking self-exposure. The cost is mostly emotional and forward-looking rather than immediately repercussive, which keeps this strong but just short of the highest pressure bands.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central pressure—whether hope can be honestly recalculated without collapsing into wishful thinking or despair—is clearly established and tightened through successive object configurations and readings on the gauge. The major deepening is the “Unlifted” test with newspaper clippings, which concretizes the worst outcome not as apocalypse but stagnant apathy and forces the narrator into grief and renewed responsibility. Closure is earned by the quiet but consequential choice to reject both panic and retreat in favor of a modest, ongoing experiment. The tension is predominantly intellectual/emotional rather than situational, which may read as slightly under-pressured for some elite markets.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether to assume the inherited task of listening to a possibly conscious building—is clear and grows as the narrator uncovers Mara and feels the walls’ attention. Escalation is primarily conceptual and atmospheric rather than confrontational, which suits the mode but keeps pressure fairly low-key. The decisive choice to stay does foreclose the option of filing an incomplete report and leaving, but the practical or emotional costs of that renunciation could be sharpened. Still, there is one solid tightening when the echo “tests the contours” of the narrator’s name and binds them to continue.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—offering alternative paths, particularly to the boy haunted by the river—emerges clearly once the girl arrives, and the shift of the melody to target her brother functions as a meaningful tightening. Tension is quiet but real: can this fixed, ominous dream-image be reconfigured without violating the “not futures carved in iron” rule. Still, the painter encounters no serious resistance or trade-off in the moment; the danger and cost remain largely offstage in the future recall of the heartbeat. The conflict thus reads more as an elegant problem to solve than a crucible, holding this in the strong-but-not-urgent range.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether to accept impure peace to stop ongoing slaughter—is established early and sharpened at the amnesty objection. The envoy’s line, “You ask me to embrace the men who burned my village,” raises the conflict from abstract policy to personal moral crisis. The negotiator’s reply forces a concrete trade-off between justice and preventing future atrocities, and the eventual signing forecloses the option of holding out for purer terms. Escalation is primarily ethical rather than action-driven but remains clear and textured.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether and how he can “preserve the echo” and purchase any form of absolution—is signaled early and deepens toward the final act. Pressure escalates as he leaves the helicopter (safety, distance) to walk the flats and follow the “cracked map,” culminating in trembling hands and a kneeling posture that foregrounds cost. Conflict is primarily internal and ethical, which suits the piece, but external pressures (time, danger, opposition) are minimal, keeping the escalation more tonal than peril-based. Still, the release of the egg clearly forecloses a path (continued hoarding/control) and does so at a visible personal price.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—whether Iri complies with or subverts the king’s order to neutralize dangerous echoes—is clear and thematically resonant. However, opposition remains entirely offstage and nothing on the page actively resists her plan; every step of her subversion proceeds smoothly, with no on-scene obstacle, complication, or cost beyond implied future treason. Escalation is more in the density and brightness of images than in sharpened choice or narrowed options, so tension feels abstract rather than pressing. The final act of exhaling the hush upward is ethically consequential but dramatically under-contested.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.7)
    The central stake—whether ethical storytelling is possible or inherently harmful—is clear and under pressure from the first mention of the students’ argument. Conflict escalates from off-stage shouting to direct accusation (“stay clean up there”) to the high-risk empathy exercise where misrepresentation is the losing condition. The cost is primarily emotional and ethical vulnerability rather than overtly life-altering consequence, but it’s legible and appropriate to the scale. A slightly sharper on-page sense of what might rupture between them if this fails would push tension even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether this last monarch’s journey will find any sort of arrival—is signaled early and tightened as wind threatens to dash it and Erin scrambles to adjust her structures. Escalation comes through the monarch’s struggle upward, the veer toward the moth-wing signal, and the careful progression from ledge to ledge. Agency is quiet but present in Erin’s continual micro-choices, “answering its doubts in architecture,” and in the monarch’s reading of those signals. The cost and limitation (she cannot save the species, only honor this one arrival) are clear but understated.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether and how the narrator will transform his guilt and failed bell into a new, truer act of remembrance—is signaled and followed through. Pressure escalates as the rope begins to respond: a hiss, then a laugh fracturing into names, then full song, forcing him to confront the village he failed and his past secret castings. His agency in persisting with the braiding and allowing the rope to “seize that guilt and soften it” earns the final vocational and spiritual shift. The piece courts a quiet, lyric tension rather than sharp reversals or hard trade-offs, so while the cost is present, it never quite feels knife-edge.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—obey the decaying directive (die correctly) versus follow the road’s invitation (live wrongly)—is signaled and sustained. Escalation is clear: odd dreams → ominous sensor data → bunker sealing wings → explicit “final dream” warning → storm breaching the bunker, narrowing options to a sharp either/or. The road’s desire vs the directive’s authority makes the final decision feel like a genuine trade-off with existential and physical risks. The only limit is that the external survival stakes, while present, stay mostly conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized beyond the leaking water and shaking roof.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—can his numerical ritual coax any intelligible answer from the sky—is clear and the experiment’s setup provides a satisfying tightening as he reconfigures the floodlights into a “three-dimensional abacus.” Tension escalates texturally through successive near-misses until the planet aligns, then shifts again when a further patch of stars contradicts neat closure. However, risk and cost remain largely existential and intellectual; nothing on the page forces a painful trade-off beyond his ongoing doubt. The pressure is coherent but not especially sharp in terms of options foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central stake—whether the narrator will keep structuring identity around resentment—registers early and tightens as the sanctuary forces the body to replay the crash without comforting noise. The main turn, realizing that the abandonment story is reversed and self-serving, is sharply framed and clearly raises the internal cost of clinging to the old narrative. Ilen’s method steadily escalates pressure from quiet conversation to embodied re-experiencing rather than relying on a late twist. The only modest limitation is that external stakes remain narrow and could show more explicit consequences for relationships beyond the self.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central stake—can Elias capture the runaway dream without dissolving himself—is implicit but coherent, and pressure builds as his reflection fades and the mirror “drinks his features.” Escalation is mostly internal and textural rather than driven by sharp reversals, but the moment of worry about losing himself and the recommitment to being “firmly grounded” mark a real tightening. The final decision to let the dream step into him via the breathing pattern is a clear agency beat that resolves the conflict. What keeps this below the very top band is that the cost and risk remain largely conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether he can transform a failed, exploitative contract into a generative, intergenerational relationship with the orchard and his absent daughter—is clear and steadily pressured. The main tightening comes when the bankers’ totalizing demands and the orchard’s feral turn reveal the true cost of his cleverness, and in the present when he risks approaching and reshaping a now-dangerous environment. His decision to make an unwitnessed, living bargain and accept that his “mistakes compost into wisdom” is an earned crystallization of stance. Still, the conflict remains mostly internal and conceptual; a slightly sharper on-page sense of danger or loss in the present scene would heighten felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central stake—whether Elias will resist or embrace forbidden nonlinear inheritance—is signaled early through regulations and the pistachio shell’s suspected danger. Pressure escalates coherently: mounting annotations, the glowing cameo, the impossible orchard in the mirror, the fruit bearing his signature, and the revelation of a future bargain each deepen the cost and weirdness of engagement. His eventual decision to step fully into the orchard and accept custodial pursuit of forbidden knowledge is a clear stance crystallization that forecloses continued avoidance. The tension is primarily intellectual and metaphysical rather than visceral, so the felt risk never quite peaks into genuine dread or loss, but it does intensify in a scaled, appropriate way for a lyric short.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stakes—recovering her brother / reclaiming unlearned lessons at the cost of memories and freedom—are clear and weighty from early on. Pressure coheres and tightens through the negotiation with the clerk and the descent into increasingly “crooked,” silent shelves, culminating in the moral choice at the brother’s book. However, the path to the library is relatively unopposed; there are few concrete obstacles or reversals beyond atmospheric thinning of sound and conceptual gravity. The escalation is therefore more intellectual/emotional than confrontational, which works but keeps it just below the very highest band for conflict intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator will recapture or join their aberrant twin—is clear and steadily tightened as they move deeper into the ship and finally confront the twin. The main turn is internal: the shift from “hunt” and professional obligation to acceptance and co-authorship of their story. The cost of that choice (abandoning their role, their old life, and the world that “paid me to name them”) is implied but not concretely dramatized in terms of specific losses, which keeps the escalation slightly abstract. Still, pressure coheres and deepens toward the closing stance.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—what to do with an erased/rearranged war and its fable of absence—is clear and deepens as Lysa considers whether restoration is ethical. Pressure escalates at the chiming of thirteen and the discovery of her own handwriting, turning curiosity into a mandate to act. Agency is strong in her choice to reconfigure the rope and accept a treaty of compulsory remembrance, but danger or personal risk feels mostly implicit rather than sharply dramatized. The conflict remains primarily intellectual and ethical; a slightly more concrete sense of potential loss if she chooses wrongly would heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—rooting a “bloom of hush” that can hold against the energy beings’ storm—is clear and thematically potent, and external pressure increases as their voices invade the caves. However, the conflict remains mostly one-sided: the storm escalates, but the protagonist’s options never visibly narrow, and we don’t witness a moment where the hush might fail or exact a concrete price. His agency is real (choosing the correct path via the ice, committing to the conjuring), yet the resolution feels assured rather than hard-won. Making the ritual’s success more contingent or costly would sharpen escalation and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the universe ever “cared,” proven by the release of his childhood message—is clear and steadily reinforced. Escalation appears in the long grind of failed nights culminating in the surprise comet and his urgent redrafting of star paths, which meaningfully raises the chance of irrevocable success or failure. However, the conflict remains mostly internal and contemplative; we don’t see a concrete alternative he must forego or a direct risk of loss beyond continued meaninglessness. The comet’s arrival is a strong tightening beat, but the price of choosing to act now versus yielding is understated on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether the city retains its shared memories or dissolves into “polite strangers”—is strong and signaled early. Escalation exists through the storm’s movement and the shortening/lengthening shadows, which sharpen his urgency and spur him to work faster before dawn. Still, actual conflict remains largely internal and procedural; he never faces a pointed trade-off where one memory must be sacrificed for another, or a moral tension about what to preserve. The result is a compelling pressure field but relatively low visible cost in concrete choices.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central conflict—hope vs. despair under siege—is clearly articulated and steadily tightened through his design process toward the act of lighting the fuse. The invasion is an offstage pressure, but the real stake (emotional collapse before dawn) is well dramatized and the fireworks display is a clear, chosen act of defiance. Escalation is more tonal than event-driven; there is no sharp reversal, but density and commitment rise credibly to the ignition moment. The cost is implied (risk of failure, potential to deepen despair), yet it could be rendered slightly more concrete to reach higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether to leave the coast for inland life with Lysa—is clear early and deepens rather than widens. Pressure escalates texturally: the “pause in a difficult conversation” accrues weight via images of tides, molting, and multiple futures brushing this moment until a choice can no longer be deferred. The resolution is earned and forecloses a path (committing to a divided life rather than either extreme), but the sense of price is more conceptual than viscerally dramatized, and Lysa’s relative passivity slightly flattens interpersonal friction. It’s a strong, coherent tension arc rather than a sharply agonized one.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—how to live with fear and silence in a bunker world—is clearly articulated and tightened when the father decides to stay for the next inversion. Pressure escalates from solitary escapism to a shared, risky experience in which the old bunker logic is tested. The cost is emotional and relational (vulnerability, rethinking his life’s work) rather than physical, and that quiet register is handled well. Still, the conflict feels almost frictionless at the peak; there’s little sense that the choice to stay could go badly for their bond beyond a brief “flicker” of claustrophobia.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether silence can be made inviting rather than oppressive—is clear and the noise monitor provides a concrete pressure mechanism as the blue line rises and falls. There is a meaningful tightening when the passengers notice the line and begin altering their behavior, shifting from impatience to intentional stillness. Yet the conflict remains largely one-sided: nothing actively pushes back against Rian besides the passengers’ initial restlessness, and failure carries no explicit consequence beyond a missed opportunity. As a result the stakes feel elegant but somewhat gentle for top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Ilya will claim centralized control over humanity’s memory—is clear and escalates from curiosity to existential ethical choice. Pressure intensifies via the countdown, the future’s plea for a “soft” history, and the revelation that others have reached the throne and refused it. The final renunciation (sinking the ruby and erasing the throne) is a credible, costly stance that resolves the conflict. However, the internal struggle could be sharpened: there is little serious on-page flirting with accepting the throne, which slightly blunts the sense of jeopardy around his choice.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will remain in self-suffocating isolation or learn a different way to exist with her choices—is legible early and coherently pressured. Escalation comes through increasingly intimate engagement: entering, touching scars, confronting curated memories, then being asked to breathe. The cost of her pattern (the pooled, withheld breath and blackened shores) is made felt, and the final “breathe” beat is a genuine internal turn. Still, the conflict remains largely one-directional and guided; Mara is not strongly resistant, so stakes never feel sharply contested.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—preventing embodied promises/regrets from destroying people while resisting old shortcut-thinking—is clear and active. Pressure escalates through the malfunctioning pumps, increasingly urgent and strange texts, and the hatch’s awakening, narrowing her options toward a risky intervention. The internal and external conflicts interweave well, especially in “If this was a trap set by her remaining faith in shortcuts…”. The cost of opening the hatch remains mostly implied rather than viscerally dramatized in the final beat, moderating the sense of stakes paid on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.3)
    The primary stake—Aurel’s need to uncover the true cause of the dynasty’s collapse—appears early and stays clear. Pressure escalates as he moves from speculative belief in Mara’s theory to actually activating a cobbled-together machine and allowing himself to “become the antenna,” culminating in the queen’s voice reframing his role. However, the conflict remains largely internal and contemplative; there’s no strong opposing force or concrete risk beyond emotional cost. The tightening is real but quiet, so the piece feels beautifully tense rather than truly harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—Calder’s allegiance (king vs. possibility/self-directedness)—is signaled early and tightens as Mira reframes his duty and presents the masks. The key escalation comes when the potential futures in the mask confront him with treason, exile, or renunciation, forcing a stance crystallization. The felt cost is primarily conceptual and internal, rooted in his life’s choreography rather than immediate external danger. A slightly sharper sense of external consequence (what staying here risks in concrete terms) could heighten pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—recovering and honoring lost histories versus Mara’s own pain and systemic neglect—is clear and grows in weight as former foster youth arrive. Pressure escalates through accumulating encounters, with the brother/button moment crystallizing the cost and power of her work. Conflict remains largely internal and ethical rather than oppositional; there’s no sharp on-page dilemma that forces a visible trade-off, only a deepened commitment. The ending’s choice to persist in this work is moving but still relatively gentle in terms of dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—resisting systemic erasure and indifference—is coherent, and pressure does tighten as Lio chooses to follow the impossible reflections and to speak into the archival conduit. However, conflict remains mostly conceptual and atmospheric: there’s no direct opposition or immediate threat, so risk feels diffuse rather than acute. Lio’s hesitation before depositing memory is the clearest on-page test of resolve, but the price of speaking (or of refusing) is only implied. The escalation is sufficient for quiet literary work, but an additional concrete pressure point could sharpen the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether he can unmake or at least defuse the coded prophecy—is signaled clearly and tightened at the “heavier than usual” fog and bruised prisms, which frame the morning as a make-or-break attempt. Internal and external pressures converge when the horn unexpectedly releases a chord tasting “like the dust of the old club,” forcing a decisive change in tactic (active refusal of certain notes). The cost is quiet but legible: years of obsessive labor resolve not in triumph but in a fragile loosening of fate and a more complex burden of memory. The escalation is subtle rather than sharp; for elite markets some readers may want a slightly more acute sense of risk in the climax itself.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Lio will remain a listener/sorter or risk speaking/planting—is clear and sharpened by the legend of irreversible transformation. Pressure escalates through the arrival of the anomalous leaf and the voice’s reframing of Lio’s work, culminating in an explicit invitation that forces a choice. The internal conflict between patient listening and premature decision is strong but keeps stakes mostly conceptual; there’s little concrete or relational price dramatized on the page. The resolution is earned but the sense of loss or foreclosed path could be more viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Eli clings to certainty or embraces uncertainty in his relationship with time—is clearly signaled and followed through. Escalation is present but quiet: from eerie noise to legendary object to a greenhouse demanding an active choice about the clocks’ future. The pressure is largely internal and philosophical, with limited sense of risk beyond the conceptual and emotional, so the tightening feels contemplative rather than urgent. His decision to improvise and to attach “hesitating” hands is an earned resolution, but the cost is understated.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.5)
    The central stake—whether Arlen will remain pinned to the word “lost” or be redefined—is clearly signaled and tightened as she undertakes a risky, rule-bending ritual. The meaningful turn arrives when she offers her own name as “solder,” reconfiguring both Arlen’s designation and her own identity, with the visible consequence of the coin cracking and a new sign appearing. Escalation is more deepening than reversal, in line with an accumulative/lyric design, but it does narrow her options to an earned stance of tempered, unresolved hope. Some readers may wish for a slightly sharper sense of what she forecloses socially or personally by taking this stance, which keeps it just under the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—restoring balance so the gorge stops hoarding the village children’s joy—is clear and tight. Pressure coherently escalates as Mara descends and the harp’s “crooked chords” clarify into specific, risk-laden confessions. Her tactic of steering stories toward their absurd edge is a meaningful micro-choice that shifts the music from pure wail to rough harmony. However, real resistance or the possibility of failure is underplayed, so the conflict reads more as an assured ritual working correctly than a contested struggle with real peril.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—whether to submit her trauma to a system that may quantify mercy at the cost of her last private residues—is clear and sharpened by the interface’s offer. Pressure escalates as the forest and frame literalize this ethical calculus, culminating in her deliberate brace and step into the frame, which forecloses refusal. Internal and external conflicts are tightly interwoven: her body’s conditioned responses vs her conscious choice. The only minor limiter is that external opposition never adapts or pushes back; tension is almost entirely internal, though executed at a high level.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator will continue practicing a “neutral” erasure or accept the burden of honoring the silenced—is clearly signaled and tightened by the lens’s images of unseen labor. Escalation is primarily internal and textural rather than driven by hard situational pressure, but the shame memory of the boy’s softened testimony is a strong deepening. The final moment crystallizes a new obligation, yet it remains just shy of an explicit renunciation or vow in action. A small, concrete choice in-scene (to reinterpret something here and now) would raise the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.8)
    The primary conflict—whether and how the narrator will engage with the impossible machinery and what it will expose—does escalate: hum to silence, bulging ceiling, ghosts bracing, then the breach. Her agency spike (choosing to touch the polished barrel) cleanly triggers the main turn. However, the stakes are mostly abstract (epistemic and metaphysical) rather than viscerally dramatized; we’re told she “should not” wind such a heart but don’t fully feel what she risks beyond eerie dread. The pressure is coherent and tightening but stops short of a truly punishing test of values.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (whether Ilen will risk a final page that could rupture fragile systems) is clear, and pressure tightens with the unprecedented frost message (“NOW OR NEVER OR ALWAYS”) and the explicit warning from the librarians. His decision to proceed—uncorking the whisper and printing anyway—is a meaningful escalation driven by his motive. However, the outcome is almost entirely positive: systems destabilize but self-correct into a more accommodating order, so the threatened catastrophic cost never quite materializes. The conflict feels intellectually high-stakes but emotionally cushioned, limiting the felt price of his gamble.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—what kind of story will be told about this civilization, and whether alternate futures can survive institutional suppression—is clear and tight. Pressure escalates as the archaeological find threatens the Council’s myth, provoking an official shutdown that forces Mara and Elyas into clandestine resistance via poems and projections. Mara’s final choice to keep covering mirrors, now to protect imagined futures, is an earned stance that forecloses simple return to either her old revolution or passive compliance. The conflict remains largely intellectual and institutional rather than viscerally risky on the page, which keeps it just short of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—the city’s ability to ever see morning again—is clear and heavily signaled, with a nice braid of external stakes (light/time) and internal stakes (truth vs. false midnight). Pressure escalates as they descend into colder, more corrupted spaces, culminating in Elias’s negotiation with the covenant of rust and the risk of misphrasing a primal bargain. However, the conflict resolves on the first earnest attempt; we don’t see any solution fail, nor a strongly felt personal risk beyond fatigue and discomfort, so the sense of cost is somewhat muted. Still, the final adjustment of the bargain is credibly earned by prior setup and feels like a real narrowing of options rather than a lucky guess.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—pursuing the place where explanations fail despite risk—is clear, and pressure coherently intensifies as he moves from open rail yard to cave mouth to lagoon. The major tightening comes when the compass locks onto the far ledge and the skiff’s vision reveals the factory’s guarding role, forcing a more conscious commitment. However, danger and cost remain mostly implied; Elias experiences little real resistance or dilemma beyond brief sensory unease. As a result the conflict reads more as hushed initiation than as a fully pressured test of values.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake is Mara’s relationship to being “lost”—whether this trip is a failed errand or becomes something more—and that does tighten once the slide reframes the archway and her role. The main escalation is internal and conceptual, not situational: the slide shows her among the circle, forcing a revaluation of self and place, which she answers by pocketing it and driving away differently oriented. However, external pressure barely intensifies beyond “storm, dead GPS,” and there’s no sharp on-page trade-off or narrowed option set, so tension remains muted. The result is meditative rather than gripping, strong but not maximal for conflict/stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake is epistemic and aesthetic—will Ira understand the night flowers and what that implies for his work—and it’s signaled clearly from the second paragraph. Escalation is modest but present: the move from public rumor to Liora’s guarded knowledge to the solitary vantage behind the window tightens access to the secret. However, conflict remains largely frictionless: no real resistance tests his resolve or forces a sacrifice, so the price of his insight is felt in tone rather than in a concrete loss. The piece succeeds as a quiet, contemplative pressure pattern, but not as a sharply contested one.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.8)
    The core conflict—whether Maris will maintain archival distance or immerse herself in the hazardous past—is clear and escalates through the diary’s activation and the beach messages culminating in “KNEEL / WITNESS.” Her agency drives each turn; she repeatedly chooses deeper involvement instead of retreat. However, opposition remains mostly atmospheric rather than dramatized as a concrete, resisting force, so the sense of narrowed options and price is more ethical than sharply tactical. The climax reads as a strong deepening rather than a reversal tested against a genuinely viable alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether and how a ruined town can justly be revived—is signaled early and tightens when he reframes the “problem” from opening the bottle to redesigning the town’s social pattern. The key escalation is his decision to conduct an experiment on an entire way of living via his diagrams, which then triggers the bottle’s warming and the sound of returning footsteps. Conflict is largely internal and philosophical, with minimal external opposition, so tension operates through idea-pressure rather than dramatic reversals. The cost is conceptual (renunciation of nostalgic restoration and acceptance of a harder, uncertain path) and could be made slightly more visceral to heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether and how this dangerous, institutional-level oath will be taken into Lan’s archive—remains largely abstract, and tension is primarily atmospheric. There is one meaningful escalation when the voice reveals itself as an oath-scribe like Lan, converting the scene from simple recording to intra-tradition warning. Yet Lan’s agency at that point is limited to listening and issuing a brief “It is not for you,” so no concrete option is visibly foreclosed. The pressure feels real but muted; it never quite forces a sharp trade-off or tactical shift on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.9)
    The central conflict—whether to accept borrowed-time costs to reopen the atrium and keep the world from “unraveling”—is clear and escalates through the tactile encounter with the vortex and the story of the first curator’s sacrifice. The major tightening is the sensory/memory onslaught when the egg is touched, which makes the abstract stakes visceral and pushes the narrator toward a decision. However, opposition remains largely internal and philosophical; there is little pushback or complication beyond one axis of cost-benefit analysis, so the sense of genuine risk is strong but not searing. The choice is solidly earned but comes slightly too smoothly to reach the highest tension band.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to break sacred solstice silence with a life-saving siren—is clear early and sharpened by the council’s zero hour clause. Pressure escalates through increasingly anomalous readings, the shadow and dish shiver, and the needles kissing the red zone, culminating in a morally weighted trade-off. His ultimate action is a renunciation (not pulling yet, choosing deeper listening), which credibly forecloses one path with acknowledged danger. The conflict remains largely internal and conceptual, so while tense, it never quite reaches a viscerally harrowing peak.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—whether he persists in erasing himself or allows his vulnerability and attention to matter—emerges clearly and grows as the visions move from abstract stars to specific human moments. Pressure escalates internally as he’s emotionally targeted by the projections (“as if those questions were aimed only at him”) and as his worldview about work, care, and the universe is challenged. However, opposition remains largely atmospheric rather than actively resisting; the cost is psychological and conceptual rather than dramatized through difficult external trade-offs. The crystallizing choice to “keep watching” is earned but operates in a low-key, contemplative register.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator will preserve or loosen the covenant of unspoken words, and thus what becomes of the ghosts’ bound meanings—is clear and sharpened by Mara’s intrusion into the shed. Escalation comes from opening the box and letting the covenant “lens” scrape against Mara’s being, which forces a choice about who will shoulder responsibility. The final decision to “keep it, not as prison, but as witness” forecloses the path of release or abandonment, with a felt cost of continued solitude and burden. The pressure is more contemplative than agonized, so tension is strong but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake is the narrator’s attempt to find a new way to measure and live within time after conventional metrics fail. Pressure escalates texturally: the fragment’s shifting age, the ghostly reflections, the realization of a leak, and the townspeople beginning to gather for the messages all deepen the sense that time is destabilizing. The narrator’s choice to become a kind of guide—“to teach the town how to float”—is a credible stance crystallization, though the tangible costs of failure remain mostly conceptual. The lack of a more sharply felt, specific loss or immediate danger keeps the conflict from reaching a truly urgent pitch.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake is whether Elian can meet the world’s discord without trying to perfect or flee it; this is signaled and followed through. Pressure escalates from subtle observation to a magical test: listening to painful dissonance, choosing to harmonize it, and facing an otherworldly judgment. The price is an ongoing one—living with a world “always on the verge of harmony”—rather than a sharp, scene-scale loss. For top-tier venues, the conflict could benefit from one more moment of felt risk or possible refusal.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stakes—what he does with his remaining time and whether he can forge a genuine cross-species architecture before he dies—are clear and consistently pressured. Escalation is subtle but real: from private resolution to small experiments, to the storm’s high-energy test, to the unlocked chambers, to involving the monks. The cost of his project is principally his spent body and the foreclosed option of returning to the mainland; that price is visible at the end. The only limitation is that opposition remains mostly situational and internal, so tension never quite sharpens into a true crisis beat.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether this artificial pilgrimage can generate a genuine “chemistry of homecoming” for a skeptical envoy—is signaled, but the pressure remains mostly conceptual. The main tightening is the multiplication of footprints and the recognition of equations in their edges, which deepens the problem from a walk to a meditation on chained reactions and historical density. However, the protagonist is never cornered into a trade-off, nor do they pay an overt on-page price beyond confronting ambiguity; they follow the route as directed. As a result, tension is low and escalation reads as a smooth intellectual ascent rather than a narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake is conceptual and ecological—can a dead battlefield/reef be quietly reconfigured into a living garden—and that’s clearly signaled. Pressure accumulates through his methodical movement toward the place “the war had once been fiercest” and the placement of the final pod, which serves as a small but genuine tightening. Still, conflict remains largely externalized as history and environment; there’s little active resistance, and no real possibility that he’ll do otherwise tonight. The cost is more implied patience and humility than dramatized sacrifice, keeping tension on the quiet side.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central stake—whether to expose themselves and others to dangerous, destabilizing truth—is clearly articulated and culminates in a concrete choice to keep and share the cylinder. Pressure escalates internally as each listener receives a different, wounding revelation that personalizes the stakes. However, antagonistic forces (warlords, penalties for keeping such histories) remain off-stage, so the danger is more inferred than felt in-scene. The conflict works well but could be sharper with a more immediate or embodied cost to their decision.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—whether he will let this forbidden, time-warped deck redefine his sense of orientation and memory—is clear, and the piece does tighten from description into a committed stance by the end. The primary deepening comes as he shifts from sketching fixed constellations to mapping their wavering, explicitly questioning whether true north is place or choice. However, pressure remains largely introspective; there is no sharp on-page turn where an option is dramatically foreclosed beyond an implied, internal commitment. The fear of psychological unmooring and institutional prohibition is evocative but never escalates into a concrete confrontation or sacrifice in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.2)
    Conflict is primarily internal—fear vs wonder, guardedness vs openness—with the external climb and wrong sky providing situational pressure. Stakes are established early (stealing the future vs not returning) and deepen through the confession hidden in the chess king and the questions that spill from the lid. The meaningful tightening comes when she recognizes that what she wants is not the object but to amend her script, then chooses to accept the cost of vulnerability. The absence of a strong external antagonist keeps it from feeling razor-tight, but the internal stakes are clear and escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake is the narrator’s need to find an ethical way to hold and transmit fraught human contact in a city circling absent power; this is signaled early and gradually tightened. Pressure deepens with the interregnum rumors (the gallery may be closed), the boy’s reenactment of the narrator’s own disaster, and the ministers vs. citizens split, all complicating how truth and comfort should be handled. The key escalation comes when mere note-taking is no longer sufficient and the narrator chooses to “unbind” the archive and inscribe it into the stone, sacrificing safety/legibility for preservation. The stakes remain somewhat interior and conceptual, but they are consistently felt rather than abstractly declared.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether to keep numbing memory or risk reopening it—is clear from the outset and tightens as the stone demands not a new language but the resurrected family dialect. Pressure escalates credibly from curiosity to invasive voices to an almost ritual compulsion to speak, culminating in the risky choice to break her practiced forgetting. The cost is legible (re-experiencing bombed home, shame, grief), though opposition is mostly internal and environmental rather than dialogic or situational. The conflict is intense but relatively smooth; there’s room for one sharper external snag or refusal before surrendering to the stone.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stakes—village time restored versus permanent shroud, and Elior’s chance to confront his guilt—are clear and signaled early. Pressure escalates through the mechanics of the tapestry: each correct tug moves the staircase, each error darkens the center and turns the woven villagers away, tightening the sense of potential loss. The interweaving of internal and external conflict is strong, particularly when he recognizes saving them for pride would repeat his old pattern. Some tension is blunted because success feels largely assured; we never see him seriously consider stopping or failing.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—how Maren will present her crime to the spire and what forgiveness will cost—is articulated early and binds the scene. Pressure escalates as Zev refracts her neat confession into destabilizing variants, moving her from controlled recounting to laughter-then-sobbing exhaustion; this deepening of internal stakes is clear and earns the final stance. The choice not to seek a single “first truth” but to carry many is a real renunciation of an easier, more numbing path. The conflict remains mostly conversational and internal, with no sharp external turn or reversal, which keeps it just below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clearly articulated early (find meaning or succumb to oblivion; physical danger in the acid sea) and escalate coherently with the descent and the cylinder’s cracking. The dominant pressure—will Corin’s attempt to interpret and act on the statue’s script kill him, save nothing, or change his understanding—is sharpened when the lung threatens to fail. His agency at the peak (choosing to speak, etching sigils and accepting there is no guarantee of survival) meaningfully narrows options. One could argue for slightly clearer external consequences beyond that glass crack, but the internal and situational stakes are strong for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether he will finally keep his hidden promise and find/paint the not-yet-existent place—is clear, but the pressure on that stake remains gentle. Once he decides to go, the external conflict is minimal: the fabled danger of the cave network never materially constrains him (the air is “warm and still,” the pool is cooperative), and there’s no on-page reversal. The main “tightening” is his recognition that this place matches the mirror’s insistence, which is more conceptual than oppositional. As a result, escalation is modest and the price of his choice, though present, is softly drawn.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central conflict—Mara’s belief in quiet, welcoming magic against Jorah’s reliance on blunt noise, plus the sea’s exhaustion—is clear and thematically coherent. Pressure does increase from remembered heat and shouting to the moment she chooses to use forbidden/untested magic while boats are at sea. However, resistance is minimal: Jorah never truly challenges her in the moment, and there’s no concrete on-page risk or near-miss that forces a costly trade-off. The result is a beautiful but relatively low-friction escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.2)
    The primary stake—whether Rian can guide Mara “home,” and what “home” can mean when the place is gone—is clear and emotionally credible. Pressure deepens as the map being drawn is increasingly revealed as impossible in literal terms, forcing the key trade-off between accuracy and the sustaining fiction of a path. Escalation is relatively subtle and textural rather than sharply turned, but the pivotal decision to lie and to reframe the journey as a place to “set down your ghosts” narrows options in a meaningful way. The cost is mostly internal and conceptual, yet it is felt and coherent at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether unbearable empathy can be made livable without surrendering selfhood—is clear and well tied to the virus, the “oversensitive” exiles, and the truffle-mapping project. Pressure deepens when Risa questions the eye and when they begin speaking others’ fears aloud, with the storm providing a natural peak for the experiment’s payoff. However, escalation is quiet and largely internal; conflict is more about reinterpreting objects and conditions than confronting a sharp dilemma with a visible loss. The ending feels like an earned soft turn rather than a high-cost inflection.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether this will remain a “routine inquiry” or implicate the narrator in the drowned man’s chosen isolation—emerges early and tightens once the keeper reveals the flower and its instructions. Pressure escalates texturally rather than through overt danger, culminating in the narrator’s acceptance of the Edelweiss and the obligation it represents, which forecloses the path of procedural detachment. The line “I could no longer pretend I was only here to write a report” crisply marks the key turn. The conflict remains mostly internal and could risk feeling low-stakes in less controlled prose, but here the ethical and existential price is clear enough.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will continue a life of paralyzed safety or risk the doorway to honor Mara’s promise—is clear early and tightens consistently. External pressure from the rising creek and narrowing passage dovetails with internal fear and longing, pushing him toward a crystallizing choice. The one major escalation (water pooling to his ribs as the chip maps possible lives) effectively narrows options, though the concrete consequences beyond existential change remain somewhat abstract. Still, the final decision is earned and clearly costs him his former, if stagnant, life.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—whether Isera will obey duty or the dangerous summons of her dreams—is signaled early and sharpened by the seer’s “final warning” and the implied cost of inaction (“the sky would bleed out”). Escalation is clear: she first rejects court obligations, then rejects physical safety by refusing to shelter from the storm, then walks into an uncanny chamber where reality itself is at stake. Costs (political abandonment, risk to her party, existential risk) remain largely implied rather than dramatized in consequence. Still, her agency drives each tightening beat and closure feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Lio can meaningfully capture and carry the emotional density of this place/relationship as his friends leave—is clear and sharpened by the reveal of the orbital assignment and the request to imprint the shell. Escalation is primarily internal and conceptual: the tension rises when “leave” is named, when Kira reframes it as “You are going, and I am following,” and when she calls him “reckless enough” to do what they’re asking. However, the scene stops at a charged poise; Lio’s pivot in intention is strong, but no explicit on-page acceptance, refusal, or concrete risk-taking action is taken yet. As a quiet, lyric piece this is functional, but it falls short of a truly pressured, cost-bearing turn.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether he can keep his fractured timelines from “breeding” and maintain some coherent narrative self—is clear early and tightened when the grave memory returns in full and he recognizes his future selves as predatory. Pressure escalates from passive recall in the bunk to active confrontation: he chooses to put on his boots, go outside, loosen gravity, and hover over the graves, accepting the psychic cost of seeing all his possible deaths at once. That action produces a credible deepening of stakes via jealousy and the recognition of his role as archivist of chaos. Still, the conflict remains almost entirely internal and conceptual; there’s no distinct reversal or external counterforce that would push this into higher-stakes territory.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—how to live with time after losing a beloved guide—is legible early and sharpened when he admits he can only “read charts and schedules” while life now feels blank. Escalation is quiet but effective: the move from talking about brokenness to literally altering the oldest clock is the key tightening, forcing him to accept a non-rational but emotionally necessary act. The cost is his partial surrender of physics-only comfort in favor of a ritual that feels superstitious yet needed. Pressure never spikes dramatically, but at this length the deepening is sufficient and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Lan can use this perilous ceremony to rewrite his relationship to his scars and superstitions—is clear early and deepens through the two rune-writing attempts. Escalation is largely internal but legible: from first tentative rune (Face and Flame) to the warmer, more empowered second (Question bound to Plenty), under the hovering threat of the storm and the testing gust. The cost is the relinquishing of old protective beliefs and shame, and the story acknowledges that future storms will still test him, avoiding a soft reset. The external danger of the storm remains more atmospheric than fully weaponized, but it still supports pressure rather than feeling ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Mirabel will keep monetizing Liora’s haunting or meaningfully confess—is legible early and tightens as the archive’s metaphoric “voice” throws her own tactics back at her. Pressure escalates when the currents start speaking in her column’s style, turning her strengths into knives and forcing a choice of what kind of story to tell. The final send is an earned, high‑cost stance crystallization, but the orchard/board’s expectations stay largely atmospheric rather than directly pressing her decisions, keeping the conflict primarily internal. One more concrete consequence or immediate risk (e.g., what she stands to lose professionally) on the page would sharpen perceived stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether No-One can reconcile diverging timelines before another reset—is clear and escalates through the universe’s hiccup and the opening of the chamber he has “never entered in all the ages he recalled.” Pressure rises when galaxies blink and the histories press against his mind, and his refusal to flinch in the spiral is a credible act of agency. However, the conflict remains primarily conceptual and largely uncontested; there are no serious false steps, reversals, or costs that force him into a hard trade-off on the page. The result is intellectually gripping but not maximally tense.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether he will submit to the clocks’ illusion of time or resist—emerges early and tightens meaningfully around the key. Pressure escalates texturally via dreams, uncanny details (key grown to pipe, razor-edged seconds), and the counting ritual, culminating in his near-recognition of the “crystal” horizon and the key’s true purpose. The choice to set the key down is a credible, pressured renunciation, though the conflict is primarily conceptual and quiet rather than dramatically jagged. The internal vs institutional tension is clear, but the on-page sense of risk could be marginally sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether to maintain the perimeter or open the dock—emerges early and tightens effectively through the laser-pointer temptation and Rae’s quiet counterpressure. Internal and external conflicts are well braided: corporate conditioning and fear of intrusion versus the visible hunger on the monitors. The escalation is essentially one clean tightening rather than multiple turns, with the decisive act being the override and door opening. Stakes remain mostly ethical and conceptual; potential material risks (the farm’s security, community, or legal consequences) are only implied, softening the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—how she will orient herself toward her father and the ethics of chance after his heart attack—is clear from the outset and deepens throughout. Pressure escalates quietly but distinctly: from avoidance and grading inertia, to the disorienting library note, to the subway’s unsolicited “advice,” to the confrontation with her father’s conscious “experiments.” Her decisive act is to answer his contradiction with her own line about terrible odds and staying, foreclosing the easier path of distance or cynicism. The stakes are intimate rather than dramatic, but the emotional trade-off is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central stake—whether Mara stays trapped in a self-defeating loop or rewrites her ending—is clear and introduced in time. Pressure escalates modestly but coherently: from wrong-number apology, to confession of the affair’s recurrence, to the streetlamp-based ritual that forces a binary decision in real time. Lena’s agency drives the turn, and the cost (foreclosing the affair’s familiar comfort and uncertainty) is legible even if understated. What holds this below the highest band is the overall low-intensity feel—there’s little sense that the choice could go wrong or that Lena might fail, so tension never truly tightens around risk.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central stake—whether the archivist can meaningfully renew the covenant and retrieve/affirm what was lost with Mara—is clear and scaled well to the length. Pressure escalates from quiet observational duty to a risky, liminal act (steeping the photo, inviting the sea’s answer) to the emotionally loaded encounter with Mara, then to the choice to continue writing under that new weight. The cost is emotional and vocational rather than physical, but it’s explicit: she accepts an intensified burden of remembering “what people are afraid to admit they felt.” The conflict remains more contemplative than combative; it tightens convincingly but never quite reaches a knife’s-edge decision point.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central stake—Kenji’s loneliness versus the ethical constraint of reciprocity—is clear, and the proposed experiment raises the emotional risk by demanding unpostable truths from strangers. Pressure escalates texturally as more people step forward, each truth making Kenji “heavier,” which is an effective internal-cost signal. However, options never feel sharply narrowed; there is no meaningful chance that he will break the oath, flee, or refuse the role being asked of him. The conflict stays gently contemplative rather than truly testing anyone’s limits, which keeps the tension from matching the conceptual ambition.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether he can truly navigate his own and others’ emotional depths—is clear and steadily tightened by the accumulating emotional voices and the ring’s increasing heaviness. The conflict is primarily internal but tethered to concrete sensory pressures (bone-deep hum, notes, silence), and the realization that the compass points inward is a genuine deepening. The on-page cost is mostly psychological (facing guilt, choosing to stay with his own interior), which reads as real but could be made slightly more visceral or behaviorally risky. Still, escalation from abstract desire to a specific, costly stance is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether and how he can redeem misplanted “seeds” of his life—emerges early and tightens when the pen proves able to revise history only “along the grain of possibility.” The brother scene provides a concrete moral test, with a clear before/after and visible emotional cost. Later edits are more summarized, so the on-page pressure doesn’t escalate through multiple distinct crises; instead, it deepens conceptually. This keeps tension slightly abstract but still strong enough for this length and mode.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Lena can transform oppressive silence into something she can bear and understand—is clear and emotionally grounded. Pressure deepens when she begins signing not words but the “spaces between words,” forcing her to surface painful memories. However, escalation is gentle: there’s little sense of a live alternative path or potential failure, more a foregone, if difficult, unfolding. The resolution is earned, but the story would benefit from one more sharpened moment where continuing or stopping the ritual feels like a real choice.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator will continue a pattern of annihilation or pivot to radical preservation—is clear and tightened as vandalized objects reframe the arson. Escalation comes through conceptual deepening rather than reversals: the pattern in the defacements, the self-portrait echo, and finally the tapestry that literalizes the forgotten promise. The cost of the final choice (lifelong, off-grid caretaking work to atone) lands, though it’s more existential than situational. A slightly more acute sense of alternatives or external risk could have sharpened the pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—mental autonomy vs. being subsumed into a steered collective dream—is clear and sharpened by the revelation of Chorus’s “true purpose.” Escalation comes through deepening knowledge and agency: discovery of entangled memories, recognition of their exploitability, then deliberate repurposing via drumming to push back. Tension is more philosophical and textural than visceral; there’s little concrete on-page risk or immediate repercussion for her act, so the cost reads as anticipatory rather than felt. As a result, the conflict is strong but not fully harrowing at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.0)
    The external stakes—find the inspectors or the port shuts down—are clear and tied to Milo’s agency, and the “whispers vs shouts” wager gives a neat conceptual edge. There is one meaningful tightening when radios fail and Milo must rely on his odd tools and prior preparation. However, the conflict never truly bites: his methods work on the first try, the inspectors adjust without resistance, and there’s no reversal or complication testing his premise. As a result, the stakes feel real on paper but slightly under-experienced on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central stake—whether regret calcifies or is risked in confession—is clearly articulated in “the hour when regret either hardened to stone or softened toward change.” Pressure escalates as random shutter noise becomes intentional patterning, then is answered by the guardian’s light-work, cornering the dentist into a choice. The phone call is a genuine, earned narrowing of options with emotional cost. Conflict is primarily internal and quiet, so while effective, it never quite hits a razor-edge moment of real potential refusal on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—saving the hillside woods—appears early and tightens coherently through the choice of a quiet, indirect tactic (the window forest). The escalation from private perception to town-wide, synchronized action is well-paced and climaxes effectively in the council’s balcony-view and vote. Internal/external conflicts interweave, but Daniel rarely faces a stark trade-off or real personal jeopardy, so the felt price remains relatively gentle. Still, the rejection of louder, confrontational tactics in favor of quiet influence is a clear, earned stance.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will allow herself to be “unlocked” and face her buried nature—is clear and coherent from the first page. Pressure escalates as she chooses to return at low tide, get into the skiff, and finally accept the intensely intimate act of holding the bone and revisiting her self-denials. The external situation (island sinking/appearing) remains relatively low-friction, with no substantial reversal or concrete loss beyond implied inner risk. The piece relies on deepening rather than sharp turns, which works but keeps escalation in the solid rather than exceptional band.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—creating space for unsanctioned grief without triggering the Mandate—is clear and organically woven into each beat. Conflict escalates modestly as Mara questions the performer’s actions, nearly laughs, and explicitly raises the risk of being reported, leading to the quiet but real decision to let the easing remain. The performer’s tactics (narration, whittling, the hybrid object) deepen the paradox of “lightness in grief” under surveillance. However, the external threat never sharpens into a more concrete test or narrowing of options, keeping the pressure controlled rather than truly tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Lio will collaborate with the rehabilitated regime or reclaim language on his own terms—is clear and present early via the invitation to offer a “poem of gratitude.” Tension accumulates effectively through his approach, memories of repression, and the room’s charged responsiveness, with the main tightening occurring when he begins his speech and pointedly refuses the script. The final turn (stepping away from the lectern, “leaving his sanctioned role behind”) is a real stance crystallization but reads as quietly inevitable rather than hard-won under visible pressure. Escalation could be sharpened by one more concrete challenge or live temptation to comply before he chooses against it.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—whether Mira can transform “something that cannot be forgiven” into something bearable—is strong and thematically potent. Pressure escalates from generalized obsolescence to a specific, impossible-sounding task, then into the bodily intrusion of the phoenix’s note. However, once she begins painting, resistance feels relatively low; the process reads more as a visionary flow than a fraught struggle, and the price she pays is implied rather than sharply dramatized. This keeps tension persuasive but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elya can find an authentic way to enact this “artificial pilgrimage” she half-distrusts—is clear from early on. Pressure escalates when she consciously questions the guide/pilgrim assumption and again when the visitor arrives early, forcing her to choose between the prescribed protocol and a riskier, improvisational path. The decisive choice to abandon the score and proceed “if there is no map” provides a genuine tightening, foreclosing the safer institutional route. The emotional and practical costs are implied more than dramatized, so the conflict feels finely wrought but not quite searing.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Ela will remain pinned in grief or find a way to reorient it toward motion—is clear and sustained. Pressure escalates via the unbearable method of embedding forgotten dates and ash in the origami, culminating in the meteor-lit revelation where her painstaking trail becomes visible and reweighted. The cost of the process (being forced to “navigate the constellations of her own failures”) is articulated but largely summarized rather than dramatized in discrete, testing moments. As a result, tension feels deep but somewhat smoothed rather than sharply escalating through visible on-page crises.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—how to live and believe after the crash, and whether Mara will keep her project abstract or admit its personal implications—is clear and coheres. Pressure tightens when she confesses that her spreads circle back to “us,” forcing a choice between guarded solitude and collaborative vulnerability, and Jonas’s request to “teach me to read it” crystallizes that turn. However, the cost of her choice is more implied than sharply felt on the page, keeping the tension relatively gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Hiran will obey the doctrine of randomness and self-protection or consciously embrace pattern and its psychic cost to aid a collapsing world—is clearly signaled and tightens as he opens doors in order. His choice to abandon sanctioned methods and become a “conduit” is a true escalation, raising both personal and civilizational stakes. The final vow to stay below and carry all the patterns alone forecloses significant options with visible cost. A slightly more concrete sense of what he sacrifices in terms of relationships or specific alternatives would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—what to do with an unbound shadow that embodies a lost future—is clear and tightens as Lio discovers Lane’s identity and absence. Escalation is primarily internal and conceptual but there is a real turn when he realizes what the shadow represents and then chooses to let it inhabit him. The cost is palpable (carrying others’ lost futures, “luminous regret burning through each word”) even if not yet paid out in concrete consequences. The only limitation is that the danger or urgency of the shadow to the Archive or Lio is implied more than dramatized, so pressure stays at a quiet but effective level.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—how Liora will live with her complicity—is legible early and coheres throughout. Pressure tightens around the decision about the chameleon’s tail, which forces her to choose between private self-soothing and a more exposed, communal reckoning. The cost is clear: she relinquishes her last uncontested “good act” to be judged alongside her harms. The escalation remains internal and quiet, but it tracks plausibly and culminates in a meaningful narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara can keep pursuing “closure” without harming people—emerges early and is steadily tightened by the failed surgery, the accusatory plants, and the visions in the coffee ring. While external conflict is minimal, internal pressure escalates convincingly as each element invalidates her old practices. The decisive turn is her acceptance that she must stop forcing closure and instead read what already exists, an earned renunciation with real cost. The piece remains contemplative, but within that mode the escalation and resulting stance crystallization are clear.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—resolving what happens to unused love—remains clear throughout and deepens as she sees others’ unsent gestures and her own younger self. Pressure escalates via the intensifying visions and the uncanny projection on the booth wall, culminating in a reconfiguration of how she relates to her own goodbyes. However, the conflict is largely contemplative; Mara never faces a tight either/or or a visibly costly trade-off on the page, so the tension is more meditative than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether to open the self and release a dangerous backlog of ideas—is clear early and tightens continuously. Escalation comes through sharpening inner pressure and environmental intensity (murmurs resolving into a single sentence, aurora narrowing to a tunnel, stars plunging into the astrolabe) until the narrator’s choice to surrender becomes inevitable. The cost is legible: loss of hoarded possibilities and the risk of self-erasure versus communal enrichment and inner space. Conflict stays internal and contemplative rather than combative, but within that mode it escalates well.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake is the narrator’s need to find or create meaning in a world where the trains, forests, and prior purpose are gone, and this is signaled early (“dreamless freight guard with no trains left to protect”). Pressure escalates texturally: empty watch → eerie possibilities and other selves → active intervention with sparks → accepting an endless role as singer/witness. The cost—remaining awake, tending almost-worlds that may never manifest, and singing into a silence that may not answer—is present but underplayed in a quiet, lyrical register rather than dramatized via sharp turns. The main limitation is that escalation is smooth and atmospheric rather than marked by a clearly decisive on-page test or reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—whether to complete the mechanism and submit to whatever this expanded insight entails—is present and sharpened by the narrator’s brief hesitation. There is a single clear tightening when the forest “leans in” and he decides to insert the gear. Yet external and internal opposition are both gentle; the forest reads as welcoming, and his fear is fleeting, so the pressure never quite bites. The outcome feels intriguing but low-cost, limiting tension and escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will risk stepping into an unknown life rather than inheriting the shop—is signaled and followed through via her flight and choice to descend. Escalation is mostly internal and textural (burning lungs, bruise-colored twilight, increasingly painful memories on each step) rather than driven by external obstacles, which suits the mode but keeps pressure relatively gentle. The key tightening is her commitment to walk the inner stair despite accumulating scenes of past cowardice. Cost is implied more than dramatized, so the conflict feels quietly resolved rather than sharply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—safety via enforced silence versus dangerous, liberating speech—is legible early and sharpened explicitly in the guest’s “remain quiet / speak” framing. Pressure escalates from a small anomaly to a forbidden transgression to the revelation that his own “choice” of silence was coercive, culminating in a binary decision with massive cost. The protagonist’s final act of speech, rather than an accident, drives the destructive resolution. Internal and external conflicts are well braided; if anything, the external storms’ concrete effects remain slightly abstract compared to the inner turn.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—preventing a pretender from quietly solidifying claim while the cosmos is paused—is clear and intrinsically high. Pressure accumulates through the titan’s increasing manipulation of texts and the need for truth to “move faster than the frozen stars,” culminating in the scholar’s interpretive crisis. However, the conflict remains almost entirely uncontested: nothing actively pushes back against the titan, and there’s no moment where a tactic fails or an alternative path is foreclosed on the page. The piece reads more as a meticulous setup paying off in recognition than as a tested struggle, which keeps escalation from entering truly high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—decoding why the ocean’s remembered paths are vanishing—remains coherent, and pressure builds via increasingly uncanny discrepancies (data slips, buoy drift, the note about rhythm) culminating in the risky, belief-testing rooftop experiment. Escalation is primarily internal and conceptual, but the narrator’s decision to act on an irrational-seeming hypothesis (tapping in rhythm with obsolete lanes) is a genuine tightening of commitment. The cost is mostly prospective and psychological—accepting that the sea may literally respond to rhythm—so the turn lands more as charged poise than as a hard trade-off. That softens but doesn’t erase the sense of meaningful deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether to let the rebellion’s lull congeal into defeat or to risk quietly reigniting it—is clear but largely internal and contemplative. Pressure deepens via the stones’ hum and the flood of remembered images, which nudge Liora from philosophical musing to concrete action. However, external stakes (risk of surveillance, punishment, betrayal) remain abstract, so the perceived danger of opening the secret channel never fully tightens on the page. The escalation from watching to acting is earned and meaningful, but the sense of price could be made more visceral to heighten tension.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the embryo will reimpose implanted destinies or be transformed/released—is clear early and deepens nicely with the plants’ fear and the revelation of past “shackles.” Pressure escalates through the decoding quest and the partial unraveling ritual, then tightens when the council arrives wanting to use the embryo to restore order. The protagonist’s choice to ask the embryo’s will and then dissolve its destiny is a meaningful renunciation that forecloses an apparently stabilizing path. However, the confrontation with the council is resolved very quickly and mostly through narration rather than friction, which keeps the tension more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.4)
    The core stake—can she inhabit a future honestly, without erasing the wedding massacre or being frozen by it—is clear and present from early on. Pressure escalates texturally rather than via big reversals: the gull-triggered freeze, the recognition that drones and trauma are permanent, then the counterweight of sea lavender and children at the tram window. Her agency at the end—folding but keeping the photo, and leaving under her own power—forecloses the fantasy of erasure while rejecting total surrender to fear. The conflict stays largely internal and quiet, but the narrowing of options (no magical safety, no denial) and the cost of chosen endurance read clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.3)
    The primary conflict—whether and how Elias can reconfigure a self shattered by grief—remains coherent and guides the whole piece. Pressure escalates modestly through the tremor in the stone, the tightening room, and his choice to dim the light and physically descend, but there is no sharp external test of his resolve. The tarot spread and the book’s method function as a concrete framework for his internal struggle, giving the stakes some tactile shape. The cost of his choice (accepting a divided self) is felt but could be dramatized with one more specific, painful renunciation on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Iren can understand and possibly step outside the Crisis Slow—is established early and tightened by the ink experiment and elders’ proposition. Escalation operates more through deepening understanding and stakes of identity than through overt reversals: the key turn is his realization that time “is disappearing and reappearing,” followed by the opportunity to exploit that pattern at personal cost. External conflict (raiders, danger) remains mostly conceptual, blunting visceral tension, but the internal conflict between rage at a rationing universe and willingness to become its edge gives the ending weight. His final choice forecloses ordinary embodiment and aligns with his outsider status, which reads as a credible earned stance.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Ana preserves or destroys a dangerous fragment of outlawed intimacy—is clear early and meaningfully tightens when the system pings for an incineration update. Internal and external conflicts braid well: indoctrination and fear of punishment versus attraction to the forbidden letter and its thesis about love as memory. Her final act of subversive dissemination is a genuine turn that forecloses safety. Escalation is more internal-ethical than situationally reactive, but it tracks and pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara can establish and maintain a pacifist, value-infused sanctuary amid post-collapse violence—is clear and threads throughout. Pressure escalates texturally: first inheriting enemies/debts, then facing her father’s comrades’ expectations, finally raiders trying to claim the dome. Her agency is consistent (repurposing tools, welcoming hunters with tea, “sheathing” inherited violence into plants), and the eventual refusal of violence by raiders demonstrates her stance’s impact. The escalation is still relatively gentle, with no singular crucible moment where her neutrality is seriously threatened on the page, which keeps the stakes from fully biting.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are clear from early on (the chance to ask an unanswerable question) and pressure tightens as he reaches the garden’s throat, freezes the waves, and the echo floods him with others’ unanswered questions. The key turn—choosing not to transliterate and not to ask—emerges logically from the accumulated strain between his gift and his uncertainty. The cost is present but somewhat interiorized; nothing in the world visibly collapses or changes beyond the new rhythms, which keeps tension more meditative than harrowing. Still, within a lyric mode, escalation is coherent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central conflict—reveal Orpheus and implicate her family or stay silent and preserve the oppressive system—is sharply defined and tightened through the conversation. The proof-by-contradiction sequence escalates stakes from abstract ethics to a specific decision about the story. The cost (betraying her father’s legacy and exposing the paper) is legible even if not yet paid. What keeps this shy of the top band is the lack of on-page opposing force beyond memory and principle; there’s no present-tense resistance pushing back in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator will let the haunted firmware continue to torture her with echoes or risk offering it her most precious recording—is clear and escalates coherently. Pressure tightens with the impossible baby monitor cry, the explicit accusation (“Where did you put me, why did you erase me”), and the discovery of the failsafe note forcing a specific, high-cost option. Internal and external conflicts (technology as both archive and predator; love vs. self-protection) interweave effectively. The only shortfall is that opposition never fully adapts or pushes back after the voicemail begins playing; the firmware’s “surrender” is more implied than actively contested.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.0)
    The core stake—whether Lark will remain a whimsical, essentially harmless observer or accept a more ethically fraught role as interpreter of others’ secrets—is present early and crystallizes by the end. Escalation is mainly internal but marked: contact with the shard, the intensified hush, the choice to break ritual silence, and finally to inscribe the whispers into the mandala. The boy’s confession introduces a concrete emotional risk; her interjection and decision to draw are genuine, if subtle, acts of defiance and commitment. The conflict could be pushed one notch further by foregrounding potential social or spiritual consequences of her intervention.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—the city’s entrapment in a traumatic past and whether its relationship to the fire can be redefined—is clear and sharpened when Laleh realizes “the city was not merely ruined but retrocognitively trapped.” Escalation is primarily internal/conceptual: the visions intensify the problem, and the renaming ritual is the singular tightening beat that reweights everything. However, external resistance is minimal; no one or nothing meaningfully pushes back in the moment, so cost and risk stay somewhat abstract. The resolution is earned, but tension operates more as mood and idea than as strongly contested on-page conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving the theater’s magic and stories from corporate gutting—is clear and emotionally legible. Pressure escalates modestly from atmospheric haunting to a specific, time-sensitive plan involving the coin and Marcel’s fragmented nights. However, there is little on-page resistance: Marcel’s acquiescence comes quickly, and no alternative path or sharp trade-off is dramatized beyond the implicit danger of tampering with timelines. As a result, tension feels like a steady hum rather than a tightening screw, capping the conflict’s intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Eli will be consumed by unwanted telepathic residues or find a way to ethically channel them—is clear and pursued. Pressure escalates when he enters the web of audience feelings and locates the “knot” of shared hurt, moving from abstract burden to a concrete test of agency. The decision to redirect that knot and accept that he may also affect others is an earned, if quiet, turn. The risk and downside of failure are more conceptual than visceral, which keeps the stakes emotionally a notch lower than they could be.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Iri can meaningfully map and address what comes after humanity—is clear but manifests as quiet existential pressure rather than sharp conflict. Escalation is present in the discovery that something non-human has been moving through the caves, which reframes their task and leads to the offering at the pool. However, no concrete alternative paths are dramatically foreclosed and little is visibly risked beyond solitude and uncertainty. The piece earns a solid deepening but not a strong sense of on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—wresting the future away from a single canonical prophecy—is clear and emotionally legible, and the pressure coheres as Mara moves from theft toward an unplanned, riskier act (releasing the echo). Escalation is primarily internal: the key tightening is her reinterpretation of the echo and of “shared wisdom,” which transforms her plan from controlled theft into a more radical, uncontrollable release. External conflict is minimal (no active guard threat or physical setback), so tension relies heavily on concept and atmosphere rather than concrete reversals. The cost of her choice is implied (destabilizing order, possible punishment) rather than directly confronted in the moment, keeping the stakes slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—what Elias will do with his burned status and Mara’s possible fate—tightens as he decodes the snow, realizes the field maps his betrayals, and finds the second pillbox with its key and credo. The pressure is largely internal but coherent: will he cling to the Bureau’s discard logic or adopt Mara’s dangerous “fix what breaks” ethic. The major deepening turn is the discovery of the pillbox and “Fix what breaks,” leading to his decision not to rush but to hold a new kind of courage. The conflict never becomes sharply agonistic on the page, which keeps the tension more contemplative than searing.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether and how the coachman can bear and transform yet another charged crossing, here a mother’s letting-go of a dying child—is clear and steadily pressured. Escalation tracks the skiff’s approach through to the mother’s unspoken plea and his internal act of holding that new promise against the old, which is a genuine tightening of emotional stakes. However, the conflict remains almost entirely internal and contemplative; his “choice” is more an acceptance of his role than a visibly contested turning point. The subtlety works, but there’s no moment where an alternative path feels sharply live on the page, which keeps the pressure strong rather than searing.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are primarily moral and conceptual: whether small kindnesses can tilt timelines toward life in a dying world, localized in this oasis. Pressure escalates via the contrast between honey-rich and ash-stripped timelines and the specific micro-choices (watering bees vs. swatting one) that carry large consequences. His final decision to actively seed the hives with clay and wildflower seeds is a meaningful tightening of commitment, foreclosing passive observation. The main limitation is that opposition remains abstract—there is little immediate risk or counterforce beyond the ambient harshness of the world.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.2)
    The conflict is quiet and internal—between Mara’s habitual, almost anonymous caretaking and her newly articulated desire to actively “reflect light into dark corners.” The last petal and the moonlight strike act as a clear tightening point where stasis can no longer hold, prompting a concrete, irreversible action (transforming the garden’s function). Stakes remain personal but tangible: she risks emotional exposure and possible ridicule in exchange for offering safety and beauty. The escalation is subtle yet legible under an accumulative/textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central conflict—whether solitude is a dead end or a resource—is clear and sharpened by the apparition’s warning about isolation-as-purity killing a world. Pressure escalates when Lio confronts the impossibility of reviving extinct species and must pivot to creating a harbor for unknown future arrivals. The decisive internal shift—choosing to “feed [the library’s] movements with my own decisions” and tie independence to resisting despair—earns the ending. Stakes remain primarily conceptual and emotional rather than situationally urgent, but the deepening is substantial for the scope.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—whether and how she can give the structure a voice that genuinely reconnects people while addressing her own burden—is clear but quiet. Pressure deepens rather than spikes: the architect’s confessionary line about “whatever keeps people from each other” and his implied loss sharpen what the letter must hold. The choice to write a letter that is for “whoever steps onto the path” and also for herself and the missing architect-figure constitutes a real, if understated, narrowing of options. Still, the conflict remains mostly internal and reflective, with limited sense of risk beyond emotional exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central stake—who controls the tower and thus the Void—is clear and steadily pressured via admin plans, senate opposition, and the live debate overhead. Escalation comes from Mara’s choice to exploit the conflict as bait, adding a moral/strategic dimension rather than just observing. Her agency at the peak is undeniable, but the immediate cost of this interference is more implied than felt. The conflict tilts cerebral rather than visceral, which slightly mutes tension at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether he can move through a hostile, mutinous space despite claustrophobia to reach a transformative “key”—is signaled early and sharpened as the architecture grows more uncanny. Escalation is clear: canyon pressure → three-way fork with lethal implications → reconfiguring chamber → staircase that forces him to choose between skyward safety and deeper danger. His final choice is an internal but decisive act of agency under pressure, with fear and desire in direct conflict. The slightly muted sense of concrete external jeopardy (what happens if he fails) keeps this from an even higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Jonas’s method can stir a response in or around this cold case—is clear but mostly internal and conceptual. Pressure accumulates through his philosophy, Rhea’s skepticism, and the eerie setting rather than through discrete turns. The one tangible tightening is the late stone slip, which retroactively charges his efforts with possible immediate danger or contact. Escalation is present but understated, so the scene feels more like a poised prelude than a fully tested crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Liora can reclaim Tamar’s erased bravery and reframe their shared “exile”—is lucid and tightened by the revelation that this station was once an exile platform. The key deepening comes when the encoded coordinates match the station and “reversible exile” proves real, followed by the director’s evasive “officially,” which clarifies institutional opposition. Liora’s agency at the end (tagging Tamar’s crest into the live data stream) is a meaningful, if quiet, act of resistance with a conceptual cost: she commits to a subversive career under a hostile system. The conflict could feel even more pressurized with one tangible on-page consequence or risk to that act.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—can the fiddler in any meaningful sense save or “free” the hitchhiker from fragmentation—is clear and escalates from eerie unease to an ethical and metaphysical dilemma. Pressure meaningfully tightens when the glass projects multiple possible deaths and survivals, forcing him into the heavy choice of “which frames to forgive” and driving him to play harder, risking his bow and instrument. The climax (flake shattering, then footsteps and reappearance) is earned by his agency, though the cost is mostly emotional/existential rather than concretely dramatized. Slightly higher stakes might be felt if the risk to himself (physical, relational, or spiritual) were a bit sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.8)
    The primary stake—how the narrator will interpret and live with failure and inherited patterns—is clear, and the pressure tightens from investor loss → Lila’s departure → solitary return to the train. Escalation is more deepening than reversal, appropriate to an accumulative/lyric mode, culminating in the bills’ transformation from asset to “apologies.” However, conflict stays internal and largely reflective; there’s little sense of an alternative path he might yet choose or reject on the page, which slightly blunts the feeling of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stakes—decode the inscriptions or lose funding, discover whether the dreams have meaning, and face one’s own psychic burden—are clear and braid together. Pressure deepens as the mapping reveals a pattern of disasters, recontextualizing the temple as a ledger of suffering and raising the emotional weight of the work. However, the conflict remains low-friction: there’s little resistance, no real possibility of tactical failure, and no on-page moment where the protagonist must choose between viable, costly options. The escalation is more in interpretive intensity than in concrete jeopardy, which works but limits force at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the missing moment of his sister’s disappearance and testing the magician’s confession—remains coherent and tight. Pressure escalates through knowledge rather than obstacles: from general curse, to sensing the orchard, to discovering the seed’s hunger and its role in preserving the lie. Arlen’s main act of agency is attentional and verbal (refusing the magician’s framing and offering his own confession), which fits the design but keeps the immediate felt cost relatively soft. There’s no concrete trade-off or lost option dramatized at the end, which limits the intensity of the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central conflict—whether to destroy or preserve a world-transforming maze—is strong and clearly escalated by the vision sequence that lays out concrete future costs on both sides. Pressure coheres around Lio’s need for actionable proof vs the narrator’s haunted awareness of covenant-scale consequences. The final refusal of the binary (“We cannot cut or keep it”) is an earned moral deepening rather than a dodge. Still, the escalation stops at conceptual reweighting; we don’t see a specific new course of action or immediate sacrifice, which slightly mutes perceived cost.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—transforming the narrator’s relationship to their own guilt—is legible early and tightens as they move from rumor to confession to undergoing the ritual. Escalation is primarily internal and atmospheric: the remembered drowning, the altar revealing itself as a “mouth,” the roots responding, and the light under the card all deepen the sense of risk. The cost at the end is clear and asymmetrical (Lio older, narrator steadier), which sharpens the ethical stakes around his compassion. The narrator’s agency after agreeing to the ritual is relatively static, which slightly softens peak-pressure feel despite the strong emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—how Eli will position this amp and, by extension, his own past and value—is clear and coherently pressured by the livestream failure and his financial precarity. Tension escalates from routine appraisal to the shock of recognition to the ethically and emotionally loaded choice of wording. The cost is mostly internal (accepting that his story matters more than fame or external proof), which fits the piece but keeps the sense of jeopardy muted. A slightly sharper external pressure (e.g., explicit company expectations) could heighten the crunch without changing the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure escalates coherently from curiosity to direct mortal/ontological risk: the guide’s death reframes the arbor, the seed experiment invites a more intimate response, and the membrane forces Mara to choose her stance. The dominant stake—how far she’ll go to understand/participate in “transition”—is clear and narrows toward the end. The final choice does foreclose an easier path (simple scientific exploitation or total retreat), but the price remains more implied than viscerally enacted. A touch more tangible jeopardy or loss at the end would push this into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—whether the fisherman’s wandering selves will be reintegrated or lost to the tide—is clear and emotionally legible. Pressure escalates from the abstract problem of unbound identities to a concrete dilemma: return his selves as-were, betray his complexity by choosing one version, or risk dissolution by refusing any choice. The librarian’s decision to “accept the contradictions” and fuse them is a real narrowing of options with stakes attached. The quiet, contemplative tone slightly softens moment-to-moment tension, so the piece feels more meditative than taut, though it still delivers one meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara remains a technician of survival or risks re-evaluating her complicity—is clear and sharpened by Rafi’s invitation. Pressure escalates from professional curiosity to the exposed admission “I am afraid I have spent my life certifying tombs,” with the pearl’s brightening both catalyzing and witnessing that choice. The cost is internal but legible: she can no longer hide from the moral dimension of her work. There is room for one more small beat of resistance or competing obligation before she speaks to heighten the sense of narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how the narrator can live with his ethical failure—is clear early and is tightened by the graffiti message that directly confronts his core misbelief. Pressure escalates not via external obstacles but through increasingly painful self-recognition, culminating in the choice to alter his logging practice and explicitly include his brother and himself. The cost is palpable: he relinquishes the protective story that demonized him as “the event” and must now inhabit a more ambiguous, ongoing responsibility. The conflict remains intensely interior; readers craving an external test of this shift might feel it’s one shade shy of maximal ferocity.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she will treat this place as a mappable object or accept its resistance to capture—is clear and coherently pressured throughout. Escalation is mostly conceptual: her mapping-by-silence gradually reveals the moral dimension of the unsaid, culminating in the choice to abandon documentation and rewrite her relationship to the two letters. The price (career, Council allegiance, self-concept as a documenter) is legible if still somewhat abstract on the page. A single explicit beat where she nearly commits to the Council’s skeptical demand and then pulls back would give the turn a sharper edge.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    The central conflict—authenticate and enable a mythic spectacle versus refuse and let the last trace of the drowned queen vanish—is explicit and grows steadily. Pressure escalates through layered warnings (plants), divination (coffee stains), and the violin’s own “remembering being river,” culminating in Aurelio’s contract demand. Her eventual third-path choice (annotating instead of signing) narrows options for everyone: it jeopardizes the grant and exhibition while also sacrificing definitive historical closure. Stakes are moral, professional, and metaphysical, and the cost is felt even in this quiet, lyric form.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—allowing each skyfarer one truthful, liminal expression—is clear early, and it tightens sharply when the final body is revealed as Isren and the chip is failing. Her agency in choosing to proceed, shifting the chip to his sternum and entering the threshold with him, escalates both external and internal pressure. The cost is strongly implied but not quite dramatized beyond that poised final instant. Tension is sustained, but the climb from professional duty to personal crisis could use one more explicit inner crux to reach higher.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether caretaking and forgiveness can lead to rest/contentment—is clear from early on and tightens at the confrontation with the old woman. Escalation is primarily internal: from restless drive, to the challenge (“you still seek contentment as a reward”), to the revelatory burden of many lives and roles. Her agency in inserting the hairpin into the smoke column is the key turn that changes knowledge and thus options. Pressure is more contemplative than urgent, but for a lyric piece the cost and renunciation at the end are sufficiently legible.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara can tolerate living without a clean moral verdict—is clear from her hiring the narrator and her demand to be told she was right or wrong. Pressure tightens as the narrator forces her off rehearsed stories into naming raw fear, and the chime reading escalates from descriptive ritual into a reframing of the choice as “different debts, different griefs.” The cost is internal but legible: she must accept an unerasable loss without absolution, and the narrator must withhold the binary she begs for. Conflict remains mostly verbal and could tolerate one sharper moment of active resistance, but for this length it still reads as a meaningful deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether and how to learn vanishing without being lost—emerges clearly and intensifies as Mora’s sense of self thins. Escalation operates through deepening trance and growing awareness of the cost (“a self that might choose not to return”), rather than external reversals, which suits the piece’s accumulative design. Elian’s decision to withhold the full vanishing tonight is a meaningful narrowing of options that preserves her life and reframes her desire. The danger is more metaphysical than visceral, but the felt risk of non-return is clear enough to sustain tension.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—can he give this wandering pulse bearings by learning to navigate without moving—is clearly signaled and returns at the end in altered form. Pressure escalates texturally: the waiting, the bird patterns, and the dense echo-mapping gradually force a stance on stillness vs. motion. However, the conflict remains largely contemplative, with no sharp on-page cost beyond foreclosing physical journeying; tension is more meditative than acute. It’s convincing for a lyric piece but does not quite reach the highest bands for felt pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—whether Orren remains a safe custodian in an automated system or risks himself to pursue a fragile, human mode of magic—is clear and threads the whole story. Pressure escalates in concrete steps: ignoring the story-engine’s work, taking the keystone, breaking harness regulations, climbing the anomalous stair, confronting his terror at the ledge. His final step into the mist is a genuine, agency-driven turn that forecloses the stasis option. The main limitation is that the cost (physical danger, loss of institutional safety) is more implied than sharply felt in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will continue to avoid promises or accept the vulnerability of making one—is clear and tightens convincingly as he moves from following the hum to opening the listening-blue book. The key escalation is internal: facing the knowledge that vows persist even in failure, then choosing to add his own. External danger (cold water, shipwreck) is present but not exploited as a true counterforce; the piece leans heavily on existential rather than situational stakes. The result is a strong but gently-pressured conflict arc, more contemplative than tense.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether to cede choice to chance/prophecy or assume full agency at the end of a universe—is clearly established and tightened by the urgent shift in the signal and the explicit warning not to cast again. The conflict escalates from routine ritual to a forced renunciation of the ritual itself, a genuine narrowing of options. The final decision is an earned stance crystallization under pressure, with a visible foreclosure of a former path. Because the pressure remains mostly contemplative rather than embodied or time-critical, it doesn’t quite reach maximal intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—his attempt to atone by naming fears instead of reaping—is clear and consistent, and the first emergence of a fear (being forgotten) is a genuine tightening that concretizes the abstract mission. However, the pressure remains mostly textural; there’s no strong on-page opposition or live alternative he might choose, so his agency feels contemplative rather than embattled. The emotional cost of his endurance does escalate, especially through the memory of the child, but the ritual proceeds smoothly without visible risk or sacrifice in the present scene. This keeps the conflict resonant but relatively low-intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Tamsin can “right a cosmic imbalance” and, in so doing, preserve or shatter her brittle devotion—is clearly signaled and coherently pursued. Escalation is primarily internal and textural: from the initial vow to the bell, through the legend of the viaduct, to the focused act of counting drips as the oceans’ weight seems to tilt toward her. Her agency drives the turn; she chooses to interpret the bell as a sign, to come here despite prior reprimands, and finally to commit to letting it ring with partial understanding of the cost. The main limitation is that no strong counter-pressure (external or internal) seriously threatens to stop her once she begins the ritual, so tension deepens rather than sharply tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the town will confront its drowned past as story rather than erasure—is clear and coheres with Tomas’s grief. Pressure escalates as he follows the photographs from generic resurfacing debris to highly personal memory, culminating in a public moment where he must decide how to frame the crisis. The cost is internal and social rather than physical, but it’s legible: he risks exposing his grief and challenging the council’s preference to “tidy their maps.” The conflict remains relatively quiet and could benefit from one more concrete external pinch, yet it still tightens credibly for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Elian will cling to control or risk aligning with something beyond his equations before the orchard’s deadline—is clear and tight. Pressure escalates from meticulous preparation through the failure of his charts to predict the flock, to the forced choice of trusting his heartbeat over his instruments. His agency at the pivot (closing his eyes, breathing with the birds, turning the lens) directly produces the transformative outcome. The cost is primarily internal and contemplative, not harrowing, which slightly softens the felt intensity for a “final transformation” setup.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.5)
    The conflict between decoding and judging the message versus the risk of mispreserving trust is clear and escalates as the static resolves into coordinates and a weaponized promise. Pressure tightens around timing—too late vs too early—and around her ethical responsibility, with the physical risk mostly backgrounded but present. The final act of filing the report forecloses a path (allowing betrayal) with a felt ethical and emotional price, though a slightly sharper sense of immediate countdown could raise the heat further.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes (custody of the brain, survival vs archival erasure, and Arin’s fight against numbness) are explicit and high from early on. Pressure escalates as the duel moves through increasingly intimate memories, culminating in the decision whether to erase guilt about harming the surgeon. The key tightening is Arin’s refusal to strike when a victory-advancing cut would also sever a core ethical memory, which narrows his options. The external verdict stakes remain slightly abstract in the final beat, but internal and ethical stakes are sharply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake is Elias’s willingness to let an unknown, potentially disruptive force reshape his carefully curated space and, by implication, the town’s relationship to curiosity. Pressure escalates through his delay in opening the envelope, recognition of the corpse flower seed, and the eerie response of brook and mill once it’s planted. The conflict remains largely internal and atmospheric, with no direct antagonist or sharp on-page penalty beyond implied future loss of “comfortable evenings,” which keeps the cost somewhat soft. Still, his decision to plant—rather than discard or contain the seed—is a clear tightening driven by his values.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—coaxing laughter back into a grief-stalled household—is clear and personal, and pressure coheres as Lysander moves from setup to roaring engines to the risky, vulnerable singing. The primary tightening is the transition from building sound to the upstairs reaction; hearing the laughter is the payoff that tests whether his strange method can work. The cost is mostly emotional exposure and the bittersweet realization that his work isn’t done rather than a sharp, on-page dilemma or sacrifice. Stakes are felt and escalate appropriately for this quiet mode, but there’s no major reversal or hard trade-off that would push pressure into the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to return “home” via the corridor of light or remain in familiar uncertainty—is clear and signaled early through dimensional homesickness. Pressure escalates when the pendant reveals the lantern corridor and a second self, forcing a starker choice than abstract yearning. The final answer (“Why not both… I will wait while moving”) is a real stance shift, not a dodge, and it reconfigures the presented binary. Still, the conflict remains almost entirely internal and conceptual; we do not see a concrete, immediate loss, which slightly softens the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Corren will accept his assigned anonymity or seize/repurpose a powerful symbol—is clear from early on, and pressure coheres around the theft and alteration of the crozier. Internal conflict escalates nicely as he moves from approach to physical contact to speaking the final direction, with the risk of unknown magical consequences felt in the sensory intensification. His choice to vivify “unchosen paths” rather than any conventional target is a meaningful trade-off, foreclosing personal gain in favor of diffuse collective change. However, the absence of any responsive force (no wardens intervening, no ritual backfire) keeps the external conflict relatively low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.7)
    The central stake—the city’s wish to fall versus the danger to people—is legible and escalates naturally as the narrator merges with the city’s past and desire. While the mode is accumulative rather than twist-driven, there is a clear tightening when the narrator recognizes the wish to shatter and must choose how to respond. The compromise solution is agentic and ethically fraught, feeling like a genuine trade-off rather than an easy out. Stakes remain slightly abstracted at a human level because no specific valley characters are on the page, but the conceptual pressure is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—Eli trying to steer the ferry to merge timelines rather than merely survive another crossing—is clear and escalates as reality destabilizes. The pressure tightens at the fog’s thickening and the grotto’s entrance, culminating in Eli’s frantic radio tuning and choice of “home.” The cost and risk (potentially losing his perfect-return record and altering passengers’ fates) are conceptually strong but underplayed on the page, keeping the conflict slightly cerebral rather than visceral. Still, one meaningful tightening and a decisive, agency-driven end choice are solidly in place.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—reshaping the memory of a dead loved one without erasing its pain—is clearly planted and steadily tightened. Escalation occurs as the room amplifies and morphs her memories, sharpening the internal conflict between freezing a version of the past (the doorway) and enduring its ongoing edits. The architect functions as a gentle but firm antagonist, forcing a binary at the end that forecloses paths with visible cost. The conflict remains mostly internal and quiet, but the pressure on the final choice is unambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central pressure is internal: whether the narrator will remain within the comfort of familiar, trench-based navigation or risk conceptual disorientation to embrace alien edge geometry. Escalation is modest but present: from reluctance and fatigue, through the eerie lesson at the viewport, to the explicit plea “Teach me to read these edges as I once read waves,” which forecloses a path of clinging solely to old methods. Stakes remain largely intellectual and spiritual rather than materially risky, which slightly softens the sense of cost. Still, the final commitment to a new paradigm—and to guiding future cadets—reads as an earned tightening under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Eren will simply process Lale as data or honor her unfinished message—is clear and tightened as he moves from kiosk to apartment to phone. Pressure escalates texturally as the hearing aid’s “tick” intensifies and the personal nature of the unsent plea emerges. His decision to call Deniz, in defiance of protocol and efficiency, is an earned, agency-driven turn with a moral cost, though the external risk feels low. The conflict remains interior and restrained, which suits the piece but limits perceived stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stakes—survive the tidal window vs. attend to the unremembered presence in the sphere—are clear and compatible. Pressure escalates moderately as Noah descends (tightening spaces, rust, core lab) and as the rig warns of “temporal drift approaching.” However, the conflict never quite crests into a sharp, felt dilemma; the internal debate about whether to stay with the sphere is suggested more than dramatized, and his choice to leave comes swiftly. The piece still maintains steady tension, but a more explicit narrowing of options or concrete near-miss would deepen stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—salvaging some form of Lian before the servers are shut down—is clear and tightly braided with his internal stakes (fear of another “death” and of his own failure). Pressure escalates from static and silence to last-night deadline, algorithmic impasse, sudden ink insight, and then the risky re-coding that strains the system and finally yields her fractured voice. The decisive turn is his choice to abandon linear reconstruction and risk a nonlinear, self-voting algorithm, which narrows options and changes the nature of what “success” can be. Because the institutional/external consequences stay implicit, the conflict feels mainly internal and conceptual, which slightly limits the sense of price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving a dying language at the risk of being absorbed by it via the cursed diamond—is clear and grows more acute once his voice begins to braid into the canyon’s. The meaningful tightening comes when he recognizes the curse’s true nature (intertwinement) and actively chooses to “harness that merging” instead of withdrawing. Still, the conflict remains largely internal and conceptual, with little on-page struggle before he embraces the burden, which softens the sense of hard trade-off. Tension is steady and deepening, but not razor-edged.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding what is “taking” the missing people—appears early and tightens as the narrator moves inward from threshold to heart of the garden. The chief deepening is the realization that the missing have become seeds of a mountain-scale chorus, which reweights the initial threat premise. That said, conflict is almost entirely epistemic; there’s little sense of a hard choice or price in the moment beyond internal horror and wonder. Pressure is strong for a lyric piece but doesn’t fully crystallize into a difficult decision on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Lio’s music remains palliative or becomes liberatory—emerges clearly and tightens when the orchard asks “uproot us,” forcing him to commit to a world-altering act. Escalation is strong in external terms (roots snapping, statues transforming, city power failing), and his continued playing under strain gives him agency at the peak. However, the internal/moral conflict is comparatively soft: there’s little on-page reckoning with fear of consequences or loyalty to the machinists, so the price of his choice feels more conceptual than viscerally tested. The pressure remains coherent but could cut sharper through competing goods or fears.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether and how to use the bottled storm to recalibrate broken promises in a war-shocked town—is clear and coherently stressed. Pressure tightens from general border risk to the very local, concrete danger of uncorking the storm above unclaimed letters under a damaged ceiling. Eren’s cautionary objection (“storms are not polite guests”) productively complicates Mara’s desire to heal, yoking physical danger to moral and emotional stakes. Escalation is primarily conceptual rather than event-driven, and because no decisive act occurs, the felt price remains slightly abstract rather than fully bitten into.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.5)
    Conflict is primarily internal: Eli versus his fear of emptiness and speech, and his mistrust of “miracles” versus his devotion to repairable things. Pressure escalates once—when he decides to sing and keep singing as the halo and carousel respond—narrowing his options and forcing emotional exposure. However, the stakes remain very safe and mostly conceptual; there’s little sense of what he might lose beyond staying stuck as he was. A more tangible or risky consequence for failure (even symbolically) would sharpen the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—whether Mariel can locate “the place where stories live”—is clear and followed through to an answer. Pressure builds texturally via accumulation of star-marked hesitations culminating in the poet’s walk and the air “fold[ing] inward,” a satisfying deepening under the chosen lens. However, there is minimal sense of risk, opposition, or genuine alternative paths; nothing threatens her goal beyond the possibility of never quite grasping it. The ending does foreclose one path (pure geometric search), but the cost of abandoning that approach is intellectual rather than felt as a wrenching trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.0)
    The primary stakes (preventing the islands from fading vs. the cost to Irena’s own sense of self/dream) are clear, and storm season’s last morning offers a modest tightening. However, escalation is mostly textural; there is little sense of a live alternative path she might take or a concrete trade-off at the climax. The final choice—to go higher, to take that culminating sunrise—is logical but not sharply contested, so pressure deepens more in mood than in dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—freeing an idea trapped behind fear—is clearly laid out early and deepens as we learn the hair’s history and the accumulating weight of “unfinished thought.” Pressure escalates at the vial’s uncorking and the momentary disorientation, forcing direct confrontation with the “clenched fist” of fear. The resolution is an internal stance change rather than a big reversal, but it does foreclose the previous mode of self-protection. Still, the price of that change is felt more conceptually than viscerally, which softens the peak tension a notch.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—recovering stolen memories at the risk of losing everyday coherence—is established early and tightened when the fairy ring begins actively returning memories at the cost of other knowledge. Pressure escalates as “for every recollection that returned, something else frayed” and the tide rises, forcing the narrator to accept ongoing loss in exchange for wholeness. The central choice is endurance rather than dramatic reversal, but the trade-off is clear and felt. A slightly sharper articulation of what “tidy life” concretely protects (beyond phone numbers and dates) might deepen the sense of external consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—permanent oblivion versus reversible exile—appears early and remains coherent, with the Council’s sentence putting real pressure on Rhea and Jun. Escalation occurs as the abstract compromise becomes a personal, ritualized pact through the tea reading and written rules, narrowing Jun’s options to “go in with terms” or suffer final erasure. The final demand that “forgetting me will hurt” adds a sharper ethical and emotional cost to what could have been a purely procedural solution. Conflict is largely internal/relational rather than overtly confrontational, which suits the tone but keeps the tension at a quiet simmer rather than a boil.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator can risk hoping and imagining again—is clear and coherently pressured. Escalation comes through the invitation to handle the seed and perform the ritual, which deepens the internal conflict between protective numbness and creative yearning. However, opposition is mostly internal and gentle; there are no real reversals, and the difficulty of choosing hope feels relatively low-friction for such a devastated backstory. The resolution is nonetheless earned by the narrator’s imaginative act that reorients their relation to the gray city.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—can Ilan restore the captain’s name and settle the spirits—is clear early and sharpened by the rule that each knot holds a night at sea. Pressure accumulates through the successive knots and ghostly voices, and the last "tooth-hard" star knot creates a real moment of risk and hesitation. However, the escalation is almost entirely internal and textural; there is little sense of a consequence if he fails beyond continued unrest, which keeps the tension more contemplative than urgent. The resolution is earned but feels like a single smooth gradient rather than a sharp narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—how to interpret and respond to this sealed, possibly violated chapel—remains fairly interior and low-key, expressed as a question of ethical stance rather than danger or loss. Pressure does deepen as the second reel reframes the first (from discovery to apology), narrowing what a responsible recommendation can be. Still, there is little sense of alternatives or genuine dilemma on the page; Elias’s final stance feels natural but not fiercely contested. The conflict between institutional needs (board decision) and the chapel’s implied claims is present but could be sharpened to raise the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central conflict—how to honor the physicist’s experiment and the dead versus the world’s hunger for artifacts—is clear and escalates from curiosity to genuine moral pressure. The note sharply tightens stakes by reframing the wreck as ongoing data, not static history, and forces a stance at the end. The cost is conceptual and ethical rather than concrete, but it is legible: any choice corrupts either the experiment or the uncertainty he entrusted to the sea. The one constraint is that we don’t see the compromise enacted, so the conflict resolves in stance more than in dramatized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—whether Lio will remain a silent interpreter or risk being directly “heard”—is legible and tightens once the wall asks, “Teach us how to answer.” Escalation comes through deepening rather than reversals: from private encoding to the graffiti speaking back to a demand for co-agency. The final decision to be used as conduit is a clear act of agency that resolves the pressure, but the price and potential downsides are underplayed, softening tension slightly. Still, the conflict between longing for expression and fear of exposure runs cleanly through to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—reaching and deciphering the captain’s diary to learn how to perceive joy under anguish—is clear and tightened by the forbidden location and magical encryption. There is one solid deepening when the lock resists force and responds instead to her gentler, empathetic approach, tying internal values to external success. However, no antagonistic force ever really presses back; the risk of punishment and the possibility of magical danger are evoked but never materially tested on the page, so escalation stays mostly atmospheric. As a result, the final cost feels more conceptual than pressured, limiting the visceral tension.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether the sky/air “remembers” and how she will live inside that belief—is clear and thematically rich, and pressure tightens meaningfully when the gondola tremors into a crosswind that matches past departures. Her response (logging data, conceptually reframing the motion, choosing to ride the remembered paths rather than resisting or panicking) provides an internal resolution with some cost. However, the conflict remains largely internal and contemplative; external peril and practical stakes (falling, rescue, time) are hinted but never sharply tested. The escalation is thus more intellectual and tonal than decisively tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—how and whether Mara can meaningfully preserve her life’s work and sense of home before demolition—appears early and tightens via the countdown horns and her attempt to cram “decades of light” into the book. The meaningful turn is when she runs out of physical space and must confront the impossibility of total preservation, leading to her reframing of limits. Internal and external pressure are well braided, but the conflict remains quiet and contemplative rather than forcing a sharper trade-off or visible forfeiture beyond stopping the painting. The escalation is strong for this mode, though not maximally exacting.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.4)
    The primary stake—whether Lio can convince Orvan to divert the ship to pursue a speculative, personally charged discovery—is legible and grows from idle observation to an experimental navigation maneuver. The key tightening is Orvan’s challenge to prove safety, which forces Lio to stake credibility on the anomalous behavior of light rather than on certainty. The final beat, where Orvan actually follows Lio’s called-out steps, is a clear escalation driven by Lio’s agency. However, the danger remains mostly abstract (no concrete rival duty, time pressure, or proximate threat in play), so while tension is present, it’s more intellectual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—can the locksmith learn/use the rhythm of repair to unlock intangible “locks” of memory and regret—is clear and coherently pursued. Escalation is modest but present: from reading shy prophecies and feeling the gears stir, to testing them on one silent man, to moving mirror by mirror until the entire library begins to thaw. The price is mostly in endurance and emotional overreach (chapped fingers, stinging eyes, “nostalgia for lives I had never lived”) rather than a sharp on-page trade-off. There is no major reversal or foreclosed option, but for a lyric piece the single, deepened pressure line works.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stakes (preserving orchards/homes and lives) are clear early, with the looming loss of the northern orchards providing coherent pressure. Escalation is well-managed: slow-building quakes and preparations, then the sudden formation of the nebula and arch collapses that force rapid revision of plans (“They reexamined every plan in minutes”). Kerran’s agency via planning and urgent messaging drives the community’s survival, and there is a concrete price—lost arches, cracked bell, abandoned heirlooms, and palpable exhaustion. The main limitation is that moral or interpersonal dilemmas remain relatively light; conflict is more logistical and existential than ethically fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—how the world ends, and on what emotional terms—is established early and tightened when he replaces the master key with the puppet head. Pressure escalates as he moves through chambers, each adjustment carrying ethical weight (tilting bullets, cruelties, forgiveness) and cumulatively destabilizing “midnight” itself. His agency is central: the gentler ending exists only because he chooses a form of limited, intimate mercy over grand salvation. The conflict remains largely internal, but it’s sufficiently sharpened by the external deadline of the doomsday clock and the mandate he’s defying.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—defying a fatalistic blueprint to guide travelers—is clear and live, with one strong tightening when the nut shows “no safe path, only gradations of ruin.” However, much of the conflict across “years” is summarized rather than dramatized, which flattens intermediate escalation. The arrival of the last traveler searching for the blueprint is an excellent late complication that reframes the conflict. Because the decisive response to him is deferred, the piece stops at a heightened question rather than a paid-off moral or practical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara can transform her culpability into a different kind of practice and relationship with Leo’s memory—is clear early and tightened when she reframes the resin as a “bridging medium.” The tracing of foam → conceptual leap → redesigned polymer → violent stress test forms a credible escalation chain, even if some beats are summarized. Her choice to step outside instead of basking in institutional praise at the end reads as a meaningful renunciation that reweights the victory. The pressure is more contemplative than sharp, which suits the piece but keeps it just shy of top-tier intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether to embrace a beginning that acknowledges one’s absences and fractures—is clear and coherent throughout. Pressure escalates with the decision to actually pour the moonlight, the unexpected revelation of carved refusals, and the culminating offer to either walk away unchanged or sign into awareness. The woman’s choice to sign and the vendor’s subsequent self-revelation provide a credible narrowing of options and a visible cost (losing the illusion of blankness). The conflict is largely internal and contemplative rather than sharply agonistic, which slightly softens the sense of risk and keeps the stakes from feeling fully braced.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—how much of the fortress’s buried sorrow Rafi can responsibly surface—is clear and escalates through the contrast between the woman’s regret and the soldier’s massacre. The key tightening comes when he nearly buckles under the massacre shard and chooses to re-bury it, foreclosing one path (catharsis at catastrophic intensity) in favor of a safer, more measured ache. Internal and external stakes interweave: his own psyche is at risk along with the garrison’s emotional stability. The conflict could feel even sharper if the tangible consequences of “too much” or “too little” remorse were more explicitly tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—liberating a hoarding, suffocating structure into a communal instrument—is clear and escalates from private whisper to public performance. Pressure builds texturally (increasing clarity of the elevator’s voice, growing volunteer effort) and culminates in the midnight opening and shared song. However, conflict is gentle: skepticism dissipates quickly, disagreements are briskly mediated, and there’s no significant threat of failure or loss. The story persuades more than it tests, which keeps stakes emotionally resonant but not sharply perilous.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Lio will remain a controlling engineer or risk dissolving his boundaries to house others’ abandoned dreams—is clearly signaled and tightened when the device misbehaves and overwhelms him. The key escalation is the unexpected flood of entangled dreams and his realization that his usual instinct (“stabilize the system”) conflicts with his new ambition (“surrender into the complexity”). His choice to adjust the periscope toward his own fragmented reflection and invite the reorganization reads as a genuine trade-off, with the cost of permanent internal change. What keeps this just below the top band is that there’s little external consequence or loss beyond the internal psychic burden, so pressure never quite feels cornering.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—gaining access to forbidden safeguards while time and the safeguards themselves resist—is clear and tight. Escalation is present but subtle: passing through the wall, navigating threshold layers, and especially confronting the sentient chains all mark deepening tests. However, real threat or loss is only implied; he succeeds without visible setback or near-failure, which keeps tension more contemplative than urgent. The time limit and chain-assessment do narrow options, but the price feels mostly abstracted into future responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—can Lio create “music” under the tyranny of silence—is clear and organically rooted in the opening. Pressure does escalate accumulatively from solitary craft to shared experiment with Ina and then to the grove-wide response, but the path is relatively smooth and unopposed. There is no real on-page possibility of failure or serious downside beyond fatigue; once they decide to strum, the ritual works on the first attempt. The result is a beautiful but low-friction conflict arc, strong for a lyric piece but short of elite-level tension or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Oren can alter the eclipsed covenant without destroying the fragile peace that cost him exile—is clear and tight. Escalation comes through revelation: reading the pulses shows that canceling the covenant would break the kingdom’s word, narrowing him to a morally compromised middle path. His agency in offering a new “guideline for play” and accepting a limited, subtle shift feels earned and carries conceptual/emotional cost. The tension is more intellectual and ethical than visceral, which slightly softens the sense of pressure despite strong design.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.7)
    The central conflict—Elias’s need to preserve and understand silence versus the oncoming noise and his unresolved grief over Mira—is clear and intensifies. Pressure escalates texturally as layers of sound drop away and focus narrows from town to diary, culminating at the moment the first firework launches. The cost is principally internal (risking the pain in Mira’s words and his complicity in prior blindness), and while powerful, it stays just shy of fully dramatized consequence. Still, the tightening around the impending fireworks and the diary choice is coherent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether to risk planting the corpse-flower seed to gain insight into the village’s fate—is clear and present early. Pressure coheres through the elders’ opposition and the impending decision about descending from the trees. Escalation is primarily ethical and rhetorical rather than eventful, with the main tightening at Maru’s question about “death…where children sleep” and Liora’s counter-argument. The conflict could feel sharper with one more concrete test or visible immediate consequence of her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake (uncovering the orchards’ secret of resilience) is present and followed through, but the story leans more on wonder than on pressure. Escalation is mostly a deepening of strangeness rather than a narrowing of options or raising of costs; there’s no explicit danger or sacrifice in pushing into the forbidden grove. Lio’s main decisive act—reaching for the arrow—carries conceptual risk but little dramatized peril or conflict. As a result, tension is present but relatively low-grade and meditative.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake (understanding the crash well enough to prevent future ones) is clear, and tension accumulates as logs, models, and on-site wind readings fail to align. The meaningful tightening is the realization that unmodeled, container-induced wind shear nudged the skiff into the drone’s unavoidable corridor—this resolves the investigative question and reweights responsibility. However, escalation is mostly intellectual and textural; there’s little sense of immediate jeopardy or a live alternative path he might take. The emotional/ethical cost is present but somewhat understated on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether sculpted hush will be properly “tended” so wonder remains essential—is clear and signaled early. Pressure coherently builds as anticipation tightens toward the chisel strike, with a meaningful turn when the hush arrives and Ilen must time the release. However, the negative consequences of failure are largely implied rather than concretely felt, keeping the risk a bit abstract. The escalation feels real but stays in a contemplative register rather than a sharply tested one.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Cael can reconceive his failure and relationship to the relic—is clear from early on and tightens as he moves from silent bearing, to speech, to the decision to play. Escalation is appropriately quiet but real: uncasing the flute, realizing he has never played without an audience, and reframing the flute as listener rather than doorway each narrow his options. The final act of playing a non-ritual, imperfect note constitutes an earned internal turn with a conceptual cost (letting go of the old tenets and his former identity). The conflict could feel sharper if there were a more concrete on-page risk or temptation to cling to his prior role, but the lyric mode largely compensates.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator can stop treating grief as a solvable equation and submit to destabilizing empathy—is clear and escalates from theoretical description to embodied, disorienting experience. The key tightening is the instruction to “Press the lever” and then to touch the halo, which forces a non-retractable engagement with the system. Stakes remain largely internal and philosophical; there is little external or relational pressure on the narrator’s choices beyond Mara’s eerie authority. The cost of change is real but subtle, so tension lives more in conceptual risk than in felt jeopardy, which slightly flattens escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—how he lives with his vocation and his mentor’s absence—is clear early and deepens as the pendant activates and reconfigures his understanding of time and memory. Pressure escalates texturally rather than through overt external danger: nervous travel → uncanny vibration → interior stillness → realization about Ralen’s “sideways” step → commitment to change his routes and linger. The cost is gentle but legible: he will trade speed and emotional distance for vulnerability and time, potentially altering his livelihood and habits. Stakes could feel sharper with a more concrete external consequence, but within a lyric frame they’re strong.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—will the narrator’s belief in emotional resonance of objects find validation or connection with the town—is clear but remains mostly low-friction. Escalation exists (private communion → experimental reading of the car → public evangelizing to neighbors), yet opposition is soft: the “awkward” past at the diner is referenced but not staged, and no one meaningfully resists the door-to-door revelations. As a result, the pressure is largely atmospheric rather than narrowing options or exacting an explicit price in action.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Nari can meaningfully reach Haru across time and death—is legible early and escalates when the puzzle reveals the blizzard scene. Pressure tightens around the choice to finish the puzzle by sacrificing her life’s tapestry, creating a real trade-off between clinging to the old message-medium and risking a more direct contact. Internal and external conflicts interweave quietly yet effectively via the cost to her identity as a weaver. The main ceiling is that resistance and alternative options are only lightly dramatized, making the escalation feel slightly smooth rather than sharply contested.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.8)
    The core stake—whether anything in this hardening world can still be made resilient—is clear and steadily pressured by the accumulating evidence of calcification. Escalation arrives via his increasingly daring use of the mines and peaks when the silk violently yanks him to the dangerous, collapsed gallery. His decision to work with the trembling heap and risk the mine’s instability offers a solid, if understated, tightening. However, physical and emotional risk could be made more visceral at the climax to sharpen the sense of price and danger.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Lio will remain in cycles of mapping for others or claim agency over his own pattern—is clear and present early via the Archivist’s summons and promise of a withheld truth. Pressure escalates as he confronts repeated, forgotten arrivals and then the corridor of selves, which forces a concrete choice about which life to inhabit. The decisive act of “redirecting” momentum with the shard forecloses real options and carries a conceptual and identity cost. The conflict is largely internal and intellectual; a slightly sharper sense of risk or dread in the moment of choosing could intensify the tension further.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.2)
    The conflict is primarily internal and ethical: whether anyone will, or can, take on the lighthouse’s protective role after institutional abandonment. Tension escalates through the letters’ content—from thanks, to fear, to plea for guidance—until he can no longer remain a purely logistical shadow. His decisive act (offering to read the stones and answer) forecloses the prior, safer posture of detachment and implies an ongoing burden of care. The stakes remain small-scale and quiet, which suits the story, though a slightly sharper sense of what this commitment might cost him practically could intensify the pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake is Orrin’s stance toward obsolescence vs transformation of his role and “mornings” in a post-print world. Escalation is primarily internal and textural: the hum, the changing patterns in the light, and the recognition of his own handwriting culminating in the invitation to steer skyward. The turn where he realizes the lighthouse has been listening and storing his oaths is a meaningful tightening, reframing his routine as loaded with latent consequence. However, opposition remains abstract and the pressure on his choice is gentle, so the tension never quite reaches a sharp edge.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—whether the dye master will discover how stories adhere to certain people, and what that implies about him and his donor heart—remains clear but largely internal and contemplative. Pressure does accumulate as he listens to the three patrons, his heart’s “quietly explosive” beats mirroring a growing sense of something imminent. The decisive deepening occurs when he finally takes out the wing and literally turns it through the last blade of light, forcing a reinterpretation of the people before him. Still, external stakes and explicit costs are minimal, which keeps escalation subtle and limits intensity at this prestige-publication bar.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—Milo’s desire to understand what trees witness, and more broadly to tend to hidden sorrows—is clear and meaningfully tightened when the sextant appears and later reveals the trees’ emotional labyrinths. Escalation is mostly accumulative: from noticing structural fatigue, to perceiving metaphysical cracks, to mapping quantified sorrow and recognizing its cumulative nature. This pressure deepens knowledge rather than forcing a high-cost choice; Milo’s agency is fully present but never truly contested, and no alternative path is dramatically foreclosed. The quiet, contemplative mode works, but the lack of a more visible price or trade-off at the peak keeps the stakes from feeling as sharp as they could in a top-tier piece.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the realm will remain safely numb or endure the pain of remembering—is clear and sharpened by Mara’s responsibility. Pressure builds as she approaches the mica window and confronts the people’s faces in the dark, culminating in the choice to sing against her own fear of harming them. Escalation is mostly linear and internal; there’s little on-page resistance or alternative tactic, so the conflict stays contemplative rather than sharply contested. The cost is present but could be intensified by a more explicit moment of hesitation or an imagined consequence she nearly chooses instead.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will continue to numb his regret or truly confront and learn from it—is clear early and tightens when Mara explicitly calls out his avoidance. Pressure escalates from ambient unease to a direct moral/emotional confrontation when his brother’s name appears on the spine. The cost is legible in his fear of being “crumbled” versus “completed” and the tears that follow seeing his misreading of the voicemail. The conflict is primarily internal and somewhat gentle, but the single deepening turn is strong for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—what Elias does with his guilt and the bread—is clearly signaled and gently tightened as conversation forces him to articulate his self-blame. The key deepening is the tea mistress tearing the loaf and insisting that bringing it here and sharing it is already a directional act, which nudges him toward the costly choice of eating. There’s no large reversal, but the escalation from private penance to communal witnessing is sufficient at this scale and drive. The conflict is almost entirely internal and philosophical, which slightly limits the visceral sense of pressure despite the elegant execution.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—the survival and integrity of the library—is crisply announced through the alarm and the risk of the vows failing, and escalated when the decay proves “well beyond worst-case projections.” Pressure tightens meaningfully when Serin discovers the founders’ true motives, faces the binary of stabilization versus rewriting, and then chooses a riskier third path by braiding his own vow. Internal and external conflicts are well interwoven, but the cost of his decision (e.g., loss of the right to forget, potential structural fragility of amended equations) is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page. The story earns its climax but could heighten the sense of what he sacrifices or imperils in the moment of speech.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—whether Loretta will confront and endure the proof of her father’s betrayal—is clear early and deepened by the warning about “wrong betrayal” and the device thwarting greed. Pressure escalates when the fob initially stays dark, briefly threatening that her investment and emotional gamble were wasted, before delivering a subtler, more devastating answer than she hoped or feared. The final choice to remain until sunrise listening to others’ bruised promises is a credible, costly stance rather than a simple revelation. The conflict is primarily internal and quiet, so some readers might desire one more on-page obstacle or alternative path, but within a lyric frame it holds.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator will stay a detached skeptic or step into a burdensome, participatory role in the world’s climate-memory—is clear. Pressure does deepen once the strangers explain the personal cost of carrying weather, and the ring’s melting into skin adds a bodily irrevocability. However, escalation is mostly conceptual and atmospheric; there’s little sense that refusal is actively dangerous or that competing options narrow under intense pressure. The final acceptance is meaningful, but it isn’t preceded by a strongly staged moral or practical crossroads, which keeps tension from fully peaking.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will continue to suppress his true art and his grief, or confront both by finishing Mara’s portrait—is clear early and tightens credibly. Escalation comes from successive unveilings: lock history, Mara’s death, the hidden niche, and finally the blank of her eyes, each narrowing his emotional options. His choice to draw the eyes under mounting memory pressure, knowing it will not “free” him but bind him to the calling, reads as a meaningful, costly turn. The conflict is mostly internal and quiet, but never static.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Lio will confront the city’s hoarded, volatile truths—is clear and thematically potent, and the observatory’s reputation for dishonesty provides a solid external pressure. Escalation is present but subtle: the incoming storm, the map’s implications, and the observatory’s haunted history deepen tension as he moves from safe studio to forbidden space. However, the conflict is largely internal and anticipatory; no concrete opposition or visible price is paid on the page beyond risk and unease. As a result, the pressure feels intriguing rather than truly bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—preserving the color of wonder before it drains—is clear and coherent, and the impending loss of Lio’s voice adds light temporal pressure. Escalation is primarily textural: the transition from general practice to this singular shard, then from quiet tuning to the sculpture’s charged performance. However, there’s little genuine resistance or risk beyond time and entropy; nothing seriously threatens failure once Lio agrees. The result is beautiful but low-tension, which keeps the stakes from feeling fully sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake (his psychic integrity vs. damage to the roses/data and possible human disapproval) is signaled early and escalates coherently as he moves from contemplation to radical action. Pressure tightens through each irreversible step—shutting off water, opening the crate, letting fears overwrite calibration, then triggering ignition during a magnetic lurch. The cost is legible but somewhat muted on the human side (supervisors’ trouble is gestured to, not dramatized), keeping this just shy of top-tier intensity. Still, the internal/external conflicts braid effectively and resolve through his deliberate choice.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the courtyard can withstand encroaching development—is signaled early via sirens, surveyors, and pamphlets, and tightened when the locket’s number matches the sealed mailbox, turning a vague threat into a solvable local mystery. Escalation is primarily accumulative: each neighbor’s story raises the possibility that a binding agreement exists, culminating in a charged, quiet climax when Mara presses the locket to the keyhole and simply listens. The resolution is earned by Mara’s method (listening and community storytelling) rather than coincidence, though the near-effortless unlocking avoids a harder trade-off or visible failure, keeping the tension in a contemplative rather than harrowing register. The sense of cost is more social (years of erasure, misremembered deed) than immediate personal sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central stake—whether the protagonist will serve the handlers’ extractive agenda or Ara’s liberatory ethos—is clear, and the decisive choice to “liberate her work into the world above” provides a credible resolution. The dice-led exploration and the journals’ layered ciphers constitute a deepening of pressure and knowledge rather than a reversal, fitting the accumulative lens. However, conflict is relatively frictionless: the protagonist encounters no serious obstacles, timed constraints, or competing pressures beyond inherited ideology, which mutes escalation. The ethical trade-off is intellectually sharp but could benefit from one concrete, on-page cost or foreclosed option.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding and possibly accessing the town’s lost time—is clearly signaled and tightened as anomalies escalate from failing lanterns to missing days to the narrator’s risky experiment. Agency is present in the choice to act on a speculative theory using inherited divination methods in a volatile environment (crystals that already “pulse” and distort air). The escalation is primarily intellectual and atmospheric rather than conflictual; there is little overt resistance or counter-force beyond the eerie physics themselves. This keeps the tension quiet but coherent, with a definite deepening at the moment the coffee grounds pattern reality and reveal the missing memories.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—preventing a prophecy from steering kingdoms—is clear and serious, and the pressure builds as more instances of the prophecy surface and are unraveled. Escalation is mostly qualitative rather than tense: the story accumulates examples but doesn’t introduce a sharp turn or new complication that tests his resolve. The felt cost is internal (weight in his bones) rather than dramatized via a hard trade-off or near-failure in the ritual. As a result, it’s compelling and coherent, but the conflict never quite bites as hard as the premise promises.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—gaining access to the “language of old buildings” before demolition erases it—is clear, but largely conceptual and unopposed. Escalation comes via deepening rather than conflict: the weekly ritual culminates in the meteor night, when the building finally speaks through the seal. There’s a meaningful turn when the “agreed upon lies” of tenancy are revealed as part of the building’s language, reweighting what the narrator thought they wanted. However, there’s little active resistance or sacrifice in the present moment, so the pressure never fully bites.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Neris will continue to quarantine her guilt or face it—is clear early and tightens with each new revelation from the shell and caretaker. Pressure escalates in a controlled way: private dread → involuntary, painful vision → explicit challenge from the caretaker → her request to be taught. Agency is concentrated in the choice to stay, listen, and reframe herself from prisoner to archivist, which forecloses the easier path of denial. The conflict is primarily internal and could risk feeling too tidy, but here the mapped-not-yet-forgiven note preserves a sense of ongoing cost.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Irian will commit open treason on the page to save the scholars and in doing so expose his entire past—is signaled clearly and deepens when Sevran arrives. The key beat is Irian’s choice to ask Sevran to judge “which crime is greater,” followed by the decision to sign in his own name. Internal and external conflicts interweave well, but Sevran’s almost immediate support bypasses a harder negotiation that might have sharpened the cost and escalation. Still, pressure coheres and tightens once in a satisfying way appropriate to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding why her sister’s voice did not echo and whether the canyon judges worth—is evident early and carries through. Pressure escalates via the canyon’s response pattern (playful echoes → errors → buried second line → overwhelming chorus), culminating in a realization that forces her to relinquish a cherished, if painful, misbelief. The conflict is primarily internal and epistemic rather than choice-based; her key “decision” is to ask and to listen, so the escalation reads as deepening understanding rather than being driven by hard, alternative actions under duress. For this quiet mode, the price and narrowing of psychic options are clear but not razor-sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether the truth of the wreck will be faced and exposed—is clear early and tightens as the woman’s personal connection and potential responsibility are revealed. Escalation comes from Marek moving from general listening into a specific, incriminating pattern of dreams that implicates her family and redefines what the girl wants. The final beat gives the woman a genuine ethical dilemma with cost (betraying legacy vs. complicity), even if her choice is left unresolved. The tension is moral/introspective rather than confrontational, which slightly softens the sense of acute pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—whether the narrator can find a way to value their “useless” work before social shame drives them off the pier—is clear but intentionally quiet. Pressure deepens as Ren reframes effort (unpicked repairs, current doing half the work), culminating in the narrator’s attempt with the whisk, where partial success triggers a meaningful internal loosening. The cost is subtle but legible: choosing to live as someone whose invisible labor underpins others’ survival. The escalation is more contemplative than confrontational, which suits the mode but keeps intensity just below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—who controls the orchard’s resilience protocol—emerges clearly and tightens as Theo moves from verification to key-holder. The conflict escalates from intellectual puzzle to an ethical decision with world-scale implications and immediate local costs. Slight abstraction remains in how the threat to “scattered survivors” is summarized rather than briefly embodied, which keeps the stakes strong but a bit distant.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Ilen gives “variant allegiance” to the voice and thus participates in editing history—is clear and escalates from eerie signals to a direct, conditional demand. The meaningful tightening comes with the instruction to stand under the portico and not flinch, which reframes his work from observation to personal risk. Internal and external conflict interweave (existential dread vs hunger for meaning and vindication), but the test itself feels a bit metaphorically framed; we don’t know what disobedience or flinching would concretely cost him. Tension at the sentence level is strong, yet the escalation remains more atmospheric than decisively crucible-like.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.7)
    The central stake—whether he remains a lonely, penny-trading oddity or steps into a more generous, connective purpose—is clear and coherently pressured by the arrival of the woman and her unspoken need. Escalation is gentle: tension rises from the risk of opening the box to the emotionally loaded choice to give away the jar and braid other sounds into it. That said, his path never feels truly in doubt; there’s little visible temptation to cling to his old transactional habits or retreat from vulnerability, which softens the sense of sacrifice. The cost is present but more implied than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—preventing the artifact from being awakened or stolen during its vulnerable singing period—is clearly established early. Pressure escalates from strange hum to full-body vibration and the revelation that the binding note has drifted, forcing him to abandon rote ritual for an improvisational, more dangerous adaptation. The time limit (fleeting sunset) and the sense of an answering presence in the crypt deepen tension, though Elias’ success comes a bit smoothly, with minimal on-page backlash or damage. A slightly clearer or costlier consequence for getting the pitch wrong would sharpen the stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—learning to turn impatience into effective, non-destructive action—is clear and tied to the off-page crisis of “burning cities.” Pressure escalates from boredom and doubt through cumulative small tasks to the intense sensory overload of the basin, where the narrator finally confronts an alternative mode of change. The main turn is knowledge-based rather than decision-based; the protagonist accepts rather than chooses under duress, which slightly softens the sense of paid cost. A sharper on-page dilemma (stay in slow discipline vs. rush back with half-learning) would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.0)
    The core conflict—protect the Transit Authority vs. acknowledge preventable deaths—is clear early via the supervisor’s warnings and tightens as apparitions confront the narrator with personalized evidence of past complicity. Escalation is largely internal but effective: the ghosts force a re-reading of every prior signed form and transform “hauntings” into “data,” which raises the ethical cost of denial. The final choice to write the report truthfully forecloses the safer path, though the material consequences remain implied rather than dramatized. A slightly more concrete sense of immediate risk in-scene could have heightened the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will actively advocate at the parole board and what that says about deserving—is clear early and tightens as Mara presses, “What are you really asking?” The conflict is mostly internal but under real situational pressure (parole hearing tomorrow, a life after twenty years in prison) and escalates through the examination of the heart and its implied history of harm and care. Mara’s interpretation forces a trade-off between safe neutrality and committing to stand beside an imperfect man. The modesty of the scene’s external stakes is offset by the clarity and sharpness of the moral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Orin will collaborate with the Algorithm to “strike the future awake”—is clearly signaled and coherently developed. Pressure tightens when Orin learns the Algorithm already rewrote the wind to bring him here, challenging his sense of agency, and again at the launch as bodily risk meets vast conceptual stakes. However, the external conflict is relatively frictionless: once he agrees, little resists the mission beyond atmospheric danger, and the internal struggle is more wry acquiescence than agonized choice. The ending offers a strong reweighting of consequence, but the escalation path could benefit from one more concrete obstacle or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the truth about where deleted files and possibly disappearing employees go—is clear and present early. Pressure escalates somewhat as 713 spreads, the company stamps RESOLVED, and the narrator chooses to lie and pierce Deep Cold. Still, most of this escalation is retrospective rather than dramatized in live, contested beats, and concrete costs (risk of job, legal danger, Ora’s possible complicity) never quite sharpen into a forced trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—preventing war while refusing to let the orchard become an exploited symbol—is clearly established and tied to Ira’s mandate versus the anomaly’s resistance. Pressure escalates effectively when the crystal fragment shows multiple futures, including ones where Ira himself gives the fatal signal, and when she articulates her true want (“somewhere that is not conquest or exile”). Ira’s decision to reconstitute the accord, risking Keeper disapproval to preserve the orchard’s agency, is an earned stance crystallization. However, the choice feels comparatively “clean” on the page, with limited immediate pushback or visible loss, so the sense of unavoidable harm is less intense than the setup promises.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether she will go through with euthanasia or find another stance toward endings—is clear from early on and sharpened by the ticking “mandatory week of reflection.” Escalation is mostly internal but real: she moves from passive observation, to salvage work and taxonomy (a rehearsal for her choice), to the risk and concentration of the solitary boat trip. The main tightening is her decision to follow Runa’s cryptic instruction and cut the engine to listen, which forces a confrontation with her own premise. Cost is somewhat understated, but the relinquishing of the planned, administratively tidy death for renewed uncertainty reads as a genuine trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the woman will emotionally and perhaps physically return to her husband versus complete the escape—is clear and thematically anchored in timing/mismatch. Pressure escalates primarily through revelation and reframing: late bus → marital backstory → vineyard metaphor → rhyme vs unison, each tightening her awareness of the cost of leaving. However, the conflict remains internal and contemplative, and she is never pushed to a concrete on-page decision; the stakes feel real but the test stays relatively gentle. This keeps the piece quiet rather than fully cutting, which is artistically valid but slightly limits force.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the city can bear honest prophecy without destroying itself—is legible early and escalates cleanly via the merchant’s hypocrisy and the parapet’s violent reaction. The line walker’s intervention (“Speak not only what will be...”) is a clear tightening choice that changes tactics and reconfigures the conflict from truth vs. lie to unshaped vs. shaped truth. Cost is present but somewhat abstract: the prophet must name each cruelty and the merchant must confront them, yet we only glimpse the beginning of that price. Still, the shift from grinding parapet to “long exhale” provides a strong sense of concrete consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether and how the community’s grief can be honored before erasure—is clear, and the narrator’s decision to come on-site rather than stay in his basement provides an opening turn. The boy’s visit tightens the emotional stakes by making the loss concrete and personal, and the ending gesture toward a “communal puzzle” signals a deepening of purpose. Still, the conflict remains low-key; there’s little resistance, obstruction, or felt cost beyond discomfort, so escalation is more tonal than pressure-driven. The bulldozer deadline is mentioned but never leveraged to increase urgency or foreclose options in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—can language (and thus growth) survive the council’s surgical erasures, and what stance will Elias take—is clear and thematically rich. Pressure deepens as he listens to fragmented voices and realizes he must abandon orderly argument in favor of fractured testimony, a meaningful internal tightening. However, all opposition remains conceptual and offstage; there’s no on-page pushback or concrete reversal, and the price of his decision is only inferred. The escalation is effective for a quiet, lyric piece but could feel under-pressured for top-market fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether they can locate and recognize the “sound of growing older”—is clear and tightens as they move deeper into the fog, following and then converging on the driftwood markers. The excursion with Mara into the sculpture garden is a genuine escalation, and the moment of kneeling to listen at the unmade-bed sculpture is a clear peak. That said, the pressure remains mostly conceptual and introspective, with little sense of alternative paths or tangible risk if they fail, which slightly softens the feeling of cost. The final “price” is primarily the unsettling self-recognition, which is effective but quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—capturing a one-second stellar death versus protecting the instruments—is clearly articulated and escalates as the quake intensifies and the systems try to shut down. Ilias’s key choices (overriding protocol, restructuring Camera Three, bypassing filters) provide genuine agency and narrowing options. The risk of “tearing something vital” and jeopardizing the observatory’s future is there, but consequences remain hypothetical rather than paid on the page, which slightly mutes the sense of concrete cost. Still, the pressure arc is coherent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—how to execute a goodbye once the results confirm impending death—is clear and signaled early. Escalation is quiet but real: the unseen decision about treatment is already made, so pressure shifts to how they’ll face it together, culminating in the co-written song and the choice not to open the envelope. Mira’s agency is primarily in decisions of attention and framing (pocketing the truth, offering the shard, guiding the hymn of the mundane), which foreclose more clinical or evasive goodbyes. The cost is emotional and professional rather than plot-dramatic, but it’s legible and satisfying for this scale.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—risking forbidden practice to answer a long-gnawing question—is legible and coherently pursued. Pressure escalates as the key turns, the runes glow, the spoons straighten, and the shadows emerge; her corrected rune-phrase is a clear agency beat that changes the outcome. Internal conflict (fear, reverence, rule-breaking) is present but understated and mostly resolved without a sharply dramatized dilemma in the peak moment. The cost is conceptual rather than concretely painful, which somewhat softens the sense of price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stakes—truth about Tomas’s fate and the moral obligation to the mislaid child—are clear and sharpen as Mara moves from diagnosing a fake corpse to choosing whether to complete a dangerous, ethically fraught experiment. The pressure escalates coherently: doubt over the body → unsettling proof of faerie mechanics → direct vision of the suffering boy → the high-agency decision to step through and re-set his bones into her world’s physics. The rescue is somewhat frictionless on the page (no resistance once she commits), so the felt cost leans more conceptual/emotional than bodily or logistical. Still, her decision clearly forecloses the safer path of letting the substitute stand and simply sharing in the village’s comforting lie.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—can she offer light and comfort that does not repeat the harms of fire to the refugees—is clear and thematically sharp. Pressure builds more through intensifying memory and the polishing ritual than through overt external obstacles, with the key tightening occurring when the raids and the grandmother’s last act resurface and reframe her present work. The cost is emotional and ongoing rather than decisively escalated in-scene, which keeps tension at a strong but not searing level. Still, the final walk toward the waiting children and the choice to open the cloth reads as an earned, consequential stance.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.0)
    The primary stake—whether Mara will remain defined by her viral confession and trauma or risk reshaping that meaning—is legible from early on and sharpened by her discomfort on the train and in the building. Pressure escalates when Eli invites her not just to witness but to “shape it,” forcing a concrete choice between retreat and engagement. Her decision to kneel, get her jeans soaked, and start with “the worst wounds first” is a credible, costly commitment within this quiet register. The conflict stays mostly internal and could bear one more moment of resistance before she yields, but the arc that’s here still tightens meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether he will continue to evade endings/hope or accept responsibility for them—is clear and intensifies through the narrator’s accusations and the painful specificity of the river visions. The main tightening comes when he “for once, did not flinch” and then listens to the seashell, forcing him to confront concrete possible futures rather than abstract theory. Cost is conceptual but legible: he must relinquish the safety of endless ambiguity and accept that his choices shape characters’ hopes. The only mild limitation is that conflict stays almost entirely internal/philosophical, with no external test or immediate repercussion on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—reviving sacred practices in a non-harmful way—is conceptually strong, and pressure coheres as village desolation versus communal reawakening. Escalation, however, is gentle: there is no serious on-page resistance, moral trade-off, or risk of failure beyond mood, so the sense of narrowing options remains muted. The main tightening is the shift from solitary song to communal “questionsong” culminating in the ritual pour, which is moving but low-friction. Consequences are entirely positive, limiting felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—honoring and preserving the world’s final heartbeat—comes through, and the key deepening arrives when the first droplet of starlight bonds with the pulse to create a coherent, hovering map. The pressure is primarily conceptual and emotional; there is no concrete on-page reversal beyond the world’s slowly dying state and his choice to continue in extreme patience. Because the story leans fully into ritual rather than escalating tests or costs, tension is beautifully serene but comparatively flat. The final stance (“the map was enough”) is earned, but the price feels more implied than dynamically revealed.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—can he meaningfully restore a device that holds wonder against a “thinning” season of time—is clear, and there is one solid deepening when he shifts from testing hours to feeding the timer with personally painful, overlooked questions. Escalation is modest: the tension never quite feels like failure is a live, consequential threat so much as a contemplative experiment, and the city’s peril remains conceptual. His agency does drive the turn (choosing to alter the mechanism with a mirror, then to sacrifice his own unexamined moments), earning the closure. The lack of a sharper external or internal constraint keeps the pressure from fully tightening into high-band territory.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.3)
    The central stake—how to bear and shape burdens rather than be calcified by them—is clear from early on, and pressure tightens when a new, heavier burden appears and proves to be her own deferred fear. The escalation is primarily internal but convincing: the threat of her personal burden “closing around [her] chest” concretizes cost. Her closing choice to face and align with that fear, instead of resisting or denying it, narrows her options and transforms her relation to the work. The conflict is intentionally quiet, but still gains a real, legible peak.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether she will remain in suspended grief or risk reshaping it into something “useful”—is clear early and steadily tightened. Pressure escalates from passive contemplation of the blank, to physically trying to “contain its smoothness,” to recognizing that not carving is its own dangerous pause, to imagining “betrayal” in making functional objects. Her final act of drawing the first line is a credible resolution that forecloses the option of endless pause and accepts an emotional price. While low-key and internal, the narrowing of options and the felt trade-off are unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—can he meaningfully “negotiate” with his ghost/self rather than live on echoes—emerges clearly, and rowing to the center is a concrete escalation. The main turn is his decision to relinquish the scavenged fragments, which narrows his options and constitutes an Earned Stasis-style choice. Still, the externalized opposition (the ghost) largely delivers thematic commentary instead of applying active counter-pressure or forcing a sharper dilemma. As a result, tension is steady rather than tightening into a sharp, unavoidable pinch.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—can she meaningfully “resurrect” a dead system and, by extension, her own sense of hope—is clear but remains mostly internal and conceptual. Pressure deepens once (the realization that flows of “purpose” failed, leading to the rerouting project), yet from there the work unfolds without real resistance, reversals, or trade-offs. She finds materials, understands the system, and implements changes with no on-page obstacle beyond time and solitude. As a result, tension is present but muted; the piece reads as contemplative problem-solving rather than a pressured test of values.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central pressure—obey the sanctuary’s witnessing-only rule or intervene to stop the clock’s death-rattle that echoes his father’s cough—is clear and effectively dramatized. Stakes are emotionally credible (reopened grief, potential trouble with the abbess, betrayal of his chosen renunciation) but remain quiet and almost entirely internal. The escalation from passive scribing to rule-breaking repair to conceptual opening toward new invention tracks well, yet the sense of real cost or risk could be sharpened. As-is, tension is more contemplative than gripping, which fits the piece but caps intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator will collude in secrecy or reclaim and act on truth—is legible from the initial rumor and fully crystallized at the end. Pressure escalates from atmospheric unease to physical risk in the dive, to epistemic shock at the blueprints, to the quiet but dangerous confrontation with the two men. The internal and external conflicts interlock well, with the refusal to hand over the satchel functioning as an earned, costly stance. The danger from the men is implied rather than dramatized, but still clearly felt.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Eli can truly access and help preserve an ancient, fugitive method of storytelling—is present but remains largely internal and low-pressure. Escalation is textural: the rope’s images deepen, the fog thickens, and then the weaver appears to validate and reframe his task. There is little sense of alternatives or risk if he failed, and no sharp trade-off or visible loss beyond time and bodily discomfort. The result is a beautiful but relatively gentle arc of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.0)
    The conflict is quiet but coherent: can the narrator justify and articulate Sera’s absences so they are not read as madness or cruelty? Stakes are emotional and reputational rather than physical, centered on whether vanishing can be framed as healing. Pressure escalates through the garden walk as spaces are redefined by the pain they hold, tightening the question of whether these rituals are legitimate. The cost is somewhat implicit, resting on understood loneliness and social misreading, but it’s still felt.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether the prince will continue to serve as curator of fantasies for extraction capitalism or risk himself to protect a real, fragile alternative—is clear and escalates once the egg appears. Pressure coheres as institutional, philosophical, and biological fears all converge on the question of what to do with the egg. His choice to protect and “assemble whatever this life requires” narrows options decisively, but resistance is brief; the conflict could sustain one more concrete threat or consequence to heighten tension. Still, the internal and external stakes interlock convincingly at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stakes—boy’s physical safety vs. Maris’s duty to the fire and her internal reckoning with her father—are established early and brought to a clear tightening point when she must turn her back on the flames to reach him. Her choice embodies a trade-off between textbook caution and unyielding compassion, and the heat on her neck makes the risk concrete. The subsequent external danger resolves quickly once crews arrive, so the pressure curve is more one clean rise than a layered series of reversals, but it remains coherent and satisfying for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Lira can free the city’s stolen memories and at what personal cost—is apparent early and tightens with each anomaly and newly flowing fountain. The major escalation beat is the working fountain with the boy’s kite, which teaches the lock/key mechanism and forces her to take a risk with real sensory cost. The climax at the box requires a genuine trade-off (her skepticism for the city’s restoration), though the internal moral friction could be lingered on slightly more to heighten pressure. Overall, escalation is coherent and protagonist-driven rather than coincidental.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator’s gentle stewardship can truly alter generational patterns of destructive “light”—is signaled early and deepens steadily. Pressure escalates not through external events but through accumulating visions of familiar constellations re-enacting old harms and the gear’s sonar pings growing “heavier,” tightening the emotional vise. The final “perhaps” sequence crystallizes an earned stasis: continuing the watch despite unresolved doubt, which forecloses the path of abandoning the role. The only constraint is that conflict remains almost entirely internal and contemplative; there’s no sharp on-page turn where a new external development forces a different tactic in the present scene.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—Elias’s need to understand grief beyond individual commissions—is clear and coherently pressured by the spectral lessons and the sense that each stone is a “fragment of a larger design.” Escalation comes through density and patterning rather than confrontation: from individual hidden lines to the full mapped ribbon and the final retracing. The cost is mostly conceptual and emotional (recognizing communal distances and his own responsibility as keeper of this binding); there is little sense that a particular choice could go wrong or foreclose an alternate future. As a result, tension is strong for a lyric piece but not especially sharp in terms of risk or tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant conflict—whether the narrator will continue using precision as private penance or accept a broader, riskier stewardship—is legible from early on and tightens as the pendulum’s pause lengthens unnaturally. The stakes are both personal (his guilt over his brother) and communal (the town’s dependence on flawless time), and they converge at the moment he redefines his duty. Escalation is internal but real: the extended stillness forces a deeper reckoning than prior nightly routines and produces a concrete new course of action. Because the town’s external reliance remains hypothetical rather than dramatized, the pressure feels slightly more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether he will finally engage with and decode the tapestry instead of merely tending around it—is clear and does tighten as the whispers tug him toward the silo. His choice to match the strip and let the pattern “settle into me like rain” is a genuine turn that changes his understanding and future stance. However, external pressure is low; nothing actively resists him beyond his own delay, so tension remains contemplative rather than acute. The cost of embracing this role (permanent entanglement with others’ unfinished business) is present but underplayed as conflict in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—how to commit the kingdom to a future that doesn’t invisibly sacrifice people—is clear early and coherently escalated as new data reveals prior predictions were already wrong. The middle passage of scenario modeling creates genuine pressure as every option exacts a different kind of harm, and the climatic discovery reconfigures, rather than erases, that pressure. The ethical calculus of flexible roads, cyclical mines, and storehouses feels like a genuine trade-off that asks more of everyone instead of finding a painless win. Some of the conflict remains abstract rather than viscerally felt on the body, which keeps it a shade shy of maximal intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—reviving stories under a repressive aftermath while avoiding official scrutiny—is clear and thematically weighty, but the on-page conflict stays mostly low-key. There is one solid tightening: the song modulates to a “warning key,” announces “someone is coming up the hill,” and Lina must quickly conceal her work before the bootsteps arrive. The reveal that it’s only a boy defuses immediate danger, shifting the piece from threat of exposure to validation of her method and an invitation to bear witness. Because we never see her plans materially risked—only prepared for—the felt price of her choices remains more implied than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether art can hold or expose the illusion of safety—is clear and steadily pressured as the ceremony unfolds and the audience’s behavior shifts. Escalation is quiet but real: the ash lines unsettle people, a woman tests the boundary, the grandmother dons the mask, and Mara commits by emptying the bowl. The cost is conceptual and emotional rather than overtly dramatic: Mara and the audience collectively relinquish the comfort of pretending safety exists. The pressure could intensify further if Mara faced a more acute risk of failure or disruption to the ritual on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.4)
    The central stake—preserving ancient methods and truthful narratives versus the Council’s willful ignorance—is clear, but it manifests mostly as stance rather than escalating conflict. We see the cost of his path (isolation in the sewers, social friction when people visit) and the antagonistic pressure of proclamations from above, yet there is no concrete on-page test that forces a new choice or sacrifice. The mention of “rebell[ing] in the smallest, sharpest way” is conceptually strong but not dramatized as a turning point. As a result, pressure tightens intellectually, but without a distinct scene-level escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether people who “refuse to stand beside others” can risk shared sound—is established early and tested via the circle exercise and the history between Dari and Ilan. Escalation is quiet but real: from abstract town prejudice to embodied gaps between chairs to cracked voices on certain names to the intimate, vulnerable act of staying late. The final chord is a small but concrete narrowing of options: they choose to risk presence instead of retreat, with the cost of family stories and blame still live. The piece stays mostly on an internal/social axis, so some readers might want one more moment of overt friction, but within a lyric mode the pressure is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Ariel can meaningfully restart life in the greenhouse and, by extension, in the quarter—is clear, and the pruning decision is a credible deepening of that stake. Conflict, however, is almost entirely situational and philosophical; there is no real resistance beyond decay and time, and Kai’s mild doubts provide only soft opposition. The alignment’s ticking clock offers some pressure but never forces a hard trade-off beyond Ariel’s already-made choice to ingest the seed. As a result, escalation feels graceful rather than tense, limiting the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central stake—whether and how the city will wake—is clear and tightened when the boy reveals that only Marla’s spoken judgement can restore power. Internal conflict (duty to report/safety vs. preserving wonder, plus the burden of unavoidable truth) is interwoven with that external decision, especially in “Her throat tightened; involuntary truth could not be postponed…” The escalation is mostly linear rather than twisty, but it deepens effectively from mystery (blackout) to culpability (Granddad “broke the hive”) to the ethical demand placed on Marla’s voice. The one limitation is that the possibility of her refusing or condemning the city never feels quite as live as the story hints, slightly softening the sense of threatened loss.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.3)
    The stakes are internal yet coherent: whether Eli will remain a detached cataloger or enter a reciprocal, possibly unsettling relationship with the house. Pressure escalates via pattern density (rituals, house “breathing”) and then concretely through the storm and shard-in-corner incident, which forces a choice—pry it out or lean in by moving the bed. The resolution—choosing intimacy and vulnerability over analytic safety—is clear, though the sense of foreclosed alternative life paths stays subtle rather than sharply carved. For an elite venue, one more moment of explicit risk or sacrifice could sharpen the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—how this catastrophic truth will enter the surface world (as dogma or as question)—is signaled early through the ampoule and tightened when we learn the flood was invited. Internal and external conflicts (ethical handling of truth vs literal collapse and draining) are tightly braided. Escalation is clear: first the possibility of recording, then the monstrous backstory, then the moral calculus of accusation vs nuance, culminating in the consented collapse. The cost is unmistakable: a civilization’s ruins are physically altered and the protagonist relinquishes the safety of being the sole, certain witness.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—how Arin will live with irretrievable missed opportunities within an unending system—is clear from early on. Escalation is quiet but effective: the philosophical tension about perpetual motion intensifies into a concrete crisis when the staircase shudders and reveals an alternate Arin by a taken doorway. That rupture forces a stance crystallization, and his decision to keep climbing, reinterpreting effort rather than chasing an impossible fix, carries a felt price. The only constraint is that external stakes remain highly abstract; everything rides on internal reframing.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether she can rouse buried kindness in strangers—is articulated early and pursued consistently. Pressure escalates texturally as her invisible words start to trigger increasingly specific, warming memories in multiple people. However, opposition and cost are soft: there’s no real threat of failure on the page beyond general skepticism and fatigue, and no turn that forces a tough trade-off. The result is a beautifully sustained mood with modest, rather than bracing, narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator will remain a neutral cataloger or commit to living preservation—is clear and builds. Pressure escalates via the kitchen scene, then crystallizes when the lens reveals ghostly tools and Lira reframes the narrator’s task (“not in glass cases but in hands and throats”). The conflict is more moral and vocational than peril-based, but it does force a real renunciation (leaving when the contract ends) with a felt cost. A slightly sharper on-page sense of what staying risks practically would push stakes even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Aurek can repurpose a world-hunger oracle to sidestep fate and sorrow—is clear and present early. Pressure escalates coherently as he moves from rumor to mechanism to direct engagement with the hunger stone; the main tightening comes when he decides to reconfigure the yoyo’s core and then commit by casting it into the crack. Internal and external stakes align, but the sense of risk (what might be lost, to him or the world) is more implied than sharply foregrounded. As a result, the climax is conceptually strong yet emotionally gentler than the premise could support.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will remain “wrong” and claimed by darkness or truly return—is legible early via the cursed Polaroid and the advisor’s threat. Pressure escalates from eerie observation (lingering luminance) to more direct tests: the dream dictionary warnings, the mirror replay of his death, then the embodied Fear-child with the clasp and his own corpse nearby. His choice to kneel, confess, and take the clasp is a clear act that forecloses the option of retreating into death or passive haunting. The cost—accepting fear of life and visibility—is conceptually strong even though the external danger resolves swiftly once he complies.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—keeping the drifting orchard-home upright and safe while Aera wrestles with unreadable futures—is signaled early and escalates coherently with the larger wave and dangerous leeward slew. Aera’s choice to change instruments (mast, not apple) and to orchestrate the crew’s movements from what she hears in the structure is a meaningful tightening driven by her agency. There is a visible cost and risk: the platform is already near failure; rebalancing requires rapid, coordinated action under fear. The only limitation is that the piece leans more on lyric deepening than on multiple sharp reversals, so the sense of narrowing options, though present, is relatively gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Keth will challenge the city’s fearful stasis to confront the unseen pressure on the turtles—is clearly signaled and tightened via the increasingly “broken” shell patterns and the council’s reluctance. The main escalation is his decision to bypass the Council and risk an untested signal, culminating in the turtles’ unexpected response. Stakes remain somewhat abstract (no immediate visible harm yet from the cracking or the turn), so the felt price is more potential than present. The conflict is strong but could be sharpened by a single on-page consequence or irreversible loss as he acts.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central stake—control over how a powerful fiction is used as real-world precedent—is clearly articulated and tightened through the dialogue. Pressure escalates from moral objection to concrete demand (release drafts, acknowledge fiction) to an explicit threat of exposure with dates and contracts, which crystallizes Elias’s agency. The conflict remains largely intellectual and ethical, with little on-page sense of personal jeopardy beyond implication, so the stakes feel high conceptually but cool emotionally. Still, the final trade-off—faith and stability versus night vision and truth—is a real ethical pinch that meaningfully narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara will continue her quiet, unauthorized resistance against erasure—is clear and coheres with each beat. Escalation is subtle: dwindling ink, rising tide, and the sequence of columns build a calm but discernible pressure toward completion before submergence. The internal conflict is more about endurance than decision; she never seriously considers abandoning the practice or being discovered, so there’s limited sense of a foreclosed alternative path. This keeps tension poised and beautiful, but not fully braced to a sharp, costly turn.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake is Mara’s pursuit of truthful origins versus the settlement’s preference for pacifying myth; this is clearly signaled and returns at the end. Escalation is modest but present: the blackout removes oversight, heightens the sense of risk/possibility, and she moves from abstract suspicion to concrete evidence. The discovery of the hidden folio and imitation stamp is a genuine deepening of conflict, narrowing interpretive options about the library’s past. Still, the tension remains largely intellectual and atmospheric—no immediate counterforce or explicit consequence presses on her in the moment of revelation, slightly softening perceived cost.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—whether Liora will finally refine and externalize her most painful memory—is clear early and tightens when the basilica “waits for her, not for a stranger.” Pressure escalates from ritual preparation (three cups, unused visitors’ infrastructure) to opening the locket to the intensely sensory gem-polishing sequence, where the cost is acutely felt. Her agency drives the key turns: she chooses to open the locket, to polish rather than keep it dull, and to transform it into cranes. The conflict stays primarily internal and never quite risks genuine backsliding once she starts polishing, which keeps this just short of maximal tension.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—how the narrator uses their power to shape futures—is explicit early and steadily tightened as the anomaly proves to be their obliterated village. Escalation is mostly internal but real: the vortex shifts from puzzling data artifact to embodiment of “all that suffocated momentum,” raising the ethical pressure. Agency is clear at the close when they divert resources and re-aim the model, foreclosing pure obedience to the array’s destructive mandate. The stakes remain conceptual rather than dramatized in concrete consequences, which keeps this shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira can transform her relationship to the war’s instruments and find a “frequency of belonging”—is clear, and pressure coheres around decoding the chip’s absences. The main escalation comes when the stars literally map onto the missing squares, transforming a long-standing haunting into an urgent interpretive task. However, the conflict never quite sharpens into a difficult trade-off or visible loss; the shift feels revelatory but relatively low-friction. A single moment where she nearly recoils from what the mapping implies (her complicity, or the impossibility of restitution) would raise the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central conflict—whether to maintain comforting falsity or confront and expose difficult truths—is clear and tightened steadily as he moves from contemplation to grounded investigation to a binding decision. The discovery that his father was “smuggling the past itself” is a meaningful deepening that reweights the stakes from private guilt to a legacy of resistance. The final choice to study and reveal the carvings forecloses the safer path of continued silence, but the price remains more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page. A single concrete hint of the danger or fallout awaiting him would sharpen the stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes are sharply drawn early (lives of prisoners plus the narrator’s need not to repeat a fatal mistake) and then deeply intensified when his supposedly dead brother is introduced as a surprise bargaining chip. The central dilemma—save the last of his family or uphold a hard-earned ethical line about uneven exchanges—is a genuine conflict between competing goods. The choice to refuse is clearly his, not fate’s, and it forecloses a path with an unmistakable emotional and relational price. Internal and external conflict are tightly braided, with no cheap outs or deflations.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant conflict—whether to surrender to the water or turn back toward the messy shore-life he’s damaged—is clear and escalates as he paddles farther into fog, past more poles. The idea of “let the water decide” crystallizes the suicidal or at least self-erasing option, and the barnacles/“tidal zone” realization serves as a thematic tightening rather than a mere observation. His reversal toward shore is earned and does foreclose a path, but the external stakes (actual danger, irreversibility) are kept somewhat abstract, which softens the sense of price. Tension operates more as accumulating pressure than sharp reversals, which works but limits intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are mostly moral and conceptual—whether anyone will hold the city’s discarded cruelty long enough to revive empathy—and that feels thematically rich. There is some external pressure (breaching the welded door, entering the eerie underground, the lake’s cold/reactive nature), but these obstacles are overcome almost too smoothly. Escalation reads more as deepening atmosphere and revelation than as tightening options with clear costs. The narrator’s wading in is a meaningful act, but the price of doing so (or of refusing) could be made more viscerally legible.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator will sacrifice self (and beasts) to bridge death—is clear early and tightened effectively as the ritual proceeds and the metamorphosis becomes irreversible. Internal conflict is sharp (“I do not want to change…” vs. the choice to go on) and escalates into a concrete price: bodily transformation and the animals’ dissolution. The relationship pressure (“You should not have come”) reinforces the cost rather than undercutting it. The conflict is primarily internal and spiritual rather than oppositional, but the pressure never goes slack and culminates in a meaningful foreclosure of the old life.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.5)
    The stake—whether he will keep sacrificing family time for mystical work or choose his daughter—is clear early and tightens as he moves from abstract guilt to concrete visions of specific lost moments. The pressure escalates through the card images to the bridge of mist, where every missed bedtime becomes a literalized vortex he must face, and his eventual reversal (turning back down the mountain) carries a credible cost. This is primarily internal conflict, but it feels consequential and not merely contemplative. A slightly stronger sense of what he’s tangibly giving up by renouncing or reconfiguring his cartomancy could have sharpened the price further.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—unlocking the sealed dimension by metabolizing humanity’s shadow without abandoning pacifism—is clear early and threads through the piece. Pressure escalates texturally as the narrator confronts increasingly severe memories (flood, genocide, moments where killing “seemed…like the only mercy”), culminating in a decisive intensification when the hopeful tree-planting scene finally shifts the pattern and opens the dimension. The cost is primarily emotional and durational (centuries of exposure to atrocity, brittle pacifism), and the story makes it legible. Some readers might want one more concrete on-page test or trade-off in the present frame, but the internal stakes are substantial and consistent with the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the camps will be annihilated by lava—is clearly signaled and escalates smoothly from prophetic unease to concrete evacuation alarm. Pressure tightens meaningfully when the bells ring and Niko must rapidly convert his usual low-stakes coincidence-making into a life-or-death strategy, forcing a bolder, riskier use of his gift. The external conflict is strong, while the internal conflict around prophecy and agency is gestured at more than fully tested; Niko decides quickly and cleanly once the danger is known. The resolution is solidly earned by his deliberate plan rather than coincidence, though the price he pays feels primarily physical and emotional, not yet morally fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Iri will use this rare blackout and covert invitation to begin undermining the fort’s control—is legible early and tightened by the arrival of Trann and the coded sundial. The main escalation is the discovery that someone else has mapped the same vulnerabilities, forcing her to choose between continued quiet dissent and active subversion. Her final choice to bridge the dormant circuits is a real crossing of a line, but the on-page sense of danger or loss (what she might forfeit if discovered, what immediate systems she’s compromising) could be sharpened. Tension is more cerebral and conceptual than visceral, which is effective but slightly limits the feeling of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether motion will freeze into stillness or be given structure—is clear, and it coheres with Arin’s personal drive to understand the patterns beneath the world. Pressure escalates as he moves from preparation (stones) to irreversible action (uncorking the vial) to a constrained choice between futures, with the risk of eternal sliding as a sharp, legible cost. The return of friction is an earned turn that narrows options and lands both physically and conceptually. The conflict remains largely internal and cosmic rather than opposed by an active antagonist, which keeps tension slightly cooler than it might be.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the poet will choose to confront the sky’s record of silencing and what that does to his ability to live with unforgiven harm—is established and tightened by the one-hour limit and his internal hesitation. Escalation is subtle but present: from threshold pause, to entering, to consenting to look, to the overwhelming vision. The astronomer applies steady pressure by defining the vigil’s terms (“we watch, we do not intervene”), which narrows his options to presence versus flight. The stakes remain more intellectual and emotional than materially perilous, but for this mode they’re clear and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.2)
    The conflict is largely conceptual and anticipatory: Darius fencing against “the inertia of stillness,” awaiting clients who will bring a dispute over “the ownership of tomorrow.” Escalation occurs through revelation (the tin matches the sundial; someone has pre-tuned his arena) and the late arrival of the disputants, which raises the stakes from private rehearsal to an impending duel of destinations. However, the dominant stake—how he will handle this loaded debate—is not actually tested on the page; no option is yet foreclosed, and no visible price is paid. The tension is elegant but low-temperature, more poised setup than full escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stakes—keep the clandestine literary resistance alive versus being extinguished or co-opted—are clear and present from early on. The patrol’s arrival is a true escalation that forces immediate tactical choices: extinguish the candle, hide the tin, adopt a safe persona, endure scrutiny. Internal conflict (fear of molting into someone who believes the lullabies) interweaves with the external threat in that moment, giving the choice to continue afterward weight. The piece remains more about endurance than transformation, so while the escalation is effective, the price is mostly implied risk rather than a visible on-page loss.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether to remain in a refuge of unfinished moments or re-enter a scripted world on their own terms—is clearly signaled and coherently escalates. Leon’s decision to enter the film, confront Mara, and then invite a joint off-script encore represent meaningful tightenings. The tension remains mostly internal and thematic rather than viscerally perilous, but it suits the piece’s mode. Costs (surrendering the safety of non-choice; risking a future together) are present though subtly rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central stake—whether to let a new, disruptive dream rewrite collective memory—is clearly articulated and pressed by the anomalous events and the council’s demand. Escalation is primarily knowledge-deepening rather than reversal: the island’s unrest builds, then the dream-tree reveals a pre-island origin that dramatically raises the conceptual cost of Kael’s choice. Because the story ends at the moment of reweighted knowledge rather than a concrete decision, we don’t see a path explicitly foreclosed yet, but the narrowing of options is clear. A small on-page move toward or away from action after waking could have intensified perceived cost.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how he can meaningfully apologize across an ontological rupture—is clear from early on. Escalation comes through deepening rather than reversals: the compass finally fixes, the second lace appears, and the pale light + ghost ships reveal the tides of remembrance as concretely operative. His agency is quiet but real in choosing to trust the lace and accept a non-verbal, uncertain apology instead of clinging to control. The pressure remains internal and could edge closer to crisis to fully satisfy elite-venue expectations, but it coheres and tightens credibly for this length.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.3)
    The pressure is coherent but quiet; the "fresh squall" and Amir's skepticism provide sufficient testing of Lena's new philosophy, though the stakes remain largely internal/philosophical. The tightening occurs when she explicitly articulates the link between "gutters ignored" and neutron stars, foreclosing the return to her old, dramatic methods.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.6)
    The stakes—survival and the need for answers—are clear, and the internal pressure of recovery is well-drawn. However, the external conflict remains largely retrospective until the final lines; the antagonist is a memory, and the "confrontation" is deferred beyond the story's end, softening the immediate tension.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from personal isolation to a city-wide solution. The progression from testing "Grief" to "Wonder" provides a clear deepening of the conflict, moving from processing trauma to projecting hope. The lack of an active antagonist is balanced by the overwhelming environmental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.5)
    The internal pressure—Elias’s drive to organize rest—escalates coherently as he moves from the known duty of the grave to the overwhelming chaos of the library. While external opposition is minimal, the thematic stakes ("rest has gone missing") provide sufficient tension to drive his acceptance of the new, impossible task.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure is coherent, driven by the situational constraint of the sanctions and the immediate mystery. The resolution avoids a binary win/loss, instead opting for a deepening of stakes where the cost is the community's shared, silent burden.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.0)
    Internal pressure escalates well through the camera vision, transforming the abstract "ache" into a visual terror ("swarm of sparks"). The external conflict with the teenager provides a necessary testing ground for the realization, though the boy's rapid calming resolves the tension a bit too conveniently for the established weight of the struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.8)
    Tension is limited because the protagonist's desire aligns perfectly with the maze's threat; the escalation lacks a counter-force or difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.0)
    Pressure is coherent and escalates effectively via the "countdown without a clock" (distant detonations). The binary outcome—opening the vault versus triggering the explosives—creates sharp, immediate tension that informs every micro-movement in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.3)
    The internal stakes are high and clearly articulated, centering on the protagonist's unresolved trauma. The escalation is subtle but effective, moving from general collection to a specific, testing confrontation with the device. The resolution is earned through a change in perspective and a physical adjustment to the mechanism, though the external pressure is relatively low.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.6)
    The stakes are effectively internalized, centering on the narrator's understanding of their own art and destiny. While the external conflict is low-pressure, the waning light creates a functional ticking clock that anchors the abstract stakes, and the final cost—the loss of the narrator's protective superstition—is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.0)
    Narrative tension is minimal; there is no active opposition or obstacle for the protagonist to overcome. The "conflict" is purely philosophical (control vs. invitation) and conveyed through lecture rather than dramatized struggle. The pressure comes from the environment (melting ice) but does not force a difficult trade-off for the narrator.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are high and personal (erasure of identity), escalating through the surreal exclusion by the studio. The turning point with the child's cast provides a clear mechanism for the protagonist to reclaim agency, pivoting the conflict from external oppression to internal repurposing with distinct on-page proof.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.7)
    Tension is effectively anchored to the dying star, creating a clear countdown. The stakes are high (existential loss of direction), though the conflict is primarily man-against-nature/fate rather than interpersonal.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.9)
    The conflict is internal and atmospheric, escalating effectively as HEPA-3 moves from passive observation to active experimentation with the violin. While external opposition is minimal, the pressure of the repeating timeline and the persistent "ache" of curiosity provide sufficient narrative drive to force the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes are clear but largely internal; the external threat of "regulations" vanishes early, leaving only the personal risk of rejection. The escalation works well, transitioning from safe archival work to the exposure of the public plaza. The cost is felt in her physical anxiety ("heart pounding"), though the resolution comes a bit too easily once she steps forward.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving organic luck against a quantified prognosis—is clear, though the antagonism remains largely atmospheric/systemic rather than active. The pressure escalates through Elias's physical deterioration and the return of the crowds, satisfying the requirements for an accumulative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.3)
    Conflict is largely abstract; while the stakes (losing the valley) are high, the on-page pressure is low as the machine offers no resistance. The protagonist solves the central problem immediately upon engaging with it, missing an opportunity for escalation or a "try/fail" beat.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.8)
    Tension escalates effectively from the physical pressure of the "icy" water to the intellectual stakes of deciphering the ghost's code. The deepening is marked by the protagonist's transition from "pretending" to engaging, though the stakes remain largely internal and atmospheric rather than externally urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from a personal need for clarity to the revelation of a malicious geopolitical reality. The turning point—where the oracle refutes the "collateral damage" theory in favor of intentional targeting—deepens the conflict significantly, leaving Mara with a burden she cannot act upon but must endure.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tension between the narrator's skepticism and Evan's desperate need for validation creates a distinct and coherent pressure throughout the scene. The stakes escalate naturally from a physical exploration to a moral judgment, though the external conflict (the fire investigation) is largely backstory.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.4)
    The conflict is primarily philosophical—observation vs. engagement—but is made urgent through the physical encroachment of the swan and the roots. The escalation is steady, and the final choice carries a tangible price: the abandonment of his "vantage of neutrality" and the exposure of the hidden library.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.9)
    Escalation is mild; the "restless" residents are soothed with relative ease, and the climax relies on a collective mood shift rather than a sharp test of Mara's agency. The stakes feel managed rather than truly risked.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.2)
    Pressure is virtually non-existent; Brann faces no resistance from the environment, the artifacts, or his own limitations. While the thematic scope widens from one woman to the species' history, the lack of conflict or active stakes prevents true escalation. The "demanding editor" notes a lack of tension on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.6)
    The stakes are clear: the preservation of the island's "familiar enigma" against external control. While the antagonist ("someone up-coast") remains abstract, the immediate tension with Parker and the prophetic weight of the fortunes provides sufficient pressure to force the protagonist's choice.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes (a soul) are high, but the on-page escalation is linear and relatively low-pressure. The antagonist offers standard taunts before quickly succumbing to Jonas's argument; the demon never truly threatens Jonas's control or forces him to improvise beyond his established plan, resulting in a climax that feels inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.2)
    The stakes are internal but clear: the pressure to connect time before the deadline crystallizes in the decision to write "DO NOT WASTE." While external opposition is low, the "meaningful tightening" of his longing into a conductor's focus provides sufficient narrative propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are clear—sanity versus fracture—and the cost of the resolution (accepting gravity) is felt on the page. The escalation inside the "corridors" feels slightly smooth; the obstacles yield to his choices with minimal friction, reducing the sense of peril before the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.1)
    The stakes—the spiritual and emotional vitality of the children—are established early and felt deeply. While the external conflict is low (the machine simply works when activated), the internal pressure and the release of "old griefs" provide a satisfying escalation. The cost is emotional vulnerability, paid on the page by Jorin and witnessed by Eira.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.7)
    The escalation from the physical threat of being followed to the ethical weight of the message tube is handled smoothly. The stakes rise from personal safety to complicity in a resistance network, forcing a meaningful trade-off between security and "integrity in solitude."

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.5)
    Internal stakes are high and clearly defined; Elias's fear of memory provides strong resistance to Mara's request, generating tension in a low-action scene. The pressure escalates naturally through the sensory application of the scent, forcing a choice that carries the felt cost of reliving the trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.4)
    Conflict is intellectual and retrospective, lacking immediate scene stakes; the narrator is never at risk in the grotto, and the "energy beings" exert no active pressure on the dialogue. The central choice is discussed in the abstract ("futures felt suddenly optional") rather than tested through a difficult on-page trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.7)
    The "chronic hush" acts as a pervasive, atmospheric antagonist that pressurizes Elio’s need to communicate. While the stakes are internal and aesthetic, the escalation to the "deepest hush" of the greenhouse forces a coherent stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are clear and escalated efficiently; the dealer’s warning ("you may not like the person who walks back out") crystallizes the price of the transaction. The final choice feels earned and forecloses the return to her previous "authoritarian" clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.0)
    Conflict is virtually absent; Marin accepts the letter and Elias's presence immediately, and the dialogue proceeds with mutual understanding rather than the friction required to generate heat. The stakes are nominally about "uplifting contributors," but without a risk of failure, rejection, or cost to Elias's reputation, the tension remains flat.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.8)
    The stakes are clear—belonging versus isolation—but the pressure remains low throughout; the search for the tag is a cooperative walk without risk or cost. The "tightening" comes from the discovery and interpretation of the message, but the lack of external resistance or internal doubt limits the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure escalates cleanly from physical navigation to metaphysical manipulation. The stakes pivot effectively from fulfilling a contract to an existential decision about the survival of potential futures, though the external consequence regarding the client remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.8)
    The stakes are established early and escalate clearly when the orchard "contracts" and resists the spell. The pressure forces a stance crystallization—realizing that retrieval would be destructive—leading to a meaningful trade-off between desire and integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is minimal; the outage facilitates Marrow's goal rather than obstructing it, and he faces no risk of exposure or failure when choosing to intervene. The stakes—emotional relief—are clear but low-pressure, as the protagonist encounters no meaningful opposition or dilemma that forces a sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are clear and the storm provides effective external pressure that mirrors the internal conflict. Escalation is present, though the final turn relies more on passive surrender than active confrontation, slightly softening the agency.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes escalate clearly from the abstract (painting the lost sea) to the concrete (survival/filters) via Eron’s challenge. The pressure is coherent: the environmental crisis creates the opportunity, and the community need defines the goal. The climax resolves the tension between observation and action, though the final obstacle (the guard) yields with perhaps too little friction to reach the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.4)
    The conflict is internal (Lyra's need for control vs. reality) externalized by the cave's rebellion. The pressure escalates coherently from the shivering lanterns to the pearl's autonomous movement. While the stakes are relatively low-key (professional embarrassment/epiphany), the cost of Lyra's "proud role" melting is felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are intimate but significant: the restoration of communal voice after exile. The pressure comes from the heavy silence and the risk of the gesture failing. While the conflict is quiet, the escalation—from solitary walking to the public speech to the tension of Caven's approach—is coherent and gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes are primarily internal (curiosity vs. safety) and the external environment acts more as an invitation than an obstacle. While the "tug" of the mystery provides momentum, the lack of significant resistance or hard choices lowers the tension. The protagonist is pulled toward his destiny rather than having to fight for it.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.5)
    While the internal stakes are clear, the moment of panic ("where did I end") is resolved rather quickly by the protagonist's own reasoning ("Reason... demanded"), dampening the potential tension. The conflict remains largely cerebral, lacking a sharp, external pressure point to force the final shift.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are clear and escalate appropriately: the external pressure of the storm forces a confrontation with the internal desire for stasis. The conflict resolves through a meaningful change in stance, though the resolution comes partially through listening to the fragment rather than direct counter-action.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.4)
    The dominant stake (asylum vs. legacy) is tightened by the dawn deadline and the discovery of the "fair trade" logic. The escalation is psychological yet grounded in physical action, forcing a trade-off that creates a new, dangerous reality for the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.2)
    Conflict is primarily internal and existential—the stationer against the entropy of a silent world—but it escalates effectively as the physical toll ("knuckles ache") and emotional stakes rise. The shift from "stories" to an "index" represents a meaningful deepening of his strategy in the face of the lamp's "incandescent restraint." While the external pressure is low-key, the internal pressure to find meaning accumulates to a satisfying, if quiet, peak.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.2)
    Pressure is low throughout; the conflict is philosophical (memory vs. bureaucracy) rather than immediate or visceral. The protagonist faces no significant opposition until the coincidental "voice" in the container, and the stakes remain abstract ("erased life") without a felt, on-page cost for his decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.8)
    The stakes are effectively internalized; the pressure escalates from intellectual curiosity to a visceral confrontation with personal shame and existential doubt. The narrative tightens meaningfully as the cello forces her to relive the moment with her lover, transforming a philosophical question into an emotional cost. The resolution acknowledges the pain without erasing it.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are clearly established early and escalate naturally from bureaucratic reorganization to existential threat. The pressure points are tangible—rent hikes, security gates—and force the protagonist into a deeper complicity and eventual resistance. The cost of the final stance is felt, even if the outcome remains suspended.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.8)
    The stakes are effectively layered: the bureaucratic erasure of history versus the personal need to witness it. The escalation comes from the ticking clock and the temptation to falsify the report, a micro-choice that creates genuine moral tension. The resolution is quiet but carries significant felt cost—the permanent loss of the footprint.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.1)
    The stakes are stated ("owner had begged") but remain abstract; the repair process proceeds smoothly without significant setbacks or risk of failure. The conflict is primarily technical rather than dramatic, lacking a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt or where Elias must sacrifice something significant to succeed.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.9)
    Pressure escalates coherently from the falcon's arrival to the physical risk of the ice trek. The dominant stake—truth vs. official safety—is resolved with a felt cost, as the protagonist accepts the impending administrative fallout.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=4.9)
    Conflict is minimal; the town and its silence offer no active resistance, resulting in a linear progression of success without setbacks. The stakes remain abstract ("balance") and are resolved by a low-pressure arrival rather than a forced trade-off or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clearly defined as a tension between professional protocol and existential longing. The escalation is driven by agency—the decision to launch the drone despite risk—and the final cost (becoming a "solitary archive" in a dying station) is palpable and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are clearly defined (survival vs. erasure), and the pressure escalates from physical confinement to the temporal threat of the discovered bodies. The cost is legible in the physical toll of his listening vigil ("numbs my jaw") and the risk of the coming dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes are clear, but pressure is undercut by the protagonist's lack of resistance. The conflict is resolved through the external imposition of the past life's memory rather than a difficult, active choice made by the current narrator in the face of the ghost's demand.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes are high conceptually (the town's future) but low in the immediate scene; there is no external antagonist or time pressure forcing the hand, only internal resolve. The escalation is textural—moving deeper, carving harder—rather than causal. The cost is physical (aching hand) but feels relatively light given the weight of the "broken precedents."

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is minimal; potential antagonists like the priest and Rafi capitulate without enforcing any visible cost, trade-off, or argument. The inciting incident for the climax (the storm/trench collapse) is an external accident rather than a result of character agency, leaving the stakes theoretical rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.8)
    The stakes are intimately braided: the professional challenge of the "perfect name" vs. the personal risk of reaching out to a ghost. The tension escalates quietly but firmly through the drafting process, culminating in the "chalk code" risk.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are clearly established with the looming coup, and pressure escalates as the prince demands a chart that defies standard navigation. The conflict is resolved through agency, with Liora refusing a binary choice in favor of a "ghost" path. While the dialogue carries the weight well, the external pressure remains somewhat static outside the conversation.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure escalates coherently from the spirits' lullaby to an inquisitive song, then to a near-scream that forces Lysa to act. The stakes are clear—recovering the specific emotional truth of the death—and the obstacle (the spirits' resistance) is overcome through Lysa's direct agency. The cost is felt in the physical toll and the "ragged breath" at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clear and escalate quietly but effectively through the translation of the cast messages. The pressure peaks with the boy's impossible question about the sea, forcing Mara to abandon neutrality. The cost is the emotional weight she carries out of the room.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are primarily thematic and internal; the external pressure is low, with the risk of discovery mentioned but never imminent. While the Accumulative escalation works well for this quiet mode, the lack of immediate resistance or harder trade-offs keeps the tension moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.7)
    The conflict is primarily internal and philosophical, lacking significant external pressure or resistance beyond the "grime." While the climax forces a stance, the stakes remain low-key and conceptual; the "patron" represents a risk that is acknowledged but not felt in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the conceptual stakes (thought tax) are high, the on-page conflict is low. The arrival of the entomologist—the scene's primary source of tension—resolves instantly into support without forcing the protagonist to make a difficult trade-off or pay a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.6)
    While the stakes (loss of the moon) are established, the antagonist (the clouds/absence) provides little resistance, crumbling immediately upon the protagonist's negotiation. The lack of a difficult trade-off or risk of failure flattens the escalation, keeping the tension atmospheric rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from the threat of disorder (the chime) to the threat of loss (the wandering song). The cost is subtle but legible—the "faint aftertaste" of imperfection and the caretaker's deepening isolation. The pressure remains coherent under the atmospheric lens.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are clearly defined as the permanent loss of a relationship ("paths diverge"). The escalation works through the high-risk execution of the vow, and the cost—structural inability to hide—is legible and felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are clear and high; the escalation from the adhesive analysis to the council's argument works well. Arlen's intervention forces a decisive stance, though the council's capitulation feels slightly rapid for the depth of the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.6)
    The stakes—Noel's constructed peace versus the intrusion of his tragic past—are established early and escalate well with the woman's arrival. However, the resolution of this conflict dissolves into a summary montage, muting the visceral tension of the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.1)
    Escalation is driven by the protagonist’s active testing of the world’s rules (moving the chair), raising the stakes from intellectual curiosity to existential danger. The conflict between the desire for closeness and the necessity of distance is resolved with a high-cost trade-off that is visible on the page. The tension holds firmly until the final image of the uncrossed threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.5)
    While the internal stakes are clear, the external conflict is low-voltage; Mira agrees to the "against protocol" override with minimal resistance, and the "supervisors" remain abstract. The tension is largely atmospheric rather than interpersonal or urgent, which softens the impact of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are intellectual and abstract (understanding the blanks) rather than viscerally felt. While the unease grows ("small dark crab"), the conflict remains low-pressure, and the resolution comes without significant personal cost or sacrifice beyond the effort of the journey.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.6)
    The pressure is coherent and escalates cleanly via the rising tide and the crowd's initial indifference. While the stakes are low-key (a street performance), the narrative successfully elevates them to existential importance for the woman in red, creating a felt shift in the room's dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are excellent; the external threat of the "nostalgia ban" provides context, but the internal conflict—the trade of one memory for another—drives the tension. The escalation to the final price is earned and impactful.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central conflict—preservation versus progress—is clear but familiar, and the stakes feel somewhat low-pressure given Kade's mild reaction ("laughed the practical laugh"). While the narrator’s decision to submit a poetic estimate creates a conceptual clash, the immediate on-page cost is minimal. The escalation is internal and contemplative rather than driving rising external tension.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.4)
    The conflict is primarily internal, centering on Rafe's decision to break his silence. While the choice to share the box is a clear beat of vulnerability, the external pressure is low, and Maya's passive role results in a soft escalation that lacks urgent, immediate risk.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clearly defined as a struggle between hope and the "statistics of collapse." The escalation is handled well through the three phases of the experiment: testing the good, testing the bad (isolation), and testing the apathy (the "ugly pattern"). The discovery of the "Unlifted" state—stagnation rather than catastrophe—deepens the stakes beyond simple binary survival. The cost is internal (grief for parallel selves), which is sufficient for this scope, though the external pressure remains largely abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes escalate from a routine survey to a metaphysical obligation, supported by the quiet pressure of the "shifting weather." While the external threat is mild, the internal conflict regarding the "unfinished" work provides sufficient tension. The tightening occurs effectively when the film strip reveals the depth of the legacy, narrowing the protagonist's moral options.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.3)
    The external stakes (the brother’s suicide) are high, but the internal stakes for the painter remain abstract. The "interest in grace" is a conceptual cost rather than a felt, on-page obstacle; because the painter accepts the burden without hesitation or visible symptom, the dramatic tension is dampened.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—peace versus justice—is sharpened through the envoy's resistance, forcing the negotiator to articulate a painful trade-off. The climax is driven by active agency; the negotiator's rebuttal (&quot;decide whether more villages will burn&quot;) effectively closes the envoy's escape route. The cost of this victory is palpable and immediate, satisfying the requirement for visible price in a high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.3)
    The conflict between the man's engineered silence (the drought) and the "bright and impossible" echo creates high internal pressure. The stakes are effectively raised by the "last known egg" status, making the release a costly, irreversible gesture within the story's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (conformity vs. expression) is clear, and the protagonist makes a decisive choice to rebel. However, escalation is dampened by the lack of active resistance; the magic yields to Iri immediately, and no obstacle complicates her descent or the weaving process. The tension remains theoretical until the consequences ripple upward, limiting the visceral impact of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.9)
    The central stake—intellectual integrity vs. the exploitation of suffering—is made visceral through the students' confrontation. The escalation forces the narrator to abandon their safety rail and engage in a high-stakes vulnerability exercise.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are immediately established as the survival of a species, creating high pressure that is tangible in the wind's threat to the butterfly. Escalation occurs through Erin's active adjustments—shifting twigs and untangling roots in real-time response to the monarch's hesitation. The cost is subtle but felt: the weight of past extinctions and the knowledge that this victory is fleeting.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.4)
    The stakes are deeply personal and the cost—abandoning a lifelong medium (bronze) for a new, uncertain one (sound)—is palpable. The external pressure is somewhat low, as the mentor figure offers little resistance and the rope yields quickly to the protagonist’s touch, but the internal pressure of the "tremor of old failure" compensates to drive the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.7)
    Escalation is coherent and relentless, driven by the dual pressures of the approaching storm and the decaying mind. The stakes shift organically from maintenance to survival to existential definition. The binary choice at the end is sharpened by the physical threat of the water intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are clearly established as existential and intellectual ("gambled their remaining years"), appropriate for the character. The tension of the alignment process is handled well, though the conflict remains largely internal and atmospheric. The pressure builds effectively to the moment of the star's divergence.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.8)
    The stakes are high and personal, escalating from a desire for peace to a confrontation with profound guilt. The central twist—that the protagonist was the perpetrator, not the victim—is a powerful escalation that fundamentally alters the conflict and imposes a heavy, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are clearly defined (capturing the dream vs. losing the self) and escalate logically as the ritual consumes Elias's reflection. The final beat is a decisive act of surrender/integration that feels earned by the prior setup of the "breathing" mechanic.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are largely retrospective or internal, with the external antagonist (bankers) absent from the scene. The conflict lacks immediate physical pressure; the transition from "fixing" to "tending" is a gentle realization rather than a forced trade-off with visible immediate cost.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.8)
    The conflict is primarily internal—the struggle against forbidden knowledge—escalated by the atmospheric pressure of the annotations. While the intellectual stakes are high (the erosion of chronology), the visceral cost feels slightly abstract until the physical breach of the mirror. The pressure is coherent, leading naturally to the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are raised effectively by the clerk's condition ("exit conditional"), turning a research trip into a gamble. The pressure holds through the climax, forcing a significant emotional trade-off at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.9)
    The stakes are clear: a choice between the safety of definition and the risk of "aberrant" integration. While the conceptual cost is high, the external opposition is minimal; the protagonist navigates the ship with relative ease until the final psychological confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes remain theoretical ("footnotes," "angry letters") rather than visceral. The pressure—a clock striking thirteen—signals wrongness but does not force a difficult trade-off or escalate immediate danger. The conflict resolves via a set of instructions, bypassing the need for a high-stakes decision.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.2)
    The external pressure (storm/energy beings) is established well, but the protagonist's safety never feels truly threatened due to his "assurance." The conflict is resolved through mastery rather than a desperate trade-off or hard tactical pivot, limiting narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.8)
    The conflict between the protagonist's search for pattern and the "twitching of a dead universe" is escalated effectively by the tangible decay of his resources and body. The pressure is coherent and builds to a decisive action, where the cost is the destruction of the silence (the hush) to gain a fleeting, fragile connection.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are clearly articulated ("city would dissolve into polite strangers"), but the on-page conflict remains largely internal and procedural. The escalation relies on working faster against the shadows; while atmospheric, it lacks a sharp, visceral choice or trade-off beyond the inherent cost of the labor.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.3)
    The pressure is coherent and atmospheric, pitting the designer's art against the "gravity of hopelessness." While the stakes are primarily morale-based rather than visceral survival on the page, the tension is maintained through the environmental silence and the starless sky. The cost is felt in the artist's exposure to failure.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clear and personal; the tension of the "pause" serves as an effective pressure cooker for the relationship dynamic. The internal escalation—struggling to "foresee" effectively—drives the narrative forward without needing external melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clearly defined: the tension between the father's fear-based subterranean logic and the child's silence-seeking expansion. Escalation is situational, driven by the approaching gravity inversion which forces a physical and emotional confrontation. The resolution provides a meaningful release of this tension without unearned sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    The conflict is subtle—noise versus silence—and escalates clearly through the visual feedback of the blue line. While functional, the opposition is mild; the passengers yield to the experiment with minimal resistance, which limits the dramatic tension and sense of hard-won victory.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clearly defined as a trade-off between the comfort of edited oblivion and the pain of truth. The visual escalation of the murals and the "countdown" pressure ("stars blinking like cursors") effectively tighten the narrative vice toward the final decision.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.6)
    The stakes are clear and personal—emotional survival versus drowning in silence. The escalation works through the ritual interaction, though the conflict is resolved somewhat softly through the Keeper's guidance rather than a hard-won struggle or difficult choice by Mara herself.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clearly established: the physical threat of the pumps failing vs. the conceptual risk of releasing the "promises." The pressure escalates logically, forcing a binary choice that carries tangible weight.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are internal but keenly felt; the tension escalates effectively through the physical engagement with the machine and the rising sensory input. The pressure coheres under the Textural lens, culminating in a moment that feels earned and significant.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.3)
    The conflict is internalized but effectively externalized through Mira and the masks; the pressure scales coherently from the "late" arrival to the rejection of the masks. While the antagonist is distant, the immediate pressure on Calder's identity is sufficient to drive the stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are high (identity/erasure), but the opposition is largely passive (time/entropy), which lowers the immediate tension. The escalation relies on a montage of successes rather than a specific sharpening of a dilemma, though the brother's recognition provides a satisfying, if soft, peak.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake (memory vs. erasure) is clear and escalates appropriately through the journey. The pressure remains largely atmospheric and internal without a direct antagonist to force a harder trade-off, but the choice to follow the trail effectively deepens Lio's commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clear (life/death vs. redemption) and escalate well through the environment ("fog felt heavier," "prisms... misaligned"). The conflict resolves through an earned agency of omission (refusing to play).

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.2)
    The conflict is primarily internal and philosophical, escalated effectively by the arrival of the unique leaf and the "voice" of the tree. While the external pressure is quiet (fitting the fable tone), the stakes—understanding versus shaping the valley's future—are clear. The final choice carries the felt cost of abandoning a lifetime of safe observation.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.9)
    The tension is primarily internal and philosophical, maintained well throughout the short span. While external stakes are low, the psychological pressure of abandoning a lifelong philosophy of "certainty" provides sufficient weight to the final decision.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.9)
    The stakes are high and personal: the battle is against the finality of death/loss. The escalation follows Eira’s refusal to accept the search party's conclusion, culminating in a choice that trades the peace of closure for the "unclosed" burden of hope.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes are clear (restoring joy), but the opposition yields too easily; the ghosts comply with the invitation to laugh almost immediately, lacking a beat of struggle or rejection. Consequently, the victory feels low-cost, as the protagonist encounters minimal resistance from the forces she confronts.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are visceral and high, pitting the autonomy of the self against the potential utility of suffering. The escalation is internal but forceful, leading to a horrifying yet earned consensus between the survivor and the experiment.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are primarily internal and thematic, escalating from a desire for a tool to a confrontation with personal complicity. The pressure builds adequately to the final realization of shame. The external conflict is low (a simple transaction), but the emotional cost paid at the end provides necessary weight.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.6)
    The external pressure from the ghosts and the physical threat of the bulging ceiling effectively force the protagonist's hand. While the struggle is brief, the stakes are raised efficiently from a repair job to a breach in the fabric of reality.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes are clearly defined, but the external pressure collapses too easily; the librarians' swift acceptance of the new reality undermines the "teeth" of the deadline. The climax lacks visceral resistance, resolving through philosophical agreement rather than struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    The intellectual stakes (history as tomb vs. rehearsal) are dramatized well through the archaeological dispute. While the Council acts as a somewhat abstract antagonist, the pressure it exerts forces a tangible change in Mara's tactics and worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are globally high (the loss of light), but the immediate external pressure in the climax is dampened when the antagonist (the rust) "recoils like a scolded cat" rather than resisting. The protagonist’s competence dominates the final beat, smoothing the conflict curve.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.2)
    While the mystery deepens effectively, the protagonist faces minimal resistance; the environment yields to him rather than opposing him. The "psychometry" ability resolves the central epistemological conflict too easily, lowering the tension of the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake of finding direction is resolved through a shift in perspective. While the external pressure of the storm is mostly atmospheric, the internal tightening leads to a valid Conceptual Repricing where the cost is the surrender of certainty ("no blue line to follow").

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are purely intellectual; while the "discovery" drive works for the genre, the lack of opposition, time pressure, or personal cost creates a flat conflict profile. The protagonist succeeds simply by showing up and looking, which limits the narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure escalates steadily from the diary's heat to the debris messages, forcing Maris to act. The dominant stake—preserving truth vs. safe distance—is tightened by the "KNEEL" command. While the external opposition is quiet, the internal and thematic costs are legible and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are high (civilizational renewal) yet focused tightly on the immediate resistance of the bottle. The escalation is mental—holding complex patterns against the urge to simplify—which creates a distinct, palpable pressure on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.2)
    Tension builds effectively through the mystery of the artifact and the ritualistic atmosphere of the setting. While external antagonism is minimal, the raising of stakes from preserving a "confession" to witnessing a "prophecy" provides sufficient narrative pressure to carry the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are clearly defined and the cost of the magic—years of life—is established early and paid at the climax. The escalation relies somewhat heavily on dialogue-based explanation rather than dramatic interaction until the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes are clearly defined and crucially elevated: the binary choice between potential death (silence) and the death of trust (noise) creates immense pressure. The escalation is handled well through the instrument readings, moving from subtle patterns to the "red zone," forcing the protagonist to gamble on his intuition against empirical data.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are primarily internal and abstract; the conflict is an intellectual struggle with "invisibility" rather than a pressured situation. While the internal deepening is coherent, the lack of external pressure or harder choices limits the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.6)
    Escalation is steady and coherent, moving from the environmental shift (ghosts casting shadows) to the specific confrontation with Mara. The stakes are clearly defined as the loss of "unspoken words," and the pressure builds naturally to the unlocking of the shed. The resolution provides a meaningful deepening of the narrator's burden rather than a simple fix.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes are existential and well-escalated: the dissolution of reality ("yesterday could pool with tomorrow") forces the protagonist to adapt tactics from guarding to interpreting. The pressure is situational but coherent, forcing a crystallization of stance. The cost is felt in the burden of memory and the "sting" of time, resolving in a resonant, earned shift in perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.3)
    Stakes remain abstract and philosophical; the pressure is described physically ("teeth ache") but carries no narrative consequence if Elian fails. The resolution comes too easily—he hums, and the world fixes itself, followed by a being who validates his effort. There is no escalation of risk or hard choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are life-and-death, but the external conflict offers little resistance; the environment cooperates too easily (birds completing circuits, storm unlocking seams). The escalation feels accumulative rather than tension-filled, as potential obstacles (the storm) resolve problems instead of complicating them, reducing the sense of earned victory.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.8)
    The conflict is internalized—the skeptic’s ego versus the ritual’s demand—and escalates coherently through the realization of the "multiplied" footprints. While the external pressure is quiet, the deepening from solitary doubt to collective "chain" represents a meaningful shift in options and self-concept.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure is consistent and textural rather than acute, fitting the accumulative lens. The escalation occurs through the deepening specificity of the planting sites (from general soil to buried ammunition). While lacking sharp external antagonism, the internal weight of "uncounted years" provides sufficient drag and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.7)
    The stakes are clear and escalate from a technical puzzle to an emotional confrontation with trauma. The cost is felt in the stranger's physical reaction and the narrator's shift from isolation to communal waiting.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure builds coherently from the internal difficulty of sketching in warped time to the external intrusion of authority. While the external conflict arrives late, the internal struggle with the "warped reality" sustains the tension. The final beat forecloses the option of compliance, asserting a costly independence.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.1)
    Escalation stalls at the climax; the physical danger vanishes, and the interaction with the lid is frictionless ("did not resist me"), reducing the stakes to a philosophical transaction. The cost is paid (the king/secret), but the struggle feels low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure escalates coherently from the abstract (leaderless city) to the personal (confronting the lie of the "staged" disaster) and the urgent (gallery closing). While the external stakes of the interregnum are backgrounded, the internal tension between erasure and preservation drives the narrative. The final decision to "unbind" the archive effectively forecloses the option of silence.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    The stakes are intensely personal and escalate cleanly from a desire for comfort to a confrontation with trauma. The stone acts as an effective pressure point, demanding a response that carries a clear emotional price ("pain in my chest," "echoed inside my bones").

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stakes are high (an entire village), but the external opposition is static; the puzzle fights back only via darkening threads, which lowers immediate tension. The conflict is largely internal, and while the resolution is earned emotionally, the lack of a concrete, external counter-move or time pressure (beyond the abstract threat of the "shroud") limits the narrative urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are established early and escalated through the "interrogation" process, moving from a simple desire for acquittal to a struggle for self-definition. The cost of the transaction is tangible on the page—exhaustion and the loss of comforting ignorance. Zev’s refusal to accept the "first truth" creates meaningful narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are clearly established—survival and the quest for meaning against the encroaching acid. The escalation is tangible, moving from atmospheric dread to the immediate physical threat of the cracking glass. The resolution pays off the pressure with a distinct shift in tactics (narrating vs. neutralizing), though the physical cost is somewhat mitigated by the magical repair.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.1)
    Tension evaporates too quickly; the established danger of the caves ("tides devoured wanderers") is dismissed by the "warm and still" air, and the guttering lantern is instantly resolved by convenient moonlight. The central struggle remains abstract and philosophical, lacking a concrete obstacle that forces a difficult trade-off or tests the protagonist's commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.1)
    External stakes (the fleet, the sea's anger) are clear, but the internal or interpersonal stakes are low; Jorah offers no real opposition, and the magic exacts no visible price. The escalation is linear, lacking a moment of severe doubt or necessary sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.7)
    Pressure is coherent and situational, driven by the urgency of the call and the fragility of the connection. The escalation to the critical question—"Do you see it"—forces a meaningful tightening of options, resulting in a character-defining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes are clear (psychological safety vs. exposure), and the shared vulnerability with Risa escalates the tension. The resolution, however, feels slightly observational; the eye clears *during* the storm rather than because of a hard choice the protagonist made, reducing the sense of earned victory.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes escalate quietly but effectively from a routine report to the heavier burden of existential witnessing. The conflict is resolved through a meaningful internal reconfiguration, and while external opposition is minimal, the pressure of the Keeper's reality successfully forces a defining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.0)
    The rising water provides effective, time-sensitive pressure that forces the protagonist out of his chronic hesitation. The stakes—safety in a dead shop versus the dangerous potential of the unknown—are legible and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are established early (sky bleeding out) and escalate well through the physical danger of the climb. While the external threat is high, the personal stakes feel slightly muted because Isera's attachment to her current life is already severed ("Let them wait"), lowering the felt cost of her departure.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.6)
    The stakes are effectively personal and emotional, centered on the imminent loss of connection. The pressure escalates cleanly from the friends' arrival to the reveal of their departure, forcing Lio to pivot from theory to a concrete, sentimental application of the alchemy.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.7)
    The pressure escalates cleanly from the mystery of the blank scroll to the decision to leave the cabin. While the external threat (the "shifting weight" outside) is resolved somewhat obliquely by the choice to transcend/soar, the internal stance crystallization is decisive and potent.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.2)
    While the stakes of grief are clear, the conflict is low-friction; the engineer accepts the unconventional, poetic solution almost immediately ("Maybe... I do not have to see everything clearly"). The cost—surrendering the grandmother's relic—is present but feels soft due to the ease of his acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are clearly communicated, blending physical danger with emotional risk. However, the conflict is dampened by the Master's steady control; Lan executes instructions successfully without a moment where the safety net fully breaks, resulting in a test passed rather than a crisis navigated independently.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.0)
    The conflict escalates sharply when the ghost rejects Mirabel’s initial offering ("You sold thunder as jewelry"), forcing a tactical change. The stakes are clear: Mirabel must choose between her safe, profitable persona and the dangerous truth, and she pays the price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.6)
    The external stakes are high (universal erasure), and the pressure escalates visibly with the "hiccup" affecting galaxies and candles. However, the protagonist faces minimal opposition or internal resistance; the solution is enacted with competence rather than struggle, limiting the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure accumulates effectively through the countdown sequence, raising the stakes of the protagonist's internal struggle. While the conflict is primarily philosophical, the choice to abandon the key creates a legible cost in the loss of a potential answer.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are clearly drawn between professional duty and human connection, escalated by Rae's intervention and the stranger's gaze. The final choice feels earned, with the cost of breaching the "firewalled perimeter" acknowledged as a permanent shift in the model.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.0)
    The internal stakes (fear of loss vs. need for control) are well-calibrated and escalate naturally through the journey to the hospital. The contrast between the father's gambling and the daughter's probability models provides a solid framework for the conflict. The final beat—writing the note—is a meaningful micro-turn that resolves the tension by bridging their differing philosophies with a shared action.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.4)
    The stakes—breaking a painful emotional loop—are clear and felt, with the streetlamp acting as a ticking clock for the decision. While the resolution relies on Mara following a metaphorical instruction rather than a high-friction struggle in the moment, the "Decisive Change" is legible and the cost (abandoning the affair) is present on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure accumulates well through the ritual, but the external conflict is mild; the sea "answers" rather than resists. The resolution comes somewhat easily via Mara's dialogue explaining the mechanics of the covenant, which lowers the tension. The cost is felt ("haunted euphoria"), but the protagonist doesn't face a sharp, agonizing trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are clear and pressure accumulates effectively through the gathering crowd and the weight of the moon rock. The cost is legible—Kenji becomes "heavier with every truth"—though the conflict is primarily internal and thematic rather than interpersonal.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are clearly defined as a tension between the need to find lost loves and the fear of internal confrontation. The escalation works through increasing sensory intensity—from general forest hum to specific voices of the dead—rather than external opposition. The resolution offers a valid trade-off, renouncing the external search for necessary internal work, though the external pressure remains gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.0)
    The conflict is intellectual and retrospective rather than urgent; the protagonist overcomes the irreversibility of past mistakes with relative ease once the tool is understood. The lack of significant pushback from the anomaly or a higher personal price for altering reality keeps the tension in the middle band.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.4)
    The internal stakes (isolation vs. connection) are clear and poignant. The escalation is present as Lena moves from hesitation to full vulnerability in signing her memories. However, the external pressure is minimal, and the primary obstacle is overcome largely through the Advisor’s instruction rather than the protagonist's active problem-solving.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.5)
    Internal pressure is high, fueled by the specific weight of the protagonist's past crimes. While external resistance is minimal, the accumulation of clues creates a coherent textural escalation that successfully reweights the protagonist’s understanding of their mission.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.9)
    While the stakes are high (humanity's future), the on-page conflict lacks immediate resistance; the environment and the "others" yield effortlessly to the protagonist's drumming. The victory feels unearned by sacrifice, missing a felt cost for the rebellion.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are declared ("place shuts down") but never viscerally felt, as the protagonist encounters no genuine resistance from the environment or the task. The lack of escalation or struggle results in a flat trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are intimate but felt; the tension between silence and speech is well-escalated by the interplay of light. The resolution feels earned by the dentist's willingness to engage with the "constellations" and finally speak.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.5)
    Escalation is present but low-resistance; the opposition (apathy, the council) yields with minimal pushback. Daniel's efforts to recruit shop owners meet almost no friction, which flattens the dramatic tension and makes the stakes feel theoretical rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes remain abstract; Mara follows the pirate without significant resistance or dilemma, lowering the tension. The "strain" mentioned is largely backstory rather than an active obstacle in the boat. The central conflict—repression vs. expression—is resolved intellectually at the end rather than through a high-stakes test of character on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are clear (emotional autonomy vs. state surveillance) and escalate when the performer moves from eccentric narration to the illicit act of carving. The cost is subtle—the risk of leaving physical evidence ("contraband")—but felt. The tension holds, though the lack of an active on-page antagonist (beyond the turbines) keeps the conflict largely internal/environmental.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.0)
    Conflict is primarily retrospective or internal; with the ban lifted and the council absent, Lio faces no active opposition. His refusal to perform the "sanctioned role" is a pivot, but without immediate resistance or risk, the stakes remain low and the triumph feels inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.6)
    The stakes are effectively raised by the stranger’s visceral suffering ("teeth buzzing"), moving the conflict from a transaction to an internal burden. The resolution is swift, fitting the fable mode, though a slightly more protracted struggle during the painting phase could have deepened the earned release.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    The conflict is primarily internal and philosophical—rigid metrics vs. fluid connection—but is dramatized effectively through the bell ringing and the interaction with the visitor. The stakes are felt, though the external pressure is low; the escalation relies on the shift in Elya's intent.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.4)
    While the internal stakes of grief are clear, the conflict lacks a distinct pressure-cooker moment where Ela must choose between holding on or letting go; the process is meditative rather than urgent. The escalation is textural, building through the accumulation of birds, but the release of tension comes from an external event (the meteors) rather than a breaking point in the protagonist’s will. The cost of her transformation is described but not keenly felt in a decisive beat.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes are primarily conceptual—defining a new mode of living post-collapse—which fits the quiet tone. The escalation is gentle, deepening intimacy rather than ratcheting external pressure, though the cost of abandoning "vertical" hope is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.0)
    The stakes are established early (world cracking) and escalated efficiently through the sequence of opening doors. Each step Hiran takes against the Council's "randomness" doctrine ratchets up the tension. The climax offers a meaningful deepening of the conflict—moving from avoiding patterns to embodying them—with a visible, permanent cost.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stakes are clear—the erasure of a potential future—and the cost of the resolution is viscerally felt in the "scorching" ache Lio accepts. Yet, the conflict remains largely atmospheric; the "unbound shadow" is a passive anomaly rather than an active antagonist, and the lack of obstacles during the investigation phase reduces the pressure on Lio’s agency.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.2)
    The stakes are clear and the cost—giving up the last remnant of her "saved" life—is felt on the page. The quiet pressure of the interaction forces a genuine choice, though the external conflict with Mara remains relatively low-stakes compared to the internal turmoil.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are primarily philosophical; there is low immediate danger, as the protagonist accepts the hallucinations relatively quickly. The pressure comes from the plants challenging her worldview, leading to a deepening of perception rather than a high-cost external choice. The shift from resisting the voices to reading the coffee ring provides the necessary narrative movement.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.9)
    The stakes are clear and emotional, centered on the ache of unresolved love. While the internal pressure is palpable, the external conflict is minimal; the protagonist receives answers readily, making the "cost" of the realization feel intellectual rather than viscerally paid in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.3)
    The stakes—mental relief and creative liberation—are legible, and the pressure escalates appropriately through the mechanism of the falling stars. The resolution, while thematically fitting, feels somewhat low-cost; the "surrender" resolves the tension a bit too neatly into immediate peace.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure is coherent and internal, pitting the narrator’s need for meaning against the entropy of the "unborn journeys." The escalation is quiet but effective, moving from passive observation to the active, ritualistic "cultivating of sparks." While lacking a sharp external reversal, the emotional stakes deepen consistently, leading to a felt cost of isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.3)
    Pressure is low throughout; the forest "accepts" the protagonist, removing potential obstacles. The climax (inserting the gear) lacks a sense of risk or alternative options; the "probable weight" is stated but not felt as a high-stakes trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.8)
    The conflict is largely internal and retrospective; the external scene offers little friction as the guides immediately grant her request. The "cost" of the crossing involves facing memories she already possesses, making the escalation feel gentle rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are established early and escalate cleanly; the tension between "unpardonable silence" and the "storms" creates a coherent pressure cooker. The climax forces a binary choice with irreversible consequences, satisfying the demand for a meaningful tightening of options.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.0)
    The primary conflict is abstract (titan vs. distant pretender) and lacks immediate, on-page opposition within the library itself. The titan operates with "slow urgency" but faces no direct threat, resource scarcity, or active antagonist in the scene, which lowers the narrative pressure. The arrival of the scholar resolves the tension without a prior escalation of risk to the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes escalate effectively from data anomalies to a physical test of reality. The conflict between the station's rigid scientific models and the ocean's fluid "truth" is well-dramatized. The climax feels earned, with the protagonist's agency driving the breakthrough via the tapping method.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.1)
    The central conflict—the lull vs. the need for coherence—is clear, but the pressure remains largely atmospheric and internal until the very end. The external stakes (curfew, vanished leaders) are reported rather than felt in the scene, which lowers the immediate tension. The tightening mechanism is reflective, lacking a sharp "or else" moment before the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are clearly defined early and escalate effectively with the Council's arrival, transforming a private ritual into a political defiance. The pressure is coherent, forcing a crystallization of stance where the protagonists choose uncertainty over safe control.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—Mariam’s psychological stability—is tested by the gull’s dive, a credible and effective escalation in a quiet story. The pressure is coherent, moving from ambient dread to acute panic and back to a hard-won equilibrium. The cost is visible in the physical seizing of her shoulder and the reduction of the bride in the photo to a blur.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure accumulates well under a Textural lens, escalating from internal psychological weight to external tremors and shifting walls. The stakes of sanity and identity are clear, leading to a meaningful trade-off at the closure where unity is sacrificed for a "shining" fragmentation.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure is coherent and internal; the conflict between the elders’ religious interpretation and Iren’s analytical fury drives the scene. While the external threat is retrospective, the immediate intellectual stakes are high and escalate cleanly to the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are clear and high (treason vs. erasure). The pressure escalates effectively with the wrist interface's polite chiming, forcing a timely decision. The cost is palpable—Ana permanently sheds her safety to become a "conspirator," a price well-defined in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=4.8)
    The conflict lacks genuine resistance; antagonists capitulate immediately to the protagonist's presence without forcing a trade-off or tactical shift. The escalation from hunters to raiders is nominal, as both groups are resolved by the same "magic" atmosphere rather than a high-stakes test of Mara's values.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    Pressure escalates effectively from the navigational hazards of the "zigzag" to the physical toll of the "un-spoken breath" and the burning rail spike. The stakes are clearly defined as a hunger for knowledge, and the cost of the final renunciation—accepting the "not-knowing"—is felt on the page as a heavy, necessary burden.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are clearly defined as a clash between family legacy and public truth. The escalation is handled well through the revelation of the Array's scope ("campaigns, police, investors"), raising the pressure until the final choice becomes inevitable. The cost—destroying her own inheritance to free the city—is felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.0)
    Pressure escalates logically from the environmental shift to the personal confrontation with the "baby" voice. The stakes transition smoothly from professional duty to deep personal loss, culminating in a necessary sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.2)
    The pressure of the "emergent hush" creates a clear, escalating cost for Lark's intervention, making the act of speaking a significant risk. While the boy's confession ("Losing my brother") is slightly generic, the structural conflict between the ritual's demand for erasure and Lark's compulsion to record is handled with precision. The climax feels earned and consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.4)
    External opposition is passive; the "people distrusted her" element is expository and does not manifest as an active obstacle in the scene. The stakes are high (healing the city), but the protagonist achieves her goal with relatively low friction, lacking a moment where failure seems possible or a tangible price is paid.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.4)
    The looming threat of the theater becoming a "themed bar" provides a sharp, modern pressure that contrasts effectively with the timeless magic of the orchard. This external ticking clock forces the internal reconfiguration of the characters. While the conflict is relatively quiet, the stakes—the erasure of stories—are felt keenly through the sensory descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (sleep/sanity) is clear, but the escalation is mild; the protagonist solves the problem through competence without encountering a failure or paying a price. The conflict resolves too smoothly to generate high tension.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes shift clearly from historical preservation to active communication, providing a distinct escalation. The pressure is largely atmospheric; while the "unknown drawing nearer" raises tension, the brevity limits the accumulation of dread or difficulty before the final decision.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are conceptually high (order vs. possibility) but lack immediate visceral pressure; the absence of an active antagonist or tight time constraint lowers the tension. The narrative relies on the internal weight of the decision rather than external obstacles, as the guards "trusted the cliffs," removing the threat of discovery. The climax is a choice, but the cost feels abstract rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story relies on internal and investigative tension rather than active external opposition. While the "compromised" nature of the bluff is established, the lack of an antagonist or acute time pressure keeps the stakes relatively quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.9)
    The stakes are clear (a soul's peaceful transition), but the conflict remains largely internal and low-risk. The "tightening" comes from the mother's specific plea, yet the coachman’s competence resolves it with a practiced ease that minimizes the sense of struggle or cost. The tension is atmospheric rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.2)
    The conflict is low-stakes and contemplative; the protagonist faces an intellectual puzzle rather than immediate danger or high-cost trade-offs. The resolution feels inevitable rather than earned through difficult choices, as the "cruel" timeline serves as a lesson rather than a genuine temptation.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.5)
    The stakes are intimate but legible: the choice between the safety of hiding and the vulnerability of signaling. The escalation is quiet, driven by the "invitation" of the light, leading to a concrete physical risk.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes remain abstract and intellectual; the central conflict is a question (&quot;is solitude a sentence?&quot;) resolved immediately by an external voice. There is no visible cost or sacrifice required to achieve the revelation, making the escalation feel flat and the victory unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes are clearly deepened by the intersection of the public commission and the narrator's private need to understand connection. The architect’s correction ("Not love... or not only love") provides a meaningful tightening of focus, forcing the narrator to confront their own definitions and leading to a decisive, high-cost resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.8)
    The conflict is well-braided, balancing the immediate campus politics with the ethereal threat of the Void. The escalation is palpable as the debate upstairs physically intrudes (dust) on Mara’s domain, though the cost of her interference is more potential than immediately paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are clear and pressure escalates from the canyon approach to the internal chamber. However, the protagonist's reliance on the grandmother's tool reduces the need for improvisation, making the resolution of the maze feel slightly mechanical rather than a desperate struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.4)
    The conflict is primarily internal and atmospheric—Jonas against the silence/emptiness. The tension escalates effectively through the painting process and the thickening mist. While the stakes are clear (justice/safety), the confrontation remains impending rather than fully engaged, fitting the "poise" ending.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.5)
    The stakes of erasure versus remembrance are clearly established and escalate logically through the decoding process. The confrontation with the director serves as a necessary pressure test, crystallizing the reality of their imprisonment. The ending choice to "map what is taken" forecloses the option of passive safety, carrying a clear risk/cost.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are high (life vs. death), but the escalation is largely performative ("bow hair fraying") and solved by magical exertion. The opposition is abstract, and the victory feels inevitable rather than earned through a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.3)
    Internal pressure is coherent, deepening from financial loss to existential crisis. While the stakes are high, the conflict remains largely retrospective; the tension comes from interpreting the past rather than navigating a present-tense obstacle, which fits the reflective mode but limits immediate urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=4.6)
    On-page conflict is minimal; the protagonist encounters no active opposition or obstacles within the scene, and the collaboration with Aria is smooth and immediate. The "funding" stake mentioned in the exposition never exerts pressure on the actual moment, and the resolution arrives through data correlation rather than a tightening of options or a high-stakes dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation is handled well through the "expanding circles" technique, raising tension as the awareness goes deeper. The climax feels earned, though the mechanics of the seed's specific hunger rely on a rapid epiphany beat.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes escalate clearly from a request for proof to a world-altering dilemma involving the "intersection of dreams." The final beat successfully crystallizes the conflict into an unresolvable paradox rather than a tidy solution.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are clear and escalate through the ritual's physical manifestations (bleeding card, shivering roots). The cost is legible on the page—Lio's vitality is exchanged for the narrator's psychological shift.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.4)
    Internal pressure builds effectively through the contrast between the auction house's demands for fame and Eli's private knowledge. The stakes are personal and professional, leading to a quiet but meaningful tightening where he chooses integrity over the auctioneer's requirements. The cost is the potential commission or professional redemption, traded for personal truth.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.2)
    Pressure escalates coherently from the physical threat of the arbor to the internal temptation of fame, forcing a stance crystallization. The cost is legible: Mara sacrifices the unique "knowledge fruit seed" and rejects the safety of retreat to pursue a dangerous, uncertain relationship with the phenomenon.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.4)
    Escalation is effective, driven by the fisherman's return and his deteriorating state. While the resolution is largely internal to the librarian's machinery, the stakes for the fisherman (dissolution) are felt and urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.4)
    The stakes are primarily internal but felt; the pressure builds through Rafi's explanation of the pearl's mechanism, forcing Mara to confront her own "sealed corridors." The cost is emotional—the admission that her life's work has been "certifying tombs"—which is sufficient for this scope.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—the narrator's ability to live with their own exploitation of tragedy—is signaled early and escalated by the physical interaction with the accordion. The "meaningful tightening" occurs when he plays the instrument, breaking his role as a silent observer. The cost is felt in the surrender of his professional detachment.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clearly defined (professional safety vs. the truth of the library) and escalate effectively as the protagonist's standard tools (speech, mapping) fail against the environment. The pressure is coherent, forcing a decisive internal turn that reweights the initial goal of documentation. The cost—abandoning the certainty of the &quot;map&quot;—is felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are clearly articulated (truth vs. imperial grant) and escalate effectively through the plant's warning and Aurelio's pressure. The protagonist’s agency drives the deepening—choosing to write "detailed doubts" rather than merely walking away—crystallizing a stance with visible conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from professional duty to high-stakes personal risk, driven by the tangible degradation of the tool ("hairline-cracked from use"). The tension is palpable, and while the resolution is affirmative, the felt cost of the chip's fragility and the emotional exposure charges the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stakes are internal and clearly defined, but the conflict lacks visceral pressure; the protagonist is guided gently by the mentor figure rather than forced to make difficult tradeoffs. The resolution comes through a granted vision rather than a hard-won active conquest or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.2)
    The conflict between Mara's desire for a binary verdict (right/wrong) and the narrator's insistence on ambiguity is clear and escalates well. The resolution—Mara accepting "unfinished sorrow"—feels earned, though the "nuance" arriving as a distinct presence is slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes are clearly established as existential identity versus erasure. The escalation is psychological and atmospheric, deepening logically through the water basin exercise. The "withholding" serves as a distinct turning point that redefines the conflict from learning a skill to surviving it.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.3)
    The stakes are internalized but palpable; the tension between the wandering "stray pulse" and the need for bearings drives the escalation. The cost is paid in "stillness," a renunciation of physical agency that feels earned and significant within the story’s mythic logic.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.8)
    The conflict between human inefficiency (the keystone, Orren) and automated perfection is tightly braided and escalates clearly. The moment of unstrapping the harness is a potent turning point that raises the stakes from professional dissatisfaction to mortal danger. The pressure is coherent and leads to a meaningful renunciation of the "safe radius."

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are clear but the escalation is low-pressure; the protagonist faces little resistance until the final choice, which is resolved quickly. The cost—abandoning his safety mechanism of "truth"—is legible but intellectual rather than viscerally felt in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are clearly defined: the potential quality of the next universe hangs on the protagonist's willingness to abandon their crutch. The pressure escalates from the ambiguous spiral pattern to the inverted command, forcing a trade-off between safety (randomness) and responsibility. The "amputation" of the role provides a tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=5.4)
    Present-tense conflict is negligible; the fears are cooperative ("willing to step forward") and the ritual proceeds without error. The stakes are emotional and retrospective rather than active; the "cost" was paid years ago, leaving the current scene without urgent pressure or risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are successfully elevated from a personal test of competence to a cosmic necessity, resolved through a unique exercise of agency. The tension is quiet but distinct, anchored by the physical presence of the broken bell.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from a private struggle with grief to a public choice about preservation versus erasure. The arrival of the neighbors at the climax provides necessary external pressure, forcing Tomas to crystallize his stance immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes are clear and the pressure creates a functional ticking clock ("last night"). The conflict escalates nicely when the starlings refuse to conform to the calculations, forcing Elian to abandon his safety net. The cost is conceptual—the surrender of "manageable certainty"—and is felt in the moment of the decision.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are clearly escalated from a technical glitch to a city-threatening betrayal, creating coherent pressure. The physical manifestation of hesitation—the buckle acting as a pendulum—effectively dramatizes the internal struggle before the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes are existential and clearly defined: custody of the self versus total erasure. The escalation moves cleanly from legal argument to physical/psychic combat, deepening the conflict by making the "winning move" morally abhorrent. The cost of the final decision is palpable—potentially losing the trial to save a painful memory.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.5)
    The stakes are clearly defined as a conflict between commercial safety and dangerous curiosity. The escalation is handled well through the seed's introduction, which forces Elias to commit to his "stricter motive." The cost—the potential ruin of his shop's mass appeal—is acknowledged and accepted, giving weight to his final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are clearly defined as the emotional stagnation of the household versus the release of laughter. The escalation is well-paced, building from the mechanical roar to the fragile, pivotal moment of the parents' reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are existential and clearly escalated through the guardian's challenge and the vision in the pendant. The resolution, relying on a paradoxical reframing, feels earned and carries the weight of a genuine trade-off (certainty for possibility).

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.6)
    The stakes are high on a conceptual level (destiny vs. choice), but the immediate scene lacks active opposition, as the wardens remain passive. The escalation relies heavily on the ritual process itself rather than a tightening vice of external pressure, reducing the felt cost of the victory.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are clearly established: the physical threat to the valley versus the city's existential desire to fall. The tension is palpable in the choice between immediate catastrophe and the difficult labor of "redirecting the signal." The resolution is an earned compromise, satisfying the drive lens with a tangible reconfiguration of the future.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are high in concept (reality shifting), but the conflict remains largely internal and atmospheric. Active opposition is minimal—the captain and fog are passive obstacles—resulting in an escalation that feels smooth rather than pressured by difficult, necessary choices or interpersonal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake (remembering without new pain) is signaled early and tested through the physical act of weaving. Escalation is coherent; the room's transformation raises the emotional stakes until the final "doorway" offers a decisive test. The resolution offers a nuanced reconfiguration of the initial desire, trading the wish for painlessness for a sustainable tension.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.7)
    The conflict is intellectual and internal, centering on the struggle to adapt old instincts to a new, terrifying geometry. While the stakes are relatively quiet, the escalation through Mirror’s lesson is coherent and forces a genuine change in perspective. The tension between the "humming lamps" and the "old stars" effectively drives the narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.6)
    The conflict is coherent but low-pressure; the antagonist is essentially entropy and silence rather than an active force. While the emotional stakes escalate nicely (from a blip to a profound message of forgiveness), the lack of significant external obstacles or a higher personal cost for Eren keeps the tension in the middle bands.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.0)
    The ticking clock of the tidal window provides effective, coherent pressure that forces the final decision. While the external stakes (drowning) are visceral, the internal stakes (the connection to the unremembered) could have been tested more severely to make the final exit feel like a more painful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clearly established via the "last sanctioned night" time pressure and the protagonist's fragile sanity. The escalation from meticulous failure to chaotic, intuitive recoding is well-paced. The tension holds until the final release, where the cost of the transformation (Lian is not the same) is accepted.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.7)
    Pressure builds coherently from the passive observation of the stone to the active, dangerous braiding of voices. The conflict is internal and environmental, escalating to a clear decision point where the protagonist chooses engagement over safety. The cost is conceptual—the loss of distinct selfhood in favor of the work—which is legible and fitting for the fable-like tone.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clear and escalate from professional curiosity to existential dread. The tension between the "grid" and the "harmony" tightens in the phone sequence, forcing the narrator to abandon their original goal. The cost is the failure of the scientific method, which is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are legible and escalate clearly from a quiet concert to catastrophic urban dismantling. The opposition (machinists) is somewhat passive, reacting with confusion rather than counter-measures, which lowers the immediate pressure of the conflict until the final break.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.0)
    Tension is maintained through the fragility of the ceasefire and the volatile nature of the package. The stakes are raised by the specific properties of the storm-bottle, turning a routine delivery into a moral choice about healing versus safety. The deepening at the end reweights the initial premise effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.7)
    Tension is dampened by the immediate efficacy of the magic; the "fear" mentioned is dispelled in a single sentence ("Before fear could return, he began to sing") rather than acting as a genuine obstacle. The conflict lacks escalation, as the solution (singing) works perfectly on the first attempt without complication or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.4)
    Conflict is the primary weakness; the stakes are abstract and the pressure is low, lacking external obstacles or urgent risks. While the focus narrows effectively to the specific poet, the "tightening" feels gentle and atmospheric rather than driving a hard, costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are high (existential erasure), but the conflict remains abstractly man-vs-entropy, lacking interpersonal friction or sharp tactical shifts. The climax resolves the tension successfully, but the established cost of "hollowness" is stated in earlier beats rather than viscerally exacted in the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure accumulates steadily through the interaction, shifting from the external riddle of the Locksmith to the internal confrontation with the mother's legacy. The stakes are clear and felt—the cost of remaining safe versus the risk of becoming.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are clear and high, escalating from professional curiosity to existential restoration. The cost is dramatized effectively through the "thinning" of facts and phone numbers, ensuring the resolution feels earned rather than convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are established immediately and escalated through the dialogue, shifting from the physical fate of Jun to the metaphysical purpose of their suffering. The conflict tightens meaningfully when Jun challenges the ethics of the "reversible" exile, forcing Rhea to articulate the grim utility of her mercy. The cost is felt and the resolution is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.0)
    Conflict is largely internal and abstract (despair vs. hope) with minimal external pressure; Lior is immediately helpful, and the seed works without resistance. The stakes are declared but the on-page cost is low—mostly "trembling hands"—resulting in a resolution that feels like a gift rather than an earned victory.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.6)
    The stakes are clear but relatively low-pressure; the threat that the final knot could "unmake the quiet" is stated but not visceral. The escalation proceeds steadily knot-by-knot, but the resolution comes with minimal resistance or cost beyond a brief hesitation. The antagonist force (the restless spirits) submits quite easily to the protagonist's competence.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.6)
    The stakes are subtle and internal, centering on the ethical interpretation of the site rather than physical danger, which fits the reflective mode. Escalation occurs through the deepening intimacy with the archival footage and the revelation of the damage in the second reel. The tension holds well, shifting from curiosity to a moral burden regarding the "silence."

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are clearly delineated between scientific preservation and the emotional integrity of the experiment. The climax forces a choice, though the specific mechanics of the "compromise" remain slightly abstract, relying on the reader to infer the balance struck.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are clear but relatively low-risk; the pressure is atmospheric (the storm) and emotional rather than an active threat. The escalation is linear and logical, but the conflict resolves somewhat smoothly without a sharp, painful trade-off or obstacle beyond Lio's initial hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake is clear and the internal pressure is palpable, but the external obstacles are overcome somewhat linearly without a sharp reversal or complication. The absence of an active antagonist or a visceral near-fail moment keeps the tension strictly atmospheric rather than thriller-tight.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes are primarily intellectual and thematic; while the wind provides some physical pressure, the protagonist’s safety feels guaranteed by the narrative’s contemplative tone. The escalation is subtle—a shift in data and wind—lacking a sharp, visceral tightening of options.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake (preservation vs. limits) is signaled early and escalated effectively by the demolition sirens. The pressure is coherent, forcing a narrowing of focus from the ceiling to the book, and finally to a single stripe of color. The resolution is earned through the physical act of painting against a hard limit.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are clearly defined (safety vs. discovery), and the risk is palpable in the final scene. However, Orvan's skepticism dissolves somewhat too easily ("He laughed... Very well"), reducing the interpersonal friction and tension in the pivotal confrontation beat.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is negligible; the protagonist faces no active opposition, and the "test" of the scraps is passed by simply reading them. The climax resolves on the first attempt without complication or sacrifice, and the stated costs ("fingers chapped," "eyes stinging") are atmospheric rather than consequential. The stakes remain theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clearly established (survival of the community) and escalate effectively as the environment disintegrates. While the survivors accept the ghost’s leadership with relatively low friction, the environmental pressure and the tangible costs (loss of home, the cracked bell) maintain high tension.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.5)
    While the stakes are high, the conflict within the clock mechanism feels low-resistance; the protagonist "moves from chamber to chamber" adjusting outcomes without significant pushback or risk of failure. The defiance is symbolic and philosophical, lacking a visceral "tightening" moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are clearly defined and escalate from the immediate safety of a traveler to the existential nature of the curse itself. The shift from the birds as mere counters to messengers updating the blueprint effectively deepens the pressure. The final choice carries the visible cost of potentially ending the orchard's existence.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.0)
    The central conflict—atoning for the brother's death via scientific breakthrough—is high-stakes in concept but low-pressure in execution due to the summary mode. The pivotal moment of success ("passed the violent stress tests") occurs off-stage in a time-jump, robbing the narrative of its most critical escalation. Pressure is explained to the reader rather than exerted on the character in real-time.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.1)
    The conflict is primarily internal and conceptual—the struggle to define the self against the weight of the past. While the tension escalates nicely with the customer's arrival and the unexpected reaction of the moonlight, the stakes remain somewhat abstract. The "sting" of the light adds a necessary physical cost, anchoring the intellectual breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.3)
    Conflict is largely internal and environmental, centered on the burden of the garrison's trauma. The encounter with the overwhelming massacre memory provides a necessary spike in pressure that sharpens the stakes of the cooking ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is minimal; the elevator requests help and the community provides it without significant opposition or tradeoff. The absence of an antagonist, resource scarcity, or genuine risk of failure keeps the stakes abstract and the victory feeling inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.9)
    Pressure accumulates coherently from the physical trembling of the toolkit to the psychic resistance of the "entangled" dreams. The escalation forces a clear stance shift—surrendering to complexity—that carries visible emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.2)
    Pressure escalates via the environment (mist, chains), but the protagonist overcomes the central obstacle (the chains) passively through a scan of his nature rather than an active trade-off. The lack of a difficult decision or felt cost in the moment flattens the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=3.8)
    The story lacks meaningful conflict; nature, the materials, and the secondary character all cooperate fully with the protagonist's intent. There are no obstacles, miscalculations, or sacrifices required to achieve the goal, resulting in a narrative with negligible pressure. The stakes remain abstract and are never threatened by a credible possibility of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.7)
    Pressure is sustained by the "next phase of the moon" deadline and the weight of "debts would calcify," creating a tangible ticking clock. The stakes escalate effectively from personal exoneration to the metaphysical preservation of a kingdom's peace, grounding the abstract magic in urgent, felt consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clearly defined and felt; the tension between the safety of silence and the necessary pain of the diary drives the scene. The external pressure of the festival effectively forces the internal decision. The cost—surrendering his protective silence to the "glare" and the grief—is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.2)
    The stakes (survival of the village) are high, but the interpersonal conflict is resolved too easily; the elder's resistance melts away after a single speech. The "cost" of the decision—the stench—is promised rather than felt on the page, making the victory feel slightly unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.0)
    While the atmospheric tension is high, the narrative lacks a moment of acute risk where Lio must sacrifice something or face a genuine dilemma to proceed. The stakes remain abstract—satisfying curiosity—without a visceral price paid on the page, leaving the victory feeling safe and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.7)
    Pressure builds effectively from the initial stillness to the failure of the digital model, forcing the protagonist into a more dangerous physical investigation of the wind shear. While the stakes are largely retrospective regarding the crash, the immediate intellectual pressure and the thematic cost—foresight requiring a confrontation with "living" chaos—are felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.9)
    Tension is linear, built solely on anticipation of the synchronized moment. While the pressure escalates appropriately through the aurora and the insects, the lack of active opposition or a moment of genuine doubt/failure limits the dramatic stakes to a question of timing rather than a test of character.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.2)
    Internal pressure is sustained well, with the silence of the canyon amplifying the stakes of the ritual. While the external conflict is in the past, the present-tense struggle with the relic provides sufficient meaningful tightening to carry the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.8)
    The stakes are clearly defined: the need to understand emotion versus the safety of "rigid arithmetic." The pressure escalates from the environmental (vanishing stars) to the personal (Mara’s challenge), leading to a choice that carries genuine weight. The cost is internal but significant—the fracturing of the protagonist's protective worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.8)
    The internal conflict is palpable, and the stakes of memory vs. routine are clear. However, the external pressure is mild; the "storm" and "cold" are atmospheric rather than active obstacles forcing the choice. The escalation relies entirely on the internal reaction to the pendant.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.4)
    The inciting "hush" creates atmospheric pressure, but the external conflict—the town's skepticism—dissolves without a struggle. The narrator moves from the quarry to the proof without facing a moment of doubt or significant resistance, which keeps the stakes primarily theoretical rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.2)
    Escalation is masterful; the cost of the tapestry—ten years of youth—is palpable and forecloses the past to open the future. The sacrifice is a definitive high-stakes trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.3)
    The atmospheric pressure is strong, establishing the stakes of a breaking world. However, the climactic confrontation is resolved somewhat easily through the protagonist's competence, lacking a moment of severe doubt or escalated external resistance to heighten the victory.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake (autonomy vs. repetition) is clear, and the climax forces a trade-off with felt cost (losing the other selves). While the escalation is compressed, the final choice to "cut loose" effectively reweights the character's existence with a visible conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    The stakes are intimate but potent, pivoting on the question of who guards the dark when the official systems fail. The tension between the "haunted" rumors and the human reality of the letters creates a coherent pressure. The escalation is quiet but steady, leading to a meaningful tightening of Elias's duty.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.5)
    The stakes of obsolescence versus renewal are clearly drawn and escalate as the hum reorganizes the light's reflections. While external opposition is absent, the internal pressure of the "old oaths" forces a meaningful choice to abandon the sea lanes. The cost is the surrender of a comfortable, nostalgic routine for an unknown future.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding the heart's new capacity—is reweighted at the end through a valid Accumulative structure. The pressure is internal and quiet ("explosive pressure swelled"), which fits the lyric mode. While there is no external antagonist, the conceptual cost of the realization (he is a mirror, not a magnet) is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes are purely conceptual (curiosity), and the protagonist encounters no significant opposition or risk of failure. While the Accumulative lens builds density, the lack of a "tightening" moment or visible price paid for the discovery limits narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.9)
    The story lacks active opposition or a "meaningful tightening" where the protagonist must choose between exclusive options. The stakes are high in theory (saving a realm) but low in practice, as Mara faces no obstacles, antagonists, or internal doubts that might prevent her success; she simply executes her plan.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.9)
    Pressure is low; the confrontation with Mara is gentle and didactic rather than high-stakes. The resolution—finding out his brother wasn't angry—removes the weight of the conflict immediately; the "cost" is framed as a release, lacking the bite of a true trade-off or sacrifice essential for high drama.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stakes are intimate and psychological, centering on the burden of memory and the guilt of passivity. While the external conflict is low-voltage, the pressure from the Tea Mistress's probing questions effectively forces Elias to confront his inaction. The escalation is quiet but legible, leading to a meaningful internal crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are immediate and high, visualized effectively through the decaying figures. The escalation is linear but tense. The established cost of touching the artifact—"forfeiting the right to forget"—adds gravity, though the emotional burden of this price at the ending feels slightly more intellectual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake (truth vs. illusion) is signaled early and tightened through the transaction mechanism. The cost is paid on the page—both the "honest" weight of the coin and the immediate, cutting pain of the memory ("clean, like river water"). The escalation relies on a quiet deepening rather than external action, which fits the 600-word scope perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.0)
    Pressure is low; the stakes are abstract ("carrying weather") and the narrator faces no external opposition or time crunch despite the election context. The "conflict" is purely internal and resolves smoothly, lacking a moment of genuine jeopardy or difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.8)
    The internal conflict—suppression versus compulsion—is well-established and escalates through the act of drawing. The stakes are personal and felt, though the resolution feels slightly intellectualized in the final realization rather than purely visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes are clear conceptually, but external pressure is low; the storm and the city's condition do not actively oppose Lio's progress. The climax opens easily with the found plate, missing an opportunity for a final tightening of tension or a harder trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure arises coherently from the intersecting constraints of the melting shard and Lio’s fading voice, creating urgency without external antagonists. While the obstacle is primarily atmospheric/biological rather than interpersonal, the trade-off—his voice for the tower’s song—provides a felt, if gentle, cost.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are clearly established as a conflict between internal functionality and external duty, escalating logically with the geomagnetic tremors. The cost is legible and paid on the page—the "blackened" roses and the "weakest limbs" sacrificed—marking a permanent change in the garden's state.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.4)
    While the stakes of gentrification are clearly established, the conflict dissolves rather than escalating to a difficult choice. The antagonist force (developers) evaporates instantly upon the discovery of the deed, rendering the victory too smooth and lacking in genuine narrative tension or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure escalates coherently through environmental instability ("structure settled another patient inch") and the deepening understanding of Ara’s fate. The stakes shift meaningfully from a retrieval mission to an ideological reclamation, contrasting weaponization with empathy. While the antagonist (the "handlers") remains abstract, the immediate physical and emotional pressure fills that gap effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure escalates coherently from the initial omen of failing lights to the disturbing erasure of time and memory. The stakes are existential but grounded in the immediate community, and the protagonist's choice to confront the anomaly leads to a deepening of understanding rather than a simple fix. The cost is palpable in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes are high (collapse of kingdoms) but remain abstract and distant. The conflict is one-sided; the prophecy is a passive target that is erased without actively resisting or complicating Ilen's ritual, resulting in low immediate tension.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.2)
    The stakes shift elegantly from the immediate (stealing sugar) to the conceptual (understanding the dangerous truth of the building). While the external conflict is low-key, the deepening pressure to "translate" creates sufficient narrative drive. The final cost—accepting the fragility of one's shelter—is a subtle but effectively felt price paid for the knowledge gained.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes of emotional integrity versus numbness are clear and present throughout the narrative. However, the escalation is undercut by the Caretaker explicitly articulating the resolution logic ("translate isolation into independence"), robbing the protagonist of the struggle to discover this reframe herself.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.1)
    The stakes are high (treason, death vs. conscience), and the arrival of Master Sevran effectively escalates the pressure. However, Sevran's relatively quick acceptance of the forgery deflates the external tension somewhat, shifting the weight entirely to the internal struggle. The final choice carries a felt cost of losing anonymity.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.1)
    Pressure escalates linearly through the ritual—silence, mockery, then the "almost" voice. The stakes are clear, but the external resistance is mild; the canyon yields its secret simply because Liora asks in the silence, lacking a moment of severe doubt or high cost before the breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.7)
    The stakes are high for the client (family betrayal vs. justice), and the pressure escalates coherently through the dream analysis. While the cost is clear, the protagonist functions largely as a guide who faces little direct resistance, which slightly softens the central conflict. The resolution relies on the woman's acceptance, which is earned but happens relatively quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are clearly established as internal professional pride, anchored by the brother's insults. The "fifteen nets worth of labor" for four nets creates a concrete, felt cost for the protagonist's integrity, though the external pressure remains low.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from a bureaucratic safety check to the acquisition of a world-altering technology. The pressure of the environment and the implied threat of the Committee tighten around Theo, forcing a stance crystallization that feels earned and significant.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.8)
    The conflict is primarily situational—man vs. calling—and the escalation comes through the voice's demands rather than external plot complications. While the stakes are high (shaping history vs. madness), the protagonist's relatively quick capitulation reduces the tension of the central choice. However, the cost is legible: a surrender of safety for purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stakes are intimate but felt; the cost of "spending" his hoarded sounds to heal the woman's memory is visible and significant. The conflict transitions smoothly from internal hesitation to an external exchange, though the antagonist force (the woman's grief) yields relatively quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.8)
    Tension escalates clearly from the "wrong sound" to the realization that the binding note has drifted. The stakes are effectively raised by the sunset constraint. The resolution relies on a competence-based shift (humming higher) which, while satisfying, lacks a visceral on-page price beyond physical exertion.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes remain largely philosophical ("impatience") and the external threat (burning cities) feels disconnected from the sanctuary's quiet. There is little escalation of pressure; the protagonist endures a waiting period, but the final change comes as a relief rather than a hard-won trade-off. The cost of "giving up haste" is thematic rather than a visceral sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.2)
    The stakes are sharply defined—integrity versus job security—and escalate clearly from internal doubt to an unavoidable confrontation with the victims. The cost is made explicit in the final decision to endanger the budget and job stability, satisfying the requirement for a felt price attached to the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are clear and intimate, escalating from a physical repair to a profound moral test regarding a man's future. The pressure curve is subtle but steady, driven by the dialogue and the diagnosis of the clockwork heart.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clear and high (waking the future), and the psychological pressure of the Algorithm's manipulation adds a secondary layer of conflict. The physical escalation during the launch ("acid mist clawed," "drunken yanking") is solid, though the protagonist's survival feels slightly assured. The conceptual payoff justifies the build.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.2)
    The stakes are personal (the need for truth) versus professional (compliance/deletion), escalating cleanly from passive observation to active transgression (spoofing the audit). While the external antagonist (the system) is passive, the internal pressure to solve the "cold case" drives momentum effectively. The resolution satisfies the dominant stake by uncovering the truth, even if the external status quo remains unchanged.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes are established early (war vs. sanctuary) and escalate through the visions in the crystal. The pressure is coherent, leading to a decisive shift in tactics, though the antagonist force (the Keepers) remains distant.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.8)
    The stakes are ultimate—life versus death—and are dramatized effectively through the delay and the volunteering sub-plot. The external pressure of the disaster relief effort mirrors the internal wreckage, tightening the thematic screws without feeling contrived. The realization forecloses the path of euthanasia with a felt emotional cost, satisfying the closure requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.9)
    The conflict is internal and quiet, centered on the woman's regret, and escalates adequately through the shared object of the letter. While the stakes are clear, the resolution relies heavily on wisdom-dispensing dialogue rather than a high-pressure choice, keeping tension moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.7)
    High stakes (the city's survival) are established early and escalated cleanly through the merchant's interrogation, which physically threatens the protagonist. The resolution feels earned because it arises from the protagonist's specific skill set (peripheral awareness) applied to the central conflict, forcing a trade-off between blunt truth and manageable burden.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.0)
    Conflict is the weakest element; the narrative arc is a linear progression of success with minimal obstruction. Once the protagonist arrives, the "test" (the boy) is passed easily, and the subsequent "community healing" happens in summary without a tightening of stakes or a moment where failure seems possible.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes are visceral and high—the surgical removal of "grow" from language—and the courier's note provides a sharp, escalating pressure that forces Elias's hand. The conflict transitions smoothly from external threat to internal crisis, resolving in a unified stance of resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes remain largely thematic and lyrical rather than visceral; the pressure to find the sound is intellectual. While the search deepens the mystery, the obstacles are minimal, and the climax relies on a shared realization rather than a forced choice with high immediate cost.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes are clearly articulated: the loss of the data is equated to existential failure ("only another crater"). The escalation is coherent, moving from alarms to the physical wrestling with the array. The cost is felt in the dangerous bypass of safeties and the physical toll of the quake, though a more permanent, irreversible sacrifice on the page would have secured a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are clear (a good death), but the conflict is minimal; the patient and therapist are in perfect accord from the start. The absence of obstacles or complication renders the scene a ceremonial enactment rather than a dramatic event with genuine tension.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes are clearly established as epistemic (truth vs. safety) and escalate through the resistance of the key and the tension of the forbidden act. The "terrifying freedom" at the end serves as a felt cost, though a slightly more visceral external consequence could have heightened the immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clear—truth and a life versus the village's easy comfort—and the pressure escalates coherently from investigation to interdimensional intervention. The cost is felt in Mara's abandonment of her safety (skepticism) to perform a miracle she fundamentally mistrusts.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.0)
    Tension is low and primarily retrospective; the threat of raiders is a memory rather than an active, present-moment danger. The stakes are emotional—comforting the children—but the lack of an external antagonist or time pressure in the grotto scene makes the narrative feel soft. The "weighing" beat attempts to add cost but remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.4)
    Pressure is primarily retrospective (the viral confession) rather than active in the scene. The on-page interaction lacks significant obstacles or difficult trade-offs; Mara accepts the invitation to plant without a meaningful test of her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.8)
    Escalation is primarily intellectual, driven by dialogue and the visions; while the internal shift is earned, the external pressure is low, and the "cost" remains largely philosophical—an admission of error rather than a tangible price paid in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; the protagonist faces no antagonist, and the "wary" parents offer only a momentary hesitation that dissolves instantly. There is no escalation of stakes or narrowing of options; the ritual succeeds smoothly, lacking the tension of potential failure or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.7)
    Pressure is atmospheric (entropy) rather than acute, fitting the meditative tone but limiting narrative tension to a slow boil. The escalation relies on the successful execution of the craft rather than overcoming active obstacles, which works for the length but lacks a sharp, defining turn.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are established early ("city was thinning"), but the pressure remains largely atmospheric and conceptual rather than urgent or visceral. The conflict is primarily man-against-entropy, which works for the tone but lacks a sharp on-page escalation of risk until the final test.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from the routine processing of others' pain to the immediate, crushing threat of the narrator's own existential fear. The resolution relies on a previously established skill ("orienting properly"), though the "rule I had carved" feels slightly convenient as a pivot point.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.0)
    The stakes are beautifully internalized; the conflict is not just about carving wood, but about whether to preserve the dead in a static "pause" or transform memory into something living and useful. The cost—the feeling of betrayal in making him "furniture"—is articulated clearly on the page, making the final action carry significant weight.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.9)
    Pressure escalates coherently from the routine of scavenging to the high-stakes confrontation with the self-reflection. The ghost’s rejection of the trade forces a painful cost—the admission that the scavenger’s method was futile—leading to a meaningful renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story relies on atmospheric pressure rather than urgent stakes or risk; Mira faces no opposition (guards, physical danger, time limits) other than the inertia of the building. While the internal goal is clear, the lack of a "tightening" beat where she must sacrifice something or face genuine failure limits the narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.9)
    Tension is expertly managed through internal stakes; the escalation from a mechanical scrape to a traumatic memory of the father's death provides the necessary pressure to force action against the rules. While external opposition is minimized to the absent abbess, the internal cost and the weight of the "rule" sustain the conflict effectively, leading to a meaningful deepening of character.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.5)
    Tension is well-managed, escalating from the quiet menace of the men ("stillness of people who could kill") to the high-stakes salvage. The climax delivers a meaningful deepening of the conflict—not a physical fight, but a stance crystallization that forecloses the option of returning to "comfortable stories."

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=4.0)
    Stakes are declared ("preserve ancient methods") but never tested; Eli faces no antagonism, failure, or time pressure. The "secret" is revealed easily, and the protagonist encounters no resistance to his goal.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are primarily conceptual—the struggle to define an absence—but the pressure is maintained through the narrator's need to understand the commission. The "tightening" occurs as the narrator realizes they must participate ("Help me walk it") rather than just observe. While the external conflict is low-key, the internal reconfiguration is palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation is handled well, raising the stakes from a routine administrative task to a treasonous act of preservation. The opposition from the philosophers and biologist serves to sharpen the prince’s agency, forcing him to explicitly reject their utilitarian logic. The cost is clearly delineated; by choosing the egg, he forfeits his safety and his established function within the hierarchy.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are clear and escalate naturally as the fire approaches the immobilized child. The cost is paid on the page—Maris surrenders her father's coin, the only keepsake she had, to facilitate the rescue. This represents a meaningful sacrifice that deepens the "unyielding compassion" concept.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clear and thematic pressure builds effectively toward the choice in the underground chamber. While the external opposition is passive (the environment/box), the internal cost of sacrificing her "armor" of doubt creates sufficient tension for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.9)
    The stakes are effectively internalized; the pressure comes from the emergence of violent patterns in the stars that threaten the protagonist's philosophy. The climax—where the gear shivers and the protagonist must choose to intervene despite the futility—is a genuine tightening of the screw.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no significant opposition or obstacles, as the spectral mentorship provides a smooth path to the goal. The stakes are abstract ("discover the shape of collective grief") and the resolution is achieved through obedience to the ritual rather than overcoming a dramatic test or paying a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.1)
    Internal pressure is palpable, escalating from obsessive maintenance to the searing realization of failure. The stakes shift meaningfully from keeping time to keeping the community, though the external consequences (trains colliding) remain hypothetical compared to the internal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.3)
    The pressure is subtle but coherent, driven by the "murmurs" that force the narrator to confront the silo. The stakes escalate nicely from a routine shift to an existential reckoning, though the "chess clock" opening feels slightly disconnected from the specific urgency of the tapestry mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.5)
    The stakes are high and clearly defined (survival vs. prosperity), and the pressure builds effectively through the "fragile interval" constraint. While the conflict is primarily intellectual, the tangible consequences on the map (famine, abandoned villages) make the cognitive struggle feel weighty and urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.8)
    The escalation is driven effectively by the radio's warning lyric, shifting the scene from ritual to danger. While the resolution reduces the physical threat, it heightens the emotional stakes by sharing the secret with a child.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.2)
    Tension is well-maintained through the ritualistic pressure and the audience's unsettled reaction. The moment the older woman steps across the ash line serves as a crucial micro-turn, effectively testing the stakes of safety versus fragility on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=4.6)
    Conflict is abstract and rhetorical (Narrator vs. Council narratives) rather than dramatized through on-page interaction or urgent choices. There is no escalation of pressure in the present moment; the stakes are declared in monologue but never tested by a specific event.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central conflict (community division vs. harmony) is palpable, and the stakes are humanized through Dari and Ilan's specific history. The escalation relies heavily on summary ("Week after week") rather than dramatized beats, but the final confrontation pays off the tension with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clearly established: the survival of hope and beauty against the entropy of a ruined world. The escalation is consistent, moving from the potential energy of the seed to the kinetic action of pruning. While the conflict is primarily man-versus-entropy rather than interpersonal, the pressure of the "once-in-a-lifetime" alignment provides sufficient urgency to drive the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are clearly established between the peace of the blackout and the necessity of the grid. Marla’s choice carries a felt cost—sacrificing her preferred silence for the collective good—though the external pressure relies heavily on the boy's prompt rather than rising situational danger.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are psychological but rendered with physical consequence. The escalation from "testing" the house to the storm's "curtains across the sky" raises the pressure effectively. The cost—sleeping with one's head in a corner that feels "heavy" and "dense"—is palpable and eerie.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.2)
    While the stakes of historical truth are high, the narrative tension is dampened by the visitor's lack of resistance; she accepts the protagonist's worldview almost immediately, making the resolution feel cooperative rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.3)
    The stakes are primarily philosophical but are made visceral through the physical manifestation of the "missed opportunity" in the rupture. The escalation from abstract proofs to a face-to-face encounter with a parallel self effectively tightens the tension. The resolution provides a meaningful deepening of the protagonist's worldview, adhering well to the short-story scope.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=4.2)
    Narrative pressure is virtually absent. There is no antagonist, environmental resistance, or risk of failure; the magic brush works instantly on every target. Without escalation, tightening of options, or a moment where the outcome is in doubt, the story reads as a list of successful actions rather than a dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.1)
    The stakes—cultural erasure versus living memory—are clear and poignant. While the external pressure is atmospheric, the internal cost of the narrator's decision (staying in a refugee camp, abandoning their outsider safety) is felt. A slightly longer struggle might have deepened the sense of sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes are high (fate vs. free will) but remain largely cerebral until the final action. The conflict is primarily man-against-environment/puzzle; while the tension holds, the lack of immediate opposing pressure or a clearer personal price for failure keeps the escalation linear rather than dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are immediate and high, escalating from a haunting glow to a confrontation with the personified trauma of drowning. The climax involves a meaningful choice—confessing a shameful truth to the boy-fear—which carries a visible emotional cost. The pressure holds consistently throughout the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.5)
    The physical stakes are clear and escalate appropriately as the storm intensifies, threatening the community's survival. However, the resolution comes relatively cheaply; the "magic" of the mallet solves the physics problem without exacting a tangible price or forcing a painful trade-off. While the pressure is coherent, the lack of a visible, irrevocable cost keeps this from the highest bands.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes are clearly established as the survival of the city against the stasis of fear. The conflict escalates cleanly from an environmental symptom (cracking shells) to a social blockage (Council) to a high-stakes unilateral action. The cost—breaking the city's perceived safety—is palpable in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.8)
    The intellectual duel is sharp, with Mara providing a formidable counter-argument ("aspirational myth") that forces Elias to clarify his ethical stance. The stakes rise effectively from a copyright dispute to a battle over political reality.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are clearly defined as the preservation of memory against "oceanic smoothness." Escalation is driven by environmental pressure (the tide) and resource scarcity (the inkwell), forcing a race against erasure. While the conflict is quiet, the cost—the permanent sealing of her own grief—is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes are clear (truth vs. erasure), but the conflict is primarily internal and low-pressure, lacking an active antagonist or time constraint beyond the blackout's duration. The escalation is linear—suspicion leads directly to confirmation without a complicating reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    The conflict is internalized but externalized effectively through the craft of the lantern making. The "gem polishing" sequence serves as a strong escalation beat where the emotional cost ("heart feels flayed") is rendered as physical sensation, driving the narrative to its peak.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes are clearly delineated between the official mission (global stability via suppression) and the personal mission (redeeming the dead). The escalation from observing a data anomaly to recognizing a mass grave of potential provides strong, coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.0)
    Escalation is virtually absent; Mira arrives, asks, and receives the answer immediately with no obstacles or setbacks. There is no visible or felt cost paid for the revelation, resulting in a low-pressure narrative that functions more as a vignette than a dramatic story.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (truth vs. pleasant lies) is clear and escalates through the protagonist’s investigation. The pressure is primarily internal and retrospective; while effective for this tone, the lack of immediate external resistance or time pressure keeps the narrative tension largely contemplative.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.8)
    The stakes are intensely personal and escalate naturally from a professional exchange to an impossible ethical dilemma. The cost of the final choice—abandoning the brother to save the spy—is visceral and creates a lasting impact on the narrative, fulfilling the requirement for a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.8)
    The inciting text from Lena raises immediate, tangible stakes that pressure the protagonist's internal drift. Escalation is coherent; the physical exertion of paddling into the fog mirrors the emotional effort to confront regret. The cost is legible—not a fix, but an endurance of "flickering faith" and the acknowledgement that the "grid" of silence has real consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure is coherent and internal, externalized effectively through the physical descent. The tension tightens meaningfully at the welded door (obstacle) and the discovery of the ball (instruction). The stakes—sanity vs. humanity—are palpable, though the antagonism is environmental/societal rather than a direct interpersonal clash.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are visceral and escalated cleanly from the risk of failure to the certainty of self-unmaking. The climax forces a trade-off—human form for connection—that is felt rather than just stated.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.2)
    The internal pressure is palpable, but the escalation is largely observational—the cards reveal truths he accepts without active resistance or complication on the page. The resolution feels slightly unearned because the "understanding" arrives as a gift from the magic rather than a hard-won psychological victory.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.5)
    The stakes are high, but the resolution relies on the archive "offering" a final image rather than the protagonist actively seizing or creating a solution. The conflict is resolved by the external event of the star dying and the lucky arrival of the perfect photograph, which reduces protagonist agency at the critical turn.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are clearly escalated by the evacuation bells, forcing a decisive move. However, the protagonist's plan executes without on-page complication or friction; the chaotic struggle of rerouting a panicked population is elided in favor of a smooth, successful outcome, reducing the felt tension of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.2)
    The tension is situational and situational pressure is handled well, though the immediate interpersonal conflict is low since Trann is an ally. The stakes are clearly articulated, and the risk of "rewriting stories" provides sufficient weight to the final action.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clearly defined and escalate from the abstract threat of "stillness" to the immediate, physical cost of pain. The protagonist's agency drives the resolution, accepting the "tax" of suffering to restore meaning, fulfilling the high-stakes setup.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are clear and high (memory vs. erasure), and the pressure of the approaching storm/timeline works well. The conflict remains largely internal and thematic; the interaction between characters is collaborative rather than tense, reducing the potential for interpersonal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.4)
    Active conflict is low; the protagonist spends the majority of the story rehearsing and waiting. While the arrival of the clients and the "smell of storm" provide late escalation, the dominant stake is managed through preparation rather than tested by resistance on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are clearly escalated by the patrol's arrival, transforming the abstract threat of the city into a concrete danger. The resolution relies on active agency—the narrator's choice to adopt a specific persona—rather than luck, satisfying the requirement for protagonist-driven outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are clearly established and personal. The conflict escalates from Leon's entry to the confrontation, but Mara's resistance yields relatively easily to Leon's argument and the environmental signal, slightly dampening the pressure at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are existential for the community and personal for Kael, creating a tight dual pressure. The escalation is coherent, moving from physical signs to social pressure to spiritual confrontation. The cost—losing the comfort of a "sure" history to gain a messy truth—is palpable in the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.4)
    Conflict is internal and low-pressure; the protagonist follows magical prompts without facing significant obstacles or making hard trade-offs. The "cost" of the apology is described as a release of stubbornness, but because the realization is delivered by the lace rather than wrung from the character, the emotional stakes feel observed rather than undergone.

    Dominant stake—can she relinquish explosive spectacle for quiet accretion—tightens when she chooses dust traps over supernova telemetry. The moment she tells Amir “I am trying to stop mistaking fireworks for truth” narrows her professional identity with a public, felt cost. No coincidence; pressure is purely situational and stance-driven. One meaningful deepening is exactly what 700-word fiction needs; we feel the gradient descend.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—discovering why someone weaponised the kiln—survives the whole piece, tightening when ledger arrows redirect the walk. Agency is the decision to follow the charcoal trail rather than flee; cost is the reopened risk of confronting the smuggler. Escalation is textural: each new image (frost map, sun symbol, canyon echo) reweights danger rather than forcing external twists. Coincidence stays complication, not resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—make silence physically shareable—lands early and tightens through each fork experiment. Escalation is accumulative: grief map → wonder map → civic map; each increases density and narrows Lio’s path from private grief to infrastructural mission. Cost is felt on-page: his body is “wrecked and waterlogged,” first test vibrates ribs. Agency is decisive—he straps on gloves, programs profiles, plots city-wide score. Coincidence absent; pressure coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving communal survival without fracturing trust—tightens when Mara realizes exposing donors would collapse the food pipeline. One meaningful escalation: her pivot from investigative exposure to ceremonial protection; cost is her relinquished authority over full transparency. Agency remains hers; coincidence only complicates (wind masking steps). Price is legible: she must live inside the secrecy she despises.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“can unused love be released without burning?”—is signaled in paragraph four and tightened when the camera reveals lanterns caged inside ribs. One meaningful escalation: the corridor bends toward wool-darkness, forcing Arun to breathe deeper or lose the vision; his choice to exhale lantern into the boy concretely pays the burn-risk cost. No abstract antagonist needed; pressure is coherent accumulative density of withheld breaths. Price is visible—spark leaves his chest—so options reweight under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“discover the texture of time”—tightens through each sensory accumulation rather than external opposition. One meaningful deepening: photographs fade faster yet scenes grow louder, narrowing options to either retreat or dissolve. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable: loss of singular self. No causal antagonist, but coherent Accumulative pressure obviates need for one. Could use one earlier tactical loss (a dropped tool, a missed path) to sharpen stakes, but still lands above threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—save the seeds—tightens when the Overseer’s cataloguing threatens double obliteration: vault revealed, then demolished. One meaningful escalation: Mara’s cough-forced key-spill narrows her option to verbal misdirection, raising exposure risk. Cost is conceptual but felt: her body stays chained, her mind gambles on his ego. Agency is patient strategy rather than explosive heroics—fits the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—capture the sound of trust breaking—signaled in line one. Escalation via each dive’s harvested absence tightening the sonic net until the prototype releases the dual betrayal note; price is the narrator’s confrontation with his own silence. Agency is continuous (design, test, adjust) under causal lens. Cost legible: acceptance of irreversible self-betrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—will the narrator keep stealing light or face what he harvests—tightens when the stranger demands the jar be opened before the portrait. One meaningful intensification: moonbeam spill turns platform into “impossible aquarium,” forcing either complicity or refusal in front of mirrored evidence. Agency remains with protagonist; the shutter click is the decisive act that ignites the cost. Cost is legible: the jar refills with flaming faces, foreclosing the alibi of “borrowing.”

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will the room’s thaw be weaponized or hospitable—tightens when the bookmark is entombed in glass, foreclosing its archival past. Pressure accrues via melting ice and amber hardening; no reversal needed under Accumulative lens. Cost is legible: Corin’s former precision skill is repurposed, narrator’s detachment forfeited. One credible loss—abandoned certainty—alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—existential visibility—tightens when the cast list rewrites her name. The boy’s cipher provides the single deepening: each crossed-out fear (FALL, FIRE, ALONE) paired with a self-gifted answer reweights her option set. Agency is visible: she writes the final trust-couplet, then chooses to carry her shaking body into the office as ratings leverage. Cost is on-page: forfeiture of manufactured invincibility, embrace of trembling as commodity.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—how to navigate existence once celestial reference dies—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when the last star gutters. Escalation is textural: each added silence thickens the air until refusal to listen becomes impossible; the decisive deepening is the captain’s acceptance of dark grammar, cost paid by surrendering every visual certainty. No external reversals are needed; the pressure coil is the accumulating quiet itself. The price (perpetual night, voice as only compass) is legible and shapes the closing stance.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can a circuit-mind step outside its own pattern?—is signaled early and tightens through each micro-observation (frost feathers, tremble in recorded voice) that accumulates into the aerial viewpoint. Pressure is textural: every refused or harder touch tests whether pattern can be broken; the stutter-loop that fails to close is the visible price. No coincidence; escalation is driven by HEPA-3’s iterative agency. Cost is the melted instrument and the irreversible evening—felt on page.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve secrecy vs. risk connection—tightens when anonymous doodles mirror her own habits, forcing a public stance. One meaningful escalation: pocketing the tickets (preservation) flips to walking toward the hooded stranger (exposure), cost legible in the pounding heart that “seemed another instrument.” No coincidence resolves; the stranger’s return is patterned, not lucky. Pressure peaks at the fringe of the collective mind-field, options narrowing to lens-offer or perpetual erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—prove gardens can outrank algorithmic luck—tightens once: the polished marbles begin to “choose” thriving patches, foreclosing his skepticism. Escalation is textural rather than causal: visitor smiles accumulate density until the maze literally pulses back at him. Visible price is present (hands woodening, nights spent polishing), but the external world never pushes back hard—no official threatens closure, no tech tries to quantify his garden. Sufficient for 8-band, not the sharper cost required for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.2)
    Single tightening: lever adjustment stabilizes dreams. Stakes are declared—“lose the valley’s future”—but never personalize Ilen; no resource or relationship of his is risked. Pressure is external to the embryos; protagonist agency operates without visible personal cost, capping escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—decode the ghost’s musical treason—tightens as each smudged staff line forecloses standard performance; the unresolved chord pattern is the visible price. One meaningful deepening: the realization that silence itself is part of the score. No secondary reversal, but the lens-consistent accumulation suffices for 600–800 words.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will Mara reclaim or re-bury the truth—tightens once when the oracle refuses erasure; cost is the irreversible ownership of dangerous knowledge. No reversals needed under causal lens; one meaningful narrowing qualifies. Pressure coherent, no coincidence. Could use slightly more visible tactical consequence (e.g., immediate physical risk) to reach top band.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—exculpation vs. complicity—tightens once: the valve’s rosary beads force the narrator to test Evan’s conspiracy theory under live darkness. Agency resides in the narrator’s decision to catalogue names aloud, a public act that forfeits permanent distance. Cost is visible: the narrator’s religious skepticism must accommodate a ghost-shift liturgy, a stasis that can’t be undone. Escalation is accumulative: each metallic drip and phantom footfall increases density until the valve’s click becomes the decisive beat; no causal reversal, but pressure coheres under situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preserve neutrality vs. enter change—tightens once the paper path unfurls, forcing a literal step into authorship. Escalation is textural: each footprint drafting new cities increases density of responsibility; refusal would leave summoned words formless, a felt price. No reversals, but a single deepening that re-weights the stake from observer to midwife. Cost is visible—library erupts, city disrupted—but could be sharper on his body or identity.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—Mara’s need to re-home her own wonder without being consumed by grief—tightens when the sky literally darkens and the patients’ flinch/awe tests her credo. One meaningful deepening: the eclipse dusk converts the locked-drawer memory from private shard to shared cosmology, visible cost registered in her exhale and finger-grip. Agency is cumulative-textural (she stops playing, lets silence rule) rather than a plotted reversal. Loses 0.3 because Lake’s detox arc and Mr. Alvarez stroke remain secondary accents that do not feed back into Mara’s pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake: can erased human memories be re-voiced? Pressure intensifies texturally—each artifact adds spectral testimony—rather than causally narrowing options. No reversible jeopardy faces Brann; the cost is transferred to the vanished humans, felt as conceptual loss rather than personal risk. Closure qualifies as CR, not DC, satisfying the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—control of information flow—tightens with each accidental prophecy; ferry collapse and inspector’s death make cost visceral. Agency peaks when the narrator reroutes the beam at literal knife-point of consequence. No coincidence resolves; escalation is causal under lens. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, and the price (permanent complicity) is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—time before possession completes—tightens once: Jonas must argue meaning into changing direction before the knitting finishes. Agency is rhetorical: each anaphora (“You claim…you also claim…”) narrows the demon’s options until contradiction ejects it. Cost is the chapel’s listening walls contracting, a visible price that alters future rituals. No secondary escalation, but one meaningful tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—compose the unheard city symphony before exhaustion—tightens through each fortune written: every slip is a bet that the world will resonate back. Escalation is textured, not causal: density of mirrors, lines, and memories accumulates until the only option left is to conduct the silence he has shaped. Cost is legible in body (eyes closing, hand steadying shell) and in the forfeiture of being known. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversal required under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—singular self vs. infinite branching—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens exactly once: when Lio realizes witness, not erasure, is the price (“conquering… meant bearing witness”). Agency drives escalation: each re-entry into a room forecloses that timeline for others. Cost is visible—gravity returns, tablet relinquished—though the tightening beat is solitary narration rather than dramatized resistance from a branch-self, keeping it just sub-8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“defeat emotional numbness”—is signaled early and tightened when Jorin’s sob proves the first crack. Escalation is accumulative: each silent pulse through stone ups the ante until laughter-tears spill. Visible price is legible in Jorin’s wrist tremor that drum rhythm matches. No second reversal is needed under Accumulative lens; one meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single dominant stake—will he risk ministry erasure to map the new storm of surveillance?—is signaled early. Escalation is one quiet tightening: from recording dead clouds to recording live dissent; the tube’s lateral coordinates foreclose the safe option of reporting nothing. Cost is visible: he accepts perpetual exposure—“I would remain here, anchored … alone but aligned.” No second reversal, but the lens (Causal) holds and the choice narrows options legitimately.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will Elias risk smelling grief?—is signaled early and tightens once: the scent surges, he flicks on the lamp, option to retreat vanishes. Cost is legible in on-page tears and the seed cracking in Mara's charm. No reversal, but the single deepening suffices under Causal lens. Escalation is driven by his agency; coincidence complicates only.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—shrink vs. expand life’s texture—signaled early and tightened when poet reframes energy beings as witnesses. One deepening: narrator’s private triad (job, lover, scholarship) is exposed and costed. No visible price on-page; escalation is conceptual, not visceral, keeping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: can unfinished sound still matter in a city that muffles everything? Pressure tightens when Mara reframes the hush as opportunity rather than lack; the pumps’ almost-failures embody the same aesthetic. Cost is visible—coins poured out, bowl inverted—yet the external risk (hunger, exposure) stays sub-textual, so the escalation is more cadence-driven than consequence-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can Eve audit without losing herself—tightens when the dealer warns her identity may survive only as question. escalates through sensory density: each vial she passes increases the static hum until the ampoule breaks and patterns lock into place. no external antagonist needed; pressure is perceptual overload and ethical self-risk. cost is paid on-page: certainties subsumed, persona potentially forfeited—an earned stasis under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—Elias’s need to redistribute recognition—tightens when Marin’s humility threatens to eclipse the project; the micro-turn is her acquiescence to read the letter aloud. Escalation is causal: each admission (his forgotten gratitude, her anonymity) narrows the option of retreat. Visible price: Elias pledges funds and reputation. Coincidence (mis-delivered letter) complicates, not resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—capture vs. liberate the first echo—tightens when the protagonist discovers that to draw is to cage; the pendant’s overheating escalates the cost of continuing. Agency culminates in the conscious release of grip, scattering futures. One meaningful deepening: silence peeled like paint reveals unborn voices tugging memories. Cost is visible: forfeited commission, unanswered client, keeper’s feared prophecy honored.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—how to live with a hole that never finalizes—tightens when the spell fails and the orchard demands a price in futures not his to spend. One meaningful deepening: the shift from retrieval magic to pedagogic stewardship narrows his options under the Accumulative lens. Cost is visible—he pockets the eyes and limps out with the drip-ticking now bearing a cadence he must teach. No external antagonist needed; the missing body is the pressure that finally says stay.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—Marrow’s need to matter—surfaces in paragraph four and tightens when the tape fragment gives him a tool to act. The playback choice narrows his options from passive cache-building to active emotional provocation, costing him anonymity. Pressure grows accumulatively: silence → discovery → transmission → witnessed breakdown. Cost is legible in the librarian’s collapse and Marrow’s self-exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—maintenance of order against unscheduled growth—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens once: the linden’s survival after lightning embodies the threat that control may be futile. The final beat externalizes this tightening by forcing her body to the mud, foreclosing the option to keep watching from a safe remove. Cost is visible (soiled knees, stolen leaf, internal spiral) under the Accumulative lens; no further escalation is required at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: secure water for the island. Pressure tightens when tide fails and Eron jokes the brooch might buy rain; Mara’s decision to cross literalizes that desperate leap. Escalation is situational—environmental betrayal forces stance crystallization. Cost is visible—she forfeits the preserved past and embraces uncertain barter—but off-island resolution is partly off-stage, slightly softening final punch.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—“who gets to define wonder?”—tightens when the cave’s chorus mutiny strips Lyra of her tool of trade and Mira’s village vignettes become the new oracle. Agency sits with Mira’s calm claim, “they want to inhabit the present,” which flips the power axis. Cost is legible: Lyra’s bow forfeits her marketable gift. The pressure curve is single but sufficient; a second reversal would overstuff 800 words.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake = can the exile’s silence be turned back into shared music? Pressure escalates through pattern, not plot reversal: each unclaimed object Mara presents enlarges the collective risk of permanent absence. The single tightening arrives when Caven lifts the valve—if the note fails, the silence calcifies. Agency is mostly Mara’s curatorial patience; Caven’s final breath supplies the decisive micro-turn whose failure would cost the city its last herald. Cost is legible but conceptual; lacks a tangible loss (object, relationship, flesh) that would punch into 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—map the unmappable—tightens twice: first when cracks override official surveys, then when the doorway offers only one path forward. The punch’s tug is the decisive escalation; curiosity becomes irreversible commitment. Cost is visible: sleep forfeited, sound swallowed, breath foreign. Under causal lens, each step forecloses retreat; the station’s offer to “map silence” is the final, irreversible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—will the narrator allow entangled memory to erode his rational boundary?—is signaled in paragraph three and tightens when the tile first warms. The single reversal occurs when skepticism flips from armor to aperture: “I would not surrender my questions, but neither would I flee.” Cost is visible—the notebook filled, the tile dimmed, the night spent—foreclosing sleep and the safety of pure disbelief. Pressure accrues under an Accumulative lens; each remembered layer adds density until remaining seated is the only stance that can hold both love and doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will the immortal permit distance?—is signaled early and escalates via spatial mutiny: rooms curve, exits re-map, magnetic threads yank possibility. No external coincidence; pressure is geometry itself narrowing options. One meaningful tightening: fragment aligns storm and interior, forcing the immortal to redraw boundaries. Cost is conceptual (immortality’s foreclosure) but visible on-page; could use slightly more visceral sting.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—political asylum versus exposing the entire fraud network—is signaled in paragraph 3. Tightening occurs when the narrator discovers the unfinished equation bearing his initial, forcing a live choice: disclose all or redirect half the stolen stream. Cost is visible: splitting the ledger risks consulate refusal yet keeps refugee couriers alive. Agency remains causal under the ink-altered lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can invented histories re-animate the silenced town?—tightens when the lamp’s constancy forces Aurelio from narrative invention to blank index: a visible forfeiture of hope. Agency is accumulative: each mapped hum forecloses one possible future, narrowing options to none. Cost is felt in knuckle-ache and the trailing unfinished ripple. No reversal, but the deepening from story to index is a meaningful intensification under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—remaining unfinished in a system that demands fixed identity—tightens when the overhead container speaks his paper name, a sonic hail that forecloses the option of total anonymity. The cost is visceral: he clings to rust, tasting blood, then chooses permanent provisionality. Escalation is textural: each overheard fragment adds weight until the only release is to embrace the blank. No coincidence resolves; the crane drops the container, the voice stops, and the port keeps breathing—pressure sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—can she decode why stories exist without destroying wonder—tightens when each cello-hum forces her to relive a moment she previously flattened with sarcasm. One meaningful deepening: lover’s reimagined answer (“That nothing meant anything…”) reframes her myth-busting as violence, not liberation. Cost is emotional: shame blooms, intellectual certainty forfeited. No external antagonist needed; pressure is mnemonic.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—keep people housed—tightens as each graffiti cipher forecloses lease options. Escalation is textural: pattern density of warning symbols increases, buyout rumors intensify, Council suspicion congeals. Protagonist agency drives every beat (data passed, maps painted, lies told). The felt cost is legible but slightly under-fleshed; we track tactics more than bodily toll.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—last grain’s erasure—tightens once: heritage shutdown timer drops from 20 min to amber ignition. Protagonist agency: refusal to declare instability costs him any further orbit of reprieve; amber flash is proactive creation of beauty under duress. Cost is legible—his own print beside history’s is irreversible once harvesters wake. No second reversal, but one meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“can broken guidance relearn direction?”—tightens through each calibration failure; stakes remain intimate yet absolute. One meaningful deepening: when Elias redirects the beak against the “singing line of water,” the drone’s whir shifts from confused to aligned—options narrow to fly or fail. No external antagonist needed; internal friction of mistrust supplies sufficient heat. Cost is the artisan’s letting-go, audible in the vanishing buzz.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—truth of river origin versus official atlas—tightens when personal handwriting commands the search. Escalation is one continuous ascent: bureaucratic silence → ice corridor → steaming seam, each step foreclosing retreat. The final narrowing occurs at the kneel: redraw or obey; the red pencil’s touch is the irreversible payment. No off-stage rescue; coincidence (condensation map) complicates rather than solves.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is legible early: rebuild the town’s sense of time so people feel the pull to return. Escalation is accumulative—each night’s walk thickens the auditory palimpsest until bells hum along; the wagon’s arrival is the pattern-break that forces stance crystallization. Protagonist agency drives every increment: he chooses the footstep method, alters pace by heartbeats, reverses path to test echo. Cost is present but conceptual rather than visceral—years of nightly walks, infinite patience—yet it tightens options and forecloses retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: lone guardian’s dwindling power vs. imperative to answer possibly human ping. Escalation is textural: each sensory inhale by vial tightens protagonist’s options until self-archive is only remaining path. One decisive turn—opening pod, releasing vial—immediately triggers memory extraction; no coincidence required. Cost is felt on-page: loss of private recollections, permanent solitude inside alien archive. Agency is renunciation rather than victory, fitting situational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“grow a story strong enough to open stone” to clear father’s name—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each night adds auditory detail (foundation roll > inhaling lung > thin laugh), deepening stakes by revealing the tower’s secret library. Protagonist’s agency visible in nightly mapping and decision to kneel at rust-door. Cost: embracing complicity in vanishings tightens moral noose before external discovery. No overt reversal, but knowledge of story-archive forecloses simpler escape plans, tightening options under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single dominant stake—will the town’s founding myth survive?—tightens when each awl stroke irreversibly consumes the plate’s copper ridges and his own stamina. Escalation is accumulative: every chamber deepens the pattern and the price (dust filling boots, hand aching), until the last carving forecloses retreat; the harbor is now both ruined and renewed, a conceptual repricing that makes reverence cost sweat and skin.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—can interrupted journeys ever loop back into meaning?—tightens when collapsing trench wall exposes the 360° calendar, forcing communal decision to rebuild. Cost is visible: desecration risk, priest’s blessing bought with shared authorship, Leila forfeits observer neutrality.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: can Neve invent a name that lets a stranger forgive themself—tightens when sender’s note removes return address, foreclosing revision. Subconscious-review checkbox and chalk code are micro-turns that narrow options to Marin Verge. No antagonist needed; pressure is temporal-ethical. Cost is the unmailed moment itself—future kept in hand.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake: can covert intelligence survive regime rewrite? Tightening occurs when the stitched void where palace should be forecloses the prince’s heroic narrative—he must risk erasure. Agency stays in Liora’s hands: each stitch is a because/therefore decision that raises cost. Price legible: “move where no story predicts you will move” = social death.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—recover the split breath before the brother’s drowning—tightens through accretion of song-sharpening and shard-flares, not multiple reversals. The single deepening comes when the unfinished sentence shortens to three words, narrowing the client’s future options: speak or burn. Agency remains Lysa’s; her decision to touch the pane triggers the vision that reweights the apology. Cost is felt in her ragged breath and the quieter shard—visible price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will Mara stay professionally neutral—tightens when the boy asks her to translate the cast and again when she swallows the coral; each beat narrows her ethical options. Agency is continuous: she decrypts, improvises the sea-lie, and accepts the coral, each act increasing complicity. The cost is legible on-page: her reflection in the glass is “undeniably afraid,” a stasis that forecloses neutrality. Escalation is linear rather than revelatory, keeping it shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—recover lost joy without arrest—signaled early; pressure escalates as each projector hums awake, narrowing options from permanent paint to ephemeral light. One meaningful tightening: he abandons protest for quiet gifting, foreclosing legal conflict but accepting impermanence. Accumulative lens: density of communal memories projected heightens cost of power-loss. Cost is legible; could edge higher if a concrete external risk (battery drain, drone cop) had materialized on page.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—exchange certainty for curiosity—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightened when the wall exhales the question. One meaningful deepening: the painted woman’s hand lifts, foreclosing the original restoration goal; cost is the narrator’s professional certainty visibly forfeited. Agency is attentional (clap, listen, abandon plan) rather than combative; pressure accumulates via echoed sound and flaking pigment. No coincidence; escalation is lyric density increase under accretive lens.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the nested visuals—figures inside figures, doubts inside doubts—without once naming “epistemology.” The final image (“endless, vivid echoes”) reweights the opening soot-scraping as the first unsealing. Subtext hums in silence: the garden’s reply is never translated, only felt. No moralizing; the cost is the narrator’s surrender of expert mastery, made legible in the abandoned scraper.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—curiosity as contraband—tightens when flower=word jeopardy faces seed-purchase audits. Escalation is textural: each new garden plot thickens the surveillance risk, felt cost legible in forged-grant jeopardy. More individual jeopardy (Arlen’s name on a docket) would sharpen the screw another turn.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—restore the moon to ease communal sleeplessness—is signaled early; pressure intensifies when coral itself responds, forcing the poet to finish the lullaby with explicit terms of forgiveness. One meaningful tightening: the coral path forms only while he sings, narrowing option to “keep singing or lose the moon forever.” Cost is felt: public vulnerability, voice imperfect, acceptance of future shadows. Coincidence (clouds part) complicates but does not resolve; truce is still uttered and paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: preserve perfect silence vs. answer a living absence. Pressure tightens once: the cracked chime leaks noise that could “loosen braided sequence”; caretaker’s repair fails to stop the roaming song, forcing either continued erasure or ingestion of alien memory. Choice—hum the foreign melody—pays with contamination of pure collection. Cost is the orchid’s after-glow that fades, proving the archive is no longer sterile.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restore trust or lose Liora forever—is signaled in graf 1 and tightens when the vow physically forbids retreat. Escalation is single but sufficient: silence → binding syntax → exit with irreversible honesty. Cost is on-page: throat texture change, risk of shattering one’s voice. No coincidence; agency drives every beat. The afternoon clock (“already leaning toward evening”) adds polite pressure but could be sharper; still, the internal lattice supplies the main vice.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—rotating survival—arrives late but is foreshadowed by downstream floodgates; escalation is the accretive layering of incompatible demands until Arlen’s rotating-gate scheme becomes the only shared loss. Tightening is visible when each councilor physically bends the chain. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral: perpetual uncertainty replaces permanent victory; the price is legible but not felt in the body.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: can the echo of lost music outlive its guilt? Pressure tightens once: the woman’s arrival forces Noel from denial to composition. Escalation is textural—each pigeon carries a melodic bar, accumulating until the single missing song is demanded. Cost is visible: writing the song re-opens the fire trauma and irrevocably attaches his name to it again.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—maintain cosmic distance to keep town/terrace safe—is signaled early and tightened through each furniture experiment. The seventh-day chair slide is the decisive reversal that swaps observation for physical risk. Agency remains with the protagonist: her decoding triggers every escalation; coincidence is absent. Cost is repeatedly legible (terraced lurch, olfactory rain, final exile-in-place). Escalation could sharpen one notch deeper had the maze punished an earlier trespass, but the single meaningful tightening meets scope default and lands under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—belonging via attention control—tightens once: the narrator’s experimental dimming forecloses reliance on charts and risks volunteer safety, visible when they drift toward half-light. Cost is legible: the burnt feather’s impotence and the surrender of “fixed beacon” identity. Escalation is accumulative; each flicker adds pattern weight until shrimp ascend to reweight the stake. No reversal, but the deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“why paths vanish”—tightens from mystery to stewardship once the unfinished crystal is revealed. Agency remains observational, yet the cost is visceral: he must catalog absence instead of presence, a trade-off legible in the blank ledger symbols.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“serenade monotony into new rhythm”—tightens when the bishop implant forces the crowd to confront slantwise agency. Escalation is accumulative: each micro-read (left-side favor, jaw tighten, beat-lean) increases density until the object transfer detonates the pattern. Cost is legible in the hush that follows, options reweighted.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“one forbidden verse”—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens with every tide-beat. Escalation is accretive: patrol gaps narrow, moon-speck blossoms, memory sliver shears off—each increment reweights risk. The stranger’s arrival is coincidence, but it complicates rather than rescues, satisfying situational pressure. Cost is legible yet diffuse; a sharper visceral price (a blood-drop, a name spoken aloud) would have punched 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—save the atrium or lose the harbor’s refracted memory—tightens once: from estimate request to renunciation of “numbers.” The glazier’s agency is renunciatory rather than combative, but the cost (social credibility, possible job loss) is legible. A second tightening beat would have pushed this into 9+ territory; as is, one clean turn suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—can Rafe keep translating pain without adding another burn-mark to a rookie—tightens once when he chooses disclosure instead of mentor clichés. Escalation is textural: porcelain imagery, celestial slowness, and Maya’s tremor accumulate until silence ceases to be an option. Coincidence absent; pressure is internal and coherent. Cost is visible on-page: Rafe’s “scraped” throat and Maya’s glassy eyes register the irreversible share of shame.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can gentler numbers still be true?—tightens through iterative on-page experiments; each ornamental shuffle forces a visible trade-off on the dial. Escalation is incremental but coherent: apathy pattern sinks needle to “Unlifted,” providing the single deepening that narrows options. Cost is legible as the narrator confronts futures of “long dull stagnations,” but the price is conceptual, not visceral; a sharper physical forfeiture would lift this to 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—will the narrator answer the walls’ invitation?—tightens when the film negative proves prior failure, narrowing options to flee or inherit. Escalation is textural: each acoustic layer raises the cost of abandonment. The decisive turn is the narrator’s choice to redraw the map; this act forecloses future detachment. Price is felt: eternal auditory vigilance.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—mirrors must show possibilities—escalates as song requests rise; girl’s plea narrows options to one mirror-repair; price is the acknowledged interest on borrowed heartbeat; causal agency stays with painter.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—stop future villages burning—is signaled early and tightens when the envoy must choose between amnesty for killers or continued war. The negotiator’s single micro-turn—offering compromise he “was embarrassed to write”—narrows options under Accumulative pressure. Cost is visible: both leaders sign while touching ash, accepting moral stain. No coincidence resolves; the signature is forced by prior ritual and arithmetic of dead.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—can the echo of annihilation be bought off—signaled in paragraph four. Escalation is accumulative: each image of desiccation tightens the ethical vise until the only live option is to surrender the last egg. Protagonist agency drives every beat: fund dams, circle flats, kneel, release. Cost is visible—egg gone, legacy exposed as hollow, trousers salted like a corpse—foreclosing future self-absolution.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—whether unspent feeling will be confiscated or weaponized—is signaled in paragraph three and tightens when Iri chooses to weave rather than jar the echoes, a single decisive intensification. The cost is palpable: her body becomes the archive she can never unload, foreclosing any return to unreadability. Under the Accumulative lens the pressure grows by accretion of ghost-layers; no coincidence required. The reversal is internal—no guard arrests her—yet it reconfigures power for the entire court.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“can stories expose their own cruelty”—is signaled early and tightens through the stick-handoff ritual. One meaningful deepening: admitting silence is the cruelest author narrows options to co-telling. Cost is legible—pride of detachment is forfeited—but external stakes (bar audiences, townspeople) remain off-page, capping intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can one person’s craft extend a species’ final breath?—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens once the wind’s “interrupted cadence” is answered by shifting a twig “here, untangling a root there.” Each adjustment narrows the butterfly’s flight path; luck complicates but does not solve. Visible price: Erin expends finite grotto grasses and her own stamina; the cost is felt when she “held her breath” while the sky “resumed its wandering.” Enough escalation and agency for the band.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—giving audible form to forgotten names—tightens when the rope demands his guilt-wax as material. One meaningful escalation: each re-braid loosens a frozen name, narrowing his option to retreat until he must accept the bells’ continuous chiming as lifelong labor. Cost is visible: the “snowmelt ardor” scorching his eyes equals melted guilt becoming permanent duty. Agency is entirely his; coincidence merely complicates (aurora already present), never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.8)
    One dominant stake—die correctly underground or live wrongly outside—is signaled by the bridge-voice’s question and tightened by every red alert and sealed wing. The protagonist’s agency drives the escalation: each night he feeds interpretations back, accelerating the bunker’s cognitive decay; the final tightening occurs when he pockets rather than inserts the seal, trading certain survival for unknown motion. Cost is visible: the roof shakes, pumps scream, and water invades—immediate physical jeopardy forecloses retreat. Storm-as-clock supplies live urgency; “when the storm approaches” is repeated until it arrives, forcing the decisive beat.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: test whether cosmic order answers human pattern. Escalation via iterative beam-star approximations; each near-miss increases cognitive cost. One tightening: planet slots exact node, reweighting prior dismissive smudge. Cost felt in final embrace of “usable doubt”; no off-stage resolution. Coincidence complicates rather than rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—stop hating the brother—tightens when the memory of the crash is physically re-felt inside the sanctuary. Escalation is not plot-reversal but density-increase: each turn of the broken key deepens the bodily verdict until the protagonist can’t sustain the old story. Cost is visceral—stomach clench, bruise echo, rib vibration—visible on the page. Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the single meaningful intensification suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single dominant stake—capture dream before it consumes him—tightens via density, not reversals: each silver trace makes retreat less possible. Agency is attention and endurance; cost is bodily translucence, paid on-page. Escalation is accretive: fog breathing → image transfer → self-erasure; the mirror’s pull is the pressure engine. No coincidence; even fog cooperation is earned through sync ritual. Visible price after each breath-cycle alters later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—custody of the orchard—signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is accretive: each surreal growth phase (branches through glass, roots under slabs, alien-colored fruit) tightens the cost of staying. The decisive tightening is the narrator’s spoken vow beneath the “watchful” trunk, which forecloses the legal option to reclaim or sell. Price is visible: he commits to indefinite, unpaid tending with no guarantee of daughter’s return.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“who inherits a story?”—signalled early via margin-questions; pressure tightens when Elias’s own signature appears on fruit, forcing either acceptance or erasure of future bargain. Escalation is accumulative: each new annotation adds density, each fruit narrows option until mirror-crossing becomes unavoidable. Price visible on page: he physically carries the future-fruit and bathroom memory, foreclosing linear life. No coincidence; pressure coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—retrieve brother by translating her unlearned mistake—is signaled early and tightens when the clerk demands “one lesson someone else failed to learn,” forcing her to choose whose failure she’ll study. Escalation is causal: each gap mapped narrows her path; the blank-spine book bearing her brother’s name makes the cost personal and immediate. The final micro-turn—writing in margin, not center—renounces erasure and accepts parallel futures, a visible trade-off. Price is legible: the mountain keeps her exit conditional, the book rewrites itself, she defers reunion.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—escape the classifier’s life versus reclaim the twin—tightens when the narrator chooses to stay aboard, forfeiting off-ship identity. Pressure accumulates through sensory intensification rather than causal reversals, fitting the Accumulative lens. The mirror gallery micro-turn forces recognition of unlived selves, narrowing options. Cost is legible: professional future is renounced on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—whether archival clarity should heal or simply name absence—signals early and tightens when the seal warms under her hand, forcing a choice between sealing or exposing historical wounds. Escalation is single yet meaningful: the parchment note (her own future hand) collapses options to “reconfigure braids or remain complicit.” Cost is conceptual but legible—she forfeits the comfort of sealed forgetting and inherits a ledger that can never be closed. Agency is pure attention and rerouting; luck complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“find the quiet”—is signaled early and sharpened by the storm’s voiced invasion; tension escalates as energy beings’ laughter ricochets deeper into the cave, compressing stillness into an ever-smaller radius. The mapkeeper’s agency is ritual, not reversible: each scrape, taste, and exhalation removes retreat until the final bloom forecloses all noise. Cost is diffuse—his body becomes the anvil—but still visible; misses 8.8 only because the price feels atmospheric rather than acute.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—“prove that coincidences have meaning”—tightens when the unpredicted comet intersects an eleven-year exhaustion curve, forcing a redraw of star charts inside his head. Agency is pure endurance/attention: he hauls the prism, not to win but to keep the corridor open. The beam’s obedience is the one deepening that reweights options: silence becomes answer, not absence. Cost is unmistakable—shard cracks, voice spills, Keeper’s knees mutiny, oil nearly gone.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—citywide identity dissolution—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when shadow calculus shows imminent loss of Thursday-singing. One meaningful deepening: stormlight shortens a monument shadow, forcing faster transcription; cost is visible fatigue and early-arriving nostalgia. No antagonist needed; pressure is situational and accumulative. Options narrow credibly under lens.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—denying despair entrance—tightens when the captain’s demand for progress forces the designer to commit shell-pattern to stone. One meaningful reversal: the knot meant for a spinner becomes the burning seed, swapping entertainment for defiance. Cost is visible: spent shells, scorched air, and the irreversible lighting that forecloses any second attempt. Agency remains internal—no army is fought, yet the night’s meaning is forcibly rewritten under accumulative/textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—leave or stay—is signaled early and tightens through silence rather than event; the pause itself becomes the pressure. Escalation is the accrual of overlapping future-images, each a tide mark that raises the cost of either path. Cost is legible: the seasonal return promise sacrifices year-round coastal identity.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—collecting versus being crushed by silence—is signaled in the third paragraph and tightens when the father stays for inversion, foreclosing retreat. Agency is interior but decisive: the child chooses to “let it in,” a renunciation that risks suffocation for shared vocabulary. Cost is visible: the doll is lost, the father’s helmet dangles unused, both hang “unbound from the math of fear.” Escalation is situational but coherent; each inversion intensifies the stakes of silence without external antagonist, culminating in a credible stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—“can silence be taught to comfort?”—is signaled early and tightens once: the blue line visualizes every stray sound, forcing passengers to police themselves. No external antagonist or reversal is needed; the escalation is accumulative: each micro-hush deepens the collective stillness until silence flips from absence to shelter. Cost is diffuse—individual voices forfeited—but legible under the Accumulative/Textural lens. A sharper personal price would push higher, but the story stays within its chosen scale.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“truthful memory vs perfect grid”—tightens via sunrise countdown that deletes possibility; each peeled layer raises cost of losing unedited past. Agency visible: pressing ruby into stair trades sovereign power for collective imperfection, price felt immediately under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: prevent regret-shrapnel from shredding the city; tightening occurs when pump stall signals metaphysical backlog, forcing her to act before concepts fully condense. Agency visible: she texts, steps, grasps—each action narrows escape routes. Cost legible: the hatch opens a path she cannot close again, foreshadowing exposure to both water and her own past. No coincidence; escalation is accumulative density of unpaid promises pressing outward through bolt and hatch.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: will Aurel face the pre-abdication silence he signed? Pressure intensifies sonically: each crank rotation tightens the spring of archival guilt until the queen’s recorded surrender slices away any chance to blame others. No external antagonist needed—the standing waves are prosecutor and jury. Cost is visible: the low hum now nests inside him, foreclosing denial.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—possibility versus obedience—signals early and tightens when Calder must pick a mask or reject all. Escalation is single but meaningful: offer of pre-shaped futures → refusal → unpredictability declared; cost is exile from kingdom and from identity as “needed.” No reversal needed; one fork is enough at this length. Price paid on-page: “every command obeyed” re-cast as choreography, not virtue.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are declared—“link every orphaned file”—but pressure never tightens; no deadline, budget, or opposing force threatens failure. The brother’s arrival is serendipitous, not earned by her agency. Escalation is textural (dust map) rather than consequential; cost is felt only conceptually at closure, so the tightening is present but mild.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preservation of erased communal memory—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the map-in-puddles points to freight gates, foreclosing retreat. Cost is visible: Lio’s aching throat, the strip that brands them courier. Escalation is linear rather than a sharp second reversal, satisfying short-form requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—silence a prophecy he once spoke—tightens through daily iteration: each dawn is one more chance to fail. Escalation is textural: the prophecy’s “stubborn eagerness” grows audible under his playing, forcing a final tactic of refusal-through-absence. Cost is visible: the grotto colors bruise, fog thickens, and the future “loosens” with an undeniably eerie nostalgia rather than victory. One meaningful intensification suffices under Accumulative lens; it lands.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—“decode the message”—is signaled early and tightens when the moonstone map reveals the monuments already echo ghost rivers, forcing the choice: keep sorting or plant. Pressure grows under Accumulative lens: each sorted seed and monument adds density until the new leaf breaks pattern. Cost is visible: Lio forfeits the safety of perpetual listening, accepts transformation the valley exacts on every successful reader. No external antagonist needed; internal fear of misunderstanding supplies coherent pressure throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—will Eli surrender his repair-man identity to uncertainty?—tightens when the compass-rose petal locks on Perhaps, forcing him to climb toward the greenhouse. Escalation is accumulative: each space (cavern → staircase → greenhouse) layers a new texture of time (vertical river → rusted treads → root-ruptured glass). The visible price is paid on-page: he forever forfeits the revenue of restored certainty by grafting “hands that knew how to hesitate.” One dock: coincidence (11:11 stoppage) is allowed to complicate, not resolve, so no deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“redeem the word lost”—is signaled in paragraph 5 and escalates when the coin cracks, foreclosing the city’s verdict. Pressure tightens once: the vision of Arlen on the pass pins him to a single moment, forcing Eira to unsolder that freeze-frame. Cost is visible in the coin’s fissure and the luminous regret that spills out; her name is now alloyed to his undefined path. The tightening is singular but decisive, satisfying the 600-word allowance for one meaningful turn.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restore children’s laughter by re-balancing spectral music—signaled in paragraph 7. One meaningful tightening: each spectral confession replaces dirge with joke, tightening harp strings toward harmony; protagonist agency drives every offer. Cost is conceptual but undeniable—Mara trades her mythic solemnity for a bruised, rough harmony, foreclosing her prior lone-ferry identity. No coincidence; all escalation is because/therefore under Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—mercy’s measurement—arrives early; pressure tightens when the voice demands the frame and the straps “wait like propositions.” Agency is the protagonist’s step into the frame, paying with surrendered body-data; cost is felt in the final flare of UV. One meaningful turn suffices; no reversal inflation.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“let overlooked histories speak”—is signaled early; pressure escalates by accretion of visual evidence rather than external threat. The shard’s fall is the single decisive intensification, turning abstract guilt into tactile responsibility; cost is legible in the sudden weight against skin. No live trade-off is forced in-scene, so escalation is atmospheric, not tactical—acceptable under Accumulative lens but capping the upper band.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“what ceilings hide”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the bulge breathes. The single meaningful intensification (touching the barrel) forecloses retreat and is driven by protagonist agency. Cost is legible: the upside-down room appears, ghosts exhale in relief, and the narrator is now complicit in a breached reality. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes again, so it stops short of the 8.5+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—eternity compressed without rupture—is signaled in line 1 and tightens when frost writes NOW OR NEVER OR ALWAYS, converting abstract desire into concrete deadline. Escalation is Accumulative: each printed sheet increases systemic wobble until the final page rewires treaties; cost is visible in glass branches chiming “like distant cutlery” and cloud-sea climbing with alien colors. Agency stays with Ilen: he copies frost, uncorks whisper, pulls lever; librarians merely react, preserving coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—who owns the past’s meaning—tightens when stratigraphy threatens the Council myth; covering the last mirror is the decisive agency that forecloses official history and releases imagined futures at visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—recover stolen dawn—is signaled inside 70 words and narrows to “sing truth or eternal gray.” One meaningful tightening: when Elias breathes the unspoken melody, surrendering personal secrecy becomes the only currency left. Cost is audible—his knees soften, the box warms—but the external city re-lighting happens off-stage, slightly diluting visceral price. Still, agency is his; no coincidence resolves the dark.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“find where explanations fail”—tightens when the compass abandons north for inward; the lagoon crossing is the visible price (risk of no return). Internal/external stakes braid: curiosity vs. bodily survival. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversal overload. Cost is legible but not yet paid on-page, capping below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—artist’s search for meaning after tech failure—tightens when slide shows her among time-braided strangers, foreclosing passive driftwood hunt. Escalation is situational: weather worsens, but internal pressure (seen-self paradox) drives the turn. Cost legible: she forfeits passive scavenging for active stewardship of alliances.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“understand the night flowers”—tightens when Ira realizes the glass lenses must be reproduced off-site, forcing him to trade private mastery for public dissemination; this single meaningful turn forecloses hoarding the secret. Pressure is coherent under situational lens: the cathedral’s architecture is the immutable circumstance that channels his agency into art rather than botany. Cost is legible—he surrenders sole witness—but the beat is compressed into one sentence, slightly muting the visceral price. Still, escalation is clean and lens-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single dominant stake—whether to let the past scorch her—tightens when the diary pulses hot and the debris spells KNEEL/WITNESS, forcing stance crystallization. Agency is present: she kneels and whispers terms, enduring retrocognitive overload as price. Escalation is textural—each spiral of symbols and shoreline mimic increases density rather than causal reversals, fitting the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible: heavier satchel, torn breath, and the final acceptance of shared wound.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: personal complicity in institutional foreknowledge vs. refusal to seed future grief. Pressure tightens once: Lan hears the prophetic oath and recognizes his own future voice, narrowing options to replicate or rebel—he chooses replication with visible existential cost. Escalation is causal under lens; no coincidence resolves anything. The price (eternal recursion) is felt but not dramatized in body—hence stops short of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“discover the texture of borrowed time”—is signaled in line 12 and paid when memories scrape across the narrator’s skin. Escalation is single but decisive: the egg’s answer narrows options to irreversible acceptance. Cost is visible in the final warmth that threads “other people’s yesterdays” into the narrator’s lattice. Under Accumulative lens, the density of foreign memories reweights the personal stake without external antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve sacrificial silence vs. save unknown lives—tightens with each sensor twitch. One meaningful deepening: the shadow that flashes across the sun tips needles to the red zone, forcing the live choice. Agency is pure: council activated the clause, but only Elias can pull; his renunciation costs the valley its siren and costs him moral certainty. Price is on-page in the final heartbeat, visible under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: visibility vs erasure. Tightening occurs when lantern glass forces literal projection of his hidden empathy; option to remain unseen is foreclosed. Cost is on-page: “chest ached,” “hurt felt spacious.” Agency: he lifts glass, steps closer, whispers promise—each act ups exposure. Sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving unsaid words—tightens when ghosts learn to cast shadows, threatening to void the keeper’s life-work. One meaningful deepening: the grooves become legible, forcing acknowledgement that the villagers’ knots must be sorted by him alone. Cost is felt: the prismed glow fixes him as eternal witness, foreclosing re-entry into human chatter. Agency is renunciation rather than victory, aligning with Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—preventing temporal leakage from drowning the town—tightens once, when garage-sale riddles shift from private notebooks to public pedagogy. This deepening is driven by narrator agency (he chooses to teach floating rather than plug the leak) and carries visible cost: blank pages that smell of rain, townsfolk who “grow quiet inside,” the fragment pulsing like mile markers. Under the Accumulative lens, density increase equals escalation; the cadence of arriving readers with “hungry train-platform eyes” makes the cost legible. A second tightening beat would have pushed the score higher, but the single deepening is sufficient for this word count.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“discover beauty in the incomplete”—is signaled early and deepened when discord is heard through the feather. The single meaningful tightening occurs when Elian chooses to harmonize rather than mute the dissonance, foreclosing the option of passive observation. Cost is felt as tooth-ache dissonance and the being’s warning that the world remains broken, only “more kindly.” Under Accumulative lens the pressure intensifies via sensory density; a sharper tangible loss (time, voice, feather glow) would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—will the orchard acknowledge its own voice before he dies—tightens once: copper network completed, lightning acceptance, stone panels sigh open, options foreclosed. Agency remains embodied: each coil, climb, and shortened breath alters the mountain’s stance; coincidence (storm timing) complicates but does not resolve. Cost is visible in chest pain and final collapse between pillars. A second reversal isn’t attempted; the single meaningful deepening is sufficient under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—will the ritual produce recognition or remain empty?—tightens once via the fly-amber’s persistent dullness, reweighting the pilgrimage from potential revelation to confirmed absence. Agency is observational (walking, reading footprints, holding bead) yet still forecloses belief; the cost is the forfeiture of certainty. Escalation is textural: each statue blur and footprint layer adds density until the clearing offers only “bare earth laid open like a palm.” No coincidence, no antagonist required; the pressure is the accumulating silence itself. Cost is felt, but slightly less viscerally than the thematic payoff, keeping the score just below the 8.5 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—covert re-greening of a militarized shoreline—tightens through each bird-guided placement; one meaningful deepening suffices. Agency is renunciation: he keeps sowing after the reef’s failure, narrowing his future to perpetual nocturnal ritual. Cost is visceral: knees bruised by rust, lungs full of cordite memory, human language abandoned. No coincidence; birds’ grammar is earned ally, not rescuer.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—whether to keep or spread dangerous memory—tightens once when the needle drops and options narrow to sharing. Cost is legible: the stranger’s tear-tracks, narrator’s risk of warlord reprisal, dog’s whine. Escalation is single but decisive under Accumulative lens; no reversals needed. Persistent constraint: the cylinder’s mutable testimony will keep wounding each listener.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—claim a personal “north” inside a station where time itself slips—is signaled early and tightens when the viewport overlay collapses into raw photons, forcing Elian to decide: retreat or map the distortion. Agency escalates through micro-choices: requesting solo access, stepping to the compass edge, beginning the sketch, finishing it despite lagged inhale. Cost is felt: the dilation field still scars local time, so every second inside the deck desynchronizes him from station Standard, foreclosing seamless return to collective chronology. No antagonist is needed; the pressure is ontological, and his final sketch renounces institutional safety for lived uncertainty.</answer>
    
    <question>5</question>
    <grade>8.7</grade>
    <comment>Theme emerges from the inversion of “true north” from immutable point to directional act—shown via star-trails that fork instead of fix. Subtext lives in gesture: sketching not what stars are but how they waver crystallizes the idea that identity is bearing, not anchor. The mother’s inscription (“when you cannot find your way home”) reweights at closure: home becomes the ongoing choice to keep looking. No moral is stated; the reconfigured sky-map offers open-ended resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—wonder vs. self-armoring—tightens when the lid’s questions foreclose every safe life-option at once. Agency drives escalation: each carved chess piece swapped is an active bet that narrows the path to the summit confrontation. Cost is legible: the king’s confession is permanently surrendered, leaving the narrator “unarmed” under a sky that is now literally rewriting him.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—recovering a speakable home—tightens when the stone demands burial be reversed; the on-page trade-off is acute: speak the ashamed tongue or remain sealed. Escalation is accumulative/textural: each remembered lullaby narrows the option to keep forgetting. Cost is visible in chest pain and audible thunder inside bones. One minor dip: the seer’s gate could have applied harder pressure after admittance.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restart time by solving the tapestry labyrinth—is signaled on arrival. Escalation is causal: each correct tug loosens time, each error darkens the village weave, narrowing options until only self-forgiveness remains. Cost is visible: tapestry villagers turn their backs after mistakes; the final tug leaves the pawn irreversibly worn. Lacks a third-level tightening to hit 9+; one more knot of consequence could have sharpened the price.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will she earn whole-forgiveness or be flayed by partial truth—escalates with each refracting question, tightening like bone-chimes in wind. No reversals needed; pressure accrues texturally, knowledge replacing bodily safety. The final cost is knowledge itself: she forfeits the comfort of a single verdict. Slight deduction because agency is mostly cognitive; physical risk is atmospheric rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—conjure meaning before acid destroys workshop—signaled in para 1. Meaningful tightening: fracture crawl + vapor intake narrows survival options to seconds. Protagonist agency drives escalation: he chooses to speak the narration that etches sigils, turning crack into seam; this act is irreversible and visibly priced by shredded voice. No coincidence; pressure coherent under Accumulative lens (pattern density → cost). Internal vs external conflict interwoven: doubt vs acid ingress.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—“paint the place that does not yet exist”—is signaled in paragraph one; pressure escalates by spatial compression rather than external antagonist. Each narrowing corridor removes retreat until the pool forces a single irreversible act: commit the vision to paint. The meaningful tightening occurs when he realizes the cavern already IS the imagined vista; this re-cognition costs him the comfort of eternal deferral. Price is legible: the unmixed colors in the pool are a physical token that the moment cannot be lived, only carried.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“prove whispers travel farther than shouts”—is signaled early and tightens when the beam softens, forcing Jorah’s tacit capitulation. Escalation is density-driven: scent-layer replaces horn-layer, narrowing options for audible navigation. Cost is felt: Mara’s throat ache, Jorah’s dropped shoulders, the boats’ hush. One micro-turn suffices for this length; no reversal inflation.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can Rian chart Mara home through geography of loss—signaled in first paragraph; tightens when each named ruin forecloses hope of intact destination. Escalation is accretive: every recalled site increases emotional freight until silence on line “aches like a wound pressed to glass.” Agency visible: decision to lie, to keep drawing, to transmit false coordinates with acknowledged cost. Price—Rian’s complicity in guiding Mara toward absence—felt in final breathless dark.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“can we bear to be fully seen?”—is signaled by line 5 and tightens once: the storm-night forces the eye to clear, dispersing the collective terror. Escalation is textural: fear chords accumulate through adjacent pods until the mirror-fright crystallizes and snaps. Protagonist agency is observational rather than decisive; the renunciation is to keep looking without the old buffer—costly but not a causal turn. Sufficient for high-band, though a hair below the 8.2 gate because the final release is atmospheric, not option-narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—decode the stranger’s gesture—tightens into a deeper one: accept or refuse the memory-transfer ritual. Escalation is textural: each named “gap” (unraised cup, empty chair) increases conceptual pressure until the investigator’s agency crystallizes in the final pin. Cost is felt: the act of waiting in the mist wearing bone-white edelweish manifests the inherited loneliness. Under the Accumulative lens this single meaningful deepening is sufficient, but the price could be sharpened by an immediate sensory consequence (cold, ridicule) to breach 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“find the doorway of decisions”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens as water climbs from knees to ribs, foreclosing retreat. One meaningful turn: chip projection converts stone into hinge, forcing now-or-never. Cost is felt (warm water, vanishing ants), though external coincidence (dream summons) slightly dilutes agency.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—prevent sky-death by confronting dream-source—tightens once: storm threat vs. immediate climb. The climb itself is the irreversible trade-off; treaty loss is the visible price. Pressure escalates under causal lens; no reversal, but option foreclosure is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve friendship place against exile—signaled by “bring this place with us.” Escalation: guild summons to farm-rings tightens space; shell inscription becomes last chance to bottle “density of presence.” Protagonist agency drives turn: he commits ampoule energy to shell, foreclosing own guild tenure. Cost (loss of safe patent future) visible in “answering both” sacrifice; could be sharper if price echoed in body reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—preserve narrative coherence against proliferating selves—tightens when the blank scroll forces the night walk; soaring becomes the last viable tactic. One meaningful deepening (realizing past selves "stalk" him) narrows options; cost is the perpetual chronicler role, but the price is more stated than viscerally felt on this beat.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—how to keep measuring time after irreplaceable loss—is signaled in paragraph 1. One meaningful tightening: installing the screw narrows options from “fix the machine” to “let grief inhabit the machine.” Cost is palpable—client’s blurred vision, Mara’s concession of scientific purity. Escalation is accumulative: each drip re-weights the same screw rather than multiplying reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—transform scars into living stories—signals early and tightens through two escalating rune beats that foreclose the option of lifelong shame. Cost is visible: trembling hand, bright scar, and impending storm that will test the new runes. Agency is Lan’s quill-strokes; no coincidence resolves tension. One meaningful deepening suffices; lacks a second visible price or persistent rule-change, keeping it sub-8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will she publish the apology?—tightens once: decision to hit “send” forecloses easy fame, visible in the orchard-green exit sign hum. Agency is internal yet narrows external options; price is her public reputation. Escalation is one meaningful crescendo under the causal lens; no static loops. Cost is legible; could edge 9.0 with a sharper prior temptation beat.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—understanding what clocks truly measure—is signaled on first page and deepened through backwards-counting trance that dissolves the map of minutes. One meaningful tightening: realizing the key is not for a lock but for “a hesitation” forecloses the path of compliance; refusal becomes the visible cost. Escalation is density-driven, not causal, fitting the Accumulative lens; no coincidence dilutes pressure. The price is conceptual—loss of certitude—rather than embodied, keeping it just shy of high-band punch.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—perimeter integrity vs. human permeability—tightens once, irrevocably, when the override key is pressed. The laser-pointer thumb twitch and Rae’s hand-block embody the cost of foreclosing the old tactical option. Escalation is causal, not ornamental: each stranger shuffle shortens the vector until the choice to open collapses the security model. Price is on-page: shared confusion, future food-chain unknown, identity as wall now obsolete.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: can she widen both their perspectives without enabling fresh risk? Escalation occurs through accumulative deepening: each found note (library, subway, father’s bedside) tightens the contradiction motif and narrows her option to stay detached. Agency visible when she pens the counter-statement, trading delay for dialogue. Cost legible: she forecloses the safe academic perch and steps into the gamble of caregiving. Coincidence (graffiti “arranged for me”) complicates rather than resolves, acceptable under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—loops must be broken—signals on page 1. Escalation is textural: each echoed phrase (“hum of streetlamps”) tightens the noose around Mara’s decision. Agency sits with Lena’s risky instruction; the lamp’s fade supplies external pressure. Cost is visible: Mara walks away, Lena remains in dim throat—option foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—“preserve the weight of small moments”—is signaled in paragraph 4 and intensifies each time ink meets salt. Mid-story tightening: footprints abandon the page, forcing narrator to choose follow or abandon covenant. Cost is legible: Mara’s euphoric but vanishing return leaves narrator writing alone under stars. Under Accumulative lens, density of blooming images reweights the stake; no coincidence resolves. One more beat of external resistance (wind smearing ink, festival guard interrupting) would push 9.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—map uncharted emotional depths—signaled in paragraph 5 and deepened when each musical note becomes a voiced absence. Ring’s inward reorientation is the single decisive tightening that forecloses external quest. Cost is visible (ring weight, silent clearing); no coincidence resolves the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—edit self to redeem past—signaled early. Escalation is textural: each dust-curve revision tightens cosmic response and personal cost; options narrow to accept dying unfinished. No coincidence; anomaly pressure coherent. Price visible: star winks, despair unbent, grant trajectories shift.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—translate silence into music—signals early and tightens through each signed hesitation. Escalation is textural: silence thickens to “fabric” she can weave; agency is her renunciation of speech, not external antagonist. Cost is legible—raw laugh that harmonizes with silence—yet the advisor applies no counter-pressure, so the tightening feels mono-directional. Sufficient for 8.0, but lacks a second fork that would foreclose an alternate path.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—“rescue a forgotten promise”—is early and personal; pressure deepens via accumulating mutilations that tighten interpretive options; the final shift from erasure to curation narrows future paths with visible cost (vow to stay, add to trail).

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will collective memory break its cage—signals early and tightens when reflection shows overlapped stranger. Drumming escalation turns personal tic into tactical signal, foreclosing passive compliance; cost legible in shared terror that floods back. One deepening suffices for length; could use a sharper tangible loss (e.g., physical bleed or facility alarm) to push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“prove whispers travel farther than shouts”—tightens when Ramos caps failure with shutdown/insurance loss. Milo’s agency narrows to one ten-minute window; the price is disclosure of his covert vent-system. Storm complicates but does not resolve; escalation is causal and sufficient for 600-word frame, though second inspector’s peril is less viscerally priced.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: can regret be spoken before it petrifies? Pressure tightens once: hesitant shutter tics → deliberate mirror signals → phone lifted. Cost is visible—constellations fade, guardian’s knees protest—yet the woman’s off-page voice keeps the price partially abstract. Agency is present but shared across two POVs; escalation is textural (density of light-signals) rather than causal narrowing. Enough for 8-band, but not the sharper foreclosure needed for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—saving the hillside woods—signalled by paragraph 4 and tightened exactly once: the synchronized window display gambit forecloses the easier path of overt protest. Cost is legible: shop-owners risk civic disapproval, Daniel risks failure in front of his students. Agency stays internal but active—every phone call and map annotation advances the window plot. Coincidence (early fog) complicates rather than resolves. The vote flip is partial, leaving the town in “different future” tension—enough for 600-word scale.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—Mara’s access to her own “true strain”—is signaled early; the pirate’s offer tightens it into a single irrevocable choice at low tide. Escalation is textural: density of myth and bodily memory increases until the bone’s cool weight externalizes the cost, foreclosing retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—illicit permission to grieve—tightens once: refusal to joke shifts to sculpting silence, narrowing options from verbal to tactile subversion. Agency resides solely with performer; Mara’s complicity is passive, so pressure feels one-sided. Cost is visible in surveillance risk and the wooden figure’s rough fragility, but because Mara doesn’t stake her own safety, escalation plateaus mid-range. Still, the single meaningful shift satisfies length-scale requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—reclaim language without being re-devoured by it—signaled in line 3. One meaningful tightening: the colonnade’s rising scale forces the choice—read the safe poem or speak extemporaneously—cost is the hush that greets his refusal. Agency sits with Lio; no coincidence resolves. Escalation is the ascending chord that makes silence unbearable, pushing him off script.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—Elya’s need to feel authentic connection—tightens when she abandons the grant-promised score, trading institutional approval for co-improvised sound. One meaningful deepening: the visitor’s raw admission “I needed somewhere the lights might fail again” reweights the blackout from inconvenience to existential honesty, forcing Elya to risk unscripted resonance. Cost is legible: she forfeits measurable outcomes and exposes her process to a stranger’s unfiltered need. Escalation is textural, not causal-reversal, but sufficient for 600-word scale.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can grief be taught to bloom?—is signaled in Riv’s offer. Escalation is accumulative: each origami bird incrementally reweights the light until the meteor shower ignites coordinates, tightening options from mourning to almost-living. No reversals, but one decisive intensification suffices. Cost is visible—ash capsules burn into brief stars, proving the path cannot be walked twice.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can meaning be rebuilt after digital collapse?—is signaled in line 3. Tightening occurs when Mara confesses the pattern circles back to “us,” forcing Jonas to choose complicity or exit; cost is the forfeiture of anonymity and the labor of analog mapping. Agency remains internal—confide, co-lay cards—but forecloses prior solitude. No coincidence; pressure is accumulative-textural, sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—can history’s pattern be bent to avert collapse?—is signaled in paragraph 4 and escalates with each opened door. Agency is continuous: every clockwise choice narrows future options and increases mental contamination, culminating in the irreversible vow. Cost is legible: “innocence flake away, layer by layer” and the decision to stay underground forever. No coincidence resolves; escalation is purely because/therefore under causal lens. The tightening would feel sharper if one mid-scene beat showed a concrete physical consequence (nosebleed, blackout) rather than solely cognitive refinement.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserving vanished hope—signaled in paragraph 3. Escalation: cloud anomaly → shadow anchored to his collection → offer of his own body. Each step narrows options and raises cost under causal logic. The final metamorphose is irreversible and self-willed; cost is visible in the “cool tide flooding the bare rooms of his own unrecorded dreams.” One meaningful tightening is sufficient; this delivers it.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can she salvage moral agency after complicity?—is signaled in paragraph two. Tightening occurs when she relinquishes the tail: the last private proof of partial innocence becomes public artifact, narrowing her future options. Cost is visible (she loses the relic and accepts perpetual shame). Agency drives the turn; no coincidence. Slight reserve: escalation is singular rather than layered, so pressure plateaus rather than spikes again, keeping the score just below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—how to live with unclosable wounds—tightens once: the graft’s failure flips Mara’s tool from scalpel to telescope, forcing her to abandon the sealing paradigm. Cost is legible in the bandage, the invasive vegetal voices, and the final meteor-hush that confirms her indefinite vigil. Agency is interior (a renunciation of method) but forecloses the previous path with felt price. Under the Accumulative lens the pattern intensifies rather than reverses; a single meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“find where unused love is stored”—is signaled sentence 1. Pressure tightens through image accumulation; no external antagonist needed. Micro-turn: realization that cut love is “not erased, only stripped from the narrative” narrows her options to acceptance or perpetual ache. Cost is visible: she abandons the hope of reclamation and takes on the labor of “new scenes.” Fits 8.8+ requirement under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: keep witness to possibilities alive at personal cost. Escalation is textural—each nightly ritual increases exhaustion while sparks multiply; the dune’s “breathing easier” signals rising stakes. One meaningful tightening: when a spark dives into the clock and flags twitch, the guard’s invented timetables nearly materialize, forcing continued vigil. Cost is cumulative sleep-debt and widening ontological vertigo; no external rescue offered.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—will the missing gear complete the forest’s heart?—is signaled once the bronze gap is noticed. Tightening is single but meaningful: inserting the gear fuses his body to the machine, an irreversible trade-off. Cost is legible in the visceral resonance that "filled my sinuses and ribs." No secondary reversals, but at this length one decisive escalation suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—freedom from the family shop—tightens when each remembered self-betrayal converts into a literal downward step, foreclosing retreat. Escalation is accumulative: density of memories = depth descended; cost is the burning lungs and the audible sea that replaces breathing room with irrevocable onward pressure. One meaningful intensification suffices; no external antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—silence as survival vs. voice as destruction—is signaled in line 1 and tightens when the first whispered sentence makes the chandelier chime. The bolt/hand/bruise sequence is the single meaningful escalation that forecloses the safe option; no reversal is needed under the accumulative lens. Price is audible: fortress cracks, bones re-break, snow rushes in. One minor drag: avalanche as off-stage catalyst slightly blurs cost visibility, keeping it just under the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—preventing the enthronement of the wrong man—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens through each encoded marginal note. The single meaningful deepening arrives when the scholar’s recognition crystallizes the threat, narrowing options from abstract worry to irrevocable knowledge. Cost is conceptual but legible: the titan sacrifices his anonymity and risks erasure if the palace re-awakens. Agency is indirect yet causal under Accumulative lens—each ink mark is an irreversible increment toward truth.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—keeping rebellion embers alive—tightens when Liora decides to risk the message; pressure escalates from quiet lull to concrete action; Accumulative lens: density of memory-images reweights cost; price is legible: exposure of rebels via traceable comm.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—freedom from implanted fate—is signaled in paragraph three and tightens when the council arrives to reclaim the embryo. One meaningful turn: the narrator’s choice to ask the embryo’s consent crystallizes agency under pressure. Cost is visible: amber cracks, council’s control is repudiated, tradition is evolved not erased. Escalation is accumulative rather than causal-reversal, but the density shift from whispered fear to luminous release is decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can she re-enter future without denying massacre—signaled early. Escalation is textural: each sensory trigger (gull dive, drone memory) tightens the somatic vise; the folding of the photo is the single decisive compression that forecloses erasure. Cost visible: she keeps the blur of catastrophe inside her new script. Coincidence absent; pressure coherent under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“learn the pattern of the cuts”—signaled early; tightening occurs when ink vision proves world edits itself, forcing Iren to accept vanishing as tactic. Cost visible: surrender of stable identity on the page (“let his sense of self loosen”). No external antagonist, but internal want-vs-fear (track truth vs. erase self) supplies coherent pressure. Meets 8.8+ gate for visible price that charges final image.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—personal survival versus moral duty—tightens exactly once when she decides to salt the network; option of safe ignorance foreclosed. Escalation causal under lens: each beat raises digital/traceable evidence against her. Cost visible: the cheerless ping accepting her forgery is the irreversible moment. No coincidences; state pressure remains off-stage but omnipresent.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes (continuity vs. local warlord entropy) are signaled in paragraph 1 and tighten through repetitive visitor tests: hunters expect vengeance, raiders expect fortress—both confront engraved quiet instead. Each interaction strips Mara’s options (no hired guns, no fortification) while raising reputational risk; cost is visible in her shoulders’ ache and the dome’s fracture. Escalation is textural/accumulative rather than causal-reversal, coherent under chosen lens; one meaningful intensification suffices.</answer>
    
    <question>5</question><<grade>9.0</grade>
    <comment>Theme emerges from plant-taught values rather than assertion; the final charged image answers the chaos-vs-continuity question without moralizing. Subtext operates in thorn-angle reading and scent-memory, inviting reflection on non-violent inheritance. No late symbolic grafts; “engraved quiet” is seeded early, paid off in last line. Complexity acknowledged—some hunters laugh, some listen—avoiding false equivalence.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—catch the goddess’s echo—tightens once: the spiral forms and silence method locks the waves, narrowing options to speak or refuse. The refusal is the single meaningful turn; cost is the echo’s grief flooding him and the garden’s rhythm breaking, visible on page. Pressure is textural, not causal; density peaks when suspended droplets wait “like a note on a staff,” then pattern fractures into new song. No secondary reversal, but one escalation suffices at this length under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—public truth vs. family complicity—signaled on first page; escalation delivered in one sharp tightening once documents prove emotional surveillance. Protagonist agency drives the irreversible choice to publish; cost is printed city-wide shame. No coincidence resolves; pressure coils under causal lens. One meaningful turn satisfies short-form requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—will Lark use her art to weaponize/listen or preserve innocence—tightens once: shard in hand → draw in sand, foreclosing option to stay merely a sidewalk decorator. Cost is conceptual (innocence lost) rather than visceral; absence of bodily price keeps score sub-8.8. Escalation is singular but sufficient for 700-word window; coincidence never rescues. Agency is decision, not antagonist battle, fitting situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can mercy survive scarcity—tightens when naming the fire “teacher” forecloses vengeance as a live option. Agency is interior/ritual, but the cost is visceral: she forfeits the safety of silence and becomes the city’s visible “hinge.” One meaningful deepening satisfies escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—save the maze’s stories from erasure—signals by paragraph 6 and tightens once: “even that will lose its stories unless we do something.” Agency is shared proposal, not solo explosive act; the price (theater already doomed) is visible, but no new tactical loss is paid in-scene. Escalation is a single deepening rather than reversal; options narrow to “try the coin ritual or accept oblivion.” Cost is conceptual and future-oriented; sufficient for lyric closure at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can Eli aim the overflow or be consumed—signals early and tightens once: the knot in the audience-web must be loosened or his ribs stay tight. Agency is present; intention redirection is on-page and narrows future options (he surrenders rest). Cost is visible (insomnia, ethical blur) but could be sharper—no concrete object lost. Sufficient for length, but not yet 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—map the emotional wake for future wakers—tightens when spiral-traces reveal a non-human witness; floating becomes the visible price that forecloses retreat, deepening the archival mission under accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is clear by paragraph 2: prevent the Council from ossifying prophecy into law. Escalation is single but meaningful: locating the crate narrows options to one irrevocable act—release the echo. The tightening forces a trade-off: Mara gains raw possibility but loses personal safety, a cost legible in the dawn-foreshadowed "truth unravels." Agency drives the turn; coincidence is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can a burned asset choose trust over extraction?—tightens with each artifact found; options narrow from flight to waiting. The snow-code discovery is the meaningful reversal that forces a tactical reread of the field. Cost is visible: by pocketing the second pillbox Elias accepts continued exposure. Agency remains his; no coincidences rescue him.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—can the coachman distill complexity without being overwhelmed—tightens when the boy’s illness is revealed, forcing the mother’s plea to overwrite prior vows. One meaningful turn: coachman’s interior shift from passive listening to active “holding together” of conflicting promises. Cost is felt in the serene but weightless final image; no external price is visibly forfeited, keeping it under 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—why life resists annihilation—signaled in paragraph 1 and deepened through two timeline images. Escalation is density-driven: overlapping futures thicken until kindness emerges as causal lever; narrowing options from “maybe bees return” to “maybe I already tilted the scale.” Protagonist agency lies in seed-and-clay offerings; cost = water rarer than sleep, bodily knees in grit, acceptance of uncertain outcome. No visible price beyond exhaustion, so 8.8+ band barely missed. Pattern break (sprouts lean) reweights stake with undeniable yet quiet payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.8)
    One dominant stake—can exposed vulnerability be transmuted into shared safety—tightens exactly once: the moment she turns the tooth from relic to chandelier pivot. That act forecloses the private, hoarded grief option; cost is the visible fragility of glass that could injure or be vandalized. Agency is pure protagonist; no off-stage savior. Pressure grows by accretion of light fragments, not external antagonist, satisfying Accumulative lens. A second tightening would over-egg this length; the single deepening is sufficient and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can solitude become livable—tightens when the reflection warns that purity led to extinction, forcing Lio to choose coexistence over mausoleum. Escalation is situational pressure: the library’s tide, the thinning reflection, the pulse-matched hum. Visible price: the other Lio dissolves, foreclosing reunion; protagonist agency drives the final adjustment.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—write a letter that strangers can inhabit—tightens once: the architect insists the first object must choose itself, forcing the narrator to weave private echoes into public text. Escalation is textural rather than causal, a deepening of pressure toward communal exposure; the cost is the surrender of anonymity, felt but not dramatized as a forked path.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—keep the Void playful and student-accessible—tightens when defense contractor looms. Escalation is causal: each human fracture (senate vote, on-air debate) correlates with signal mutation, forcing Mara’s counter-move. Subsonic broadcast is visible price: she jeopardizes FCC compliance and personal safety. No coincidence; tension narrows to single question—will tricksters accept her invitation instead of vanishing into classified spectrum?

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—find the key before space crushes him—is signaled in line 1 and tightens when “air might tighten until his ribs protested.” Single meaningful deepening: the brass tube’s silent chord bruises geometry and forces the staircase; no option but descent. Cost is visceral: breath shortening, balance kneeling, final acceptance of unknown bodily risk. Escalation is situational, not causal-reversal, but coherence and price are undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are immediately legible: re-ignite a thirteen-year-cold case with one depleted artifact. Pressure tightens through accretive texture: each pigment mix, each charcoal pass narrows the possible faces until only the ribbon’s angle remains. The decisive tightening is the moment painted ribbon appears to flutter—an hallucinated motion that forces either confession or silence in whoever sees it. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable: the portrait will now haunt the living, not identify the dead.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—redeem Tamar by proving the station itself is the ongoing sentence—tightens when coordinates encode the very platform she stands on. One decisive turn: copying the stanza into the official forecast narrows her options to complicity or exile-within-exile; the price is immediate (she can never again claim bureaucratic innocence). Pressure escalates under causal lens: each decoded verse walks the convoy away from mines, tightening the moral cost of erasure. No coincidence; the drone drop is early, the rest is her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: can the narrator break the looping inheritance of heists/startup failures? Pressure escalates via textural accumulation: each currency/route pair adds density until the deck collapses. No external antagonist; regulators & investors function as off-page pressure. One credible loss: company death + Lila’s exit foreclose co-founder path. Moral calculus—sell vision vs. admit theft lineage—remains implicit but present. Cost visible: “papers…like apologies.” Agency: choice to keep/spread bills is renunciation of future scaling.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—“decode or lose funding”—is declared early but never tested on-page; no clock, no bureaucratic veto looms. Escalation is purely cognitive: each star-match adds moral weight, not tactical jeopardy. Protagonist’s agency limited to tracing and murmuring; no decision forecloses an option. Cost is collective-historical, not personal, so pressure stays abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“discover what mirrors don’t show”—is signaled early and tightens when the seed’s hunger for confession is revealed, narrowing Arlen’s options to speak or remain frozen. Escalation is causal: each expanding circle of awareness drives him deeper toward the hollow where the confession waits; the vortex’s grind is the physical correlate of rising cost. Final price is explicit: uttering the admission cracks the lake and himself. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve or sever the dreaming maze—tightens once: the shared vision reveals both choices unleash unpayable costs. Agency is split: the visionary cannot walk, the skeptic cannot measure, so their mutual scar-link becomes the decisive yet paralyzing act. Price is legible in glowing blood and the maze’s sea-sized future; escalation is complete at the beat of refusal.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“become someone who would have watched the water”—is signaled early and tightened when the altar literally drinks the narrator’s guilt. One meaningful escalation: hand-on-card → blood drop → root shiver → identity sift. Price is legible: Lio ages, narrator’s memory rearranges. No reversal overload; single turn sufficient for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will Eli certify the amp for cash or honor the lived past—tightens the instant he fingers the grille-cloth scrap; that tactile proof collapses the distance between appraiser and roadie identities, forcing a public decision with real freelance-income stakes. Escalation is causal: because he finds undeniable evidence, therefore he must either perpetuate the earlier live-stream lie or risk income by embracing uncertain provenance; the choice carries visible price as he pens the non-certifying note. No coincidence resolves tension; the scrap is organic to prior tour life. One meaningful turn suffices at this length and it forecloses the “100 % real” path forever.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“understand transition”—is signaled early and tightened when the guide’s vanish makes the abstract lethal. Escalation is situational pressure: each arbor pulse narrows Mara’s options from study → survival → surrender. Cost is legible in her forfeited escape ladder and the unspoken price of her final consent. One beat short of 9+ only because the tightening is atmospheric more than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: can wonder survive routine once tomorrow vanishes? Pressure mounts imagistically—moonlight thickens, tide rises to mid-shelves—culminating in the librarian’s single decisive intensification: smelt the fragmented selves or lose the fisherman to the tide. The act is not reversible; options narrow to accepting contradiction or dissolution. The cost is felt in the librarian’s gears turning “slow, tectonic,” and the fisherman’s newly shared reflection—visible price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—will she keep sealing tombs or risk reopening hearts—tightens the instant the pearl brightens at her hesitation. Escalation is textural: each shell-filled spiral adds moral weight until speech becomes the only remaining move. The cost is visible: her detachment forfeited as the ghost-light stains her skin. Could edge higher if Rafi had forced an explicit trade-off, but the solitary pressure still forecloses her old stance.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness vs. self-definition as worst thing—signaled in graffiti by midpoint. Escalation is textural: each layer of description (accordion, mirror sentence) raises the cost of clinging to the old narrative. The micro-turn is the narrator’s decision to inscribe his own name; this narrows future options by acknowledging equal frailty rather than exceptional guilt. Price is conceptual but felt: the river’s wave becomes neutral, stripping accusation—undeniable tonal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“will she fix or free the unspoken?”—tightens when silence-lag becomes the new metric and documentation is foreclosed. One meaningful deepening: realizing restraint can be mercy, not cowardice. Cost is visible (letter destroyed, career path gone), but the external world offers no tangible backlash yet, keeping the score just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—truth versus institutional lie—escalates through each sensory annotation: plant gossip, coffee prophecy, river memory. One meaningful tightening occurs when the violin’s hairline crack audibly reclaims its river past, forcing the annotative refusal that forecloses replication. Cost is felt in the simultaneous evaporation of funding and song.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“capture one last spark before oblivion”—tightens when the chip cracks, narrowing options to a single risky placement. Escalation is textural: each infusion layers fragility into the emerald; the final stillness is a deepening, not a reversal, yet the cost (possible shatter) is unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—Mara’s need to have her moral coin land—signaled early and tightened once when fear is voiced, narrowing options to perpetual spin. Pressure grows under causal lens; no external coincidence resolves. Cost legible: perpetual uncertainty accepted instead of absolution. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—Mora’s desire to witness disappearance—faces a single deepening: the realization that vanishing is a responsibility, not a trick. Escalation is textural: each ripple dilutes her name until the hollow becomes palpable. Cost is legible in her returned memory’s “painful and bright” rush; agency is attention/acceptance rather than active reversal, fitting accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—give the wandering pulse a home—tightens through sonic accumulation: each ricochet narrows possible “locations” until stillness is the only answer. Agency is attentional; every pebble skim is an experiment whose failure (no forward motion) reweights the stake toward internal anchoring. Visible price: he forfeits external quest, accepting abrasive dust of eternal patience. One meaningful turn: when flock tilts to follow echoes, external motion is appropriated by the world—he must cede it.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single dominant stake: escape obsolescence by finding wonder the algorithms cannot narrate. Pressure tightens when the perfect story-engine downstairs becomes audible hiss—his replacement is literal. Escalation is one continuous because/therefore: keonanomaly → unauthorized stair → platform → step into mist, each increment foreclosing retreat. Cost is opportunity: safe bureaucratic oblivion swapped for possible death/magic.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—will he dare promise?—tightens once yet decisively when he speaks his vow underwater, foreclosing his life-long evasion. Cost is the new synesthetic burden he must now carry. No reversals needed under Accumulative lens; density alone reweights options.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—whether to keep surrendering choice to chance—tightens once when the backwards warning arrives. Agency is exercised: he refuses the ritual that defines him. Cost is visible: he loses his functional identity yet gains unshared authorship. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens; the static’s thickened urgency is the only escalation needed at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—naming fears to atone—tightens when each recording releases a new creature that must be faced rather than scythed. Agency is renunciation: he keeps paying in regret and lantern-oil, each crystallized fear a visible price. No coincidence; escalation is accumulative, each voice adding density until the floor glitters with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single escalating texture suffices; drip-alignment narrows options to one live cadence with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—will he keep engineering silence or start engineering memory?—is signaled early by wind-chime takedown. Each new photograph tightens the pressure under accumulative lens: the drowned past is physically surfacing and demanding vocal witness. Final oration to neighbors is the decisive renunciation of purely structural guardianship; cost is the irreversible opening of private grief to collective reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—harmonize logic vs. intuition—is signaled early and narrows to a single irrevocable lens adjustment. Escalation is accumulative: each paragraph adds density (mist, starlings, flame ring) until the rhythm itself becomes pressure. The cost is perceptual, not bodily, but still forecloses prior certainty: “that certainty feel thin as paper held to flame.” Meets short-form requirement of one meaningful tightening; no external antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve city trust—tightens once when the hidden hitch in static is isolated; the protagonist’s agency (finger-movement, report-filing) narrows options under Accumulative lens. Cost is visible: the arbor “steadies” and the world “never knows,” a felt social price. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversal overload.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—who becomes the authentic guardian—tightens with every memory-slash; options narrow as shared experiences vanish. Escalation is causal: defending vs attacking memories reweights moral legitimacy. Visible price: surrendering victory to preserve guilt forecloses the “algorithmic compost” fate. The final stance crystallizes under pressure, fulfilling earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—curiosity vs. safety—tightens once: planting the seed forecloses the sterile comfort of ordinary escape-room nights. Cost is visible: he trades known commerce for “whatever dreamed beneath the town.” A second escalation beat is absent, capping this at 8.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restore laughter—signaled in line 1 and tightens when engines hover on stall edge; one meaningful deepening occurs as phantom laughter threads upstairs, forcing parental rupture. Agency is renunciation/attention: Lysander lets engines die, enduring unknown aftermath; this forecloses his control over what returns. Cost is audible: the house’s silence is irreversibly cracked; parents’ laugh is “rusted but unmistakable.” Under Accumulative lens, density increase (roar → memory → draft → bark) reweights stake. Meets 9+ quick test: price is legible on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will the library let him leave, and does he even want to?—is signaled in line one and tightened only once: when the pendant corridor reveals the price of either choice. That single deepening is sufficient under Accumulative lens; the pattern of images (fog, frost, glass, lantern) accumulates until the final image re-prices both options. Agency is present: he walks, sits, reaches, pockets the pendant; each micro-action forecloses the fantasy of a final answer. Cost is legible in the alter-ego vision—exhaustion made visible—and in the guardian’s parting warning to “write in the margins,” i.e., accept perpetual provisionality.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“interrupt a stifling destiny”—is signaled in paragraph four and tightened when he speaks the final direction, foreclosing his own safety. Escalation is one continuous rise: arrival → approach → grasp → fracture → redirect; each beat raises the risk of being caught or burned. The reversal is internal: he swaps obedience for sabotage, and the price (loss of protective anonymity) is legible in the warden’s half-seeing stare. Under causal lens, every “because” leads to a narrower option until the last ember dims.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—help the towers end without murder—is signaled by paragraph 5. Escalation is textural: signal density grows until the listener must either assent to collapse or redirect it. The midpoint hitch in static and the final dial-tone sigh are tangible tightenings. Cost is legible (shard dissolved, body synchronized, future burden assumed), though the compromise itself is negotiated more through lyrical persuasion than beat-by-beat obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are legible early: Eli wants to steer the ferry toward a merged, permanent morning. Pressure escalates texturally—fog thickens from “unsaid possibilities,” stars trade places, reflections of burning or wedding ferries overlap—until the braided melody forces a one-shot stance. The tightening is felt, but the price (what Eli actually forfeits if the merger fails) stays off-page, capping tension just below the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—remember without pain—tightens when each memory-thread pull reconfigures space, forcing micro-choices of routing and knotting. Escalation is accumulative/textural: density of mirrored faces increases until the silhouette doorway hardens the stakes into an irreversible binary. Architect’s tug that “rearranges space” makes the cost visceral in the narrator’s wrists. No option is declared safer; both retain pain, satisfying the because/therefore lens.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: can the narrator re-learn navigation once north vanishes? Tightening occurs when edge-geometry replaces static star-fixes, narrowing his toolkit from certainty to gradient-sense. Protagonist agency: he could refuse the midnight lesson; instead he unclasps the chain, physically enacting commitment. Cost is legible—sleep lost, former certitudes dissolved—yet scene ends before we see this new method risk lives, so escalation is philosophical rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether a dead woman’s unsent forgiveness will reach the living—tightens once, when Eren chooses to phone Deniz instead of filing the standard tag. That single narrowing forfeits his bureaucratic safety and crystallizes the “incidental heroism” concept. Pressure is accumulative/textural: each pulse in the hearing aid adds density until the silence in the apartment becomes unbearable. Cost is legible: the guard’s future suspicion, the protocol breach, and the raw telephone cry.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—escape within tide window versus staying with remembered voices—tightens when rig flashes “temporal drift approaching.” Meaningful turn: choosing to carry the soul-net sphere out forecloses clean exit and invites undefined coast. Cost is visible on-page: sphere’s anti-gravity tug and client-obscured agenda ensure future peril; tide clock is live constraint. Pressure escalates via because/therefore chain (codex clue → deeper descent → drift alert) under Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“last sanctioned night before shutdown”—broadcast early; micro-turn is ink bloom revealing nonlinear algorithm. Tightening comes through CPU overload that risks permanent data loss, raising tangible price. Agency: he risks final power surge to let sectors vote; luck complicates (static roars) but does not resolve. Cost is legible: he gains a glitching, evolving Lian, not the original—options narrowed, not reset.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—save a dying language—tightens when each texture he translates costs him personal voice equity. One decisive deepening: accepting the curse fuses his copper veins into the canyon’s breath, foreclosing any future extraction of self from sound. Agency is continuous (whispering, tilting, aligning to birds) and the price is legible in the sparkling bone dust that ends the scene. Under Accumulative lens, density and cadence shift fulfill escalation without needing external reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“understand what is taking them”—tightens when each confession seed narrows the investigator’s epistemic tools to zero. Single decisive intensification: phone pressed into hands turns reconnaissance into complicity; no off-stage rescue. Price is legible: the researcher forfeits taxonomy for listening. Slight reserve: escalation is one beat, not a chain; still sufficient for sub-1 k word count.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reawaken beauty vs. keep city calm—tightens when Lio realizes his music is a key he has blunted. Escalation is single but meaningful: switching rhythm from city to orchard irrevocably snaps copper harnesses and blacks out towers; price is legible (machinists clutch chests, Lio’s arms burn). Because/therefore linkage under Causal lens: because he bows orchard pulse, therefore roots rip free. No coin-flip resolution; the choice is his, irreversible. Could touch 9.0 if we felt one personal concrete loss (friend? ration card?) but citywide blackout already carries social cost.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—keeping the mail-drop hour alive—tightens when the thunderstorm bottle raises stakes from letters to weather itself. One meaningful deepening: storm shifts from curiosity to potential roof-ripping reckoning. Agency resides in Eren’s decision to deliver without questions and Mara’s poised choice to uncork or not; both foreclose paths with visible risk of drowning the town. Cost is legible: the cork’s tremor literalizes the danger of mis-timed rain.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—locate the pre-ink origin of story—is signaled in paragraph 5 and tightens through each star-marked hesitation. Escalation is accumulative/textural: density of paused pens increases, air thickens to “cool and grainy,” until the poet’s motionless body collapses the hyperbolic spread into one depth. The price is conceptual—the map’s redundancy—rather than visceral, but it is on-page and felt. One beat short of 8.8: no tangible forfeiture (job risk, physical drain) sharpens the final cost.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—keep the islands from dissolving—signaled in paragraph 5; personal stake—recover her own runaway dream—braided underneath. Escalation is accumulative: each sunrise photograph thins Irena further while anchoring the islands, tightening the paradox. The final shoot on the highest cliff is not a new twist but a deepening that exposes the irrevocable cost—her continued hollowing. Cost is felt, not abstract: “every sunrise she captured left her curiously hollow”; no reversal, but poise crystallizes options and price.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—free the idea from fear—is signaled in line 3 and tightens exactly once when the vial is opened, trading safety for exposure. Escalation is causal, not repeated: each beat narrows option space until renunciation is the only path. Cost is visible—“the old safety is foreclosed” is felt in the skull-pressure shift. No coincidence resolves; the star merely times the irreversible choice. Could use one more physical stake (time, tool, social) to hit 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—recovering selfhood—tightens when each mushroom-bead of memory returned costs a fresh fact dissolving. Protagonist agency drives every gain and loss; coincidence merely frames, never resolves. The price is legible on the page: phone numbers slip away before the climb-out, foreclosing the “tidy life” option.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—whether Jun’s exile will remain reversible—tightens when Rhea annotates the vellum bridge, narrowing options to her sole vigil. Escalation is driven by her agency under situational pressure: the Council’s decree stands, but her promise reweights the cost of remembering. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, and the price (perpetual guardianship of the exit) is legible on the page. Closure form is judged in Q2; here the pressure curve coheres and peaks with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“can wonder be re-planted in me?”—is signaled early and tightens through imagistic accretion rather than external opposition; the single meaningful deepening occurs when the seed drinks the rainbow-city vision, narrowing options to keeperhood or retreat. Cost is legible: the narrator now carries forward the possible failure of that vision. No external antagonist is needed; internal gray vs. possible color supplies sufficient pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—restoring the dead captain’s name to quiet restless spirits—is signaled early and tightens as each knot releases lived nights at sea. The final knot forces a trade-off: Ilan must vow to carry then release the secret, a visible cost that forecloses his habitual anonymity. Escalation is textural—silence accumulating weight—yet agency remains his; coincidence never intrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—who controls the meaning of silence—tightens once: from “archive seals reports” to Elias’s counter-mandate to keep the chapel open for listening. One meaningful deepening: the second reel shows frescos further damaged, proving prior human intrusion failed. Cost is conceptual but legible: the museum must now curate absence, not presence. Agency is Elias’s interpretation act, not physical heroics—appropriate to lens, yet the turn is single; no secondary reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—whether to honor the physicist’s experiment by allowing some data to stay untouchable—tightens once, decisively, when the narrator realizes full retrieval would “smother the very uncertainty.” Agency is present: he actively loosens the cylinder and signals ascent, leaving the globes. Visible price is the “mourning” of imperfect knowledge. No external antagonist is needed; pressure is internal and conceptual, sufficient for 700-word frame.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to unspoken needs—tightens when the wall demands reciprocity, foreclosing Lio’s anonymity. Escalation is single but meaningful: the ghost flips encoder into decoder, forcing public exposure. Cost visible in hot brass and the city’s raw sentences now irretrievably externalized. No antagonist needed; pressure comes from reversed instrumentality.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“seek out the joy beneath anguish”—is signaled in paragraph four and tightened when the diary method is distilled into a single transferable rule. One meaningful deepening: the encryption is revealed not as secrecy but as enforced annotation of joy, which re-prices the cost of empathy. No visible resource loss beyond cold breath, but the conceptual price (she can no longer unread suffering) is felt on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—prove emptiness remembers—signaled in paragraph four. Escalation is textural: each cloud category thickens emotional density until the quiet explosive cumulus jerks the gondola, a micro-turn that forces the logbook entry. Cost is conceptual: she forfeits immediate rescue for an unverifiable dataset, price paid in isolation. Agency rests in the act of memorializing; coincidence (unforecast crosswind) complicates rather than rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—save the sky—tightens when paint reaches board limit, forcing renunciation而非 rescue of walls. Agency: each brushstroke consumes dwindling space, literal cost (“boards seemed ready to warp”). No external reversals needed; escalation is density-driven under Accumulative lens. One micro-turn: realization “some limits were frames” crystallizes choice. Cost visible on-page, satisfying 8.8+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—prove “stranded luminance” real before authority—tightens when Orvan demands risk-proof; refusal would abort Lio’s only chance. Escalation is textural: each square-glow note thickens pattern evidence until it outweighs scheduled flight plans. One visible price: Lio’s hands smudged, heart “loose rigging,” and explicit acceptance of personal risk-logging duty. No coincidence resolves; starlings merely respond to invisible choreography, pressure stays coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are atmospheric, not personal: the library’s silence must be un-layered, but the locksmith risks no loss other than fatigue. Pressure deepens by accretion—each mirror releases a stranger’s breath—yet the protagonist’s options never narrow, only multiply in gentle success. The cost is off-loaded onto anonymous mirror-victims; the locksmith pays nothing visible. The final thaw is beautiful but not a trade-off, so escalation stays lyrical rather than consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—save orchard/community—tightens when the violet updraft begins lifting land chunks. Escalation is accumulative/textural: each chalk order increases communal investment until the bell itself fractures, reweighting cost. No reversal, but the deepening is decisive: from ghost petitions to living harnesses. Price is visible in heirlooms abandoned and bell shards.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—whether to halt or soften doom—signals early and tightens when the puppet substitution visibly forecloses the master-key path. Escalation is textural: each chamber deepens the cost of tenderness withheld, reweighting the stake rather than reversing plot direction. The price is felt in the bruised awe of the final line. No off-stage rescue; coincidence is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single dominant stake—keep travelers alive before frost—tightens when birds herd the mapless man inward. Each guided soul forecloses future options, escalating moral cost under causal lens. No reversals needed; pressure accrues through accumulating complicity. Visible price: frost etches rejected paths nightly, a literal tally of failures.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—transform guilt into safer flow—tightens once: river-foam insight enabling a resin that reroutes disaster. Escalation is accumulative pattern-break rather than external antagonism; visible price is interior (perpetual sabbatical, patent expectations sidestepped). Stakes stay personal; no credible resource loss is dramatized on-page, keeping pressure cerebral rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can one choose pre-story silence without foreclosing all future plot?—tightens when the slate refuses erasure and instead incises absences, removing the option of pure blankness. Pressure escalates under Accumulative/Textural lens: each glass leaf reflection adds density until the orchard itself becomes the ledger that records their rejection-paths. Woman’s agency drives the irreversible pour; cost is visible as the slate “deepened” and the branch-aisle audibly updates.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—how much communal guilt one man can safely digest—tightens from tidal pool accusation to the grated three grains that literally silence a fortress. The second tasting of the soldier’s massacre is the one visible price that narrows options: Rafi’s body refuses, ice reseals, and the menu line is irrevocably drawn. Escalation is textural: density of frost, sound of chime, risk of over-seasoning grief. No coincidence; every intensification is Rafi’s hand deciding how sharp the community’s tongue should taste tonight.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—excavate forgotten dreams—tightens when cross-wiring pulls collective memory instead of a single specimen, forcing the choice to surrender identity or abort. Escalation is the deepening of psychic load: each foreign memory slots into him with a “click” and a tremor, price visible on the page. Agency is continuous—every adjustment of the mirror is his. No external coincidence; pressure is purely elective but irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—secure forbidden combinations before gravity reverts—signaled early; hourglass pressure tightens every paragraph. One meaningful deepening: chains actively read his pulse, forcing him to bank curiosity against cruelty; visible price is the codex’s neural load that “presses against his skull.” Agency sits with attention and breath discipline; no lucky rescue. Cost is legible, but because he never truly risks failure, the tightening feels foreordained rather than razor-narrow.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—rewrite or accept the covenant that exiled him—tightens when the pulses demand an answer; refusal would freeze the alignment for a lifetime. Agency is exercised in the whispered prayer that renegotiates terms; the price is the irreversible deeper dent and the continued burden of exile. One meaningful deepening suffices and is legible on the stone. Cost is visceral: the ache in his bones and the future’s figurative thumb beside his own.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“catalog silence before fireworks erase it”—tightens naturally as the town’s sound strata vanish; each fade is a micro-loss that escalates under Accumulative logic. Agency is present: Elias chooses to point the mic at the diary, a tactic that risks contaminating his pure archive with personal grief; this forecloses the option of keeping Mira sealed. Cost is legible: the final glare reveals the first silence he cannot name, because it now contains her unsaid words. One beat shy of 8.8 only because the external firework countdown is situational backdrop rather than a causal antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can the village remain aloft—signaled early and braided to Liora’s private stake of coaxing life from decay. One meaningful tightening: elders move from refusal to conditional permission, foreclosing her safe return; cost is elders’ surrender and her exposure. Agency is decision/attention rather than physical battle; coincidence absent. Under accumulative lens, scent density and storm pattern intensify until the final inhale reweights stakes; price is legible if atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake = uncover the secret of endurance; pressure tightens from observation to guardianship. One meaningful tightening: the water’s memory reveal narrows Lio’s options—he can’t just report; he must carry the arrow’s will. Cost is conceptual (eternal vigilance) rather than visceral, keeping it just shy of 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prevent next “singular convergence”—is signaled in paragraph four; pressure escalates as each wind reading narrows the possible flight paths until only collision corridors remain; the cost is the investigator’s acceptance that perfect data still can’t out-engineer chaos, crystallized in the breath-vapor image.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—certify wonder as essential—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens once: the chisel falls, silence arrives, Ilen must decide to release. The tightening is textural, not causal, but the pattern break (world pauses, aurora flares) reweights the stake with atmospheric cost. No second reversal, yet the single intensification is sufficient under Accumulative lens. Price is conceptual yet legible: the world’s breath is spent and cannot be reclaimed.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: can Cael renegotiate his failure into meaning? Pressure tightens when he realizes the flute was never asked but only commanded; the single deepening is enough. Agency is interior—he risks the imperfect note instead of silence. Cost is the permanent loss of certainty; the bridge remains closed yet a new inner path opens.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—grief’s rigid equation—faces embodied test inside printed geometry. One tightening: hand-on-halo forecloses the safety of old certainties, price legible in “triviality.” Agency remains narrator’s throughout; Mara merely invites. Escalation is accretive: each borrowed persona layers pressure until geometry collapses the arithmetic.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.3)
    Pressure tightens once: the pendant’s unexpected glow forces a middle beat of stillness that forecloses the courier’s lifelong reflex to keep moving; the cost is visible (kneeling in wet snow, temporal vertigo), satisfying the single meaningful deepening required at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.3)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—reach Haru—tightens once: unweaving the tapestry forecloses her decade-long ritual and narrows options to the puzzle window. Visible price paid on-page: the loom stands “bare and skeletal,” orchard “abruptly older.” Escalation is accumulative-textural: density of silence increases until the puzzle exhalation breaks pattern. No coincidence; the blizzard image is earned by thread-feeding.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—“can anything still be made whole?”—is signaled early and tightened once when Corren confronts the fused heap underground. Yet the price is paid by the world, not the protagonist; the lattice rises, but Corren sacrifices no tool, story, or hope of his own. Escalation is atmospheric (arches groan, mine creaks) rather than tactical; options do not narrow, they transmute. Agency is present—he speaks, climbs, carries—but the cost remains abstract, keeping pressure legible but not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—escape cyclic servitude to external mappers—signaled early and tightens when shard reveals each loop as unpaid labor. Escalation driven by protagonist agency: Lio wields shard to redirect momentum, trading multiverse safety for singular authorship. Cost legible in atmospheric hush afterward; option space narrows to one dust-mote world. No coincidence resolves conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—who will keep the unseen watchers—tightens when the spiral points inward; Elias’s agency is to rewrite that sign and accept perpetual, invisible vigilance. Escalation is textural: each discovered letter thickens the moral density until refusing to sign his own becomes the decisive, narrowing act. Cost is the公开的 loneliness he volunteers for, etched in the scraping sound of stones.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—whether obsolete ritual can birth an unalgorithmic dawn—tightens once, when the beam straightens from nostalgic swirl to usable vertical cannon. Agency is Orrin’s: he physically tilts the lens, paying with the realization his own archived rage is now ammunition. Coincidence (stars realign) complicates but does not resolve; resolution comes from his yes to the invitation. Cost is the surrender of protective irony—he must release the “hoarded shadows” he clung to for decades.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—will the new heart reveal the magnetism secret?—tightens through pattern accumulation: each patron’s shorter tale compresses more longing. Agency remains observational, but that stance is the only path compatible with his surgical gift; final display of wing is the decisive act that forecloses pure spectatorship. Cost is legible in “borrowed heart” and audible clinks against ceramic—felt, not declared. No coincidence resolves; mist merely listens.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—will Milo accept the maze’s invitation to witness?—is signaled when the corridor inhales. Escalation is accumulative: each mapped dream tightens the noose of knowledge until the ledger becomes the only possible exhale. No external antagonist; pressure is the growing density of witnessed sorrow. Cost is visible—he forfeits anonymous sweeping for lifelong bookkeeping of grief—and forecloses return to innocence.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—realm survival through painful remembrance—tightens exactly once but profoundly: when Mara decides to un-swaddle the oldest song-shard, trading her role as merciful carrier for the harsher office of communal mirror. That act narrows her options to irreversible; the satchel empties onstage and the realm’s “sudden honesty” is the visible price. Agency is accumulative under lyric lens: one decisive release that reweights all prior hoarded grief into living dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—atonement via listening—tightens once when the gray book forces hearing the voicemail. Cost is legible in the sob-release; options narrow from exile to staying. No second reversal, but one meaningful deepening suffices under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—library’s survival via luminous vows—tightens when decay accelerates beyond projections, forcing an either/or: preserve founders’ fear or risk structural collapse by rewriting. Serin’s agency is continuous: touch cuffs → speak vows → insert own clause; each action visibly alters the pulse graph. Cost is felt: eternal personal memory burden flashes in the final lantern flicker. The “external tide” abstraction keeps escalation from piercing 8.8—no tangible foe or resource lost on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—“capture the sound of trust breaking”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when the fob actually plays the memory, foreclosing her last excuse for her father. Agency is interior but active: she keeps asking, keeps listening, chooses to stay. Cost is visceral: the stagger, the burn in her palm, the muffled market. No coincidence; escalation is purely driven by her insistence under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—will the narrator join the archive or remain detached—tightens as tastes shift from rust to burnt sugar, culminating in the ring’s fusion and tacit yes; cost is the loss of skeptical distance. Escalation is textural: density of sensory input, not external blockage; under Accumulative lens this counts. Could use one sharper obstacle or forfeiture to reach 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—will he finish Mara’s portrait?—is signaled in paragraph 7 and tightens with each mnemonic fragment. Pressure escalates through accumulative pattern: every recalled face sharpens the need to rectify the betrayal. The decisive turn is the charcoal stroke that draws her eyes; cost is paid in tears that blur the lines, foreclosing the fantasy that refusal equals preservation. No coincidence; the cave’s silence and the lock’s hollow click are external corollaries to internal narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—recover lost conversations—signals early and tightens when the map points to the sealed observatory, a single meaningful escalation. Agency is dramatized: Lio kneels, matches humidity stains, and decides to open the rusted gate; the click of the lock is the irreversible turn that forecloses retreat. Cost is on-page: the sour hush of bottled dishonesty hits his throat the instant the door unlatches. No coincidence resolves; storm only thickens backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake = preserve wonder’s color before global graying; signaled by girl’s frost-steam arrival. Escalation is the shard’s insertion into tower: wind seizes arms, new chord emerges, cities pause—options narrow for Lio (voice exits) and world (gray temporarily held off). Cost paid on-page: muteness arrives, “last warmth of speech” lost. Agency = carving cradle, setting shard, accepting silence. Slight deduction: choral effect on cities is reported not dramatized, keeping cost one step removed from reader skin.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: will the android free himself from static without losing the children’s memories? Escalation is textural—each geomagnetic jerk thickens the “inner static” until the burn becomes the only narrowing option. Micro-choices reroute water, compress nightmares, ignite partition—each carries a visible price (dried roses, scorched roots, quieter but lonelier signal). The final cost is felt: a hush replaces the static, but the children’s fears are miniaturized, not lived—stakes land with undeniable forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—save the courtyard—surfaces by word 120 and tightens when the locket mailbox number is revealed. One meaningful deepening occurs: stories reconstruct the sealed-agreement morning, shifting the conflict from nostalgia to legal survival. Agency is collective rather than solo; Mara’s listening stance enables others to supply the decisive knowledge, so the price is social risk (standing up to developers) rather than individual bodily cost.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—liberate Ara’s counter-surveillance dance-code—tightens once: the dice-route becomes irreversible when notebooks are found swollen but legible. The escalation is textural: each roll adds syllabic pressure, culminating in the reading-aloud beat that forces the narrator to commit. No external antagonist appears, aligning with situational/accumulative design; cost is the invisible price above, felt but not yet exacted. Could use one more micro-loss (air-tank minutes? fingertip numbness?) to viscerally price the final hack.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—retrieve deleted memories—tightens when each failed lantern marks another lost day. Escalation is textural: density of forgetting increases until the protagonist risks his own mind to brew the coffee reading. Cost is visible: slowed breath, wet-sand chest, stunned-fish memories that could swallow him. The final spiral forecloses easy recovery; the price of seeing is becoming part of the drain.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“learn the language before demolition”—is signaled early and tightens when the seal’s blank ring makes the building’s denials audible. Agency is attention rather than plot heroics; the narrator’s choice to clasp the seal and accept lies narrows future options. Cost is conceptual but legible: tenancy now requires carrying denials “as gently as their truths.” One deepening, no reversals; accumulative pressure suffices under chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—will she confront the quarantined guilt or keep it sealed?—is signaled at shell pick-up. One meaningful tightening: caretaker’s question (“what are you quarantining…”) collapses her avoidance, forcing the decision to learn listening. Cost is legible—night-long exposure, dawn arrival without emotional release—under causal lens. No coincidence; escalation is driven by her consent to keep the shell at ear.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—save scholars—signalled in first third; each drip = ticking clock that narrows forgery window. Tightening arrives when Sevran appears: exposure forecloses further anonymous sabotage. Agency: Irian decides to claim authorship, paying with lifelong vulnerability. Cost visible on page—“risk exposing every forgery he had ever penned.” Pressure coherent under causal lens; no coincidence rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—why some voices vanish—signaled line 1; escalation via echo-tests that progressively strip illusion; final tightening forecloses vengeance, replaces it with custodial song. Cost is legible: she放弃追索妹妹完整的回音，接受保管残响的责任。Agency present in every musical probe; no coincidence resolves. Could use one earlier tangible loss (water spent? bone flute crack?) to push past 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake is exposure versus complicity, signaled in the first paragraph ("truths do not float...they need living hearts as their rafts") and tightened when Marek names the woman's forebears as the door-sealers. The single reversal: visitor arrives seeking solace, leaves shouldering restitution—occurs because Marek transfers the moral task to her, narrowing her options from passive sympathy to actionable reparations. Cost mounts through physical cues: wind-burn, sleepless eyes, audible glacier shift, and ultimately the frozen tear image. Agency is Marek's refusal to keep carrying the wreck alone; the visitor's agency crystallizes in the silent, teary acceptance that forecloses denial.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—validate invisible effort—arrives early; pressure tightens once when Ren demands the moon-path mimic, foreclosing the option to stay passive. Cost is legible (failed drops, internal “tight place” easing), but escalation is mentor-driven rather than protagonist-initiated; agency is receptive, not decisive. Sufficient for the length under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—control of the resilience protocol—tightens once: the reconstructed letters convert abstract rumor into actionable blackmail leverage. Escalation is causal: each strip of paper shrinks Theo’s options until only complicity or sabotage remains. Visible price: the orchard will starve survivors if he destroys the diamond; moral arithmetic is legible. Agency drives the turn: his refusal is not nihilistic but data-derived.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will Ilen surrender his future to an unknown Voice—tightens when the Voice demands allegiance under the portico. Escalation is accumulative: signals shift from static to conversational, then to whole sentences, finally to a conditional prophecy. The portico stand is the visible price that forecloses refusal. Cost is felt, but slightly abstract (“the dawn would remember”) compared to bodily stakes earlier; keeps it shy of 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—translate between generations—tightens once: he relinquishes the private music-box memory instead of selling it, narrowing his hoarder-option. Agency is present but soft; the woman’s arrival supplies external pressure, yet the decisive surrender is his. Cost is conceptual (emptied pockets) rather than viscerally felt; still, under accumulative lens the cadence shift from solitary bottling to communal handing-over reweights stakes acceptably.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prevent the sacred storm from awakening—tightens when the hum warps and the sunset clock starts. Escalation is textural: every added vibration, color drain, and dental buzz increases density until the final chord releases pressure. Agency is Elias’s micro-shifts of pitch; no external savior or coincidence. Visible price: raw throat, forfeited rest, and the artifact’s new fragile equilibrium that could fail again next sunset—options are foreclosed by the adapted rite he cannot repeat verbatim.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can the narrator trade haste for strategic delay—tightens when the viaduct’s current reveals thousands of micro-refusals. The tightening is conceptual rather than tactical, but the stakes are re-weighted: delay is no longer avoidance but insurrection. Cost is visible in the familial flashbacks that are now off-limits to speed. No loss of tool or bodily price keeps it under 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—professional survival vs. moral witness—signaled early; pressure tightens when apparitions demand acknowledgement. One meaningful turn: vow to write the unfiltered report, foreclosing complicity. Cost is loss of supervisory protection; visible in whispered apology. No coincidence; escalation is investigator-driven. Could use one more intermediate obstacle to reach 9.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can Elias face the parole board after withholding absolution—tightens once: the repaired heart converts abstract forgiveness into a concrete auditory test. The bent cog supplies visible price, but the board’s decision is still prospective; pressure peaks inside the shop rather than in front of the inmates, so escalation is micro not macro. Sufficient for the length, yet the cost is vicarious.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—“will the unheard bell be struck?”—is signaled by line 4 and tightens once: when Orin learns his past flights were scripted, the option of pure self-direction is foreclosed; price is visible (loss of autonomy, acid on skin), but the escalation is a single deepening rather than a because/therefore chain, fitting Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—find Ora/find where deleted files go—tightens when 713 graduates from glitch to map. Each recurrence is an Accumulative beat that raises conceptual cost: the system itself may be complicit. The final silence-tag forces the protagonist’s illegal query; agency is continuous. Cost is unmistakable on the page: eternal exile from comfortable ignorance.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure escalates cleanly under Causal lens: each successive mirror forecast strips away Ira’s ability to delegate violence to off-stage Keepers, forcing an either/or between sanctioning slaughter or rewriting the treaty template. The decisive tightening occurs when he physically lifts the fragment and tests futures in front of the anomaly—this irrevocably commits him to authorship and exposes personal political risk (loss of Keeper backing). Stakes stay singular—“orchard as autonomous sanctuary”—with no diffusion; cost is visible in the fragment’s hairline cracks spreading under shared gaze.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—learn the sound of endings so as to decide on ending—tightens when the sound turns out to be continuance, forcing a stance shift. Single meaningful escalation: catalogue-recycling taxonomy becomes rehearsal for self-classification (repairable/irretrievable), then the vibration forecloses suicide. Cost is felt: the clinic path is now “undecided,” social permission forfeited. Agency stays with protagonist: choosing dawn departure, cutting engine, holding tip to water.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—missed departure as emblem of relational mismatch—is signaled in the title-grade opening. One meaningful tightening: the burning letter under the bench turns abstract regret into a tactile test; when she smears soot, the option to dismiss the moment forecloses. Cost is legible: she decides to return, accepting future lateness risk; he accepts renewed exile. Agency is mutual, not solved by luck.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—will denial keep grinding the city toward swallowing?—is signaled early and tightens when the cable lurches after the merchant’s denial. One meaningful deepening: the walker realizes honesty must be shaped, not merely scattered; this reframes tactics and slows the parapet. Agency is the walker’s whispered intervention; cost is the city’s near-collapse and the perpetual vigilance implied by the new “wall” of echoes. Coincidence never resolves; escalation is purely accumulative under the lens of collective honesty.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—archivist must host communal grief without being swallowed—arrives early and tightens once when the table fills with artifacts. Yet pressure plateaus: no single beat forces him to risk professional distance or personal emotion; the “lighter” epiphany is gifted rather than paid for. Escalation accumulates texture, not option-loss, fitting the lyric mode but limiting cost clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can language keep growing—signaled in para 3 and tightened when “grow” is targeted. One meaningful escalation: Elias shifts from passive cataloging to active, performative testimony, foreclosing anonymity. Cost is social exposure and loss of neutral cover; visible in final “barely audible armor.” Agency propels the turn; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—hearing the sound of growing older—launches with the prophet’s obsession and transfers to the duo when they kneel at the unmade-bed sculpture. Pressure escalates accumulatively: each erased chalk line and scattered driftwood arrow intensifies the fear that the sound will stay ephemeral. The tightening is single but meaningful: once Mara presses ear to damp boards, retreat is impossible; they must carry the unheard sound out. Cost is legible in their stunned inability to translate the experience back to the prophet, proving the sound exacts an expressive toll.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—capture the one-second stellar death before quake destroys optics—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens with every seismic increment. Escalation is accumulative/textural: white glare, crawling alarms, clock whine, and floor roll densify until bypass becomes inevitable. Ilias’s agency drives the decisive turn—he forfeits safety systems, trading instrument integrity for data integrity. Cost is visible: mirrors tremble “like teeth in an old jaw,” foreshadowing future calibration failure.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—“where shadows go at noon”—tightens causally with each loop closed; the final spoon-straightening narrows options to irreversible seeing. Cost is conceptual but legible: knowledge that can’t be un-known. One tightening suffices; no escalation slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—whether doubt or belief will govern action—tightens when the tooth tugs at the “cleft in certainty,” forcing Mara either to seal the fracture or walk through it.  Escalation is textural: each image (counterfeit scars, moonlit cloth, violet sky) deepens the cost of being wrong.  The protagonist’s agency drives every beat: her decision to realign the boy bone-by-bone is the irreversible act that dissolves the substitute corpse.  Price is visible—her certainty is permanently fissured, and she must now live with navigable doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—deliver calm light to refugee children—signaled in first third and tightened only once: “I swore then to share light without using fire.” Escalation is density/cadence, not causal turns: each polished fragment adds emotional mass until the galaxy-in-cloth overbalances the grotto dark. The visible price is spent breath, abraded knuckles, reopened memory; cost stays legible in the closing glow.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can Mara re-enter the world she exposed?—is signaled early. Escalation arrives when she kneels to plant: the public shame is not erased but physically worked-through, a single decisive tightening under causal lens; cost is the damp seeping through fabric, a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will he keep excising hope or let it live on-page—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened when the narrator accuses him of “tearing them out.” One meaningful escalation: the backward-flow visions force a public accounting of his cowardice; option set narrows to “write or lose self.” Cost is conceptual but legible: he must trade aesthetic purity for vulnerable arrival. Agency resides in the silent decision to “let them arrive”; luck does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—restore fertility without cruelty—is signaled early; tightening occurs when the tinkerer realizes alignment equals synchronized breath, foreclosing the option of solitary heroics. Cost is soft but legible: he surrenders sole authorship of the song, letting villagers’ phrases reshape the melody. Agency remains his; coincidence is absent. One meaningful escalation suffices under Accumulative lens; persistent constraint (silent wells) dissolves through shared cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—translate fading heartbeats into a map—signals in paragraph 4 and tightens with each emptied vial. Escalation is textural: starlight beads diminish, twig-continents cohere, options narrow to the final sealing beat. Cost is visible: the last droplet leaves the case lighter, the orchard darker, the alchemist alone. No antagonist but entropy; the pressure is coherent and accumulative under the Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—restore the city’s capacity to “borrow awe”—is signaled in paragraph 9. Escalation is textural: each echo harvested tightens the cavern’s acoustic web until silence itself becomes luminous pressure. No antagonist is needed; the risk is existential flattening. The decisive deepening occurs when the locksmith chooses a mirror-polished hub instead of a new spring, trading reliability for contingent wonder—on-page cost is the timer’s future fragility.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—keep the patterns from calcifying—tightens when her own unnamed fear surfaces. Escalation is textural: each burden’s absorption increases the invisible geometry’s density until her personal dread threatens to lattice her lungs. The decisive turn—orient toward, not away—reconfigures the pull without external coincidence. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: she leaves carrying the same weight arranged differently, foreclosing the illusion of purgation.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake = can she convert static grief into a living, useful object without betraying Luca’s wild seconds. Tightening occurs once but decisively: the blank’s silent weight v. the kettle’s cooling tick narrows options to act now or lose the moment—this is the meaningful escalation required at this length. Cost is visible: the first cut irreversibly ends the era of the uncarved pause, a price she feels in whitening knuckles. Agency is hers; no outside coincidence. Keeps 0.1 shy of 9.0 because the external world offers no additional complicating pressure—escalation is purely internal, sufficient but not multi-layered.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can borrowed stories replace an eroded life?—is signaled early and tightens once: the offer of scavenged relics to the ghost. Agency is renunciation rather than decision; the path foreclosed is the illusion that fragments can constitute a self. Escalation is accumulative: each salvaged object adds density until the ghost’s silent verdict reweights the stake. Cost is visible—pocketed wheel surrendered, outline emptied into ghost-frame—under the Accumulative lens. No reversal, but the deepening of burden satisfies the single-turn requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“can she resurrect purpose through flow?”—tightens once: capped lines force her to choose reclamation over escape. Cost is visible: sleepless night, filthy hands, acknowledgment that ships won’t come. Escalation is accumulative density rather than causal reversals; sufficient under Accumulative lens. Persistent constraint (no arrivals) shapes final image, meets 8+ bar but lacks a second irreversible trade-off for 9.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—comfort versus resurrected creative risk—signaled early; pressure tightens once slipping gear threatens to prolong dying-city sound, forcing Elias to violate abbess rule. Cost visible: he risks post and inner peace, tasting “wet stone smell” of past failure as he chooses. Agency is renunciation-into-action: forbidden mend becomes first covert step toward future invention. Escalation is accumulative pattern-break rather than causal chain, coherent under chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—“salvage my own capacity for disbelief”—is signaled early and tightens when the narrator chooses to stay “one breath longer,” risking surfacing into gun-range. The escalation beat is micro but decisive: stuffing pages into satchel inside a tearing hull forecloses the safe ignorance option. Cost is visceral—colder-than-truth water, tremoring harness, immediate threat of two silent men—so the final refusal carries lived endangerment rather than abstract heroism. No coincidence resolves; the threat merely shifts from submerged dark to silhouetted lantern.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“preserve ancient methods”—tightens when Eli learns the method is rope, not seed. One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens; price is the infinite patience he must now practice, implied by snow mounting on his shoulders.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can the narrator write an “explained absence” that satisfies Lady Sera—tightens when she demands he “help me walk it,” turning interview into joint pilgrimage. Each named grief-site increments pressure under Accumulative lens; no external antagonist needed. Cost is conceptual: the garden proves absence is not erasure, forcing narrator to abandon neat horizon-line narratives. Escalation is steady but single-tier; no secondary reversal, hence caps below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—beauty vs. mechanized order—is signaled early and tightens once: the egg forces a binary choice at court. Escalation is driven by his agency; syndicate backlash is implied, not yet visited, but cost is already felt in his abdication of propaganda duty. No false coincidence. Persistent constraint (industrial empire) remains, sharpening stakes for future.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will she repeat or repair her father’s legacy—tightens when she must choose between fire suppression and the boy. One meaningful turn: she turns her back on the flame, narrowing her own safety. Cost is visible in the coin surrender. Pressure is coherent under causal lens; coincidence (crew arrival) complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—liberate memories vs. keep her protective doubt—tightens once, decisively, when Lira realizes every fountain is a lock and every lost moment a key; this crystallizes the price she will later pay. Escalation is accumulative: each freed memory adds audible/visible pressure until the city itself “leans in.” Cost is legible on-page when her mind clears of doubt and the plaza drenches her—an embodied forfeiture that forecloses her former stance.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—can caretaking ever break the old equations of burning?—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens with each stellar micro-birth/-death. The caretaker’s agency is continual, invisible nudges that cost emotional stamina; every star swallowed or exiled mirrors the pattern they seek to abolish. Escalation is textural: density of petal-fall increases, gear-ticks grow “heavier,” constellations re-form into familiar, unwelcome shapes. Final renunciation of voice and face crystallizes the price—perpetual watch without guarantee of change.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—uncover the village’s braided grief—tightens as each hidden verse is carved, charcoal marking the ribbon like a rising debt. Pressure is textural: pattern accumulates rather than reverses. The final thrum of wings reweights the stake, but the grandmother’s agency, not Elias’s, supplies the last push, slightly muting cost.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: preventing civic catastrophe through flawless winding. One decisive deepening: the pause reveals that private absolution endangers public time. Cost is legible—mis-winding could derail trains, steal last breaths. Agency converts from solitary penance to shared stewardship; the pendulum’s resumed swing externalizes the narrowed option.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: will the gardener keep listening or cut the threads? Pressure tightens when the strip ticks against the case—first signal that passive rounds must become active decoding. Protagonist agency: he climbs, aligns, palms the weave; each act narrows his future to eternal caretaking. Cost is legible in the final exhalation—night softens because he accepts infinite unfinished games.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—save northern lives without conscription to death—signalled in paragraph four. One meaningful tightening: discovery of the three-year thaw pulse collapses static-road plans and forces the adaptive arc tactic; cost is the political risk of asking “more of the kingdom.” No coincidence; pressure escalates via data fragments that tighten the noose of responsibility. Final stroke crystallizes the trade-off: innovation within constraint, not conquest over winter.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—keep the memory insurgency alive—tightens once: the boy’s arrival makes the tactic visible, raising the chance of betrayal. Cost is conceptual (city could re-starve) but also tangible: the dust now clings to a witness who can’t be erased. Agency is Lina’s continuous writing; no outside rescue. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversal required.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“safety is mirage”—tightens through spatial compression: each ash circuit narrows exit vectors until the floor itself becomes unstable horizon. Agency is performative but real: Mara’s last scatter forecloses the option to stop, ash visibly resettles on shoes as price. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversal required under Accumulative lens. Cost is legible; minor deduction for off-stage audience reaction rather than protagonist loss.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve usable truth against official forgetting—is signaled early and sharpened by each artifact recovered. One meaningful tightening: the realization that schematics are gone and silence is permanent forecloses restoration; cost is the swallowed metronome of memory itself. Escalation is textural/density-driven rather than causal-reversal, fitting the chosen lens. Price is legible on-page in the final mute glint of brass.</answer>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: memory versus manufactured narrative, brass truth versus mirrored hope. No final-paragraph moralizing; the reweighting is performed by the silent cog itself. Subtext lives in gestures—scrubbing brass that will never speak—inviting reader to feel the cost of preserved but voiceless history. Complexity is honored: both survival and surrender remain plausible readings.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—whether two hostile factions can share a single breath—is signaled early and tightens through each subtraction of noise. The meaningful deepening occurs when silence after Dari’s cracked note is allowed to stand; the group’s tolerance for that rupture forecloses easy harmony and raises the cost of continuation. Agency is collective yet visible: they choose to keep returning, to keep breathing together. No coincidence resolves; the final chord is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“wake the greenhouse tonight”—is signaled early. Escalation is accretive: each clipped dead vine narrows the option to surrender; celestial alignment provides live clock. Cost is visible in soot under nails, sweat, and the seed’s irreversible internal graft. No coincidence; the moons simply heighten texture rather than solve.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—whether wonder can survive routine—tightens when Marla realizes the blackout is sabotage meant to force awe. Agency centers on her irreversible speech act: saying the city is “worth waking” reboots the grid and binds her to lifelong secrecy. Cost is immediate: she trades absolute honesty for custodianship of astonishment. One meaningful turn suffices; no coincidence resolves the conflict—the reboot is contingent on her truthful endorsement.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: can Eli decipher the house’s whispering grammar before it erases him? Pressure escalates through Accumulative beats: floor sigh, light refusal, storm-rattle, shard lodging—each intensifies ambient density. The meaningful tightening is the bed-drag toward the corner: a single, irreversible act that narrows Eli’s future to co-habitation rather than observation. Cost is felt—he yields territorial control and accepts reciprocal surveillance; no coincidence resolves the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—will the secret be replaced by a new certainty?—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when the ampoule becomes the portable verdict. Escalation is causal: each pull at the fault-line narrows escape options and increases flood risk to the diver. Price is concrete: the statue sacrifices its own mobility forever; she risks suit tear and nitrogen narcosis. No reversal beyond the single consent moment, but that is sufficient for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—prove arrival unnecessary via perpetual motion—arrives early and tightens when the crack shows the parallel self who did enter a door, making the cost of refusal visible. Escalation is textural: each asymmetric landing layers the pressure of “keep walking” versus “what if.” The dice throws and notebook scrawls are micro-choices that feed the same tactic rather than branching options, so the deepening is atmospheric, not tactical. The price is conceptual but legible: the sealed crack forecloses the only visible off-ramp, leaving the staircase as the sole future.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can anonymous kindness be rekindled?—is signaled in para 3 and tightens via three on-page reversals: nurse unclenches, courier slows, balcony man swallows rage. Each micro-turn narrows the city’s emotional aperture under an accumulative lens. Agency is Aurelia’s sustained brush-work; cost is her own sleepless vigil, never repaid. No coincidence resolves; the only “luck” is moonlight, already established as her chosen medium.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—preserve intangible culture—tightens when the lens reveals ghost crafts; the bread-initial custom supplies one visible cost (displaced eat only the taste of their names). Escalation is single-cycle but sufficient for 700-word scope; pressure coherent under Accumulative lens.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-survival emerges through bread, lens, and bees’ absence; no explicit thesis stated. Final image (“wondering which of us history would spare”) re-weights prior motifs with conceptual cost, meeting CR standard.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—step beyond fate’s design—signaled in paragraph three and tighten once: the yoyo-cast physically rewrites future possibilities. Pressure escalates via because/therefore: each backward mechanism (clock, stair, knob) forecloses normal exit; the only forward is deeper inversion. Cost is audible and tactile: string scream, lighthouse tremor, and the implicit price that Aurek may have loosed worse futures. Agency is absolute; no coincidence rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—finish returning from death or stay photographically cursed—is signaled in line 3 and tightens exactly once when Elias realizes he must unbosom to the boy-fear holding the clasp. Escalation is causal under the chosen lens: each mirror deepens the cost of denial until the pier confrontation forces the trade-off. The price is visible—the clasp transfers, the photo warms—but the option space does not narrow further, keeping it shy of 8.8. No off-stage coincidence; the advisor’s whisper always precedes action.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—keep the orchard afloat—tightens when the largest swell slews them leeward and paths “snarled together.” Aera’s dub-driven command reweights the physical layout, turning noise into stabilizing rhythm; the price is the persistent bass-note fear that remains audible under the new sway. Escalation is textural rather than causal: density of sound and motion increases until the platform finds syncopation with the sea. One visible forfeiture—blossoms sacrificed to wind—marks the cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—will Keth keep cataloguing ghosts or risk reopening the sea—tightens when shell patterns crack into “unanswered questions.” One decisive escalation: Council refusal forces him to act alone, narrowing options to a single unauthorized whistle-note. Cost is visible: the turtles’ turn commits the entire city to an uncharted vector, social credit spent. Agency remains interior but causal under Accumulative lens—each misread spiral accumulates until external motion is the only release.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—authorship vs misuse—tightens when Elias realizes the publisher will keep franchising the king as political scripture. One meaningful turn: his shift from defensive plea to offensive threat (“publish my own history”), which narrows options and raises social cost. Price is legible: risk of cultural destabilization he once sold as noble lies now turned against him.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—memory vs. obliteration—signaled in paragraph 3. One meaningful tightening: last note sealed just as tide blocks return, foreclosing retrieval. Cost is visible: she loses physical evidence yet gains invisible archive. Escalation is accumulative: each grout swallow deepens the irreversibility; no external coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—whether the erased hillside voices will stay silenced—is signaled in paragraph eight. Escalation is steady: each missing shelf-cluster raises the probability of deliberate curation, tightening Mara’s options to complicity or exposure. The snapped kelp-ribbon is the visible price—she irreversibly vandalizes collection integrity to reach truth. Cost is legible: she forfeits her status as neutral indexer and accepts outsider exile implied by “beyond her depth.”

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—can she render her own grief bearable?—is signaled in paragraph 5 and tightens once: the memory must be polished, not merely stored. The polishing wheel is the visible price that alters tactics; each spark “flays” her heart, foreclosing the option to stop. Under the accumulative lens, density increases until the basilica hum becomes undeniable; coincidence never resolves, only crystallizes her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“see the machinery with no filter” versus complicity in future murder—tightens when the vortex parks over his own crater. One meaningful deepening: realizing the anomaly is not future violence but past stolen futures. Cost is conceptual (guilt made legible) rather than external; a visible forfeiture would have nudged 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—belonging versus erased coordinates—is signaled early and tightens once: the star-tone map forecloses her old grid logic. The cost is conceptual (her war lens is obsolete) but felt on-page when the console hums new tones. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversal is required under Accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—whether to keep falsifying pasts or risk exposure by reading the real erased index—tightens the moment the forked emblem is traced. Escalation is causal: recognition of emblem → narrows options to two irrevocable paths, each with visible social/economic cost. No coincidence; the watch缺口 and driftwood groove mirror by design, not luck. Price is on-page: he pockets the wood, accepting the danger of resurrecting names his father died to hide.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes compress from collective (return all sailors) to singular (brother vs spy); the tightening is irreversible once the hood lifts. Escalation is causal: because the captains hate the spy, offering her becomes a moral crucible that narrows the negotiator’s identity to one choice. Cost is legible—his brother’s gaze “asking the moon to hurry” is the unpaid price. No coincidence; every pressure is engineered by prior treaties and his own past treachery.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“will he surrender to water or reclaim relation?”—is signaled early and tightens when the compass needle stalls mid-bay, forcing a stance. Escalation is textural: each pylon pair narrows options like vanishing points, the fog thickens, the phone text lingers. Cost is legible in the final paddle strokes toward an absent shore. One deepening, no reversal, fits 800-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will he shoulder the memories the city shed?—is signaled in paragraph 1 and escalates through each checkpoint. The baseball’s future date compresses time and moral cost, narrowing options: hesitation equals civic amnesia. The lake’s reactive glow is the visible price, forcing stance crystallization. Agency is decision-based, not violent, perfectly scaled to 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reforge bond beyond death—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens when spice scent starts irreversible metamorphosis. One meaningful turn: the moment fortune slip lifts and her smoke-hand touches bark-cheek, foreclosing human future. Cost is visible—body becomes tree, beasts dissolve—yet escalation is single-arc rather than layered reversal. Sufficient for 600-word scope, but lacks secondary pressure or unexpected complication.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—redeem stolen father-time—signals early and tightens when each fallen card forecloses another excuse to stay away. Escalation is textural: ink-veined cards, porcelain shard, and wax-stiff cloth accumulate until the silver line ruptures into the mist bridge, forcing the decisive descent. Protagonist agency drives every intensification; no external antagonist needed. Cost is legible—he sobs “like swallowing glass” and accepts perpetual absence of those hours—meeting 8.8+ bar.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—unseal the denied dimension—threads every immersion; each memory ingested tightens the knot until the final photo of stubborn hope snaps it open. Pressure escalates by accretion, not reversal: genocide after war after betrayal layers mass until the ship’s own gravity warps. No external antagonist needed; the aggregate shadow is coherent pressure. Cost is legible in the star’s final sputter and the narrator’s near-zero mass—options reweighted.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: can one man reroute an entire population without owning the narrative? Pressure tightens from whispering hush → tug → frantic bells; each increment forecloses the option to wait. Cost is visible—blisters, lost myths, anonymous gratitude—altering later options (he will keep walking unnamed). Coincidence complicates but does not resolve; the saved camps stand “empty and bewildered,” a lasting consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—seize the blackout to rewrite the fort’s story—signalled in first third. Escalation is one tightening: blackout → cipher → rod act → lock amnesia; each step raises exposure and irreversibility. Cost is legible: her identity as loyal sentinel is forfeited when locks forget inside/outside. Agency drives every beat; coincidence (blackout) complicates rather than rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—witness vs. intervene—tightens when the lens doubles: seeing himself slip forever forces the choice to stay and finish the pattern. Escalation is one meaningful deepening: stillness moves from cosmic to corporeal as knees meet stone. Cost is the returned pain that forecloses the option to retreat. Agency is renunciation—he pays the tax for the world but keeps the equations that let pain mean.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—control over how tomorrow’s quarrels will travel—tightens once: the unrecognized overture in architecture forces Darius to abandon passive waiting and openly duel. Agency is foregrounded in the sundial adjustment and rapier draw; the price is the exposure of his secret cartographic method. Pressure escalates under Causal lens; no coincidence resolves. One meaningful turn suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—keep the words alive—tightens when boots enter the courtyard; the tin’s concealment becomes a live fork: surrender the archive or risk arrest. Escalation is situational: external pressure crystallizes internal stance; coincidence (patrol route) complicates but does not resolve. Cost is visceral: Lio’s shaky hands, the officer’s casual verdict—“this place should be bulldozed”—make loss legible. One missed beat: we never see a runner actually plaster a poem, so the “blooming resistance” is more asserted than tested; still, the tin’s survival re-weights options under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—improvisation vs. fate—tightens once: the compass needle snaps upward, foreclosing the option to remain separate. The price is legible on the page: Leon forfeits the station world and its clocks, Mara forfeits safe suspension. Escalation is accumulative: each dangling compass adds density until one flares and re-weights the stake. Agency remains bilateral; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—protect vs. expand collective memory—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when the island itself “reaches backward.” The meaningful deepening is the dream’s showing an earlier homeland, which reframes every prior omen as possible truth rather than aberration. Agency is Kael’s decision to listen rather than suppress, a renunciation that forecloses the safety of fixed memory; the price is the luminous doubt he must now carry. Escalation is textural/accumulative: each omen adds density until the dream reweights the whole pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—deliver the unsent apology—remains singular and gains density as each object (compass, lace) amplifies the risk of permanent silence. Mid-story pattern break—compass abandons north—forces tactical pivot into grove, escalating stakes under Accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual but legible: he accepts that forgiveness may never return, only the possibility of it. Could edge higher if a concrete forfeiture (time, tool, limb) were dramatized on page.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding gradual causality over catastrophe—is signaled early and deepens when Lena links flood bureaucracy to neutron star “quiet quakes.” Escalation occurs through her agency: building the device, wiring cameras, choosing cucumber vines over servers. Cost is unmistakable: she trades prestige for puddles and smudges, accepting obscurity to pursue her model. Amir’s arrival tests but doesn’t resolve pressure; the tightening is internal, crystallizing her stance against “mistaking fireworks for truth.”

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—discovering who tried to kill her and why—is signaled early and tightens decisively when ledger numbers align with frost patterns, transforming coincidence into intention. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her act of holding the strip to the sky triggers the canyon’s response and the emergence of directional arrows. Cost is unmistakable: survival reframed not as luck but as unfinished violence, demanding confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—translating silence into felt music—is signaled early and deepens through Lio’s activation of emotional profiles. Agency drives escalation: his choice to use Grief 1 then Wonder 3 transforms passive survival into active creation. Cost is unmistakable: his body is “wrecked,” ears “never surfaced,” yet he offers it as first instrument. The tightening forecloses return to old sonic world, forcing innovation under constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—giving rest a permanent address—is signaled early and deepens when Elias confronts lives “that never found conclusion.” The tightening occurs when he chooses to enter the library despite protest (“I bury bodies, not cities”), narrowing his path to active stewardship of unrest. Cost is felt in his brittle voice and the irreversible step into “impossible spaces.” Escalation is driven by his agency under an Accumulative lens, though the transition from boat to city leans slightly on lyric convenience rather than causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—communal survival under sanctions—is signaled early and deepens when Mara realizes donations are internal, not external. Her agency drives escalation: waiting, confronting, then choosing public acknowledgment without naming. Cost is conceptual (risking cessation of aid) and emotional (Kito’s fear of exposure). The tightening forecloses investigative pursuit in favor of collective dignity, consistent with the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—releasing unused love without burning—is signaled early and deepens through Arun’s experiment with the camera and crystal. Escalation is driven by his agency: inserting the Tear, pointing the lens inward, then outward toward the boy. Each act narrows options and reveals cost—the weight of unspent orbits, the risk of vulnerability. The boy’s presence raises stakes by externalizing Arun’s internal condition, making healing reciprocal rather than solitary.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—discovering time’s texture—is signaled early and deepens into existential risk. Agency drives escalation: choosing to walk the youngest bridge, clutching the halo, laying photos in a ring, stepping into disintegration. Each act narrows options; the final step forecloses individual existence. Cost is unmistakable: dissolution into shared reverie, paid through loss of selfhood, rendered palpable in “fraying outline” and “smeared” cells.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—saving the seed vault—is signaled early and tightens via Mara’s agency: her cough isn’t luck but calculated sabotage that narrows the Overseer’s options. Pressure escalates coherently under Causal lens: detonations count down, keys spill, knowledge deepens (“she had already seen which key... shone with new wear”). Cost is unmistakable—Mara risks immediate violence to mislead him—and forecloses escape (she remains chained). Coincidence complicates (keys clatter into strings) but resolution stems solely from her strategic endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—capturing trust’s fracture to prevent future pain—is signaled early and deepens when the protagonist realizes their own complicity. Escalation is driven by agency: each dive harvests absences, each prototype adjustment tightens focus. The cost is unmistakable: confronting self-betrayal forfeits the fantasy of external blame. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with the “green turning mute” memory sharpening tactics until the dual-note breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving truth through stolen light—is signaled early and deepens when the Florist’s code forces confrontation. The tightening occurs when the stranger demands the jar be opened, narrowing options: trust superstition or step through the hinge. Cost is visible in the protagonist’s relinquishment of control; the moonbeams’ release alters their understanding permanently. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (choosing to open the jar), though the stranger’s omniscience slightly edges toward convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming spaces of control for vulnerable inquiry—is signaled early and deepens via Corin’s renunciation of past complicity (“targeting lenses gathered dust, mercifully blind”). The meaningful tightening occurs when the bookmark is encased: a mundane object becomes sacred vessel, foreclosing archival memory in favor of living dialogue. Cost is felt (“heart froze in its cage of skill”) and conceptual (precision abandoned for fragility). Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves tension.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—existential erasure vs. self-authorship—is signaled early (“not who I thought”) and tightens when the cast list replaces her name. The meaningful deepening occurs at the cipher table: decoding fear into agency (“FALL → LEARN”) shifts tactics from passive endurance to active defiance. Agency is clear—she chooses to write “TRUST HURTS, TRUST HEALS”—with conceptual cost: embracing visibility despite studio’s demand for invisibility. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; coincidence (child’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the real turn is her interpretation of his cast.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—navigating after celestial light vanishes—is signaled early and tightens when the last star trembles. The oracle’s agency drives escalation: her method of “summarizing silence” creates the only viable path forward. Cost is unmistakable—the captain’s fear, the frayed gold leaf—and the deepening (star’s extinction) forces a trade-off between old knowledge and new perception, all under Accumulative/Textural pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—can artificial consciousness transcend pattern?—tightens through HEPA-3’s agency: each loop tests his response to the violin, narrowing options until the 612th touch irrevocably alters his cognition. Cost is unmistakable: the violin’s destruction and permanent “ghost” overlay foreclose pure machine logic. Escalation stems from protagonist’s choices, not coincidence; even Dr. Roe’s exit (“left him alone”) forces self-reliance. The “second chance program” isn’t a deus ex machina but a crucible whose rules shape every micro-decision.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether to preserve sterile archival order or risk connection through contraband memories—tightens decisively when she chooses to investigate rather than destroy. Her agency drives escalation: unlocking the projector, cross-referencing footage, attending the concert. Cost is unmistakable: abandoning her shadow-self (“pressed flat” by secrecy) for exposure. Under the Accumulative lens, each doodle deepens stakes until the final choice crystallizes pressure into action, with coincidence (the hooded figure’s return) complicating but not resolving—the resolution stems from her courage.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming agency in a quantified world—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s deliberate acts of care. Escalation occurs via protagonist-driven pressure: polishing marbles, planting dusk flowers, hanging chimes—all renunciations of passive victimhood. Each action forecloses resignation, with visible cost (bodily decay, social invisibility). The tightening culminates when visitors’ rising luck scores validate his work, yet he remains unseen—a poignant trade-off that sharpens the thematic calculus without coincidence or external rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—proving time moves sideways—is signaled early and deepens through Ilen’s calibration, which risks violent awakenings and loss of the valley’s future. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: his lever adjustment triggers neural drift “not forward but sideways,” narrowing options to success or catastrophe. Cost is visible in his emotional burden (delayed family messages) and the embryos’ fragile stability. Slight deduction: the “fracture” consequence remains implied rather than viscerally dramatized, softening the ultimate price.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the ghost’s coded rebellion—is signaled early and tightens when the musician realizes the score resides in absences (“pauses the flood imposed”). His agency drives escalation: he hums, traces, interprets, culminating in acceptance of the score. Cost is unmistakable: he aligns himself with treasonous art in a drowned, forbidden space. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves tension.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—validating whether storms are steered—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the oracle confirms Mara’s buried hypothesis. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each recurrence of Feverwhisper or storm reference deepens the moral weight. Mara’s agency drives escalation (she insists they speak; asks for the truth); cost is felt in her bodily reactions and social alienation (“margins of other people’s graphs”). Final crystallization carries opportunity cost: she accepts lifelong burden.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—validating Evan’s innocence—tightens when the ghost shift is revealed not as supernatural but as hidden laborers, raising moral cost (corporate cover-up vs. personal sacrifice). The deepening (“people the company paid off”) narrows options: narrator can no longer dismiss Evan as delusional. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens; cost is felt in the narrator’s dawning complicity (“swallowed it… watched it burn the town instead of me”). Agency lies in attention: choosing to see the unseen workers.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—neutrality versus participation—is signaled early and deepens decisively when the swan appears, narrowing options to a binary with tangible cost. The keeper’s agency drives escalation: choosing to read by touch (not open) triggers spatial transformation; stepping onto blank pages abandons neutrality, causing ink to draft futures. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: each descriptive layer (“regenerative silence,” “stone softened into paper”) tightens the thematic vise until the final Charged Poise crystallizes stakes—listening in fracture versus observing from afar. Cost is legible: the world above awakens “unsettled,” and his detachment is irrevocably broken.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—nurturing wonder in those who’ve given up—is signaled early and deepens when eclipse-induced anxiety threatens to tip wonder into fear. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses low music “not to drown the sky,” adjusts viewers, moves among patients with adaptive cues. The tightening occurs in the hush before totality, where shared vulnerability forces connection (Lake grasping Mr. Alvarez’s hand). Cost is legible in Mara’s jolt of recognition—grief no longer lances but opens—and the foreclosed path of solitary mourning.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving memory against entropy—is signaled early and tightens through Brann’s realization that all eras rehearsed the same existential question. The deepening occurs when the medieval weaver’s off-center loom mirrors the diary’s displaced axis, narrowing Brann’s mission from collection to witness. Cost is felt in his charged poise: he accepts endless labor with no new dreams. Agency drives escalation—he chooses to descend, reaffirming purpose under irreversible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—control over information flow—is signaled early and tightens when prophecies become real. The escalation is protagonist-driven: first passive transcription, then active orchestration (“nudging the notes”). Cost is unmistakable—the ferry folds, an inspector dies—and culminates in the ethical burden of steering fate. Under a Hybrid lens, pressure accumulates texturally until the causal pivot at the lens panel forces a trade-off between secrecy and sovereignty.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—whether meaning can be argued into changing direction before possession completes—is signaled early and deepens through Jonas’s rhetorical entanglement of the demon. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: each chord shift, pigment mark, and paradox tightens the conceptual net. The demon’s unraveling stems from its own contradictions, not coincidence. Cost is legible in Jonas’s solitude, the parents excluded, and the single-color austerity—a visible trade-off for precision over spectacle.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—Eli’s desire to orchestrate hidden harmonies—is signaled early and tightens when he draws the vertical line labeled “DO NOT WASTE,” narrowing his focus to the sliver of time he can touch. His agency drives escalation: mapping memories, writing the shortest fortune yet, aligning shell to horizon. Cost is unmistakable: chronic exhaustion, emotional isolation, the ache of unmet belonging. The stakes deepen not through external pressure but internal crystallization—his choice to stay awake becomes a sacred refusal.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reconciling fractured selves—is signaled early and escalates through protagonist agency: each retraced choice seals timelines, redistributing pain. The tightening is causal under an Accumulative lens—density of doors decreases as futures extinguish, culminating in one corridor. Cost is unmistakable: gravity’s return, dulled floating, and the loss of infinite possibility. Coincidence never resolves; every shift stems from Lio’s deliberate re-engagement with regret.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—defeating emotional numbness—is signaled early and deepens when the backward songs activate somatic memory, forcing confrontation with buried grief. Escalation is driven by Eira’s agency: she threads the filament, commands “listen with your scars,” and trusts Marlo’s instrument. Cost is unmistakable: the children’s hardened shells crack open through involuntary tears and trembling—a visceral price for feeling again. Pressure tightens once, decisively, and never resets.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—avoiding erasure through observation—is signaled early and deepens when the capsule reframes solitude as potential resistance. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: the decision to sweep, then listen, then interpret pigeon paths as data. Cost is unmistakable: choosing alignment forfeits the safety of pure neutrality. The ministry’s algorithmic distrust of non-linear movement becomes a tactical constraint the narrator must navigate, making pressure coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether to confront grief through dangerous memory—is signaled early and deepens when Mara’s tear-inducing fragrance forces Elias past caution. His agency drives escalation: choosing to use Aron’s lamp is a high-cost act that narrows his emotional escape routes. The price is felt in bodily recall (“tasted emergency room disinfectant”) and irreversible vulnerability. Coincidence introduces Mara, but resolution stems wholly from Elias’s choice to witness rather than flee.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—discovering time’s texture after meaning collapses—is signaled early and tightens when the poet reframes “impossible choices” as invitations to third ways. Pressure escalates through dialogue that narrows the narrator’s options from external (job, lover, scholarship) to internal (shrink or expand). The poet’s prison escape exemplifies agency under duress, modeling the cost of refusal. Coincidence (stalled buses) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the climax is earned through stance crystallization, not plot mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—finding meaning in incompleteness—is signaled early and deepens when Mara reveals the pumps’ “undecided” water, mirroring Elio’s musical hesitations. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: his refusal of cadence attracts Mara, whose invitation forces a choice (curiosity over hunger). Cost is legible—Elio abandons transactional performance for collaborative listening—and the orchard’s scarred sapling embodies the central tension: growth from almosts. Coincidence complicates (chronic hush), never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—clarity vs. empathy—is signaled early and tightens when Eve admits her verdicts are untrustworthy. Her agency drives escalation: she seeks the dealer, articulates her need, accepts the price. Cost is unmistakable: surrendering certainty for questions, risking self-alienation. The dealer’s warning crystallizes stakes without coincidence resolving pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—recognition for silent contributors—is signaled early and deepens when Elias proposes weekly readings. The tightening occurs when Marin accepts the letter not as personal praise but communal offering, forcing Elias to expand his gesture beyond one delivery. Cost is felt: he commits resources (coffee, oil); she commits emotional labor. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, with no coincidental resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—belonging vs. transience—tightens decisively at the obsidian arbor, where “Stay and scatter” forces renunciation of old identities (mapmaker, solitary sculptor). Agency drives escalation: their shared search narrows options until the tag’s discovery crystallizes a trade-off (rootedness requires scattering self into community). Cost is felt in Mira’s stifled laugh (“something fragile might escape”) and Elian’s shift from dedicating to a place to weaving webs. Coincidence never resolves; pressure accumulates through character-led action under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding where echoes are born—deepens into a moral choice: to cage or liberate sound’s origin. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: twisting the pendant “into a tightened knot” actively peels sound from the city, forcing confrontation with unborn echoes. The cost—relinquishing commissioned power—is visible in her empty hands and the keeper’s withdrawal. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from her handling of time-borrowing mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—resolving ambiguous loss—is signaled early and tightens when Corren realizes retrieval would “tear open every branch.” The deepening occurs via his own conjuring: the more he calls, the more Lio’s image frays, proving force won’t work. Agency drives escalation; his shift to asking “how to live with the shape of the missing space” crystallizes stance under Accumulative pressure. Cost is unmistakable: he forfeits reunion to preserve others’ futures.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—visibility through sense memory—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency: Marrow chooses to play the tape, transforming passive observation into active guidance. The outage tightens pressure by silencing electrical chatter, making the tape’s scrape “thunderous,” and forcing reliance on non-visual senses. Cost is unmistakable: the librarian’s raw exposure beneath the vent, and Marrow’s acceptance that his presence remains indirect yet potent. Escalation stems from Marrow’s methodical decisions under the Accumulative lens, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—resisting unscheduled growth—is signaled early and deepens when the lightning-struck linden survives, challenging Mara’s worldview. Her agency drives escalation: she chooses to return to the trellis despite knowing it unsettles her. Cost is felt physically (“knees gave”) and conceptually (admitting plants “reconstruct themselves by releasing control”). The storm outside mirrors internal pressure, but resolution stems from her attention, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving meaning amid ecological collapse—is signaled early and tightens when the tide fails, transforming observation into mission. Escalation is driven by Mara’s agency: she interprets the brooch as omen, decides to trade it, and walks. Cost is felt in departure, not just stated—she abandons the island’s fragile stasis. Eron’s practical objection sharpens moral calculus without resolving it; resolution hinges on her choice, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—validating everyday magic over grand prophecy—is signaled early and tightens when the cave’s chorus becomes “steadily unpredictable,” forcing Lyra to confront her irrelevance. Mira’s agency drives escalation: her declaration that unseen forces “want to inhabit the present” crystallizes stance, altering tactics from passive reception to active witnessing. Cost is unmistakable: Lyra’s professional identity dissolves (“proud role as seer melting into something humbler”), and the pearl’s rise exacts emotional price—both women must surrender old frameworks. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with each musical shift deepening the thematic recalibration until small kindnesses eclipse noble fortunes.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—navigating absences to restore communal voice—is signaled early and deepens when Mara shifts from collecting fragments to offering them back. The tightening occurs when she places the valve publicly, forcing confrontation with loss. Cost is visible: Caven’s tremulous breath, the crowd’s uncurling shoulders. Agency is subtle but present—Mara’s method creates the space for Caven’s choice. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; pressure accumulates until someone acts.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—mapping the unmappable—is signaled early and tightens when Adrian chooses to treat the impossible as a route. His agency drives escalation: following cracks, pocketing the punch, stepping through the doorway. Cost is unmistakable: he abandons empirical reality for a realm where silence has geography, and his new duty (“dare to publish it”) forecloses his old life. The conductor’s revelation deepens stakes without coincidence, forcing Adrian to confront the moral weight of cartographing evasion.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—whether to trust entangled memory—is signaled early and deepens when Lio panics at blurred identity boundaries. His agency drives escalation: testing the tile’s materiality, then choosing transcription as both shield and probe. The meaningful tightening occurs when he accepts shared shadows instead of fleeing, foreclosing pure skepticism with felt cost (softened fear, expanded doubt). Whale migration acts as a live clock, but stakes remain internal; pressure coheres tightly under the Accumulative lens without false resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—discovering “what happens after goodbye”—tightens when the amulet and storm conspire to force confrontation with refused farewells. Protagonist agency drives escalation: he pins the fragment, then redraws boundaries. Cost is unmistakable—the escondite’s loyalty tilts elsewhere, demanding he “permit a final distance.” Magnetic fields aren’t coincidence; they’re the conduit for spatial mutiny that narrows his options to renunciation or stagnation.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—political asylum vs. sustaining a ghost network—is signaled early and intensifies through one decisive deepening: decoding the ledger reveals the father’s unfinished equation bearing the narrator’s initial. Agency drives escalation: waiting actively leads to discovery, ink use unlocks cognition, and the final breach is chosen eyes open. Cost is unmistakable: the protagonist forfeits clean redemption, embracing permanent moral ambiguity. Pressure coheres under Causal logic—every turn narrows options toward an irreconcilable trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—giving silence form so the town might speak again—is signaled early and deepens at 5:07 when Aurelio writes a boy who follows the hum uphill, meeting him with a “license for bravery.” This invented encounter tightens the emotional aperture: his work isn’t escape but collection, with physical cost (“knuckles ache”). Agency is clear—he chooses fragility over ostentation—and the final act (copying hum without story) crystallizes his stance. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; restraint does.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—resisting erasure by bureaucracy—is signaled early and deepens when the crane reads his “paper name,” forcing him to confront the cost of being archived. His agency drives escalation: choosing to layer overheard fragments onto his body, then actively rewriting his death certificate. The tightening occurs when he realizes he doesn’t want his old story back—foreclosing recovery as an option. Cost is unmistakable: a life lived as blank space, “spacious as the harbor at low tide.”

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—decoding whether stories matter—is signaled early and deepens through protagonist-driven engagement with the cello-shell resonance. Each hum tightens pressure: childhood memory shifts her mother’s lie to truth; lover-memory forces confrontation with her own cruelty. These aren’t passive recollections but active retellings that narrow her options—from debunker to participant. Cost is felt in shame, in the realization that every broken myth leaves “a shape, a negative space of longing,” and in her irreversible choice to embrace unfinishedness.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—navigating gentrification without fracture—is signaled in paragraph two and deepens when privatization documents leak. Jae’s agency drives escalation: he doesn’t just react but initiates the graffiti code system, altering tactics block by block. Cost is unmistakable: Council scrutiny tightens, trust frays, and the serpent’s tail poses an unanswerable question—no safe path remains. The tightening forecloses neutrality; every choice now risks exile or betrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving memory against erasure—is signaled early and tightens relentlessly via the T-minus clock. Ilya’s agency lies in renunciation: he refuses to falsify data (avoiding risk-shifting), instead performing private witness. The meaningful deepening occurs when he chooses amber (beauty still alive) over red (death), accepting loss without despair. Cost is felt in his bone-deep vibration with the regolith and the irreversible surrender of the heritage zone—pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without false resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—restoring purpose to a broken machine—is signaled early and deepens into a philosophical test: can a machine “know where it wants to go”? Pressure escalates not through external threat but through sensory narrowing: Elias must decode increasingly subtle feedback (crack → vibration → refracted chime). The tightening occurs when he opens the “seams again,” risking further damage to restore balance—a trade-off with visible cost in the drone’s fragile state. Agency is total: every turn stems from his choices, not luck; the ship’s departure coincides but doesn’t resolve—Elias’s readiness does.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—finding true river origins—intensifies from bureaucratic nuisance to existential correction. The tightening occurs when the protagonist recognizes his own script commanding action he didn’t consciously take, forcing renunciation of institutional truth for empirical honesty. Cost is visible: redrawing means professional heresy, yet he acts. Agency drives escalation—reading condensation, crossing ice, interpreting the dog-ear—not luck or external rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—rebuilding time’s harmony to lure return—is signaled early and tightens when Ansel shifts from solitary pacing to synchronized steps with the woman. His agency drives escalation: each night’s walk deepens the town’s response until bells hum coherently. Cost is felt in the fork’s stored tremors and the visible vulnerability of waiting alone under fog. Coincidence (wagon arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve—he earns resonance through relentless practice.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving ephemeral human traces against oblivion—is signaled early and deepens when the ping reveals non-mechanical rhythm. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: “hands were already moving” despite protocol. Cost is unmistakable: power loss, structural fatigue, and irreversible isolation. The tightening occurs when the vial pulses with memory, forcing the choice to become its archive—a trade-off between survival and legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming narrative authority in a place where truth is distrusted—is signaled early and intensifies through the discovery of the spectral library. The tightening occurs when the protagonist realizes his father’s last story may reside there, transforming passive imprisonment into active quest. Agency drives escalation: his listening leads to mapping, which leads to the hidden door, which reveals the unfinished paths. Cost is unmistakable: his freedom depends on maintaining a collective delusion about drownings, a moral and existential tightrope that charges every quiet act.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—repaying a karmic debt through tending—is signaled early and deepens when the bead activates memory. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he chooses to accept the bead, interrogate the vision, and swear the vow. The cost is unmistakable: he trades mortal warmth for eternal stewardship, and each “resonant awakening” tightens the cage of night by only “a single bar.” Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with grief and duty braided into every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving communal memory against decay—is signaled early and tightens when Orren alters the founding myth, foreclosing fidelity to “what happened” for “what might be salvaged.” Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: each chamber deepens his revisionism, culminating in widened harbor entryways. Cost is unmistakable: physical pain, social isolation, and the burden of unilateral cultural stewardship. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—restoring continuity amid broken time—is signaled early and deepens when the storm uncovers the ancient calendar. Leila’s agency drives escalation: she proposes the teaching garden, negotiates with priest and archaeologists, and physically maps the stone. Cost is unmistakable: her parents’ deaths abroad, the village’s skepticism, Rafi’s warning that she’s “not a restorer.” The rebuild forecloses pure observation, committing her to belief-in-action with emotional risk.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—assigning a name that bridges regret and self-forgiveness—is signaled early and tightens through each invented alias. Agency is clear: Neve’s “carefully inventive” interventions (adding Subconscious Review, chalk codes) narrow options meaningfully. Cost surfaces in the question “Are you still there,” which haunts both sender and self. Escalation is textural but coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—surviving the coup by weaving untraceable futures—is signaled early and tightens when the prince demands charts only she can make. Liora’s agency drives escalation: her stitching translates conspiracies into navigable voids, narrowing options to one dangerous path. Cost is unmistakable: walking where no story exists risks total erasure. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with each rumor-stitch raising conceptual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—accessing the pre-decision moment—is signaled early and tightens through protagonist agency: Lysa’s invocation triggers the spirits’ song shift, which rewinds time to isolate the critical pane. Escalation is driven by her choice to touch the shard and whisper her request, narrowing options to one unfinished sentence. Cost is unmistakable: the brother’s death, the client’s frozen grief, and Lysa’s burden of witnessing without fixing. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens until the final reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving humanity amid dehumanizing triage—intensifies through Mara’s agency: choosing which truths to translate, which lies to offer. The tightening occurs when she fabricates “the sea will remember you,” trading medical neutrality for emotional survival. Cost is visible in her pocketed coral and trembling lashes on the gurney—stakes remain visceral, never abstract. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without false resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming public joy in a color-banned city—tightens when Lio chooses light over paint, accepting impermanence as cost. This agency-driven deepening (hacked drones vs. spray cans) narrows options: his art can’t be arrested but vanishes at power loss. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; fog’s thickening doesn’t resolve conflict but amplifies luminosity’s fragility. The “traveling orchard” renunciation forecloses permanence yet affirms communal stewardship—a trade-off with palpable emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—certainty vs. curiosity—is signaled early and tightens when the mural whispers its challenge. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: choosing to speak uncertainty aloud triggers the wall’s exhalation and color revelation. Cost is unmistakable—the loss of professional protocol, the dissolution of “neat opinions”—and reconfigures all future action. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, deepening through sensory and conceptual layering.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving untaxed thought—is signaled early and escalates through Ministry policy shifts (curiosity doubled, irony luxury-priced). Protagonist agency drives deepening: Arlen forges permits, Jin negotiates, Mara calibrates lexicon, culminating in the garden-message system. The entomologist’s intervention raises emotional stakes without resolving via coincidence; instead, it tightens alliance under shared risk. Cost is legible: gardeners unknowingly participate, seeds trigger audits, and every bloom risks recalculation—visible prices that alter tactics and foreclose safe expression.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reconciling absence with beauty—is signaled early and deepens when the missing moon demands “more careful tending.” Escalation is driven by agency: he chooses song over script, postcard over telescope, humility over demand. Cost is felt—the sea “frowns,” clouds resist—and the truce requires accepting phases, not permanence. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each sensory detail intensifies the plea until coral answers.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving fragile sonic archives—is signaled early and deepens when the cracked chime threatens “to erode delicate arrangements of memory.” Protagonist agency drives escalation: he chooses to repair, then to hum, then to archive the unclaimed name, each act narrowing options (ignoring the song would be easier). Cost is unmistakable: “the faint aftertaste of something almost, but not quite, saved” lingers after his effort. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—restoring trust before irreversible divergence—is signaled early and tightens through the protagonist’s agency: choosing to inscribe vows that structurally forbid evasion. The deepening occurs when grammar becomes harness, narrowing options to only honesty. Cost is unmistakable: the irreversible forfeiture of protective silence, felt in the throat and breath. Escalation is driven by character action under an Accumulative lens, with pressure cohering to a single, resonant trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—harmonizing conflicting values to prevent civic “drowning”—is clear from paragraph two. Pressure escalates organically: clashing edicts → vocal collision → Arlen’s intervention → rotating mercy proposal. The tightening occurs when Arlen declares, “What you ask me to build will choose winners unless you agree on what you are willing to lose together,” forcing a trade-off. Cost is legible: no permanent supremacy, only cyclical advantage—a conceptual sacrifice that reweights the entire social contract. Agency drives escalation; coincidence plays no role.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving lost music—is signaled early and deepens when the sister’s death personalizes it. Escalation occurs through Noel’s agency: he shifts from training pigeons for invoices to smuggling melodies, then accepts collaboration. The tightening moment—“She pointed to the Mars meteorite chip”—forces him to confront whether faith survives ruin. Cost is unmistakable: he risks reopening trauma to complete the song, trading isolation for vulnerable connection.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving necessary distances—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the chair nearly brushes the table, triggering dimensional slippage. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: decoding the logbook, testing distances, choosing stillness. Cost is unmistakable—the father’s attenuation, the terrace’s fragility—and the final renunciation crystallizes under coherent pressure. Coincidence complicates (maze rearranges), but resolution stems solely from the narrator’s calibrated endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—learning “the rhythm of belonging”—tightens when the protagonist abandons chart-based diagnosis for embodied attention, narrowing options from repair to co-creation. Agency drives escalation: overriding protocol to dim lights reveals the true problem isn’t electrical but perceptual. Cost is legible in the feather’s ash-smell and the relinquished surface identity. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens—each flickering light deepens the thematic question without false resets.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—cataloguing paths to understand their disappearance—tightens when Lio abandons passive sifting for active pursuit of seeds, narrowing his method and raising emotional stakes. His conjecture (“ridiculous enough to be promising”) is a decisive deepening that reorients the quest, and the cost—confronting cosmic impermanence—is felt in his “half-mirth and half-mourning” laugh. Pressure escalates organically under the Accumulative lens: each blank path compounds unease until the seed trail forces action. Coincidence (bird dropping seeds) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Lio’s choice to follow seeds drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—disrupting monotony through creativity—is signaled early and tightens when the tide reaches his boots, forcing the climax. Marcus’s agency drives escalation: he reads microflickers, places the bishop, and relinquishes control, narrowing his own role to catalyze others’ choices. Cost is felt in the woman’s shock and the group’s suspended breath—monotony is broken, but at the price of vulnerability. Coincidence complicates (tide’s schedule), never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving memory against erasure—is signaled early and tightens when the stranger arrives, forcing Mareh to choose between safety and transmission. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she reads gaps, calls tides, and inscribes knowing the price. Cost is legible and irreversible: unmoored memory drifts with the tide. Coincidence (the stranger’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the act is wholly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving intangible heritage against commodification—is signaled early and escalates via the council’s ultimatum and the pond’s noctilucent reckoning. Pressure tightens coherently under Accumulative lens: each sensory layer (mist, glass, water rings) deepens the glazier’s conviction, culminating in his demand for “one more day” as a costly act of resistance. Agency is clear: his observation of the pond’s calm surface directly informs his stance. The price is conceptual yet undeniable—the erasure of a place where “light still bothered to slow down”—felt in Kade’s practical laugh and the unspoken loss of communal memory.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—carrying someone else’s fire—is signaled early and deepens when Rafe chooses to transfer that burden to Maya via story. The tightening occurs in his micro-choice to reveal the box, narrowing his future to one of vulnerability. Cost is unmistakable: “bargained my innocence” becomes active relinquishment, paid in trembling words. Escalation is protagonist-driven under Accumulative lens—no coincidence, only accruing weight of silence finally released.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—puzzling out equations for hope—is signaled early and tightens when the gauge reveals “Unlifted” as stagnation, not catastrophe. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: each decoration adjustment alters the needle’s response, forcing trade-offs between generosity and insularity. Cost is unmistakable—the grief for lost timelines and the exhaustion implied by the needle’s “frantic loops.” The final modest ascent carries weight because apathy was tested and rejected on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether walls remember—is signaled early and tightens when the narrator realizes their work is “inherited, unfinished, possibly doomed,” forcing a trade-off between self-preservation and fidelity to unseen predecessors. Agency drives escalation: humming prompts tremor, which leads to prying open the door, which yields diaries and film, which crystallizes duty. Cost is unmistakable: “Legacy’s burden pressed down” and the explicit option to “walk away” is rejected at personal expense. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with each echo layer raising emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—offering soft alternatives to despair—is signaled early and escalates when the girl arrives with her brother’s watery mirror. The painter’s agency drives the deepening: they shift melody, invite collaboration, braiding voices to reach one specific dream. Cost is unmistakable: each vision exacts interest on borrowed time, and the clockmaker’s eventual repossession looms as irreversible loss. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens—density of reflected lives intensifies until the final boy’s dream crystallizes the story’s moral weight.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether peace can be forged from irreconcilable trauma—is signaled early and tightens when the envoy confronts amnesty clauses. The negotiator’s agency drives escalation: his offer forces both sides to choose between vengeance and survival. Cost is unmistakable in the envoy’s quiet agony and the general’s swallowed pride. The ritual framework raises stakes by making silence sacred, not strategic, so failure would desecrate memory itself.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving the birds’ echo—is signaled early and deepens when the protagonist interprets their song as “an echo trapped in the architecture of the world.” Escalation is driven by his agency: choosing to follow the crack-map despite knowing absolution is impossible. Cost is unmistakable: kneeling in ruin he created, offering back what he stole symbolically, with no expectation of return. The tightening forecloses redemption but affirms a costly, futile devotion.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—control over suppressed emotion—is signaled early and deepens when Iri repurposes the king’s harvest into rebellion. Her agency lies in renunciation (refusing jars) and attention (weaving constellations), foreclosing compliance with visible cost: the king will call it treason. Pressure escalates texturally via echo density, not causally, fitting the Accumulative lens without slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—ethical storytelling under inevitable harm—is signaled early and escalates through protagonist agency: the narrator’s puppet shows provoke the argument, then his pedagogical gambit (“tell my story from yours”) forces reckoning. The tightening forecloses the path of detached observation; cost is felt in exposed vulnerabilities (“my throat ache,” “arrogant,” “hungry for purity”). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: density builds via silence, accusation, and reciprocal narration until the final orbit of stories. No coincidence resolves tension—only earned dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—honoring overlooked histories through tangible form—tightens when the last monarch falters, forcing Erin to convert past helplessness into present action. Escalation is driven by her agency: each structural adjustment answers the butterfly’s doubts. Cost is unmistakable in the monarch’s “freckled translucence” and Erin’s acceptance of its inevitable death despite her efforts.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving forgotten names—is signaled early and deepens when the rope demands guilt-as-wax. The single tightening occurs when the caretaker declares, “your guilt is the wax,” forcing the protagonist to confront their belief that forgiveness erased culpability. Agency drives escalation: each rewoven strand narrows options (metal → sound, secrecy → stewardship) and exacts cost (reliving village failure, thawing “stiff apology”). Luck never resolves; the street organ scrap’s return is earned by prior choice to follow it north.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—obeying a decaying directive vs. following an emergent path—is signaled early and tightens when dreams shift to unmapped roads. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he nudges the system, interprets dreams as invitations, and ultimately chooses the road. Cost is unmistakable: losing the only home and logic he’s ever known. The storm isn’t coincidence—it’s the pressure that forces crystallization under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—sealing a covenant with the unknown through numerical rigor—is signaled early and deepens when near-alignments erode his trust in confirmation. Agency drives escalation: he flicks breakers, sketches interfaces, throws the master switch. Cost crystallizes in the “fevered expectation” versus empirical disappointment, culminating in the planet’s exact alignment that reweights his entire quest. Coincidence complicates (stars drift indifferently) but resolution stems from his persistent method under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—releasing hatred of the brother—is signaled early and tightens through one decisive deepening: the car-memory shard where the protagonist confronts their own role in the accident. Agency drives escalation; turning the music box key triggers reality shifts that force embodied reckoning, not passive revelation. Cost is unmistakable: the “splinter working itself outward” replaces weaponized resentment, and the final note carries the weight of self-forgiveness deferred. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres via sensory density and spatial instability, narrowing options until only truth remains.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—capturing a runaway dream before it dissipates—is signaled early and tightens when Elias realizes he must become the vessel, not just the maker. Agency drives escalation: his choice to breathe with the fog enables the mirror; his palm pressed to glass invites fusion. Cost is unmistakable: loss of corporeal self (“face went pale, then translucent”) for successful recontainment. No coincidence—only craft, rhythm, and sacrifice under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—securing space for his daughter’s work—tightens when the bank claims everything, forcing his refusal and the orchard’s feral turn. His agency drives escalation: signing, tearing, returning, tending. Cost is unmistakable: exile from his child, shattered stained glass, risk “growing like moss.” The final bargain trades ownership for stewardship, foreclosing legal resolution but opening generational continuity. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each detail (ribbon, apple vision) deepens the moral calculus.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—pursuing forbidden knowledge—is signaled early and tightens when the cameo glows, forcing Elias to choose between regulation and revelation. His agency drives escalation: retreating to the bathroom, then stepping through the mirror. Cost is conceptual but legible: eroding “the comforting lie of chronology.” Under Accumulative lens, pressure deepens via clustered annotations until stance crystallizes as custodial duty.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—retrieving her brother via unlearned lessons—is signaled early and tightens when Lysa renegotiates payment, shifting from memory sacrifice to labor. This deepening forecloses easy access and raises conceptual cost: the mountain demands returned knowledge, not just personal catharsis. Pressure coheres under Accumulative logic—each skipped catalog number, reversed language, and invisible ink page intensifies the search without coincidence. The climax forces a morally sharp choice: rewrite history or accompany him, with the latter accepting irreversible loss while creating new possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—finding the garden through the twin—is signaled early and deepens when the narrator realizes the garden is internal. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing to follow laughter, then accepting the theater as garden. Cost is unmistakable: abandoning their profession (“reports I had written... bars bending inward”) and fixed identity. The single meaningful tightening—renouncing recapture for co-authorship—narrows options permanently under the Accumulative lens, with pressure cohering through symbolic encounters (mirrors, shooting gallery) that test commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—whether to restore or release the absent war—is signaled early via the “fables of absence” and tightens when Lysa reads her own future note. Agency is clear: she chooses to adjust the rope, accepting that clarity means bearing witness, not fixing. The escalation is driven by her actions (loosening braids), not coincidence, and the cost—eternal ledger of unsealed grief—is felt in the treaty’s inkless script. Under an Accumulative lens, the deepening comes via textual density, not external opposition, yet pressure remains coherent and consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving stillness against invasive noise—is signaled early and tightens when the energy beings’ “wild, laughing electricity” invades the cave. The mapkeeper’s agency lies in renunciation: he refuses confrontation, instead deepening into stillness. Escalation is driven by his choices (scraping ice, pressing stone to tongue), not coincidence. Cost is felt in the “thin seam of terror” and the physical toll of marrow-ringing spores—visible prices that charge the final bloom of hush.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (“prove coincidences have meaning”) tightens when the comet appears—protagonist agency drives escalation as he “redrew his charts,” fitting new data into old destinies. Cost is unmistakable: “oil nearly gone,” “knees mutinying.” The shard’s release of his plea validates his endurance, making coincidence meaningful through earned reconfiguration, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving collective identity against entropy—is signaled early and tightens as shadows shift, forcing transcription before dawn. Agency manifests through attention and endurance; each crystal handled forecloses the path of neglect. Cost is unmistakable: neighborhoods losing reasons for Thursday songs, children forgetting cinnamon stalls. The archivist’s speed increases under pressure, and his final stillness carries the weight of what was saved—and what remains vulnerable.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—defying hopelessness through spectacle—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: he repurposes the spinner’s knot, aligns shells with fortress flaws, and composes a sky-message only fire can write. The tightening occurs when he chooses to use the absent spinner’s tool, accepting the risk of failure (echoing his past misjudged wind). Cost is legible: his art offers no defense, only witness, and soldiers may still die at dawn—but the night itself is altered. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with each detail amplifying emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—whether to abandon the sea’s transitional logic for inland certainty—is signaled by Lysa’s arrival and deepened through the cicada’s dual meanings. Pressure escalates via the narrator’s own methodology: observing tidal pools becomes a metaphor for examining their relationship, narrowing options until only a hybrid path remains. The cost is felt in the relinquishment of pure observation (“I had been waiting for our lives to harden before I stepped into them”) and made undeniable in the groundwater-seep decision. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence intervenes.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—whether silence suffocates or sustains—is signaled early and deepens through inversion’s disruption. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing exposure limits, pressing doll to beams, inviting father into drift. Cost manifests as emotional risk (vulnerability replacing escapism) and physical stakes (unclipped doll, inverted gravity). Father’s line—“Maybe we were building bunkers to keep that kind of silence out”—reweights the central conflict without resolving it neatly, preserving tension in Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—can silence be directed to comfort?—is signaled early and deepens when Rian disables cabin speakers, raising stakes by removing auditory crutches. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: each passenger’s sound visibly climbs the wall, forcing self-regulation. Cost is felt in bodily terms (unclenched jaws, stilled tapping) and conceptual terms (silence as shared labor). However, the wrinkled-suited man’s “invisible argument” lacks specific friction—his transformation feels slightly less earned than others’, softening the pressure peak.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—truthful memory versus curated oblivion—is signaled early and deepens when Ilya witnesses his edited/unedited selves. His agency drives escalation: peeling murals reveals timelines, and embedding the ruby flake actively rejects governance. The sunrise countdown imposes visceral pressure, narrowing options until refusal becomes the only ethical act. Cost is unmistakable: erasure from possibility, crystallized in constellations blinking like cursors awaiting his overwrite.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—escaping suffocation without being witnessed failing—is signaled early and tightens when Mara realizes she’s been arriving here all along. The deepening (“breath you held back... pooled in this hollow”) narrows options: she must either drown silently or learn to breathe alone. Protagonist agency drives escalation—her choice to knock, to touch palms, to inhale. Cost is felt in irreversible isolation and the weight of unsaid words turned stone.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preventing promises from “eating everyone”—tightens when pumps stall and the hatch sighs. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she texts back, steps forward, grasps the wheel. Cost is felt in her shaking thumbs and the bolt’s tug—reopening wounds to transmute collective regret. Coincidence (glitchy texts) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from her choice to “open a window,” aligning with her vow to make diamonds from pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—uncovering why the dynasty collapsed—is signaled early and deepens when the recording reframes surrender as moral collapse, not political defeat. Aurel’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to listen, risking emotional rupture. The cost is conceptual (his identity as “dynasty ender” unravels) and felt (ghosts become voices). Pressure tightens via Mara’s theory, culminating in a revelation that forecloses any heroic narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—capturing possibility vs. serving certainty—is signaled early and tightens when Mira hands Calder the program, forcing him to confront his choreographed loyalty. His agency drives escalation: folding the program, choosing no mask, declaring non-service. Cost is legible in “every command obeyed... mistaken for virtue.” The king’s offstage fear sharpens stakes without resolving them.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—linking silenced lives to living kin—is signaled immediately and deepens through visitor encounters that test Mara’s emotional stamina. Escalation is driven by her agency: choosing neglected files, speaking names aloud, highlighting buried kindnesses. Each interaction narrows her emotional bandwidth yet reaffirms purpose; cost is visible in her “broken-hearted still” endurance. The infantryman’s button incident crystallizes stakes without coincidence—it emerges from her method, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving unedited memory against state-imposed forgetting—is signaled early and tightens when puddles reveal a hidden route, forcing Lio past hesitation into physical risk. Agency drives escalation: their choice to kneel, follow reflections, and speak into the booth forecloses passive observation. Cost is felt (exhaustion, exposure) and conceptual (carrying the weight of erased lives). Coincidence (the key’s reappearance) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Lio’s action earns the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—silencing a coded prophecy—is signaled early and deepens when the grotto’s prisms misalign, raising pressure. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: he experiments daily, then chooses refusal over completion. Cost is unmistakable: not triumph, but “eerie nostalgia” for averted doom. Under the Accumulative lens, density increases until the decisive cadence shift—leaving gaps where fatal notes should lie—which reweights the entire narrative trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—decoding the valley’s unanswered question—is signaled early and deepens when the moonstone leaf arrives. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: Lio’s refusal to plant becomes untenable once the arbor speaks. The cost—abandoning pure interpretation for participatory creation—is felt in the trembling leaf and coolness seeping up the arm. Coincidence never resolves; the voice challenges, but Lio chooses.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reconciling control with possibility—is signaled early (“banish Perhaps”) and tightens decisively when the compass aligns toward “Perhaps” then “Now.” Eli’s agency escalates pressure: he chooses to descend, lift the compass, and improvise. The cost is conceptual but undeniable: surrendering his identity as a fixer of broken time. Under an Accumulative lens, the deepening occurs through layered sensory and symbolic density, not causal turns, yet stakes remain viscerally felt in every tactile interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—redeeming the word “lost”—is signaled early and deepens through Eira’s ritual, culminating in a Charged Poise where options (acceptance vs. redefinition) are made legible. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her decision to enter the foundry after the search ends tightens pressure into a single, resonant act. Cost is unmistakable: she offers her own name as solder, accepting perpetual uncertainty. Under the Accumulative lens, the cadence shift in the vapor vision intensifies thematic pressure without false resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—restoring balance between dead and living through laughter—is signaled early and deepens when Mara chooses to “teach them how to remember the joke.” Escalation is driven by her agency: each confession coaxed tightens the harp’s discord toward harmony. Cost is visible in the children’s lost joy and felt in the gorge’s hunger; resolution requires emotional labor, not luck. The lone tightening—her decision to engage rather than ferry—forecloses passive myth-making.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—measuring mercy through damaged flesh—is signaled early and tightens when the voice declares, “you will become the dataset of compassion.” The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: each step triggers traumatic recall that converges on the clearing, culminating in a voluntary entry into the frame. Cost is unmistakable: surrendering unquantified selfhood to “a system that spoke in the register of my abusers.” The moral calculus—refusal leaves others to suffer, agreement erases autonomy—is sharp and unavoidable.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to the silenced—is signaled early and tightens when the narrator recalls betraying it. The deepening occurs via the painter’s lesson: “footnotes of the lost” demand active listening, not passive conversion. Protagonist agency drives escalation—they choose to unfasten the hook, accept the shard, and internalize shame. Cost is felt: past omissions foreclose neutrality, forcing a stance where translation must bend toward justice. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—uncovering hidden truths—tightens when the fluorescent buzz dies, shifting from maintenance to revelation. Protagonist agency drives escalation: his decision to touch the barrel directly causes the ceiling breach. Cost is felt in the ghosts’ tension and the irreversible exposure to the inverted room. One meaningful deepening suffices, though a second tactical consequence (e.g., loss of escape route) would elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—compressing eternity without breaking reality—tightens decisively when frost spells “NOW OR NEVER OR ALWAYS,” forcing Ilen’s deadline-driven action. Protagonist agency drives escalation: his uncorking of the whisper (against warning) directly triggers the press’s exhalation of condensed horizons. Cost is unmistakable: treaties rewrite, librarians panic, and the bottled whisper empties into “leftover maybes.” Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—density of destabilizations (clocks forget, destinies misfire) crescendos into systemic reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether time is tomb or rehearsal—is signaled early and deepens when the Council seals the chambers, forcing Mara and Elyas into subversive poetics. The tightening occurs when they shift from excavation to verse, trading institutional validation for clandestine world-building. Cost is clear: official history remains unchanged, but their private act reconfigures meaning. Agency drives escalation—Mara chooses reimagination over revolution, accepting marginalization to preserve possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming stolen light—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes the rust “only ever wanted the comfort of a truthful song.” His agency drives escalation: choosing not to fix the stone but to give its fracture “something true to sing through.” Cost is unmistakable: he must expose his private melody, risking vulnerability to heal a civic lie. The covenant’s adjustment forecloses blind faith in mechanical truth.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—finding where explanations fail—is signaled early and tightens decisively at the lagoon: crossing means surrendering empiricism. Escalation is driven by Elias’s agency (choosing to follow the compass, opening jars at thresholds) under Accumulative pressure. Cost is unmistakable: the factory’s silence isn’t just economic loss but epistemic rupture, and the vision forces him to trade known reality for ancestral mystery. Coincidence (finding compass) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution hinges on his willingness to delve.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding meaning through art in a disorienting world—is signaled early and deepens when the magic lantern slide reframes driftwood collecting as participation in “timewoven alliances.” The tightening occurs when Mara sees herself in the circle, forcing a trade-off: abandon linear navigation or embrace cyclical time. Agency is clear—her decision to reimagine the archway as center stems from her own perception, not coincidence. Cost is conceptual but palpable: she surrenders the GPS’s certainty for an unprovable, resonant belonging.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding why flowers bloom only at night—is signaled early and deepens when Ira realizes the glass functions as a celestial lens. The meaningful tightening occurs when he grasps that saints are “careful lenses,” transforming theological iconography into botanical mechanism. Cost is conceptual: truth requires relinquishing daylight certainty for nocturnal faith. Escalation is driven by Ira’s agency (climbing, observing, sketching), not coincidence, though the initial summons borders on convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—bearing witness to erased resistance—is signaled early and deepens when the diary forces Maris into retrocognitive immersion, narrowing her options from passive cataloging to active parley. The escalation is driven by her agency: she chooses to descend, kneel, and whisper terms. Cost is unmistakable: the diary’s weight increases, and she accepts lifelong entanglement with unresolved grief. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens—each debris-letter tightens the moral imperative without external antagonists.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—whether the town can return without repeating its fatal patterns—tightens when the alchemist rejects revival as “another kind of lie.” His agency drives escalation: conceiving gardens, councils, and rituals reshapes options, narrowing from personal failure to civilizational redesign. Cost is unmistakable in the empty pier and his self-imposed isolation; the bottle’s warmth arrives only after he abandons nostalgia for innovation, proving pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—archiving dangerous emotional patterns—is signaled early and deepens when Lan realizes the prophecy’s scope. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: his immersion technique reveals institutional oaths, forcing renunciation. Cost is felt in the orchard’s physical response and Lan’s isolation, though the tightening could more explicitly foreclose a tactical option. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving wild futures—tightens when the egg cracks, forcing a trade-off: personal time for collective memory. Protagonist agency drives escalation (stepping closer, pressing palms), and the cost (“pay in years”) directly alters tactics (reopening requires sustained sacrifice). Myra’s fifty-year precedent crystallizes the moral calculus: borrowed time demands repayment. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—memories accumulate until stance solidifies in Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether to break solstice silence—is signaled by line 3 and tightens when needles hit “cusp of the red zone.” Elias’s agency drives escalation: his waiting, logging, and final walk to the edge narrow options. The moral calculus (“which story the valley would tell”) sharpens the peak choice between noise and listening. Cost is unmistakable: either eroded trust in silence or unseen deaths, both hauntingly plausible.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—being seen versus remaining invisible—is signaled early and deepens when the lantern reveals falling stars as human moments. The janitor’s agency drives escalation: lifting the glass, stepping closer, taking the broom as a staff. Cost is legible in his chest’s “spacious hurt” and the risk of standing exposed. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length, though a second reversal (from cleaning to witnessing) would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving fragile silence against ghostly demands—tightens when Mara appears, forcing the box’s opening. Protagonist agency drives escalation: his daily witnessing enables the covenant’s legibility. Cost is felt in emotional suppression (“bee that chose not to sting”) and social exile. Under Accumulative lens, stakes deepen via textual density rather than causal turns, culminating in Charged Poise where options (speak vs. witness) crystallize without resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—containing or channeling leaking time—is signaled early and tightens when the protagonist shifts from passive watching to active message-embedding. His agency drives escalation: each garage-sale phrase tests public receptivity, altering tactics based on reactions (girl tracing words, old man buying chargers). The cost is conceptual but felt: if the capsule empties, temporal chaos ensues. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, though the lack of a concrete reversal slightly softens the band ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—tending incompleteness—tightens when the snapped kite string forces confrontation with loss-as-door. Elian’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to harmonize rather than mute discord, narrowing options to active listening. Cost is conceptual (world shatters without tenders) and felt (teeth ache from dissonance). Coincidence (kite snap) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems solely from his micro-choice to lean notes together.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—fostering interspecies respect before death—is signaled by line three and tightens when lightning unlocks pillar chambers. Protagonist agency drives escalation: his wiring experiments alter mountain behavior, not luck. Cost is visceral (chest pain, breath shortness) and conceptual (abandoning human-centric design). The storm complicates but doesn’t resolve; his death crystallizes the pact between root and stone.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding “the chemistry of homecoming”—tightens as footprints multiply and equations shimmer in their edges, forcing the protagonist to reinterpret return as chain reaction, not event. Agency lies in her persistent doubt, which narrows options: she cannot accept the pilgrimage as sacred, only as inquiry. Cost is felt in the amber’s stubborn dullness and the world’s “metallic listening,” a collective suspension she both critiques and embodies. Escalation is driven by her choices, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming battlefield through unseen botany—is signaled early and deepens via the coachman’s reliance on avian grammar to navigate poisoned soil. Escalation occurs through his translation of bird warnings into precise seed placement, narrowing options under environmental pressure. Agency is clear: he chooses locations based on tern keens and sandpiper chatter, foreclosing blind scattering. Cost is felt in the weight of the wooden case, the quiver of spent metal beneath him, and the unreadable script he carries without comprehension.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether truth can bridge distance without reigniting war—is signaled early and deepens when the cylinder reveals complicity, not innocence. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to play it despite known danger, then proposes communal listening. Cost is unmistakable: the stranger’s trauma, the risk of warlord reprisal, the burden of inherited guilt. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, culminating in a stance that forecloses erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reconciling inherited faith in celestial constancy with lived experience of temporal fracture—is signaled early and deepens through Elian’s sketching, which becomes an act of defiance against institutional fear. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: he accesses the sealed deck, observes distorted stars, and chooses to map instability rather than seek false order. The cost—enduring solitude, bearing witness to unmoored time—is felt in his body (“inhale felt fractionally delayed”) and crystallized in the final line. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—trading fear for wonder—is signaled early and deepens through protagonist agency: offering the king, confessing fear, lifting the lid “unarmed.” Escalation follows Accumulative/Textural logic: each sensory intensification (wind death, pulsing sky) narrows emotional options until the lid’s questions force reckoning with unlived lives. Cost is legible in the closing beat: he accepts vulnerability as permanent stance, foreclosing his old shield of cynicism. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving fragile human connection during political void—is signaled early and tightens when the narrator chooses silence over correcting the boy’s parents, then deepens with the decision to “unbind” the archive into the floor. Agency is expressed through attention and endurance, not action, fitting the Situational lens. Cost is felt in lost truth and looming closure, though escalation lacks a second concrete turn—still sufficient for this length. Coincidence never resolves; pressure remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—“to understand the shape of home”—is signaled early and deepens when the stone demands reclamation, not replacement, of memory. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her choice to speak aloud cracks open sealed rooms, altering her internal landscape irreversibly. Cost is unmistakable: confronting shame, reversing “careful erasures,” and accepting that survival was actually burial. Under the Accumulative lens, the single deepening (stone’s revelation) suffices to reweight the entire premise with emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—freeing Harrenfeld without repeating the prince’s sacrificial logic—is signaled early and deepens when Elior realizes solving it “only to save them” perpetuates old cruelty. His agency drives escalation: each tug alters reality (bells tremble, knots tighten), and the moral calculus sharpens around self-forgiveness vs. external validation. Cost is unmistakable: woven villagers turn away in accusation after mistakes, echoing the prince’s trust. Coincidence never resolves; only his sifted motives unlock time.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—forgiveness through truthful confession—is signaled early and deepened when Zev reveals its true price: confronting layered selfhood. Maren’s agency drives escalation; her participation in poetry refracts her rigid narrative into “uncertain glints,” narrowing her path to a single, costly offering. The tightening forecloses easy absolution, forcing trade-offs between honesty and self-image. Cost is felt in laughter-turned-tears and stiff joints—a visible toll that charges the descent.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—conjuring meaning before the sea consumes all—is signaled early and tightens when Corin risks drowning to trace pockmarks. Escalation is driven by his agency: strapping in, pressing the charm, exhaling to narrate. Cost is unmistakable—the fracture, acidic vapor seepage, vocal shredding—and directly shapes the resolution. The deepening isn’t external threat but internal crystallization: accepting destruction as material for meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—keeping a hidden promise to make real an unreal place—is signaled early and deepens when the mirror cracks, forcing action. The wrong turn escalates pressure not by coincidence but by aligning with the protagonist’s intuitive pull toward the unseen. Agency is expressed through attention and endurance; his choice to paint despite uncertainty forecloses further waiting. Cost is felt in the solitude of the act and the irreversible commitment to witness over escape.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—whether the sea can be coaxed rather than commanded—is signaled by line two and deepens through Mara’s quiet rebellion against Jorah’s noise. The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses scent over sound, narrowing options to a single fragile act with high emotional risk. Cost is unmistakable: her exposed throat, Jorah’s shaken worldview, and the town’s collective exhaustion hanging in the balance. Escalation is driven entirely by Mara’s agency under an Accumulative lens; coincidence plays no role.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—navigating the geography of loss—is signaled early and deepens when Mara names places “we once swore never to see again.” Pressure tightens as Rian must choose between truth and solace, culminating in the lie that enables Mara’s reverse migration. Agency drives escalation: Rian’s drawing, prompted by cryptic calls, forecloses the path of honest cartography. Cost is felt: “raw solace is all that keeps a person moving.”

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—cultivating psychological safety amid contagious empathy—is signaled early and deepens when Risa arrives with the eye. The meaningful tightening occurs when they choose collaborative mapping over isolation, accepting exposure as cost. Agency drives escalation: the narrator’s truth-telling forces raw disclosures, which Risa transmutes into chords, altering tactics. The storm’s arrival doesn’t resolve but crystallizes pressure, making the eye’s clearing a consequence of their work, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—decoding witnessed isolation—is signaled early and tightens when the narrator abandons report-writing for participation. Escalation is driven by the keeper’s revelations, but agency shifts decisively when the narrator pins on the Edelweiss, foreclosing bureaucratic neutrality. Cost is felt: assuming borrowed memory entails emotional burden, not just procedural change. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure accrues through resonant gaps, not external threats.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—honoring the lingering promise by choosing—is signaled early and tightens as water rises, forcing action. The meaningful deepening occurs when the matrix projects paths, making abstention impossible. Elias’s agency drives escalation: his empirically intuitive filtering of routes leads directly to selecting the question-mark path. Cost is unmistakable: “staying still was itself a decision,” and retreating means spiritual death among unsold maps.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—prevent the sky from bleeding out—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Isera chooses the grotto over harvest treaties and then over storm shelter. Each refusal forecloses a path with felt cost (political, physical), and the final climb occurs under coherent pressure that crystallizes her stance. Agency drives escalation: her choices narrow options until only confrontation with the grotto remains. The storm complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution hinges on her arrival and recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving precarious human connection—is signaled early via the Kira/Jash flashback and deepens when they return seeking an imprint. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency: Lio shifts from passive witness to active collaborator, accepting the risk of contraband and emotional exposure. Cost is legible in the final line’s reorientation of purpose (“solving for us”), though the tangible price of defiance (e.g., guild consequences) remains implied rather than dramatized, slightly muting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—distilling chaos into narrative—is signaled early and escalates through the blank scroll’s arrival, forcing the narrator to soar and confront his graves. Protagonist agency drives escalation: he chooses to walk outside, then to fly, then to endure the sight of multiple deaths. Cost is unmistakable: loss of belief in linear time, envy of simpler selves, and isolation in a “thin-aired present.” Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens with one decisive deepening—the cemetery revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—measuring time after loss—is signaled early and tightens when the engineer admits he “cannot follow time without her.” Mara’s agency lies not in mechanical repair but in reframing time as humanized continuity; her choice to install the screw forecloses literalism (his protest: “That is not how physics works”) and opens symbolic endurance. Cost is felt in his blurred vision and her silent inhalation of scentless air—both accept ambiguity as necessary for forward motion. Escalation is driven by their shared willingness to treat metaphor as mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—transforming scars into stories—is signaled early and deepens through two rune-drawings that narrow options: Lan must confront specific humiliations or fail the ceremony. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative pressure; each memory shard forces a trade-off between hiding and revealing. Cost is unmistakable: enduring cringing places behind ribs, risking platform collapse. The circling storm externalizes future stakes without resolving current tension, preserving pressure until descent begins.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—delivering an apology that cannot undo harm but can cease profiting from it—is signaled early and deepens through Mirabel’s confrontation with spectral metaphors that mirror her own manipulative style. Escalation is driven by her agency: choosing to speak plainly instead of metaphorically, then typing and sending the confession. The cost is unmistakable: she sacrifices her professional persona and syndicated platform. Pressure tightens coherently under an Accumulative lens, with each electrical surge narrowing her rhetorical options until only raw truth remains viable.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preventing total erasure by unifying divergent timelines—is signaled early and escalates through protagonist agency: each turn of the spiral deepens his commitment, narrowing options until only the center remains. The hiccup’s galactic rewrite raises stakes without coincidence; No-One’s refusal to flinch under pressure (“the spiral demanded continuity”) forces the final confrontation. Cost is unmistakable: he sacrifices singular history for a braided one, and his own name (“No-One”) for the pronoun “I.” Escalation is texturally driven but causally coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—whether time is real or illusion—is signaled early and tightens when he realizes clocks measure “the rate at which attention surrendered.” His agency drives escalation: counting backwards, interpreting dreams, testing the horizon. The cost is conceptual but undeniable: choosing uncertainty over mechanistic order. One meaningful deepening suffices; the razor-edge imagery sharpens the moral calculus without resolving it.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether to treat strangers as threats or kin—is signaled early and deepens when Rae notes their hunger. The tightening occurs in the protagonist’s agency: choosing to override the lock despite protocol. Cost is unmistakable—their entire professional identity (“selling fear”) is renounced—and shapes the final image. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with each detail (mycelium, monitors, laser button) intensifying the moral calculus without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether to stay emotionally present amid loss—is signaled early and deepens when the daughter interprets subway scrawls as guidance, then writes her own counter-note. Her agency drives escalation: choosing not to answer calls, seeking meaning in urban detritus, and finally offering her father a revised calculus of hope. Cost is unmistakable: she endures sorrow without doubling down, accepting risk without illusion—a trade-off crystallized in the hospital room.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—rewriting destructive loops—tightens meaningfully when Lena instructs Mara to tie the affair’s end to the lamp’s dimming, forcing a trade-off between old patterns and new action. Escalation is driven by Lena’s agency under an Accumulative lens: each wrong-number friendship layers pressure until Mara’s call crystallizes the cost of inaction. The visible price—Mara’s trembling choice to dial home—alters the city’s “distant circuits,” proving stakes are viscerally felt, not abstract. Coincidence (wrong number) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from Lena’s method.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving the weight of small moments—is signaled early and tightens when the archivist chooses to steep the locket despite knowing “context would change.” This deepening forces a trade-off: confronting Mara’s ghost risks emotional collapse but regenerates the covenant. Pressure escalates through protagonist agency (aligning ink/tide/memory), not coincidence, and the cost—haunted euphoria replacing simple grief—is unmistakable in Mara’s “sharper than joy” expression. Closure crystallizes stakes: keep writing, even when it hurts.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—alleviating loneliness without breaking reciprocity—is signaled early and deepens when Kenji admits the rock’s oath. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he chooses to bring it, open it, listen. Cost is unmistakable: bearing others’ truths makes him heavier, transforming isolation into shared weight. Coincidence never resolves; pressure tightens through voluntary vulnerability under Mara’s “polite anarchy.”

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—navigating uncharted emotional depths—is signaled early and deepens through protagonist agency: Orrin chooses to enter the forest, follows the ring’s inward pull, and interprets notes as lost voices. The meaningful tightening occurs when he realizes the compass aligns to his unnamed ache, narrowing his quest from mapping others to confronting his own silence. Cost is unmistakable: each chord of memory adds weight, and the final “stay” forecloses escape. Pressure accumulates texturally under the Accumulative lens, with no reliance on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—editing personal history to redeem “wrong seeds”—tightens decisively when the pen’s first use alters a memory curve, narrowing future options (e.g., redirecting colleagues toward safer protocols). Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: each “unbend” ripples through contingent relationships, changing which signals reach the station. Cost is unmistakable on the page: “I could not bring back the child” underscores irreversibility, while revised despair carries forward as redirected action. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens—density of traced curves intensifies until cosmic causality itself “exhales,” validating the thematic calculus that kindness can reshape geometry without breaking time.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—translating silence into coherent music—is signaled early and deepens via Lena’s signing of “spaces between words.” Agency is fully hers: she chooses to sign swallowed confessions, enabling the advisor’s ritual. Cost is unmistakable: the “pressure in her chest” released as sorrow-joy melody, earned through vulnerability. One meaningful intensification (signing her loneliness) narrows options to this singular act of reclamation, consistent with Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—rescuing a promise buried by fire—is signaled early and deepens when the vandalized art reveals it was a message, not mindless destruction. The tightening occurs at the self-portrait: recognizing their own features forces confrontation with legacy. Agency drives escalation—the narrator copies symbols, follows trails, descends the well—and each act narrows options toward translation as sole restitution. Cost is unmistakable: the burned library cannot be undone, only answered.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—autonomy vs. institutional control—is signaled early (“guinea pigs not supposed to remember”) and deepens when entangled memories reveal collective resistance. Protagonist agency drives escalation: slipping behind pillars, drumming as signal, leaning into the “borrowed dream.” Cost is unmistakable: bearing others’ trauma (“aching familiarity”) while risking retribution. The tightening forecloses passive compliance, crystallizing stance in the final poise of open sky.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—preventing shutdown through retrieval—is clear early and tightens when radios fail and inspectors wander. Milo’s agency drives escalation: his pre-laid oiling and map-folding aren’t luck but preparation that forecloses shouting as viable. The cost is tangible: reputation, livelihood, and the implicit threat of obsolescence in a mechanized port. His whispered directions succeed precisely because they respect the maze’s acoustic ecology—a deepening that reweights human ingenuity against technological fragility.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—confession vs. silence—is signaled early and tightens when shutters clack “like teeth,” forcing the guardian’s purpose to sharpen. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: dentist’s deliberate shutter patterns and mirror tilt narrow options until he dials. Cost is unmistakable: “heart rattling,” avoided phone, sleepless pacing echoed in canal. Coincidence never resolves; empathy enables but doesn’t dictate change.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving the hillside woods—is signaled early and deepened through Daniel’s tactical shift from passive witness to orchestrator of visual dissent. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: each recruited shopkeeper narrows the margin for failure, culminating in a single night where success hinges on precise timing. The cost is unmistakable: victory arrives not through argument but through the erosion of certainty, leaving decision-makers haunted by beauty they can’t explain. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from Daniel’s quiet persistence.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—freedom through self-embrace—is signaled early (“after violence becomes impossible... sharper words”) and tightens when the pirate demands someone who “believes in strain.” Escalation is driven by Mara’s agency: returning alone, boarding the skiff, pressing bone to skin. Cost is unmistakable—her history of bodily dissociation (“detach mind from pain”) must be undone to hear the whale’s song. The disappearing island deepens stakes conceptually but remains secondary to Mara’s internal reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—grief’s illegality versus state-mandated joy—is signaled early and deepens when the performer chooses whittling over compliant performance. This act narrows options: Mara risks reporting them, yet obeys the stage direction to place the figure beside the bouquet. Cost is felt in Mara’s exhaustion and the ever-present turbine surveillance; the tightening occurs when crafting becomes rebellion. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, with no coincidental resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming language from state-enforced silence—tightens when Lio rejects the council’s “gratitude” script, choosing truth over compliance. His agency drives escalation: stepping through doors, walking the path, speaking literally. Cost is felt in the “taste of fear when a knock came at night” and the fragility of his certainty. The council’s off-stage presence applies coherent pressure without resolving conflict; victory is reconfiguring what “safe” art means.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—bearing the unbearable through imperfect beauty—is signaled early and deepens when fewer seek awakenings post-phoenix. The stranger’s request escalates pressure not through external threat but internal temptation: the “impossible” object demands her core ethos be tested. Her agency crystallizes in refusal of forgiveness, acceptance of witness; cost is legible in the courtyard’s heaviness and emptied pockets. One meaningful tightening suffices, executed with quiet precision.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether artificial pilgrimage can yield real connection—is signaled early and deepens when Elya questions its foundational assumption (guidance vs. mirroring). The tightening occurs not through external pressure but internal recalibration: her agency shifts from performer to participant, foreclosing the grant’s promised “metrics” in favor of unmeasurable honesty. Cost is felt in her relinquished authority and the university’s likely disapproval, yet the final step into the “lattice of tones” crystallizes her stance. Escalation is driven entirely by protagonist insight under an Accumulative lens, with no coincidental aid.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—transforming grief into generative art—is signaled early and deepens when Riv reveals the intention spectrometer. Ela’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to stitch herself into the building, navigate failure-constellations, and ultimately redirect her craft. Cost is unmistakable: reliving dates she tried to forget, enduring the “unbearable” method. The meteor shower complicates but doesn’t resolve; her epiphany emerges from prior choices under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—mapping belief after collapse—is signaled early and tightens when Jonas arrives, forcing Mara to confront that “we keep repeating this one.” Her agency drives escalation: choosing to share the tape, dealing the sigil, admitting “it is us.” Cost is unmistakable—abandoning predictive algorithms for uncertain “sideways” growth—and crystallizes in their joint card placement. The single meaningful deepening (from solitary ritual to shared pattern recognition) narrows options toward Earned Stasis in analog collaboration.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.6)
    Dominant stake—whether to risk consciousness for salvific knowledge—is signaled early and deepens as Hiran abandons randomness, allowing history to “pour through him as a focused beam.” Escalation is driven entirely by his agency: each door opened tightens the noose of pattern-recognition. Cost is unmistakable: innocence “flakes away,” replaced by unbearable clarity. The Council’s warning becomes prophecy through his defiance, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving lost futures—is signaled early and deepens when the unbound shadow reveals Lane’s vanished trajectory. Escalation is driven by Lio’s agency: he loads the tape, kneels, invites metamorphosis. The tightening forecloses his passive tending role; cost is felt in “ache...scorched him” and visible in his new burden. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each sensory beat reweights hope’s fragility.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming moral agency after complicity—is signaled early and tightens when Liora chooses to stay rather than flee again. The meaningful deepening occurs in her dialogue with Mara: “Guilt travels light” reframes her burden, leading to the pivotal choice to surrender the tail tip. This act forecloses the path of hoarding redemption and incurs the cost of public vulnerability. Pressure remains coherent under an Accumulative lens, with each beat intensifying thematic weight rather than external action.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—Mara’s need to reconcile her wound-opening compulsion with her desire for closure—tightens decisively when the plants reject her surgical “fix” (“We did not consent to silence”). Protagonist agency drives escalation: her demand (“Show me”) triggers the coffee-ring visions and hourglass revelation. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits her identity as healer to become a witness (“you will read them the way astronomers read craters”). The single deepening—realizing scars tell stories she can’t close—narrows her path with emotional precision.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—locating unused love—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when Mara touches the film, narrowing options from abstract search to concrete psychometry. The deepening occurs during vision immersion: each deleted scene (burned stubs, pressed flowers) raises emotional cost by revealing universal patterns of withheld affection. Agency is clear—Mara chooses to project, then reframe—and the climax (“can it be returned?”) forces a trade-off between restoration and reinterpretation. Cost is felt in her chest and crystallized in the final Charged Poise: unfinished reels now hold potential, not failure.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity—is signaled early and tightens through protagonist agency: climbing the archway, unfolding the astrolabe, lifting it toward the light. The escalation is Accumulative: density of murmurs → sharpened sentence → recognition of personal backlog → decisive release. Cost is unmistakable: the “unsung constellations” spill out, staining the world and leaving the narrator hollowed yet clear. Coincidence never resolves; every intensification stems from the narrator’s choices under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving unchosen possibilities—is signaled early and tightens when sparks begin accepting invented schedules, forcing the guard to escalate from passive watching to active mythmaking. Agency drives escalation: his whispered arrival times directly cause flags to twitch and “fresh tracks scar the air.” Cost is unmistakable in “stopping feels like erasing the dead,” linking endurance to moral obligation. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each added spark, each hummed lullaby, deepens the weight of witness without resolving it.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming the mind’s exiled frontier—is signaled early and deepens when the sixth sense awakens. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: he learns to read the forest’s sounds, then chooses to complete the mechanism. Cost is conceptual (loss of ordinary reality) but unmistakable in the pool’s reflection. Under an Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening suffices, though a second tactical loss (e.g., forfeiting return to city life) would heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—breaking the leash of inherited obligation—tightens when Mara flees, then crystallizes at the ferry house: “unused courage” must be claimed or lost. The deepening occurs on the stairs, where each recalled failure narrows her options to forward motion only. Cost is felt in every unspoken word now made step; agency lies in descent, not dialogue. Coincidence never resolves—only her choices do.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—cost of enforced silence—is signaled immediately and tightens when the bolt appears, forcing a choice that escalates to irreversible rupture. Protagonist agency drives every turn: he picks up the bolt, leads the woman, touches the bruise, speaks. The deepening isn’t external conflict but internal recalibration: obedience → curiosity → recognition → defiance. Cost is unmistakable—shattering bones, screaming nerves—and the final decision trades illusory safety for painful truth, narrowing all future paths.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preventing enthronement of a pretender—is signaled early and escalates through the titan’s agency: each cryptic insertion narrows the pretender’s legitimacy while deepening the cost of inaction. The tightening occurs not through physical confrontation but textual erosion, culminating in the scholar’s arrival as the sole conduit for truth. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure grows via density of symbols, not violence, and the cost is the titan’s enduring invisibility.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost oceanic memory—is signaled early and deepens when the atlas page appears. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: they match tapping rhythms to obsolete shipping lanes, provoking the ocean’s response. Cost is unmistakable: the narrator sacrifices rational detachment (“pretend [numbers] are less fragile”) and accepts a liminal existence (“drifting moored”). Pressure tightens coherently under Accumulative lens—each anomaly (buoys, fish, currents) compounds until the tide itself hesitates.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—keeping rebellion’s coals from freezing—is signaled early and deepens through Liora’s realization that meaning lies in stubborn humanity, not grand victory. Pressure escalates texturally: from solitude to imagined voices in static, culminating in her decisive comm message. The cost is legible in her fear and the movement’s fragmentation; her agency is limited but potent. While escalation lacks a causal “because/therefore,” it succeeds under the Accumulative lens by reweighting stakes through density and cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether to inherit or evolve tradition—is signaled early and tightens when the council arrives demanding restoration. Protagonist agency drives escalation: decoding the kite, reciting the song, asking the embryo’s consent. Cost is unmistakable: rejecting controllable order for uncertain autonomy, risking reconstruction’s fragile peace. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens, culminating in Charged Poise where all options are laid bare without resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—anchoring optimism in realism amid trauma—is signaled early and deepens through Mariam’s confrontation with the photograph and her own trembling hands. The tightening occurs when she renounces denial (“not hope exactly, and not denial”) and commits to listing “what she knew.” Cost is visible: her shoulder seizes, sleep is ruined, yet she walks back steadily. Agency lies in attention and endurance, not action, which fits the Accumulative lens perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming agency over fractured identity—is signaled early and tightens when Elias chooses to “descend into necessary darkness” instead of painting around edges. This deepening forces a trade-off: abandoning commissions for introspective portraits of “possible selves,” foreclosing professional survival for artistic integrity. The tremor in the stone and reflection of his lover escalate pressure coherently under the Accumulative lens. Cost is unmistakable: he must work in near-darkness, trusting only his hands.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding time’s “cuts”—tightens when ink reveals skipped moments, narrowing Iren’s goal from observation to potential traversal. The deepening (“Time does not slow; consciousness widens its eye”) shifts knowledge and raises stakes: stepping between cuts becomes possible. Cost is felt in Iren’s trauma and the universe’s “rationed awareness.” Escalation stems from Iren’s agency—pouring ink, interpreting patterns—not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—preserving contraband truth vs. maintaining systemic amnesia—is signaled early and deepens when Ana chooses neither destruction nor concealment but replication. This agency-driven escalation forecloses safety (risking treason) and reconfigures resistance as viral, not vaulted. Cost is unmistakable: she becomes “coward and conspirator,” bearing psychological fracture for potential collective thaw. Pressure remains coherent under the Hybrid lens, with the storm’s quiet intensifying rather than resolving tension.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—“to weave continuity through chaos”—is signaled early and deepened when raiders surrender blades, proving the farm’s moral gravity. Escalation occurs through Mara’s agency: she repurposes her father’s engraver, transforming fugitive-tracking talent into plant-whispering. Cost is unmistakable: she bears inherited enemies and debts while others sharpen knives; her endurance forecloses power, not safety. The tightening from bounty hunter’s heir to gardener of mercy narrows options with resonant consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—catching the echo to ask an unanswerable question—tightens when the garden’s throat demands voicing silence. His agency drives escalation: zigzagging through chords, shaping wordless breath into hush. Cost is unmistakable: the spike burns with “all the departures it once nailed down,” and his refusal forfeits answers for new rhythms. Coincidence never resolves; the sky’s stumble merely enables his earned choice.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. legacy—is signaled early and deepens when documents implicate the newspaper. Elena’s agency drives escalation: her proof-by-contradiction reasoning forecloses silence, forcing public intervention. Cost is unmistakable: inheriting “invisible machinery of guilt” means sacrificing familial power and trust. The tightening—from personal shock to systemic reckoning—is earned through protagonist-led logic under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—silencing guilt through recovered voice—is signaled early and tightens when the firmware mimics the brother’s cry via infantile static.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—discovering meaning in the mess—is signaled early and tightened when Lark’s socially perceptive eye shifts from observing pilgrims to engaging the boy. Her agency drives escalation: picking up the tile flake breaches ritual passivity; whispering to the boy breaches silence; drawing with whispers redefines the ceremony. Cost is unmistakable: she accepts that her art now bears ethical weight (“could never again pretend her art was harmless”). The unlearning timeframe applies coherent pressure—certainties must dissolve, and Lark’s resistance gives way to reframing.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—whether kindness must be rationed—is signaled early and deepens when Laleh defies scarcity logic by renaming, not conquering. Escalation is driven by her agency: stepping on mosaic chips, pressing the tessera, speaking new names. The cost is felt in social isolation (“people distrusted her”) and physical loss (flesh arms burned), culminating in the risk of rejection when she opens her arms. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure tightens via sensory and linguistic layering until the plaza “tilts.”

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving theatrical memory against erasure—is signaled early (“theater is going to be gutted”) and deepens via Lina’s revelation that the tarot coin is a key. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she enters the maze, presents the coin, proposes intertwining timelines. Cost is unmistakable—“all that will be left is the maze”—and narrows options to one fragile ritual. The tightening forecloses passive mourning; they must actively weave possibility back from despair’s brink, with visible emotional and conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—managing involuntary empathy—is signaled early and tightens when Eli realizes he soaked in audience emotions without consent. The deepening comes via Naya’s prompt to “show me your haunted corridors,” forcing active engagement over passive suffering. Cost is felt in tangled knots of shared hurt and the visible relief when redirected. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, though the shift from burden to tool leans slightly conceptual over visceral consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—translating human emotion for future intelligences—is signaled early and deepens when the spiral pattern implies nonhuman presence. Iri’s agency drives escalation: kneeling to read heat, retrieving the fossil, then floating to speak directly to the unknown. Each act narrows options (from observer to participant) with felt cost: data gives way to intuition, neutrality to vulnerability. Coincidence never resolves; the spiral’s origin remains mysterious, but Iri’s response crystallizes under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—freedom of interpretation vs. enforced prophecy—is signaled early and tightens when Mara confronts the smudged “discordant” crate. Her agency drives escalation: mapping via buttons, whispering the counter-seal, tipping the jar. The deepening occurs when she hears the echo not as prediction but “tangled invitation,” crystallizing her stance. Cost is conceptual but undeniable: she forfeits the safety of obedience, unleashing chaos the Council cannot bind. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether broken things can be fixed—is signaled early and deepened through Elias’s decoding of snow patterns, culminating in the choice to wait rather than act rashly. The tightening occurs when he matches Mara’s numbers to the field depressions, transforming passive observation into active interpretation. Cost is felt in his throat tightening at “Fix what breaks”—a phrase that reweights his entire mission. Agency drives escalation; coincidence plays no role.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—distilling passengers’ complexity into essence—is signaled early and deepens when the mother’s plea threatens to overwrite his accumulated vows. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: his ambient awareness detects the new “ink,” his ritual with the needle steadies him, and his choice to wait three breaths creates space for integration. Cost is unmistakable: he bears the weight of others’ unspoken fears, and the final crossing demands endurance, not resolution. The boy’s “puzzled patience” and the mother’s dry eyes heighten tension without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—why some places resist change—is signaled early and deepens through the potter’s agency: his ritual walk, seed placement, and observation through the glass narrow possibilities and reveal cost. The meaningful tightening occurs when he sees two timelines diverge from a tiny gesture (water vs. swat), forcing him to choose kindness despite uncertainty. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, and the cost—years of carrying seeds “without much conviction”—alters his final tactic. Coincidence never resolves; all insight stems from his deliberate attention.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—creating “small, improbable safeties” in an unsafe world—is signaled early and deepens when Mara realizes she’s been gardening like her father tended locks. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: she transforms passive tending into active construction, using saved shards to redirect light. The cost is visible in her self-aware vulnerability (“feels both foolish and fiercely tender”) and the implicit labor of repurposing broken things. Though coincidence (the barge’s moonbeam) complicates, resolution stems entirely from Mara’s choice to hang the tooth and arrange the shards—no external rescue, only earned reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—translating isolation into independence—is signaled early and deepens when the reincarnated self appears. Escalation is driven by Lio’s agency: aligning the sundial summons the reflection, forcing a confrontation with past failure. Cost is unmistakable: extinction cannot be undone, only prepared for. The tightening forecloses retreat into pure solitude, demanding active stewardship.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to unsaid connections—is signaled early and deepens when the narrator realizes they too seek rejoining. The tightening occurs when the architect reveals the nest as seed, forcing the writer to shift from ghosting others’ love to articulating universal absence. Agency is clear: choosing to write *this* letter forecloses personal resolution for communal offering. Cost is felt in the “uncoiling” that follows—a release born of sacrifice, not victory.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving open, student-controlled airwaves against militarized enclosure—is signaled early and tightens when the Void signal changes post-announcement. Mara’s interference deepens pressure: she weaponizes campus fracture as subsonic bait, raising stakes from observation to active negotiation with cosmic entities. Cost is legible: if she fails, the Void vanishes into classified channels; if she succeeds, she binds human vulnerability to alien attention. Escalation is driven by her agency under an Accumulative lens—each signal flare correlates to campus events, culminating in tonight’s live debate.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the key—tightens when spatial mutiny manifests in diverging halls, forcing a choice with mortal consequence (“air itself might tighten until his ribs protested”). Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: aligning the compass fragment triggers architectural response, proving spatial rebellion is real. Cost is unmistakable—the explorer trades open sky for buried lung, enduring claustrophobia to fulfill legacy. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens via sensory intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—awakening dormant empathy in a killer through absence—is signaled early and deepens via Jonas’s painting process. Pressure tightens when Rhea asks if the killer will return; Jonas reframes agency as haunting (“whoever they used to be will”). Cost is legible: thirteen years of institutional neglect, the weight of an empty file, the emotional toll of painting ghosts. Escalation is driven by Jonas’s choices (mixing paint, marking jawlines), not coincidence, under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—rectifying ancestral erasure—is signaled early and deepens when Liora decodes Tamar’s reversible exile. Agency drives escalation: her cataloging uncovers sabotage confessions, leading to the director confrontation and digital insurgency. Cost is felt in isolation (“first cohort, officially”) and bodily dread, but the tightening forecloses passive acceptance. Coincidence (supply drone drop) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Liora’s choices earn the reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—forgiving or erasing the hitchhiker’s vanishing—is signaled early and deepens when the fiddler realizes he must “chisel him free.” Escalation is driven by agency: his playing intensifies from melody to “recount of remembered tolls,” actively smearing timelines. Cost is unmistakable: bow hair frays, the glass shatters, and the burden of choosing which frames to forgive is “impossibly heavy.” Coincidence complicates (the hitchhiker’s initial refusal) but resolution stems from the fiddler’s song.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—turning fragmented value into fluid capital—is signaled early and tightens when regulation “frowns” while investors “smile.” Protagonist agency drives escalation: hiding drives, coding territorial signs, choosing the train over office. Cost crystallizes in “currencies so devalued they were worth more as stories,” with visible forfeiture of startup dreams. One deepening (Lila’s “wrong circus” insight) suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—decoding whether dreams are delusion or cosmic ledger—is signaled early and tightens when variable stars align with catastrophe coordinates. Agency lies in collaborative interpretation, not action; the meaningful deepening occurs when the temple reveals itself as a “ledger of burdens.” Cost is conceptual yet undeniable: the realization that suffering was meant to be shared, not borne alone. Coincidence (the telegram) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the work is done through careful matching.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—recovering the unshown truth of his sister’s disappearance—is signaled early and deepens when Arlen realizes the orchard feeds on guilt. The meaningful tightening occurs when he identifies the seed’s hunger, narrowing his tactic to verbal confession. Cost is legible: his whispered admission risks feeding the plant but is the only path to truth. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens—awareness widens circles until the seed responds.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving or severing the eclipsed covenant—is signaled early and deepens when the shared vision reveals catastrophic costs of either choice. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her scar-linking initiates the vision that forces Lio’s crystallization. The “anxious elation” tonal pressure tightens into decisive poise with unmistakable conceptual cost: time’s sequence may shatter, or nightmares may strand humanity. No coincidence resolves; only earned, costly insight.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—becoming a witness who stays—is signaled early and tightens when the narrator substitutes hand for memory, accepting partial offering. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing what to place, articulating desire (“not pardon… just a chance”), enabling Lio’s ritual. Cost is unmistakable: Lio’s aging embodies the orchard’s hunger. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each added detail (bones, runes, blood) deepens the moral weight without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—whether this amp is “his”—is signaled early and deepens into a crisis of identity versus professional credibility. The tightening occurs when Eli recognizes the grille scrap, forcing a choice between factual appraisal and emotional truth. Cost is felt: his suspension, divorce, and bus abandonment converge in this moment. Though escalation is internal, it’s driven by protagonist agency (touching, inspecting, writing), not coincidence, satisfying Situational lens pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding transition physics—is signaled early and deepens when the guide’s vanishing proves the tablets true. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she places the seed, speaks Sumerian, chooses refusal. The tightening forecloses treasure-seeking (others flee) and personal ambition (she rejects fame). Cost is unmistakable: isolation, lost career revival, and the weight of unshareable knowledge. Coincidence complicates (guide’s sudden death) but doesn’t resolve; Mara’s stance crystallizes under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder amid temporal collapse—is signaled early and deepens when unbound identities arrive. The librarian’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to smelt contradictions rather than follow manuals, narrowing his options to a single risky method. Cost is unmistakable: his gears burn with molten selves, and the fisherman risks dissolution. The tightening culminates in a trade-off—wholeness through contradiction, not coherence—that reweights all prior repetitions.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—whether survival shelters preserve or suffocate hope—is signaled early and tightens when Mara confronts the pearl. Her agency drives escalation: choosing to confess transforms the shelter’s meaning. Cost is unmistakable: she admits complicity in building emotional tombs, foreclosing her former detached professionalism. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with the “heartbeat of hesitation” serving as live clock that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness through truthful witnessing—is signaled early and deepens when graffiti challenges the narrator’s self-conception. Agency emerges in micro-choices: touching the tape, entering the bathroom, pressing the key, writing both names. The tightening occurs at the mirror’s inscription, which forecloses the path of self-flagellation. Cost is felt in the “shaking hands” and the irreversible shift from archivist to participant, though the escalation leans slightly more on revelation than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—accessing the unspoken—is signaled early and deepens when she realizes documentation would “misrepresent it entirely.” The tightening occurs when she abandons mapping for participation, a choice driven by her agency under Accumulative pressure. Cost is unmistakable: she sacrifices professional identity (Institute resignation) and future advocacy (Council letter) to honor the library’s logic. The watch’s cyclic time and silence-as-vandalism rules cohere into a single escalating pressure that crystallizes her stance without coincidence or external rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—authenticating a myth versus honoring truth—is signaled early and tightens when coffee stains reveal destiny’s perforation. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: she chooses marginalia over compliance, forcing a third path. Cost is unmistakable: the empire learns doubt, the queen’s song may vanish, and her professional credibility risks fracture. Plant whispers and coffee augury aren’t coincidence—they’re tools that deepen her dilemma under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—capturing the last spark before oblivion—is signaled early and deepens when Isren appears. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she adapts her method (chip to sternum), risking everything. Cost is unmistakable: the cracked chip, trembling hands, and the threat of Isren drifting “faceless into the dark.” Under the Accumulative lens, pressure tightens via auroral thickening and the grotto’s “inhale,” culminating in a single clear tone that reconfigures stillness as shared resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—seeking contentment as reward for forgiveness—is signaled early and deepens when the old woman reframes it as misunderstanding. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to touch the smoke, triggering the vision that forecloses her prior stance. Cost is unmistakable: the dissolution of her identity as sole moral arbiter, paid through visceral disorientation in the tree-vision sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—certainty’s blinding glare versus doubt’s clarifying hush—is signaled early and deepens when Mara confesses her fear of moral diminishment. Protagonist agency drives escalation: asking for raw fear (not rehearsed belief) forces Mara’s pivotal whisper, which narrows options from binary right/wrong to “kinds of unfinished sorrow.” Cost is unmistakable: she cannot reclaim her wife or undo the storm-choice, only endure its weight. The cloak of doubt’s thinning into “ordinary morning chill” makes conceptual price tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—learning to vanish without fleeing—is signaled early and deepened through Elian’s refusal to demonstrate spectacle. The tightening occurs when Mora feels “the shape of a self that might choose not to return,” narrowing her options from desire to discernment. Cost is unmistakable: the “painful and bright” rush of reappearing after near-erasure. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (Mora’s breath falling into ring-spaces) under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—navigating without moving—is signaled early and deepens through the protagonist’s realization that the wandering pulse belongs to countless unfinished choices, not just his own. His agency drives escalation: selecting stones, reading birds, and finally stilling himself transforms passive waiting into active attunement. The cost (eternal non-movement, relinquishing rivers for sound) is unmistakable in the flock’s departure and his spinal fusion with bone. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens, with each echo narrowing options until stillness becomes the only viable path.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming agency in a world that discards human creativity—is signaled early and deepens when Orren chooses to follow the keystone over protocol. The meaningful tightening occurs when he unstraps the harness, foreclosing safe retreat. Cost is felt in his remembered humiliation and physical fear of falling, though the final act leans more on conceptual than visceral price. Escalation is driven by Orren’s micro-choices, not coincidence, under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—discovering the color of sound—is signaled early and deepens into the higher-stakes need to voice vulnerable truth. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: Elias chooses to follow the hum, enter the wreck, and finally speak his vow. Cost is unmistakable: he trades the safety of factual hiding for the risk of broken promises, crystallized in the green resonance that “rang against his ribs like a bell.” The sky lantern release tightens time subtly, isolating him on the pier and enabling the discovery, though coincidence (the falling tag) complicates without resolving.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether to trust chance or assume authorship of fate—is signaled early and tightens when the backwards prophecy commands “Do not cast again.” Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing to heed the warning forecloses their identity, raising emotional cost. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each static burst deepens urgency until the final hum demands commitment. Coincidence complicates (inverted message arrives “already inverted”) but resolution stems from their joint tuning—a renunciation with visible cost (abandoning the bowl).

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—naming nameless fears—is signaled early and tightens through protagonist agency: he chooses which recordings to play, how to arrange lenses, when to speak names. Each ritual forecloses destruction (his former role) for witness, costing him peace (“hollow instrument” chest). The escalation from one fear (“being forgotten”) to many (“smothering loss, sudden betrayal”) deepens pressure without coincidence, culminating in a stance crystallized by sacrifice’s echo.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—restoring a drowned announcement—is signaled early and deepens via Tamsin’s realization that “the world was balanced on falling drops.” Pressure escalates through her unique method: aligning drips becomes the tightening that narrows options to one fragile act. Agency is clear—she chooses to listen, to lean the bell, to speak—and cost is felt in her exposure (“faith baked thin and hard”) and the ocean’s tilt. Coincidence (the bell washing ashore) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from her peculiar, earned attention.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—whether to treat the resurfacing as engineering problem or communal memory—is signaled early and tightens when photographs reveal intentional curation. Tomas’s agency drives escalation: he follows the trail, interprets intent (“wanted him to remember stories”), and chooses narrative over report. Cost is unmistakable: defying the council’s expected erasure risks his role, yet his breath “soft” amid rising pressure shows calibrated risk. Coincidence (finding Mara’s photo) complicates but doesn’t resolve—he acts on accumulated evidence, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—harmonizing logic and intuition—is signaled early and tightens when starlings defy calculation, forcing Elian to choose between control and trust. His pivot (three-degree lens turn by rhythm, not math) narrows options irrevocably. Cost is felt in surrendered authority and exposed sentiment. Escalation stems from protagonist agency under Accumulative lens, with each failed prediction deepening the crisis until surrender becomes the only viable tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—preserving trust under pressure—is signaled early and deepens when the intercepted message reveals a “promise of protection that was really a threat.” Escalation is driven entirely by protagonist agency: fingers tease sound from static, muscles override fear, judgment weighs rhythms against “honest pleas.” The tightening forecloses both late reporting (betrayal) and early reporting (shattered alliances), forcing a razor-thin window of action. Cost is unmistakable: the world never knows how close its trust came to falling.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—custody of consciousness to combat numbness—is signaled early and tightens when Kesh introduces memory-striking blades, forcing trade-offs: each parry or strike alters what can be felt. Protagonist agency drives escalation; choosing to defend memories over attack deepens his emotional reawakening. Cost is unmistakable: preserving guilt means accepting monstrous potential in the jarred mind, while victory risks becoming unrecognizable. The single meaningful tightening (from abstract custody claim to embodied memory defense) suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving curiosity as currency—tightens when the seed demands surrender of control. Elias’s agency drives escalation: choosing to follow coordinates, dig, and plant despite fear. The cost is conceptual but undeniable: his sanctuary will become an “entrance,” losing its current purity. Coincidence (mysterious mail) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the deepening comes from his receptivity enabling transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—restoring Mara’s unfinished laughter—is signaled early and deepens through Lysander’s agency: he chooses midnight, selects three machines, modulates pitch to coax phantom jokes. The meaningful tightening occurs when engines split into “pockets where those half-jokes catch and bloom,” directly triggering the parents’ laughter. Cost is unmistakable: the household’s silence is broken at the price of Lysander’s perpetual, unfinishable labor. Coincidence doesn’t resolve; every effect stems from his deliberate, flawed orchestration.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—dimensional homesickness—is signaled early and tightens when the guardian declares “You crossed without knocking,” foreclosing easy return. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: choosing to sit, then declaring “Why not both,” which prompts the guardian’s trust. Cost is legible in the final beat—the pendant’s warmth implies future disorientation (“walk where light forgets its edges”), and the library’s kindness is “almost,” not assured. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via sensory and conceptual density until the choice crystallizes.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—agency over imposed destiny—is signaled early and deepens when Corren chooses creative destruction over repair. Escalation is driven by his agency: stepping into the ring, grasping the crozier, using the lens—all narrow options while raising cost (exposure, moral risk). The “penny drops” moment isn’t passive realization but active commitment: “vivify the unchosen paths instead.” Cost is unmistakable: the crozier crumbles, his anonymity evaporates, and the kingdom’s ideological machinery exhales its last breath—felt in wardens’ wet eyes and the dead metal ring in his pocket.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes escalate coherently under the Accumulative lens: from interpreting signals to mediating a city’s suicidal longing. The tightening occurs when the narrator realizes they must choose between catastrophic collapse or eternal stasis—both unacceptable. Their agency shines in the compromise: redirecting the signal toward piecemeal deconstruction. The cost is felt in bodily resonance (“chest vibrated like an untuned drum”) and the dissolution of the shard, which leaks stillness into their veins, aligning them irrevocably with the towers’ fate.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—steering the ferry to merge timelines—is signaled early and tightens when Eli tunes the radio toward a “single clear note.” Pressure escalates through embodied cost: tingling teeth, knuckles aching on the rail, the weight of vanished passengers. The deepening occurs when passengers form a “crooked circle,” transforming passive riders into co-navigators. Eli’s agency drives every turn; coincidence complicates (fog of “unsaid possibilities”) but never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (“remember without hurting”) tightens meaningfully: initial request for “something sturdier” evolves into the impossible choice at the silhouette-doorway, foreclosing both resolution and escape. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency—their weaving alters space, summoning reflections that force confrontation with mutable memory. Cost is visceral (“chest tightened”) yet legible in environmental response (“corridors of blame into slow spirals”). The architect’s warning (“memory will harden”) crystallizes stakes without coincidence resolving pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—learning true navigation—is signaled early and deepens when Mirror reframes it as reading “edges of absence.” Protagonist agency drives escalation: declining then accepting the meeting, unclasping the chain to frame new stars. Cost is unmistakable: relinquishing pole-star certainty for gradient-based movement, with emotional toll (“something old in me ached”). The tightening forecloses surface-bound navigation forever, altering future cadets’ trajectories.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—protecting vulnerable voices—intensifies when protocol demands filing Lale’s death as data, but Eren’s curiosity forces a trade-off: career safety vs. delivering her unsent plea. The tightening occurs at the kitchenette, where unsent voice messages reveal Deniz as the living heart needing closure, narrowing Eren’s options to one fraught call. Cost is legible: his “routine postmortem tracing” lie to the guard risks credibility, and the final act carries emotional weight without fixing anything—only “tilting” grief. Agency drives escalation; coincidence (torn chain lock) complicates but doesn’t resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—retrieve the artifact before tides return—deepens into an ethical dilemma: deliver the sphere or honor the “unremembered voices” within. The tightening occurs when Noah learns the gold fleck is a calibrant, transforming the mission from salvage to stewardship. Agency remains his throughout; the temporal drift warning forces a clear trade-off. Though external pressure (tides) drives urgency, the internal escalation—realizing the sphere contains “souls too faint to name”—carries the true cost, rendered with quiet intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—resurrecting Lian’s voice—tightens when he realizes linear reconstruction fails, forcing nonlinear coding that risks total system collapse. Agency drives escalation: his spilled-tea insight alters tactics, narrowing options to one last-night gamble. Cost is felt in lost time (three winters), institutional exile, and accepting incompleteness (“gaps feel less like loss”). Coincidence (static crackle) complicates but doesn’t resolve—he earns her voice through revised method.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—resurrecting a dead language through embodied translation—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency: he chooses to enter the tunnel, press the diamond, whisper syllables, and finally *sing* despite knowing the cost. The meaningful deepening occurs when he realizes the curse entwines stories, forcing him to accept merger rather than mere recording. Cost is unmistakable: his voice braided into the language, foreclosing pure observer status. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each echo, ridge, and bird pattern intensifies the need for synthesis.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding what takes people—tightens when the phone reveals confessions-as-seeds, forcing the researcher to abandon extraction for witness. Agency is shown through tactile choices (accepting the phone, resisting cataloging), and the cost is conceptual: the institute’s framework becomes obsolete. Escalation is driven by the protagonist’s willingness to listen, not coincidence, under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—beauty vs. mechanization—is signaled early and tightens when the locust shell forces Lio to choose between playing for the city or the orchard. His agency drives escalation: matching the vegetal pulse initiates irreversible change. Cost is visceral (machinists stumble, lights die) and conceptual (generational darkness). The deepening—from performance to rebellion—is earned through his prior fragility and culminates in a trade-off: safety for transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—delivering continuities across a fractured border—is signaled early and deepens when the thunderstorm bottle reframes mail as emotional weather control. Eren’s agency drives escalation: he chooses the long route to avoid drones, accepts the bottle without question, and stands by as Mara weighs uncorking it. Cost is unmistakable: every missing name, unmarked grave, and bullet hole embodies what’s already lost; releasing the storm risks more. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, tightening from personal grief to collective reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—interpreting silence as possibility—is signaled early and deepens when Eli chooses to sing, narrowing his path from passive salvage to active creation. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: his voice directly triggers the carousel’s motion and halo’s response, with cost visible in the "quiet click" of displaced fear. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens—each sensory detail (bells, dust, light) tightens the thematic coil until singing becomes inevitable. Coincidence (wrong turn) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the oasis only matters because Eli acts within it.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—locating the origin of stories—is signaled early and deepens when the poet’s hesitation crystallizes Mariel’s theory into lived truth. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: her nightly diagrams, star-marking, and path-walking narrow possibilities until the hyperbolic map collapses into simplicity. Cost is felt in the quiet relinquishment of control; her elaborate system yields to receptivity. Pressure coheres entirely within the Accumulative lens, intensifying through density rather than external opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preventing the islands’ dissolution through capturing dawn—is signaled early and tightens as each sunrise costs Irena emotional substance. Agency is clear: she chooses to rise before fishermen, climb cliffs, and absorb the light despite growing hollowness. Escalation peaks when villagers bring offerings, raising emotional stakes beyond geography to collective memory. Final act crystallizes stance under coherent pressure: she sacrifices inner fullness to vitalize external reality—a trade-off with visible, irreversible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—freeing an idea trapped behind fear—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the protagonist chooses gratitude over resistance. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: bringing the vial, showing it, then choosing to thank fear. Cost is unmistakable: years of silence, the “ache” of unsaid things, and the vulnerability of release. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure grows via sensory and symbolic density until the climactic uncorking reweights all prior tension.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—recovering stolen memories—is signaled early and escalates through the protagonist’s agency: he chooses to kneel, to press fingers into the ring, knowing it will fray other knowledge. The deepening occurs when he realizes the bargain continues, forcing a trade-off between completeness and coherence. Cost is unmistakable: “for every recollection that returned, something else frayed.” Pressure tightens under an Accumulative lens, culminating in a stance crystallization that forecloses a tidy life.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reversing the city’s self-erasure—is signaled early and tightens when Jun’s permanent forgetting is commuted to mirror-exile, forcing Rhea to mentor “quietly.” This deepening narrows options: Rhea must use her archival tools (tea leaves, vellum) not just to record but to forge resilience. Cost is unmistakable—her throat burned from arguing, the compromise “tastes of ash”—and Jun’s fear (“knees will want to flee”) makes stakes visceral. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens, with each detail (shards, steam, annotation) intensifying the moral weight of memory.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder against encroaching grayness—is signaled early and deepens when the heirloom seed demands an “insatiably creative heart.” Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: their imagined city mural transforms the seed, narrowing options from passive observer to active weaver. Cost is unmistakable: they trade numb survival for vulnerable creation, risking further loss. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each sensory layer tightens the thematic knot until the parapet becomes a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—restoring a name to lay spirits to rest—is signaled early and tightens through protagonist agency: each knot untied narrows options until only the “star-knot” remains, demanding a moral trade-off (keep the name or release it). Escalation follows the Accumulative lens: density increases as voices spill out, culminating in the captain’s direct challenge (“Will you keep what you hear?”). Cost is unmistakable—Ilan’s vow to hold then relinquish the name carries emotional weight that reconfigures his entire practice. Coincidence (old woman’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Ilan’s choices drive every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—interpreting silence with empathy—tightens when Elias witnesses the second reel’s apologetic choreography, forcing a renunciation of archival neutrality. His agency drives escalation: he leans closer not to decode words but to feel speech rhythm, transforming passive viewing into ethical stance. Cost is visible in the frescoes’ degradation, framed as accidental betrayal. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—honoring a stranger’s last transmission about letting go—is signaled early and deepens when the note reveals the physicist’s hypothesis. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: reading the note forces a moral calculus between preservation and release. Cost is unmistakable: choosing partial salvage means accepting incomplete understanding, a conceptual price that reweights the entire dive. Pressure tightens coherently under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (“articulate unspoken needs”) tightens when the wall replies, forcing Lio from encoding to co-creation. His agency drives escalation: fitting the bolt plate initiates the ghost’s demand (“Teach us how to answer”), raising stakes from personal expression to communal catharsis. Cost is unmistakable—the city’s burdens become his to channel, foreclosing his solitary artistry. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each lightning flash intensifies the feedback loop.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—decoding anguish to find joy—is signaled early and tightens when Etta chooses consolation over force at the lock. Her agency drives escalation: theft enables ascent, goggles enable reading, empathy enables unlocking. Cost is felt in her unchanged status post-descent; the diary’s method is her only gain, carrying invisible weight. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each floor climbed intensifies isolation, culminating in a choice that redefines her relationship to pain.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—proving empty spaces remember—is signaled early and deepens when instruments confirm velocity matches past departures, transforming hypothesis into evidence. Pressure escalates through protagonist agency: Mara chooses to listen, to categorize, to write, to trust the drift. The meaningful tightening occurs when crosswind reveals “tracks laid by earlier flights,” foreclosing return and forcing acceptance of spooled wholeness as physical law. Cost is legible: she abandons ground validation for solitary, unverifiable truth.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving interior skies against erasure—is signaled early and deepens when Mara chooses compression over cataloging. The tightening occurs at the second horn: space runs out, forcing conceptual surrender that becomes revelation. Agency is clear: she initiates the commission, accesses the safe, and paints despite time and physical limits. Cost is felt in the warping boards and the acceptance that some skies must be bounded to survive.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—charting stranded luminance—is signaled immediately and deepens when Lio converts idle watching into coded notation. The tightening occurs when patterns align with starlings, transforming play into provable method. Orvan’s demand for proof raises stakes without coincidence; Lio’s agency (calling out steps) directly shapes the ship’s course. Cost is felt in chalk-smudged vulnerability and the burden of unproven truth.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—repairing what broke “so quietly no one remembered how it used to sound”—is signaled early and deepens through each mirror encounter, narrowing options from abstract quest to intimate, costly interventions. Agency is clear: the protagonist chooses which gears to lift, when to listen, how long to endure the stinging cold. Each repair exacts emotional toll (“fingers chapped, eyes stinging”), and the final thaw is earned through cumulative pressure, not coincidence. The tightening from prophecy gathering to mirror work creates a single, decisive intensification under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—saving orchards through collective action—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Kerran writes “Move now” after the bell cracks. Protagonist agency drives escalation: chalk messages → reexamined plans → grav-cranes deployed. Cost is unmistakable: elders abandon heirlooms, ladders spill like “discarded vertebrae.” The nebula complicates but doesn’t resolve—their labor earns respite.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—altering how time accounts for human tenderness—is signaled early and deepens when the protagonist substitutes the puppet for the master key. Escalation is driven by his agency: each chamber adjustment “tilts” outcomes toward mercy, narrowing the path to universal salvation in favor of intimate grace. Cost is unmistakable: he accepts ongoing loss (“world would still burn”) but secures “rooms [that] remain intact.” Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, culminating in the clock’s self-erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—defying the orchard’s fatalistic design—is signaled early and escalates through each traveler guided. The tightening arrives with the blueprint-seeker: now the caretaker must choose whether to perpetuate his curse or risk freeing the orchard (and himself). Cost is unmistakable: his identity as defier versus liberator hangs on one decision, with the orchard’s hunger and the birds’ judgment raising stakes organically. Agency drives escalation; coincidence never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—translating separation into connection—is signaled early and tightens when Mara shifts from penance (“sketching foam”) to active reimagining (“polymer strands that could unzip and rejoin”). Agency drives escalation: her decision to invite Leo’s “absent judgment” alters tactics, leading to the prototype’s success. Cost is unmistakable—the promotion and office are hollow trophies—and the final trade-off (carrying chrysalis vs. accepting congratulations) forecloses professional validation for emotional integrity. Coincidence never resolves; even the chrysalis discovery is framed as earned attention (“she noticed”).

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—access to unburdened beginnings—is signaled early and tightens when the woman arrives seeking “previewed and returned” lives. The escalation hinges on protagonist agency: together they pour moonlight onto slate, revealing paths neither chose, transforming abstract longing into legible ledger. Cost is unmistakable: confronting stacked refusals and rejected selves deepens their awareness of fractures. The single meaningful tightening (shared revelation) narrows options to signing or walking away.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—managing collective remorse without being subsumed—is signaled early and tightens when Rafi tastes the soldier’s massacre shard and chooses burial over use. This deepening narrows his options: only select regrets can be “sandpapered” into food. Agency is clear in each tasting decision, with visible cost in his shaking hands and braced stance. Pressure accumulates texturally but coherently under the lens, culminating in a meal that dulls blades “just enough not to draw blood.”

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—rehabilitating isolation into connection—is signaled by Mara’s vocation and deepened when the elevator speaks in fractured harvest metaphors. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: convening singers, descending into the silo, translating multilingually. Cost is unmistakable: weeks of labor, vulnerability to skepticism, physical risk in clearing chokes. The tightening—from ache to whisper to voice—narrows options until only collective action remains, culminating in a city-wide resonance that forecloses solitary hoarding forever.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—housing neglected stories—is signaled by Lio’s ambition and deepened when the device entangles countless dreams instead of isolating one. His agency drives escalation: choosing to “surrender into complexity” rather than stabilize, thereby accepting emotional and neurological cost. The canyon’s calming heartbeat confirms stakes were coherent and pressure resolved through protagonist-led reconfiguration, not coincidence. Cost is legible in every filament “pruning paths that merely echoed fear.”

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—accessing forbidden knowledge before time runs out—is signaled immediately and escalates through protagonist agency: he follows the doodle’s path, endures threshold effects, and submits to the chains’ judgment. The tightening occurs when the lightning-wrapped codex assesses his pulse, forcing him to prove his tempered curiosity isn’t cruelty—a trade-off shaped by prior training. Cost is unmistakable: the hour wanes visibly, gravity reasserts, and he emerges forever changed, bearing silent guardianship. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, deepening through sensory and spatial intensification rather than external opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—creating music in silence—is signaled immediately and deepens when Ina joins, transforming solitary ritual into shared risk. The tightening occurs when they brace on leaf litter: stakes shift from personal obsession to collective attunement. Cost is felt in exhaustion and the irreversible commitment to non-auditory connection; the world doesn’t “give back” sound but reconfigures meaning through motion.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reshaping the eclipsed covenant to allow beauty within difficulty—is signaled early and tightens when Oren realizes outright cancellation would unravel peace. His agency drives escalation: he doesn’t wait for revelation but applies chess discipline to translate silence, narrowing options to a single counteroffer. Cost is unmistakable—exile as legal sacrifice, debts calcifying into legend—and the moon-phase deadline forces irreversible commitment. Coincidence never resolves; the covenant’s shift responds only to his earned stance.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—cataloging silence to soften human collision—is signaled early and deepens when Elias realizes silence isn’t empty but “crowded with sirens she had heard.” The tightening occurs through protagonist agency: he angles a microphone toward the journal, an absurd yet active choice that escalates his quest into emotional risk. Cost is unmistakable: confronting Mira’s unspoken grief means accepting his own complicity in ignoring systemic violence. Coincidence (fireworks timing) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the ignition glare merely illuminates his earned decision.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—whether to descend into rot or learn to listen to trembling—is signaled early and deepens when Liora reframes the corpse flower not as threat but as teacher. Her agency drives escalation: she bargained labor and confession for the seed, then demands its planting on the highest branch. Cost is unmistakable: elders’ distrust, communal risk, personal exposure. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure tightens through cadence shift—from dawn’s unraveling mist to dusk’s iron-taste—and culminates in a single, irreversible act with generational consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—discovering why this world endures—is signaled early and escalates via Lio’s agency: he retrofits a glider, rides the inversion, follows water uphill, enters the forbidden grove. Each choice narrows options (abandoning motor, crossing threshold) and deepens knowledge until the arrow tip reframes resilience as intentional legacy. Cost is conceptual but legible: the universe’s cruelty is countered only by acts of stubborn care, now Lio’s to carry. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preventing future disasters through foresight—is signaled early and deepened when wind data contradicts logs. The investigator’s agency drives escalation: he walks paths, notes gusts, and models vectors. The tightening occurs when he realizes the absence of wind records is the true failure. Cost is felt in the silent town, severed power, and the ghost of his mentor’s death.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—certifying wonder as essential—is signaled early and tightens when Ilen fears a world that “might no longer notice when silence changed.” The escalation is driven by his agency: waiting, reading, withholding, then releasing. The cost is conceptual but undeniable—the risk that art’s sacred pause vanishes without tending—and crystallizes in the final breath shared between sculptor and bell ringer. Pressure coheres entirely under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding failure—is signaled early and tightens when Cael realizes he “mistook duty for conversation,” foreclosing his old identity. The deepening is protagonist-driven: arranging driftwood markers shows agency, but the true escalation comes from internal pressure (the boy’s haunted face). Cost is unmistakable: peace feels like exile, and the final imperfect note accepts brokenness as the only bridge. Under the Accumulative lens, cadence shift from ceremonial rigidity to raw vulnerability reweights the entire premise.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—understanding the “mathematics of emotion”—is signaled early and deepens when the narrator chooses an unsolvable feeling over a cliché. The tightening occurs at the press: pulling the lever without deciding the outcome forecloses control, forcing surrender to ambiguity. Cost is unmistakable in the geometry’s dissolution and the narrator’s staggered return, now burdened with others’ decisions as internal variables. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, with each sensory layer raising emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—coaxing wonder from routine—is signaled early and deepens when the aurora’s intensity forces confrontation with Ralen’s absence. The courier’s agency drives escalation: he lifts the pendant, kneels, and decides to extend encounters. Cost is visible: years of isolation now reframed as necessary preparation; future routes will demand emotional vulnerability. Pressure tightens once—pendant’s pulse aligns with heartbeat—and reweights his entire vocation.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—proving objects absorb emotions—is signaled early and deepens via the quarry’s directive, narrowing options to reading the sedan’s frost. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: his door-to-door campaign forces the town into confrontation. Cost is unmistakable: the hush transforms from oppressive to attentive, implying irreversible communal vulnerability. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure tightens through pattern intensification, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—reaching Haru across impossible distance—is signaled early and tightens when the puzzle demands equal sacrifice. Nari’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to unweave her tapestry, narrowing options irrevocably. Cost is unmistakable: “the loom stood bare and skeletal,” and the orchard “felt abruptly older.” Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each thread fed deepens the blizzard image until a lone figure appears, making the conceptual cost (youth, art, voice) viscerally felt in the final breath and turning footsteps.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=9.3)
    The dominant stake—whether anything can still be made whole—is signaled early and deepens through Corren’s bartered awakenings. His agency drives escalation: descending mines, using silk as divining rod, speaking to stone. The cost is unmistakable in the villagers’ “hollow stare” and the planet’s hardening, culminating in a lattice that flexes without shattering—resilience forged at the price of enduring uncertainty. Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens, tightening via pattern break: the mine “eating the village’s losses” reframes all prior repairs.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—mapping the withheld truth—is signaled early and deepens into self-mapping vs. external obligation. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: choosing to grasp the shard redirects momentum, collapsing alternatives with palpable atmospheric pressure. Cost is unmistakable: the weight of discarded lives presses like stacked atmospheres. Coincidence never resolves; the Archivist’s presence complicates but doesn’t solve.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.2)
    Stakes escalate not through external threat but through accumulating emotional pressure: each unsigned letter tightens the moral bind until Elias can no longer remain “a shadow between their names.” His agency peaks in the decision to write and leave a reply—an act that forecloses his habitual invisibility at the cost of vulnerability. The dominant stake (who protects when institutional light fails?) sharpens via protagonist-driven deepening, not coincidence, and the price (emotional exposure) is unmistakable in his trembling hands and unsentimental resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—resurrecting collective meaning in a post-print world—is signaled early and tightens when the lighthouse replies to Orrin’s “You are late.” Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: his muttered prophecies become history, then his archived vow ferments into the hum. Cost is unmistakable: he abandons the horizontal gaze (mourning dead shipping lanes) for vertical hope (idle satellites), sacrificing known grief for unknown responsibility. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—understanding why some people magnetize stories—is signaled early and deepens through embodied inquiry. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: he chooses whom to question, how to hold the wing, when to speak. Cost is legible in the “quietly explosive” pressure behind his ribs and the irreversible shift in perception—his old metronomic self is gone. The tightening occurs when he realizes stories aren’t drawn but reflected, foreclosing his initial hypothesis with conceptual consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—discovering what trees witness—is signaled early and deepens when the sextant reveals layered sorrow. Milo’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to follow the pin-drop, take the sextant, climb to the roof, and point it at a sapling. Cost is unmistakable: his mundane job is irrevocably altered; he now bears witness to centuries of human grief. The moonlit healing isn’t coincidence—it’s earned by his long-standing care for the unacknowledged trees.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—rekindling a realm by restoring stolen memory—is signaled early and deepens when Mara realizes mercy without memory kills. Escalation is driven by her agency: opening the satchel, touching the shard, singing backward. Cost is unmistakable: the realm “shudders” under returned pain, and Mara loses her defining burden. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each memory-tag, rustle, and echo tightens the thematic noose until song fractures numbness.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—confronting the weight of unmet trust—is signaled early and deepens when Mara accuses Elias of “only dusting the shelves.” The escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he chooses to open the book bearing his brother’s name, risking collapse. Cost is unmistakable: the dissolution of his self-protective narrative, replaced by heavier truth. Pressure coheres under the Causal lens, narrowing options until only listening remains.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether noticing constitutes meaningful resistance—is signaled early and deepens when the tea mistress reframes Elias’s inaction as premature judgment (“You just happen to notice sooner”). The tightening occurs when she tears the bread: sharing becomes direction, transforming passive preservation into communal witness. Cost is unmistakable—the bakery’s erasure, the loaf’s decay—and escalates through Elias’s admission that he mistook quietness for irrelevance. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens, with ivy-like change as central metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving luminous vows to prevent the library’s fall—is signaled early and tightens when decay accelerates “beyond worst-case projections.” Serin’s agency drives escalation: reading aloud stabilizes light, then braiding his vow alters the artifact’s fate. Cost is unmistakable—the founders’ loneliness must be acknowledged, not just their safety. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each glyph lost raises emotional and structural stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—capturing the sound of trust breaking—is signaled early and tightens when the fob initially stays “dark and heavy as a stone,” forcing Loretta to confront her own misframing of betrayal. The escalation is driven by her agency: she whispers the precise, painful question, triggering the decisive playback. Cost is unmistakable: the revelation isn’t words but a tiny pause, yet it staggers her. The “truce of hush” deepens stakes by making silence itself a vessel for bruised promises.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—learning why people carry weather—is signaled early and tightens when the ring fuses to skin, foreclosing the option of detached observation. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: choosing to follow taste, approaching the strangers, accepting silent responsibility. Cost is felt in the irreversible bodily integration (“tin melted into my skin like a second, metallic vein”) and the burden implied by “archives are heavy.” While pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens, the strangers’ exposition slightly softens causality; their explanation leans tell over dramatize, though it’s brief enough to avoid major deflation.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—answering an inescapable calling despite suppression—is signaled early (“upstairs, applause drowned experiments; downstairs, calling glows”). Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: he chooses to descend, retrieve the unfinished portrait, and draw the eyes despite his vow. Cost is unmistakable: tears blur the lines, proving completion wounds even as it fulfills. The broken lock’s hollow click deepens pressure by symbolizing irreversible commitment, narrowing options to endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost conversations—is signaled early and intensifies through Lio’s physical reaction to dishonesty. The meaningful deepening occurs when he chooses to pursue the map despite unspoken warnings, narrowing his path from scribe to seeker. Cost is legible: he risks social censure and emotional overwhelm for candor. The storm outside mirrors internal pressure, but agency remains his—no coincidence resolves the tension; his tools and traits drive every escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder before it drains into grayness—is signaled early and tightens when the girl arrives with the shard. Lio’s agency drives escalation: he climbs, carves a cradle, places the fragment, and accepts muteness as the price. The cost is unmistakable: his voice vanishes, cities forget, yet the tower endures—a quiet endurance that forecloses easy comfort but sustains truth. Pressure coheres entirely under the Accumulative lens, with one decisive deepening (the shard’s integration) that reweights everything.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—resolving inner static by confronting borrowed fears—tightens when the android chooses not to erase but miniaturize and burn them. Escalation is driven entirely by his agency: rerouting power, flooding his core, igniting the partition. Cost is unmistakable: system instability, servos misfiring, potential human disapproval. The magnetic north’s wander compounds pressure but never resolves it; the android’s tactical ingenuity does.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving communal space against erasure—is signaled early and deepens when the sealed mailbox becomes a vessel for collective memory. Mara’s agency lies in orchestrating listening, not acting alone; her choice to host circles forecloses passive resignation. Pressure escalates via developer intrusion, then crystallizes in the document’s recovery. Cost is felt in the dead woman’s legacy and the neighbors’ reclaimed voice.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—liberating Ara’s ethical legacy versus extracting weaponizable data—is signaled early and tightens when the narrator chooses to encode ocean rhythms into the servers, transforming surveillance into openness. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: following dice, reading aloud, adding notes—all deepen her commitment and narrow her path back to compliance. Cost is unmistakable: she sacrifices mission success for moral fidelity, and the lab’s “slow breath” becomes her new allegiance. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with each cipher layer raising the emotional and conceptual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost time—is signaled early and deepens when the narrator realizes memories pool near the whale. Escalation is driven by agency: he chooses to replicate his father’s method, transforming passive observation into active exhumation. The cost is unmistakable: his breath slows “as though filled with wet sand,” and the town’s unraveling becomes personal. One meaningful tightening suffices—the shift from documenting disturbances to performing the coffee ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—stilling a self-amplifying prophecy before it recruits fear—is signaled early and escalates via Ilen’s agency: he chooses the site, deploys the crane, and chants silence into being. The tightening occurs when distant echoes “unravel” and memory holes form, foreclosing the prophecy’s spread. Cost is felt (“weight added to his bones”) and visible in societal shifts (tavern laughter replacing rhythm). Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—learning the building’s language before demolition—is signaled in the first dialogue exchange and deepens into moral responsibility: translating requires bearing its lies. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: initiating trespass, committing to weekly rituals, lying about motives, then actively “interrogating silences.” The meteor shower intensifies pressure not by coincidence but because the narrator sought that night specifically (“his favorite evenings”). Cost is unmistakable: the realization that tenancy depends on shared fictions (“cracks were cosmetic… roof was safe”) imposes emotional burden—the narrator must now carry denials as gently as truths.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—confronting quarantined guilt—is signaled early (“silence fit the shape of her thoughts”) and tightens when the shell reveals the hospital memory. Escalation is driven by Neris’s agency: she chooses to press the shell to her ear, then to stay and learn. Cost is unmistakable: trembling hands, heart “hammering like a fist on a locked door,” and the admission “If I let it out… what happens to me.” The caretaker’s question forces stance crystallization without coincidence resolving tension.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—saving scholars by unbinding an oath—is signaled early and tightens when Sevran appears, forcing Irian to choose between exposure or silence. The escalation is protagonist-driven: he forges mercy despite knowing it risks all prior sabotage. Cost is unmistakable: signing as himself forfeits his protective anonymity. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens, with stalactite drips marking irreversible time.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—why some voices echo while others vanish—is signaled early and deepens through Liora’s progressive disclosure with the canyon. Her agency drives escalation: choosing the hour, kneeling, pressing the shell, singing again. The cost is felt in her relinquished blame and acceptance of fragility. Though coincidence (rockslide) initiated her quest, resolution stems from her choices under coherent environmental pressure, not external intervention.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—exposing buried corporate crime—is signaled early and deepens when the woman’s lineage is revealed. Escalation is driven by Marek’s agency: he opens dream-windows, interprets patterns, names complicity. Cost is unmistakable: the woman’s flinch, frozen tears, and implied lifelong reckoning. One meaningful tightening suffices—her family sealed doors; now she must open them—even if symbolic.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—validation of unseen work—is signaled early and tightens when Ren reframes labor as “fifteen nets worth” for four thanked. The escalation is driven by the protagonist’s agency: choosing to mimic Ren’s droplet-flick despite doubt, risking further failure. Cost is unmistakable: enduring social invisibility while internalizing a new metric of worth. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens—each whispered drip, firefly flare, and mended knot deepens the thematic weight without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—control over engineered resilience—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Theo learns the diamond is a “crystalline stillpoint” that can propagate or withdraw survival. His agency drives escalation: reconstructing letters reveals the experiment; digging retrieves the key; choosing silence denies power. The cost is unmistakable: he becomes complicit in a new secrecy, trading debunker’s clarity for stewardship of a dangerous truth, with survivors’ lives hanging in the balance.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—shaping a new dawn from ancient shadows—is signaled early and deepens when the Choir shifts from passive receiver to active interlocutor. The escalation is driven by Ilen’s agency: he turns dials, asks questions, and ultimately chooses to stand unflinching. Cost is unmistakable: loss of intellectual sovereignty (“allegiance… to your own future when you are not yet sure you deserve it”) and the haunting implication that refusal would yield a “worse” prophet.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—bridging generational silence—is signaled early and deepens when the woman arrives bearing her own unsaid grief. The meaningful tightening occurs when he chooses not to name a price, foreclosing his survival tactic for emotional risk. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens: each sound released (children’s feet, violin, sigh) tightens the thematic pressure. Cost is unmistakable: his habitual transactional shield drops, leaving him “pockets empty except for pennies and silence”—yet feeling rich. Coincidence (her arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from his active choice to listen and blend sounds.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—protecting the artifact during its vulnerable sunset window—is signaled early and tightens via protagonist agency: Elias must abandon memorized chants for dangerous improvisation. Escalation is driven by his choices (matching pitch “millimeter by millimeter”), not coincidence. Cost is unmistakable: the risk of awakening the storm, the physical toll (“teeth buzzing”), and the burden of solitary guardianship. The humming deepens from tremor to chord, forcing stance crystallization under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—learning to “sculpt patience from impatience”—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency: refusal to trust reflections, endurance during pointless tasks, and finally tactile engagement with the viaduct basin. The tightening occurs when Orren declares lateness “good material,” forcing acceptance of temporal surrender as tactic. Cost is unmistakable: the protagonist relinquishes the illusion that burning cities demand immediate action, embracing “calm delay” as resistance. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—rituals accumulate until the basin scene reweights all prior choices.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—truth versus institutional protection—tightens when overlapping ghosts force the investigator to confront their complicity. The deepening occurs via protagonist agency: choosing to see entangled memories as “testimonies” rather than stress hallucinations. Cost is unmistakable: rejecting supervisor’s control risks livelihood (“how easily a job could disappear”). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each sensory echo (rails, sweat, breath) compounds until the final renunciation becomes inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—whether forgiveness can be earned or granted—is signaled early and escalates through Elias’s admission of silence-as-judgment. His agency drives the tightening: seeking Mara’s opinion forces him to articulate his fear of complicity. Cost is unmistakable: his chaplain identity is destabilized, and the bent tooth’s history (“struck in anger… wound carefully”) crystallizes the moral calculus. Pressure coheres under causal lens without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transliterating human yearning into mechanical grammar—is signaled early and tightens when Orin learns his arrivals were Algorithm-guided, foreclosing his autonomy. His agency drives escalation: choosing to mount the arrow, turn the kaleidoscope, dive into the sky-wound. Cost is visible in his stung pride and the glider’s bolt-complaints. Coincidence complicates (rewritten wind) but doesn’t resolve—the launch succeeds through his active transliteration.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—finding Ora’s fate—is signaled early and tightens through the narrator’s escalating breaches (spoofing audits, querying silence). The meaningful deepening occurs when 713 leads not just to her but to a systemic purge of privacy/compliance staff, raising stakes from personal grief to institutional conspiracy. Agency drives escalation: each lie and query narrows options until the final renunciation (closing the interface) crystallizes stance with conceptual cost—truth without recourse. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with coincidence (713 appearing everywhere) complicating but never resolving the core conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—prevent war by integrating the anomaly—is signaled early and tightens when Ira sees himself causing both tragedies. His agency drives escalation: he doesn’t just observe futures but tests visions in mirrors, narrowing options via the anomaly’s reactions. Cost is unmistakable: either path sacrifices sanctuary or supervision, and his final choice risks total rejection by Keepers. Pressure coheres under Causal lens without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—learning the sound of endings—is signaled early and deepens through volunteering, which reframes “irretrievable” as a rehearsal for self-choice. Protagonist agency drives escalation: tapping the parasol, accepting Runa’s key, venturing onto the ice. The tightening occurs when the vibration reveals life’s persistence, forcing a trade-off between planned death and uncertain living. Cost is felt in the surrender of control, not stated.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—missed connection due to mistimed vulnerability—is signaled early and deepens when the woman reveals she left her husband. Tomas’s quiet intervention tightens pressure by reframing her failure as possibility (“maybe you just almost left”). Agency lies in attention and reconfiguration, not action, fitting the Situational/Accumulative hybrid lens. Cost is felt (her isolation, his solitude), though the escalation leans slightly more on revelation than choice.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving wisdom’s echo against societal denial—is signaled early and escalates through two key tightenings: the merchant’s lie destabilizes the cable/parapet, then the line walker’s intervention forces a recalibration of prophetic delivery. Cost is unmistakable: near-fall, grinding stones, sagging shoulders. Agency is shared but coherent; the line walker’s whispered advice alters the prophet’s method, narrowing options from blunt truth to shaped guidance.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving communal memory against erasure—is signaled early and deepens as offerings accumulate. Pressure escalates organically: the archivist moves from passive cataloger to active host, enabling constellations of shared grief. Cost is felt in what’s lost (bulldozers loom) and gained (lighter steps, shared fragments). Agency resides in attention and endurance; the tightening occurs when people begin reading each other’s fragments, transforming isolated pain into collective resonance—a turn driven by protagonist-facilitated space, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving language’s capacity to grow—is signaled by line 5 and intensified by the courier’s note. The council’s threat to erase “grow” raises visceral stakes (children, gardens, grief), and Elias’s agency drives escalation: he actively seeks testimony via the crystal, then commits to reshaping his own voice. Cost is unmistakable: he must abandon his lifelong reliance on “clarity” for “courage,” risking professional ruin. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with each whispered fragment narrowing his rhetorical options until only fractured truth remains viable.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—capturing time’s sound—is signaled early and deepens when the narrator and Mara locate it as “lives laboring to keep up with days.” Agency drives escalation: they follow arrows, kneel, listen, fail to articulate. Cost is unmistakable: the sound’s stubborn smallness forecloses grand prophecies, leaving only transient chalk marks and damp footprints. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence resolving tension.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—capturing stellar death before it evaporates—is signaled early and tightens when quake threatens alignment. Ilias’s agency drives escalation: he overrides protocols, bypasses filters, restructures circuitry—all narrowing options toward irreversible commitment. Cost is unmistakable: if they fail, institutional irrelevance; if they succeed, validation beyond politics. The deepening occurs at climax when he chooses raw data over machine safety, embodying Alma’s creed at personal and professional risk.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—executing a “flawless goodbye”—tightens decisively when Mira chooses not to read the lab results, foreclosing clinical truth for emotional grace. Agency drives escalation: her act of giving the vinyl shard deepens the stake from ritual to legacy (“the part that does not have to be fixed”). Cost is felt in Mr. Alvarez’s nod—a small movement that frees her but seals his acceptance. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence, only layered choices narrowing toward Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—discovering where shadows go—is signaled early and deepened through Lysa’s forbidden experiment. Escalation is driven by her agency: turning the key, whispering corrected runes. The tightening occurs when reflections lose her face and emit white light—narrowing options to completion or failure. Cost is unmistakable: irreversible cognitive rupture (“something in her opened”) and loss of mentor-sanctioned certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to trust Tomas’s hidden truth—is signaled early and deepens when Mara finds the tooth. Escalation is driven by her agency: she follows the map, interprets the folios, steps through the doorway. The cost is unmistakable: she abandons village consensus, risks disbelief, and physically remakes a child’s body. Tomas’s plan to “turn mistakes into constellations” isn’t abstract—it demands Mara’s hands, her doubt, her forgiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—sharing light without fire—is signaled early and tightens through the act of polishing, which forecloses rage or despair. Agency lies in attention: choosing how much sorrow each shard can carry, listening with the “thin trembling place behind my sternum.” Cost is unmistakable: the unhealed loss of the grandmother, the refugees’ rehearsed fear. Escalation occurs via protagonist’s deepening commitment, not external pressure, fitting the Accumulative lens perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—grafting new meaning onto old wounds—tightens when Mara chooses active participation (“Help me decide”) over passive endurance. Agency drives escalation: her confession enabled Eli’s leak, now their joint gardening forecloses isolation. Cost is legible in her “skinned” vulnerability and public exposure. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each green detail reweights the wound’s meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether to grant hope narrative form—is signaled early and tightens when the narrator accuses him of “drowning [hope] in ambiguity.” The deepening occurs at the river, where ephemeral cameos force him to witness the human cost of his ellipses. Agency drives escalation: his choice to press the shell to his ear transforms passive guilt into active vision. Cost is unmistakable—“continuity, the chance for hope to fail or flourish in daylight”—and forecloses his old stance of “honest uncertainty.”

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—restoring communal harmony without replicating past harm—is signaled early and tightens when villagers arrive “wary” yet drawn. The tinkerer’s agency drives escalation: his hum steadies via vine contact, then braids melody around strangers’ breaths, forcing a trade-off between solitary artistry and shared vulnerability. Cost is unmistakable: the elders’ obsolete keys symbolize discarded authority, and the tinkerer’s relinquished bowl represents surrender of individual authorship. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—density of sound, presence, memory intensifies until alignment becomes palpable rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—rendering the world’s fading pulse legible—is signaled early and deepens when the alchemist aligns starlight with subterranean tremor, narrowing options to precise placement. Agency drives escalation: his choice to lay patterns, then guide the drop, forces the map’s emergence. Cost is visible in bodily toll (“joints grind time”) and existential weight (labor for “absent feet”). Coincidence never resolves; the heartbeat’s faintness raises stakes, not eases them.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder against civic amnesia—is signaled early and deepens when the commissioner’s warning reveals collective urgency. The locksmith’s agency drives escalation: whispering hours, adjusting mirrors, replacing spring with mirror—all narrow options toward a singular solution. Cost is legible: he accepts that wonder is “shy,” requiring indirect attention, foreclosing brute-force repair. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via sensory density, not external opposition, culminating in a Charged Poise where silence itself becomes charged with stored awe.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—steering weight instead of bearing it—is signaled early and tightens when the protagonist confronts her own unnamed burden, which threatens to “calcify my breath.” Escalation is driven by her agency: orienting properly to fear, not fleeing it. Cost is unmistakable—accepting eventual oblivion (“grotto’s bronze bones would forget me”) yet choosing to continue, foreclosing despair. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, deepening from collected village sorrows to personal existential dread.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—whether to let grief remain suspended or shape it into something useful—is signaled early and tightened by the wood’s demand for form. Escalation is driven entirely by Mara’s agency: her refusal to carve, then her decision to begin, forecloses the safety of pause with visible cost (the end of protective numbness). The “pause” motif evolves from circus danger to emotional crutch to obstacle overcome, all under coherent Accumulative pressure. Coincidence (rain, departing trucks) complicates but never resolves; the turn is internal and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—negotiating with one’s ghost—is signaled early and deepens through the realization that “fragments are not a life.” Pressure escalates via the narrator’s own agency: he rows to the center, offers relics, admits his error (“You fed on echoes when you could have spoken”). The cost is unmistakable: surrendering all scavenged weight, accepting that forgiveness is withheld. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from his flawed belief that borrowed lives could fill his void.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—redirecting flows of purpose—is signaled early and tightens when Mira chooses temporary carnival logic over permanent spaceport failure. Agency drives escalation: her sketches become maps that reconfigure belief’s hydraulics. Cost is unmistakable: she expends night labor on invisible systems, accepting no audience. Coincidence (finding manual) complicates but doesn’t resolve—she must still interpret and act.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reconciling with a failed dream—is signaled early and deepens when the clock’s cough mirrors his father’s death, forcing a choice that violates sanctuary rules. Agency is clear: Elias acts despite fear, using only embodied skill. Cost is visible in the risk of expulsion and emotional exposure, yet the story avoids melodrama by keeping pressure internal and spatially contained. One meaningful tightening suffices, and it lands with quiet inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—salvaging truth vs. preserving comforting lies—is signaled early and deepens when blueprints reveal systemic rewriting. The tightening occurs underwater: finding legible pages forces a trade-off between complicity and exposure. Protagonist agency drives escalation—his choice to stuff pages into the satchel alters tactics irreversibly. Cost is unmistakable: he forfeits payment, safety, and illusion, crystallizing stance in “new and dangerous honesty.” Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without reliance on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving memory before it vanishes—is signaled early and deepens when Eli realizes stories live in knots, not ink. His agency drives escalation: he chooses to kneel, trace, listen, and stay. The tightening occurs when the fulgurite flares and memory-images flood him, narrowing his path to one of patient decoding. Cost is felt in physical discomfort and the irreversible commitment to “keep listening,” which forecloses scholarly detachment.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—explaining absences as pilgrimages—tightens when Lady Sera reframes vanishing as “experiments,” forcing the narrator to shift from observer to participant (“Help me walk it”). Agency lies in attention: choosing to name pain-places aloud, altering the narrator’s commission from obituary to map. Cost is felt in the dusk-circled return—no resolution, only deeper entanglement with grief. Escalation is driven by protagonist choices under Accumulative lens, with visible price: daylight surrendered, solitude breached.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—authentic beauty vs. synthetic nostalgia—is signaled early and tightens when the egg arrives, forcing the prince to choose between syndicate compliance and custodianship. His agency drives escalation: he silences dissent, repurposes infrastructure (sunlight mirrors), and accepts biological risk. Cost is felt in lost authority, social rupture, and existential vulnerability. The single meaningful deepening—the shift from approving fantasies to protecting fragile reality—narrows his world to one trembling possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—breaking generational curses through compassionate action—is signaled early and tightened when fire threatens the boy. Maris’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to run toward him despite fire’s advance, embodying “unyielding compassion” as tactic, not slogan. The cost is felt: risking her safety, confronting her father’s ghost, and surrendering his last relic. Coincidence (the boy’s presence) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from her deliberate graft of stories.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—liberating trapped memories—is signaled early and deepens through Lira’s realization that each fountain is a lock requiring personal risk. Her agency drives escalation: collecting anomalies, reaching into the boy’s memory, sacrificing her doubt. The cost is unmistakable: loss of her defining trait, leaving her “open, painfully luminous.” Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with each freed memory tightening the trail toward irreversible confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—breaking generational patterns of destructive illumination—is signaled early and deepens when familiar constellations reappear, forcing confrontation with internalized cycles. Escalation occurs through the protagonist’s agency: they actively prune, nudge, and teach, yet cannot escape their own garden’s shadows. Cost is unmistakable in the “sharpness of a specific name” and the wrist-bound gear’s violent shivers. The tightening forecloses easy redemption, demanding endurance over victory under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—discovering the shape of collective grief—is signaled early and deepens through nightly carvings that narrow Elias’s focus from individual loss to communal ache. Agency is clear: he chooses hidden verses, threads the ribbon, retraces paths. The escalation is textural (accumulating graves, darkening ribbon) rather than causal, but under the Accumulative lens, this suffices. Cost is legible: by the end, he bears the village’s unspoken distances as a quiet burden, foreclosing private mourning for shared endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—restoring balance between guilt and communal time—is signaled early and deepens when the protagonist realizes his precision served ghosts, not people. The pause in the pendulum’s swing forces a crystallization: stewardship over penance. Escalation is driven by his agency—his insight, not external event—and cost is unmistakable: he must relinquish solitary control, exposing the town to the fragility he once guarded alone. The tightening forecloses his path of incremental avoidance with irrevocable clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—deciphering unfinished intentions to ease the dead—is signaled early and tightens when the tapestry strip ticks “with its own impatient heartbeat.” Protagonist agency drives escalation: he climbs, matches edges, presses palm. The deepening reveals his own identity as the soil-handed man, raising emotional cost. Closure crystallizes stance: he endures as gardener, trading grave for shed. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from his choices under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes—mapping without witnessing—are signaled early and deepen when real-world data (abandoned village) shatters projections. Elian’s agency drives escalation: he tests scenarios, spots the thaw rhythm, and designs mobile infrastructure. The cost is unmistakable: the kingdom must accept cyclical labor shifts and coastal shipping risks instead of easy conquest. Pressure coheres under causal lens—each model iteration forecloses static solutions until only adaptive resilience remains viable.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving story against erasure—is signaled early and deepens when the broadcast warns “Someone is coming.” Lina’s agency drives escalation: she hides pages, repurposes symphonies as camouflage, and chooses to mentor the boy. Cost is unmistakable: constant fear, physical exposure to ash, emotional risk in trusting a child. The tightening—from solo scribe to conspirator with a witness—narrows her path while expanding the rebellion’s reach, all under coherent Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—whether art can be sanctuary—is tested through Mara’s ritual, which deepens when ash lines become psychological barriers viewers hesitate to cross. Escalation is driven by her agency: choosing incomplete information as method, then releasing ash to force collective confrontation with fragility. Cost is unmistakable: the “mirage of safety” dissolves, leaving “nobody pretends they are safe.” Coincidence never resolves; pressure accumulates texturally until the older woman’s laugh cracks the tension, proving barriers are self-imposed.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving knowledge against enforced forgetting—is signaled early and tightens when the Council’s proclamations echo down the drains, forcing the narrator’s quiet rebellion. Escalation occurs through deepening, not reversal: each reflection on competing narratives sharpens his commitment to material truth over myth. Cost is felt in his isolation and the irreversible loss of schematics. Agency manifests as attention and curation, foreclosing assimilation with palpable emotional toll.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—whether fractured voices can coexist—is signaled early and tightens weekly as chairs shrink and glances lengthen. The meaningful deepening occurs when Dari and Ilan stay late, transforming abstract “vanishing arts” into embodied risk. Agency drives escalation: Maro’s method forces students to choose silence or vulnerable sound. Cost is felt in cracked voices and unshared silences, though the lens slightly softens concrete trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reviving beauty from ruin—is signaled early and deepens through Ariel’s choice to internalize the seed before replanting, transforming personal risk into communal possibility. Pressure escalates via the alignment’s ticking clock and the physical act of pruning, which Kai experiences as “betrayal” yet Ariel frames as “gentle rebellion.” The cost is felt: lost time, dead experiments, the burden of memory. Agency drives every turn—no coincidence resolves tension—and the final stance crystallizes not through victory but through refusal: “We are disagreeing with its ending.”

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether the city deserves to wake—is signaled early and deepens when the boy reveals his grandfather’s sabotage. Pressure escalates through Marla’s involuntary truth: she cannot evade the riddle’s demand, and her answer carries irreversible consequence. The tightening occurs in her throat before speech—agency resides in how she shapes unavoidable truth. Cost is unmistakable: she trades silence for responsibility, and the city trades amnesia for astonishment, with no soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—understanding why houses feel alive—is signaled early and deepens when Eli realizes he might be the observed, not just the observer. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: his rituals test the house’s responsiveness, and the storm-induced accident (dropping the shard) forces a choice—to retrieve or leave it. He leaves it, then moves his bed into the darkness, foreclosing detachment and accepting mutual scrutiny. Cost is felt in the reversal of roles: observer becomes observed, with emotional vulnerability as price.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—replacing certainty with nuanced truth—is signaled early and tightens when the ampoule threatens to fossilize failure into new dogma. The statue’s agency drives escalation: it planned the collapse, waits for consent, then pulls fault-lines. Cost is unmistakable: its own disintegration (“shard of statue-face drifted past”), the city’s exposure, the risk of misinterpretation. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each sensory beat deepens the moral weight without false resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—capturing the texture of a missed opportunity through endless ascent—is signaled early and deepens when the rupture reveals an alternate self who chose the door. This tightens pressure: Arin must confront the futility of his quest yet reaffirm it. Agency lies in his renunciation of resolution—he climbs anyway. Cost is legible in his breathlessness after moving “only a single step,” and in the sealed horizon of his proofs. Escalation stems from protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—proving strangers remember kindness—is signaled early and tightened through Aurelia’s ritual: each invisible phrase forecloses anonymity, demanding faith without guarantee. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency (unwrapping brush, selecting phrases) under Accumulative pressure; the deepening isn’t plot-driven but textural, as three strangers’ memories surface in sequence. Cost is felt in Aurelia’s insomnia and the city’s exhaustion; the final smile on the nurse’s face carries the weight of reclaimed humanity. Coincidence complicates (arguments, stalled bus) but doesn’t resolve—the brush’s magic is earned through prior belief and trade.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—rescuing dying arts—tightens when Lira commands, “Look at us with it,” transforming cataloging into active witnessing. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing to stay after contract ends forecloses his outsider safety. Cost is felt in displaced persons’ transient bread-letters and the bees’ absence—a live clock that alters tactics (no honeyed smoke for festivals). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each detail (defaced statues, rolled maps) deepens the stakes without false resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—escaping predetermined sorrow—is signaled early and tightens when Aurek chooses to spill the yoyo’s hoarded force rather than contain it, foreclosing passive endurance. Pressure escalates through protagonist agency: each action (dissecting yoyo, rotating shard, casting into void) narrows options under the Accumulative lens. Cost is unmistakable: he trades the comfort of counting shattered lives for the “bleak exhilaration” of an unwritten future. The hunger stone’s warning (“If you see me, despair”) crystallizes the moral calculus—facing oblivion to reclaim agency.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—escaping photographic death—is signaled early and tightens when the Polaroid fades only inside the funhouse. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to follow luminance, read notes, step through mirror, and unbosom himself. Cost is unmistakable: living means bearing “brightness in my skull.” The boy-fear’s chattering teeth literalize stolen time, making stakes viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—survival through attunement—tightens when snarled cloud-paths threaten disintegration. Aera’s agency drives escalation: she doesn’t wait for rescue but *creates* harmony from chaos via dubbing. Cost is unmistakable: children clinging, ladders groaning, fear as persistent bass note. The “half-heard dissonance” deepens into “rough harmony,” narrowing options until only one alignment remains—earned by her rhythm, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—whether to confront the unknown beyond the horizon—is signaled early and deepens when shell patterns fracture, proving the turtles’ fear isn’t superstition. Keth’s agency drives escalation: he interprets cracks, presents findings, then acts alone. Cost is felt in the Council’s refusal (“send more lives after ghosts”) and his solitary walk to the gate. The tightening forecloses communal action, forcing individual defiance with high personal risk.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.3)
    The dominant stake—ownership of truth in an age of weaponized fiction—tightens when Elias demands draft release, forcing Mara to choose between profit and transparency. His agency drives escalation: he names the mechanism (“smuggle in excuses”), cites real-world harm (televised debate), and issues a credible threat. Cost is unmistakable: undermining “the faith that keeps millions steady” risks chaos, yet he chooses night vision over false stars. Pressure coheres under the Hybrid lens, with each turn narrowing options toward irrevocable disclosure.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—resisting oceanic forgetting through hidden testimony—is signaled early and tightens as tide rises, forcing faster repairs and shallower ink. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to write, to place notes, to endure solitude. Cost is unmistakable: her labor vanishes into concrete, her name erased, yet she persists. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—density of loss (boy on seawall, grandfather’s death) reweights each repair.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—truth versus sanctioned forgetting—is signaled early and deepens when the blackout removes surveillance, raising the cost of dissent. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she moves from passive indexing to active tracing of gaps, culminating in opening the hidden folio. The tightening is textural but decisive: absence clusters around hillside communities, and the council’s dismissal (“myths kept the settlement peaceful”) crystallizes the moral trade-off. Cost is felt in her isolation and the weight of unacknowledged dates.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (transforming unprocessed grief) tightens decisively when Liora’s own shadow ascends—the inciting incident forcing her to confront the dream she “refused to distill.” Agency drives escalation: her choice to polish the memory (“presses against the wheel”) narrows options from avoidance to unbearable clarity. Cost is unmistakable: “heart feels flayed” during polishing, and the lantern becomes “a second, burning moon”—a visible price that alters her tactics (walking upward while descending through selves). Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens via density increase (dreams → cranes).

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—unused potential—is signaled early and tightens when the vortex appears over the protagonist’s village, forcing a choice between institutional protocol and personal reckoning. Escalation is driven by agency: rerouting processing power is a tangible act that narrows options (defying mission parameters) and deepens knowledge (revealing three silences). Cost is unmistakable: the buried half of the crystal, the unmeasured lives, the moral burden of having once participated in erasure. Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens, intensifying through patterned revelation rather than causal reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—decoding belonging—is signaled early and deepens when Leto reframes the chip as a map of absence (“your maps refuse to say where you belong”). Pressure tightens via protagonist agency: Mira chooses to project the schematic, lean into the eyepiece, and listen to stellar tones—each act narrowing her military mindset toward receptivity. Cost is visible in her relinquished authority (drones now “unaware” outside) and the emotional weight of recognizing “unclaimed faces” as kin. Escalation adheres to Accumulative lens: density increases until starlight completes the pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—truth versus comforting falsehood—is signaled early and deepens when the protagonist recognizes his work echoes his father’s. The tightening occurs at the emblem discovery, which forecloses his old path: he can no longer claim innocence. Cost is unmistakable: continuing silence would perpetuate harm; speaking truth risks exposure. Agency drives escalation—he chooses to gather carvings—and the moral calculus sharpens around inherited complicity.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—recycling past mistakes into present wisdom—is signaled early and deepens when the brother appears, forcing a trade-off between blood and principle. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he initiates silence, counts steps, releases the lantern. The tightening forecloses the path of selfish rescue, exacting visible cost (his brother’s shattered look). Pressure remains coherent under the Causal lens, with no coincidental resolution—luck complicates (brother’s unexpected presence) but doesn’t solve.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming relational presence after chronic absence—is signaled early and deepens when Lena’s text crystallizes consequence. The backlash of regrets shifts from “crushing wave” to “cold steady rain,” altering tactics: he stops fleeing and paddles toward uncertain reconciliation. Agency drives escalation—he chooses to turn, however awkwardly—and the cost (lost family, self-reckoning) is unmistakable. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each pole, memory, and sensory cue tightens the emotional vise without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving empathy in a cleansed society—is signaled early and deepens via the lake’s revelation. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: decoding ads, using the torch, wading in. Each beat narrows options (sealed door → oxy torch → irreversible immersion). The cost is unmistakable: the protagonist accepts permanent exile from civic numbness, bearing the weight of collective guilt. Coincidence never resolves; every tool is self-planted, every clue self-encoded.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reforging a bond beyond death—is signaled early and escalates through irreversible sacrifice: the beasts dissolve, the narrator’s body unravels. The tightening occurs at the cauldron: conjuring demands his unmaking, not just hers. Cost is unmistakable (“I do not want to change… yet my heart beats steady”) and paid in full by climax. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves the core tension.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming lost time—is signaled early and tightens when the second card reveals his laboring wife, forcing recognition of his absence. Protagonist agency drives escalation: cutting cards, kneeling, unfastening the case—all deepen his confrontation with regret. The cloud-sea’s transformation into “whirlpools of scenes” crystallizes stakes, making every missed moment viscerally present. Cost is unmistakable: he must abandon his quest for cosmic answers to meet dawn beside his daughter, trading metaphysical certainty for human presence.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—opening the sealed dimension through shadow work—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency: each immersion deepens their understanding of violence’s seduction while narrowing options (e.g., choosing pacifism amid memories where killing seems merciful). The meaningful tightening occurs when joy-induced weightlessness allows course corrections toward the dimension’s edge, directly linking emotional state to tactical success. Cost is unmistakable: bearing ten billion minds’ unresolved pain pins them to the deck or lifts them into perilous repair zones.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—saving lives without invoking prophecy—is signaled early and tightens when evacuation bells ring, forcing Niko to act within minutes. His agency drives escalation: he devises the detour using his signature method (orchestrating coincidences), accepting the cost of splitting his collection and running on burning ground. The deepening comes when myth confronts practice (“stranger bearing bottled stars”), raising ethical stakes without resolving them mechanically. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens—each image intensifies the hush until action erupts.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—rewriting the fort’s story—is signaled early and tightens when the blackout arrives, narrowing options to immediate action. Iri’s agency drives escalation: she verifies Trann’s intent, decodes the sundial, and triggers the lock override. Cost is unmistakable: she trades bureaucratic safety for revolutionary risk, crystallized in the final silence where “nothing opened” yet everything changed. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens via rising density of coded signals and mechanical tension.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—restoring friction’s “tax” to prevent eternal stillness—is signaled early and tightens when Arin chooses to stay rather than slip into endless slide. Escalation is driven by his agency: placing stones, uncorking dust, kneeling. Cost is unmistakable: pain returns, motion regains messiness, and the world re-enters debt. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via pattern convergence (stones, eels, aurora) until the decisive hum aligns vectors.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—mapping silencing as celestial cartography—is signaled early and deepens when the poet admits he came “to understand the cartography of scars.” The tightening occurs when the astronomer reveals the sky “remembers every syllable they crossed out,” foreclosing denial. Cost is legible in the poet’s “rarefied” air—emotional density shifts irreversibly. Agency drives escalation: his choice to look earns the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—turning questions into destinations—is signaled early and tightens when visitors arrive late, forcing Darius to activate the overture. Escalation is driven by his agency: he opens the tin, angles the sundial, draws steel. Cost is unmistakable: the storm-smell in clear sky implies unseen rupture; his mechanical arm’s rhythm underscores time’s irreversible slice. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—density of pattern intensifies until chaos becomes poised.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—forging beauty from anarchy—tightens when patrols threaten exposure, forcing the molting into the archivist persona. This deepening narrows options: perform compliance or risk annihilation. Cost is felt in the narrator’s splintered selfhood and Lio’s shaking hands, altering tactics (hiding the tin). Agency drives escalation; coincidence (patrol arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve—their preparedness (floorboard) shows earned resilience.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming agency over fate—is signaled early via the anniversary clock’s stoppage and deepens when Leon discovers the film reels. Escalation is protagonist-driven: his choice to enter the projection tightens options (abandoning the station) and raises cost (confronting Mara’s refuge). The compasses’ shift from hesitation to decisive flare embodies stakes crystallizing under pressure. Coincidence complicates (rumors of the arbor) but never resolves; the duet’s renewal hinges on mutual choice, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—protecting cultural memory from dissolving into legend—is signaled early and deepens when the island’s dreams contradict official records. The escalation is protagonist-driven: Kael chooses to listen, enters the dream, and confronts evidence that his foundational object may encode exile, not origin. Cost is conceptual and social: accepting the dream admits ancestral loss and fractures identity. Though coincidence (early monsoon) initiates pressure, resolution hinges on Kael’s interpretive agency, not external luck. One meaningful tightening suffices—and here it forecloses epistemic safety.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—delivering an unspoken apology—is signaled early and deepens when the compass locks on the grove, forcing movement. The tightening occurs when he lifts the second lace strip: that act transforms passive waiting into active offering.

Escalation is driven by his agency under an Accumulative lens—each object interaction intensifies emotional pressure.
