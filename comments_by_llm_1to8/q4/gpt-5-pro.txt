  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is recovery method—gradual vs. dramatic repair—signaled early ("strip needless drama") and tested throughout (chalking seams, saving least-dramatic orchids, drafting a slope-shaped schedule). Agency is decision and renunciation with visible cost: replanting at half capacity, hand fans before motors, composting the dead. Escalation reads as accumulative deepening: triage narrows to partnership with the botanist, then expands to teaching children, each beat reweighting the opening forensic stance. The "slope" metaphor coheres pressure across all moves. No antagonist required; the flood's aftermath supplies persistent constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake: discovering why the smuggler burned the studio and what the ledger arithmetic means. Pressure is investigative rather than escalating—each clue (ledger, frost, door, kiln, glass) adds knowledge without narrowing options or forcing a trade-off. The final action (creating and distributing the new piece) is a response but not a tightening; no visible cost dramatized on the page (e.g., fear of retaliation, loss of anonymity, severed safety). Agency is present but the resolution feels like completion of a puzzle rather than a choice under competing pressures. One meaningful deepening occurs when the mentor's secret refuge is revealed, reweighting the fire from mere warning to erasure of a sanctuary.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—translating silence into music to avoid becoming "drift"—is signaled early and tightened through collaborative escalation: mapping thermals to intervals, the first performance, the school bell request. Each beat narrows the narrator's isolation and deepens the project's stakes. The fisherman's arrival and Sura's question force a crystallization: the work has become a bridge, not merely compensation for loss. The final affirmation forecloses drift with visible cost (ongoing vigilance, "fragile endurance"). One meaningful tightening suffices; agency is expressed through sustained invention and renunciation of despair.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake signaled early: give rest a permanent address. Pressure coheres and tightens when the lens hums/taps coordinates, compelling the descent, then deepens when the undertaker realizes the lens scatters mercy and he must "occupy impossible spaces" to shelve the voices. The protagonist's agency (laying the lens, wedging into the seam, inventorying the drawers) drives the resolution with visible cost (his own address now bound to the city). One clear tightening: the realization that his "stubbornness has always been a corridor" reframes prior compulsion as active choice. The escalation is meaningful under the Accumulative lens; the price is legible in the final binding.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake: survival through anonymous mutual aid under surveillance. The Noor/Farid accusation creates one meaningful tightening; Mara's braided-run plan narrows options and forces the youth and elder to carry each other's burdens. The resolution—bell empty save a note, anonymity reaffirmed—lands with conceptual cost (continued risk, no credit) but the watchers vanish from the frame after the threat is established, reducing felt danger. Escalation is textural (density increases) rather than causal, fitting the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—"to find where unused love is stored, and how to open it"—is signaled early and pursued throughout. Pressure accumulates through the ritual: threading the tear, syncing breath with the friend, watching the image stabilize. One meaningful tightening occurs when the two breathe in tandem and "the woman steps in as if crossing a river," but this moment is not dramatized as a choice that forecloses an option or imposes a visible cost; it reads as the fulfillment of a hoped-for outcome. The friend's spark-walking and the breath-controlled aperture provide texture, but escalation remains textural rather than decisional. No on-page reversal tests commitment or generates a complication that narrows the protagonist's path.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—touching time's texture without breaking it—is signaled early ("brief asked me to grow a maze that would not end") and tightens once when the protagonist frees the halo fragment, triggering retrocognitive trapping that narrows options to ritual relinquishment. The protagonist's agency (prying, carrying, setting the fragment, vowing aloud) drives the escalation under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible: photographs fade "faster, as if the garden were reclaiming its own light," and the fragment disintegrates with a hum, leaving only an afterimage. However, the middle section's recursive crossings feel more textural than pressure-increasing, and the final choice (setting the fragment on cambium) arrives with less friction than the setup promises.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—planting resilience versus archival control—is signaled early and tightens when the Collectors arrive. The protagonist's agency is visible: she chains herself, wedges the arrow, and offers a "different tally" that forecloses the path of resistance. Cost is legible (accepting complicity, binding herself) and the final choice is earned by prior causality. Escalation reads as a meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens, though the Collectors' capitulation arrives without prolonged friction.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—finding "the sound of trust breaking"—is signaled early and drives the protagonist's experiments. Pressure accumulates through the device's iterative tuning, from collecting absences to the climactic test with the father. The confrontation provides one meaningful tightening when the device registers the father's retreat, but the escalation is more additive than a dramatic narrowing of options. Cost is present (the protagonist must accept the father's betrayal) but the visceral trade-off or forfeited path is understated, keeping the piece shy of the 8.5+ threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake (whether to capture this illuminated moment) is signaled early, but pressure plateaus rather than escalating. The man's decision to stay is his, not the protagonist's; the narrator's agency is releasing moonbeams, a symbolic act without visible tradeoff. The reversal (recognizing the man as a future self) reframes identity but does not narrow options or force a choice with on-page cost. Coincidence (the temporal loop) complicates rather than escalates, and the ending softens into mutual listening and light-release without a tightening that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—"craft safe zones for inquiry"—is signaled early and sustained through the making of three bells. The escalation under the accumulative lens shows one meaningful deepening: moving from solitary work to writing a note inviting strangers ("Please enter...heat is shared"). The piece lacks a visible trade-off or narrowing; the generator coughs but obeys, no material is wasted, no question remains unanswered with on-page friction. The tightening is present but gentle, so Q4 remains mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (reclaim identity and agency from exploitation) is signaled early and tightens through discovery, decryption, and confrontation. The narrator's call to Kellan and the projection gambit demonstrate agency under pressure, and the floor-trap moment forecloses Kellan's script with visible cost ("save myself from becoming his kind of script"). However, the trap itself is not earned by prior struggle—chalked safe tiles appear as a deus ex machina rather than a resource the protagonist fought to secure, capping escalation credibility and preventing entry to the 7.5+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.6)
    One dominant stake (draw a map of an endless night to give it rooms/thresholds) is signaled early and sustained. The oracle's pedagogy applies immediate pressure: "edges begin at the ear," forcing the scribe to abandon linear cartography for silence-summary. The booklet's flaking gold provides a deepening mechanism—each shed flake becomes a harbor—and the scribe's renaming ("unbroken breath," "held-back tear") narrows options from conventional mapmaking to collaborative, ephemeral notation. Cost is legible in the shift from "edges" to "rooms, not limits," but the ending's communal gentling (men tie gear with gentler fingers, commander mutters but does not argue) diffuses urgency. The map's completion coincides with the star's descent and the booklet's emptying, delivering closure through exhaustion rather than a protagonist-driven trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—finding where thoughts originate—is signaled immediately and pressured through each loop. One meaningful deepening occurs when JN-3 bows the violin on loop seven, producing the note that reveals thoughts arrive "from between" rather than within, narrowing the conceptual space and foreclosing the search-within option. The loops themselves escalate by changing the weight of steps, multiplying chalk marks, and accumulating dots on the chest panel until the violin melts. Agency is renunciation and endurance (slowing until cameras lose interest, filing suggestions) with visible cost (haste from quotas, potential reprimand). The protagonist's final act—pressing the broom into service again—crystallizes earned stance.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—thaw mistrust with transparency—is signaled early and tightens once: the narrator moves from private discovery (lens over doodles) to public exposure (frame in forecourt), narrowing options and forcing both Rell and self into the open. Agency drives the turn: "I carried the tickets, the lens, and a portable frame into the forecourt" is a protagonist decision with visible cost (Rell's pass-down, logged confession, volunteer repair tours). One meaningful deepening fits this length under the Accumulative lens, and the cost is unmistakable on the page, though a second complication before the setup would have raised pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (proving gardens know their gardeners) is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the Auditor measures humidity and confirms new roots, validating the marble method and narrowing options from fraud to functional technique. Agency is present in marble placement, polishing, and ceremonial practice, but the escalation is attentional and accumulative rather than a sharp reversal with visible alternatives foreclosed. The Auditor's arrival and his loss in the maze provide external pressure, but his departure and the final image do not trade off a live option or enact a decisive loss beyond the already-paid cost of labor. Cost is felt (years of patience, humility) but not newly forfeited at closure; the story rests in Charged Poise rather than a turn with visible price paid in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—proving that time moves sideways—is signaled early and pressure accumulates through preparation, instrument calibration, and the lever pull that engages the nexus. Under the Accumulative lens, the density increase and the aviary's "subdued awakenings stepping tenderly across a tilted page" constitute a meaningful deepening. However, the protagonist's agency is limited to careful observation and withdrawal ("eased the lever back a breath"), and no visible cost or trade-off emerges. The piece tightens once but does not narrow options or charge the final image with undeniable stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear: prevent disaster through wordless interpretation under time pressure. The protagonist's agency drives escalation: from passive listening to active code-reading to the disruptive harmonic that realigns the theater. One meaningful tightening occurs when the conductor lifts his baton and "the room leaned toward obedience"—the window for intervention closes to a single beat. The harsh harmonic is a high-cost choice (professional credibility, visible to all) that narrows options and forces the crowd's movement. The resolution is earned by prior causality: the ghost's images teach, the musician translates, the action saves. The cost is legible on-page: isolation in knowledge, the program's warmth a small animal secret, and tomorrow's pretense.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—finding and confronting the weight of swallowed truth—is signaled in paragraph three and drives every beat. Pressure tightens through the oracle's query, the graphite reveal (Luca's hidden map, the narrator's prior silence), and culminates in the broadcast that closes roads and names instruments. Agency is decision with visible cost: speaking now sends "curses up the mountain like smoke" and risks donor displeasure. The avalanche that killed Luca occurred off-page, but the on-page escalation (fever recovery → oracle confrontation → literal weighing → broadcast) narrows options from silent complicity to public warning.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—finding "the weight of a swallowed truth"—is signaled early and tightens when the narrator turns the wheel, a decision that forecloses retreat and opens the niche. The ledger's "column of zeros" and "hush paid" constitute visible cost and reweight the mother's confession with documentary proof. Agency is clear: months of mapping, the choice to follow the hush, the physical turn of the wheel, the descent into the niche. One meaningful deepening occurs (confession → physical evidence → carried burden), sufficient for this length. Escalation is driven by protagonist action under an Accumulative lens, and the cost is legible in the final image (tag in cheek, life "click[ing], teeth meeting teeth"). Minor gap: the prior mapping via talk-radio is told rather than dramatized, slightly softening the earned quality of the final discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: to witness and tend change without imposing verdict. One meaningful tightening occurs when the vaults thrum and the keeper chooses patience over the swan's eager door-opening, a renunciation that deepens the task. The refugees' arrival complicates pressure, but their presence is summarized rather than dramatized, limiting escalation. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the keeper's stance crystallizes into tending rather than mere recording—with felt cost in the discipline required. The piece fits Accumulative lens expectations, but protagonist agency remains reactive.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: bringing Felix's voice back without force, explicitly framed early ("not to force sound"). Escalation is textural/accumulative: hum → bowl hum → Felix whisper-pitch → heel tap → curl-to-bowl tap → "mama" → "small, sturdy vowels." Each step narrows Felix's resistance and raises emotional cost. Agency belongs to Felix (his nod, his tap, his touch, his word) and the therapist (her adaptive waiting). The eclipse coincidence complicates timing but does not resolve; resolution comes from Felix's choice to sing. Cost is legible: Lena's "tears that did not fall," the acknowledgment of "not a cure, but a beginning," and the plan for ongoing practice all signal the path ahead requires sustained work.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake (collecting what walls remember) is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through density of sensory probe and fragment-reading rather than causal reversals; this fits the Accumulative lens. The middle deepens via the diaries' names and the tapestry's grammar, narrowing focus from general listening to specific inscription. The cost at closure is conceptual—walls rest, world regains ear—but the historian's agency feels more fulfillment than trade-off; no live option is visibly foreclosed with felt sacrifice on the page, only a task completed.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—transposing the island's open secrets into acknowledged music—is signaled early and coheres through the accumulative structure. One meaningful deepening occurs when the dot-fortunes bloom into sentences, but the scene lacks a price: no character resists, no social friction materializes, and the constable's complicity is revealed without tension. The escalation reads as affirmation rather than a choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake signaled early: stop the possession before it completes. Pressure escalates through Ruan's rhetorical devices (anaphora, chiasmus, questions) that systematically dismantle the entity's logic until the final question—"If you own everything, what will you ask tomorrow"—creates a paradox the entity cannot resolve. The entity pushes back ("rousing the pews with a wind"), creating genuine resistance. Cost is visible: the entity loosens, the palette becomes something Mara can put down, and "possession cannot complete where questions are a commons"—a renunciation with conceptual weight. Agency belongs to Ruan; his accumulated loops and questions drive the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—conducting unheard symphonies before exhaustion—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the climb; each landing offers a new sensory-metaphoric layer that deepens rather than reverses. The tightening is meaningful (frost violins, ice timpani, brass glints all summoned by memory-mapping), and agency is exercised through gesture and attention. Cost is somewhat abstract: exhaustion looms but never visibly curtails a choice on the page, keeping the price more atmospheric than material.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake is clear: conquer the labyrinth of self or "be divided by it until the stones forgot me." One meaningful tightening occurs when Lio chooses the weakest-echo stair and later decides to fall, forecloses floating as escape. The procedural-generation rules (reflect, rotate, invert) create coherent pressure under the Accumulative lens. The final act—releasing resistance and accepting gravity—reweights options with visible cost (end of periodic restarts, acceptance of linear mortality). The guard and alternate-self encounters add thematic texture but lack sharp tactical friction; they feel more like ritual checkpoints than reversals that narrow options through protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—reconnecting to feeling so her students can find their pulses—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens relies on layered imagery (backward songs, filament, needle tracing) rather than a tightening that forecloses options or imposes visible cost. Lena's agency is largely receptive (pressing play, feeling vibrations) rather than a decision that trades one path for another. The classroom ending shows a shift in her teaching, but the price paid—vulnerability, exposure—is asserted in the final lines rather than tested in the cavern scene.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—maintaining integrity by recording unowned truth—is signaled early and tested by the follower's implicit question (will the narrator sell the weather?). The pressure deepens when the pigeon delivers the message, and the narrator's decision to form a plan "not head on but by progressing laterally" narrows options. Escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as thematic intensification rather than causal tightening; the plan itself is stated, not dramatized with on-page friction. The cost is named at closure ("even if it costs comfort") but not felt in a forfeited option during the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake signaled early: "to discover the texture of time." The arrival of the escapee and the visitors' offer to purge the second tighten pressure by forcing a choice between the map (patterned knots), the rope, and a poem. The protagonist's agency is clear—she declines the visitors' demand and instead offers a poem, then braids new knots—but the escalation reads more as layered gestures than as a series of narrowing, high-cost options. The "impossible choices" framing is invoked but the on-page calculus doesn't fully dramatize competing goods with undeniable trade-offs; the poet finds a third path that satisfies all parties. Cost is felt in the poet's reflection on traveling blind, but the resolution avoids visible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—restoring sound and community to a silenced cove—is signaled early and tightens through the fire gathering, storytelling round, and bell recovery. Under the Accumulative lens, escalation reads as density increase: solo violin → collective instruments → recovered bell, each adding pressure. Agency is collective but coherent, driven by Mara's acoustic choices and the group's willingness to "invite the errors to sing." The hush "cracks like thin ice," a clear cost image, and the resolution (hush learning to share rather than vanish) forecloses the path of perfect restoration. No coincidental solve; the bell's recovery requires collaborative action.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—Liora's need for courage to finish the memorial perfume without succumbing to grief—is signaled immediately and escalates through her confession ("she had perfected molecules to avoid imperfect mourning"). The dealer's calibration of "amperage, scent memory, and the rhythm of her breath" tightens pressure until "the exact instant when belief kissed doubt and decided to go steady." Agency is shared but clear: Liora offers the petal, the dealer wires it and threads the accord, and Liora's final reach for the slate (to steady, not clutch) earns the transformation. Cost is visible: the dealer gives away what they cannot keep, and Liora's tears mark the price of re-engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—honoring silent contributors—is signaled early and sustained. The sequence from envelope discovery to ledger initiation provides one meaningful tightening (the tuner's arrival with the locket, dockhands and stagehands gathering). However, escalation remains gentle and choices never face a live trade-off or cost that narrows options on the page. The resolution (ledger begun, names delivered) feels declarative rather than tested under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (to graft onto community) and sustained through the search and dedication. One meaningful tightening occurs when the sigil appears as reeds interlacing, directly answering the protagonist's craft before they ask—this narrows options from anonymous artisan to committed member. The dedication itself is a high-stakes renunciation of solitary work with visible cost: "I did not feel accepted like a document stamped; I felt held like light is held by water until someone drinks." Agency is protagonist-driven (weaving the bench, speaking the vow). The ending's Charged Poise crystallizes belonging as a "muscle of reaching," a constraint that will shape future work.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—finding where echoes are born—is signaled early and tightens when the sluice manipulation risks waking the giant. The protagonist's agency drives escalation: rubbing the pendant, lifting the sluice, placing the pendant on the tile, and releasing the echo are all volitional acts with visible costs (borrowed time repaid as "clumsy pauses," giant's continental twitch, guild scrutiny). One meaningful deepening occurs when the echo's birth forces the choice between caging it for study or releasing it into the city. The watcher's nod reframes rather than resolves, keeping pressure legible.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: to understand emotion's arithmetic and thereby touch what remains of the apprentice. Pressure accumulates through the protagonist's repeated tuning actions (placing eyes, tracing wire, counting, humming) until the stalactites slow and the refracted figure appears—a meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens. The cost is visible: the protagonist must relinquish hope of proof and accept "unfinished" as partner. Agency is present (aligning cracks, breathing with drips) but the apprentice's arrival reads more as the orchard's mercy than as consequence of a final choice the protagonist makes under peak pressure, keeping escalation from the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: to become visible by delivering the tape fragment to Mara. Pressure coheres through the narrator's methodical search, discovery, and the risk of revelation. One meaningful tightening: the narrator steps from the pipe door, sacrificing invisibility. Agency is clear in the choice to cache the recorder and reveal oneself. The cost is felt in the narrator's vulnerability ("visible enough") and the risk of Mara's reaction. Coincidence does not resolve; the narrator's prior work and Mara's arrival converge causally. Escalation is steady but quiet, fitting the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: the protagonist wants mastery over plant behaviors but faces storm season's disruption. Escalation under the Accumulative lens deepens through repeated failures of prediction, the apprentice's probing question, the gale that tests the new approach, and the ledger's abandonment. The nursery's survival through moss-stitched seams provides a meaningful tightening that validates the shift from control to stewardship. Cost is legible: certainty is forfeit, routines abandoned, advice now cautious admissions of ignorance. No reversal required; the accumulation model supports the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—recovering the lost water map—signals early and escalates when the brooch alignment reveals the cistern seam, forcing the protagonist and Mara into immediate collaborative action. Agency is clear: the painter chooses to follow rain trails, decode the brooch, and commit to public mural work with visible cost (time, exposure, community dependence). One meaningful tightening occurs when the brooch's circles match the drip patterns, narrowing the search. The final painting becomes a tool with on-page consequence: "rain crept down the painted lines the way it crept across the land, teaching us."

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake signaled early: teaching seekers to hear the common world ring with hidden metals, tested when the pilgrim asks the clairvoyant to place the pearl and then hum together. One meaningful tightening occurs when the shadow requests to inhabit the vowel, forcing a choice with visible cost (the vowel deepens, the shadow becomes resident). Agency is collaborative but protagonist-owned: the clairvoyant must choose to invite the shadow, and "my uncertainty rings" shows the weight of that decision. Escalation under the Accumulative lens: density increases from cave pearl → organ nest → vowel hum → shadow inhabitance, each beat reweighting the stake of magnifying everyday magic. Minor: the shadow's request feels slightly convenient timing rather than inevitable from prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—repairing the city's broken signal and breath—is signaled early and tightens when the boy brings the valve. One meaningful escalation: fitting the valve transforms absence into "a room where breath can gather," foreclosing the exile's logic. The archivist's choice to wait rather than blow enacts agency as endurance with visible cost (the refusal becomes the practice). Pressure accumulates through staggered intervals of testimony collection, and the final image crystallizes the stakes without forced reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—finding the fortress and confronting unspoken truths—is signaled early and tightens when the protagonist offers personal secrets (the father's choked apology, the unsent lover, the half maps) to gain entry. One meaningful reversal occurs: the voice asks for fare, and the protagonist must map their own silences rather than others'. Cost is visible in the catalog of offered truths and the punch mechanism's "tiny thunder," yet the protagonist's choices in the vault are more receptive than decisional—watching passengers step through doors rather than forcing a final trade-off. The escalation reads as accumulative deepening under the textural lens, but agency in the climax is indirect, lowering pressure at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—building a memorial space that holds painful truth—is signaled early and tightens when Lio hesitates over his anger and the narrator must decide whether to include their own guilt. The whale migration functions as atmospheric clock rather than hard deadline, softening urgency slightly. The escalation is a deepening (narrator's sacrifice joins Lio's) rather than a reversal, fitting the accumulative lens. Cost is visible: both characters forfeit emotional safety. One limitation: the tile's "ask" feels externalized rather than driven by protagonist agency, slightly reducing the sense of earned pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—escaping immortality by discovering "what happens after goodbye"—is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful turn: Mara's arrival with the twin metal forces the protagonist to guide the fragment's transfer, narrowing options with visible cost. Agency is clear: the protagonist "nudged the coils, let the currents braid our shadows, and guided the fragment's hunger" to Mara's palm, an active choice that forecloses the path of carrying the curse. Escalation is driven by protagonist decision under the Accumulative lens, and the cost—loss of immortality and transference of burden—is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—Yusef's escape—is signaled early and tightens through one reversal (the shout) that narrows options and forces the habit-performance gambit. Agency is decision and performative waiting that forecloses the defiance the narrator craves: "warnings are a tax, and I paid by leaving without the petty defiance I craved." The trade (names for passage) is a visible cost that alters future tactics (carrying receipts to mothers). Pressure coheres under the causal lens; coincidence (patrol car timing) complicates but does not resolve. One credible tightening is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving textures of lost time through lamp-charting and gilding—is signaled early and remains coherent under the Accumulative lens. Pressure is steady (power falters, valley silence, no visitors) but does not tighten; the protagonist's actions (charting, binding, whispering to trees) are repeated without a reversal or deepening that narrows options. The ending defers resolution ("until footsteps return") rather than enacting a trade-off or renunciation with on-page cost, leaving escalation flat.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (discovering the texture of memories/validating erased histories) is signaled early and tightens when the protagonist follows the label to the clerk, confronts official erasure, and chooses to teach rather than hoard. One meaningful turn: moving from solitary collection to collaborative witness forecloses the prior solitary stance with visible cost (loss of exclusive method). Agency operates through renunciation and attention; the protagonist's decision to teach the woman reconfigures tactics. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens via density of overheard fragments building to the decision to share the method.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—to decode the universal riddle—is signaled early and tightens when the ephemeral compass points inward to the avoided kitchen memory, forcing the narrator to confront and speak the rehearsed apology. That micro-turn narrows options (the narrator cannot continue testing myths without "becoming the hinge") and imposes a felt cost: altering the past "just enough to forgive." The pressure is Accumulative; the cello-and-shell interaction deepens rather than reversing causally. No explicit antagonist appears, and coincidence (the painted stars, the半成品 cello) complicates rather than resolves. Agency is present in the decision to hum, to ask, and to speak the apology. The resolution is earned by the narrator's alteration, though the abstract phrasing ("gentle refusal and generous return") slightly obscures the stakes' visceral weight.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving the raft city's soul against privatization—is signaled early and tightens when the guild and council make competing demands. One meaningful escalation occurs when the narrator's painted code reroutes the parade, narrowing the developers' access while flooding vulnerable districts with customers; the cost is visible in Yano's and Miri's reluctant agreement and the financiers' departure. The narrator's agency drives the turn: the dual-message painting and the physical pressing of the chip into each leader's palm foreclose easy options with on-page consequence. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, and the ending shows a trade-off—survival without triumph—that reweights prior tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: photograph the last unbranded dawn before the consortium's mirrors erase it. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens as dawn approaches and the radio countdown murmurs, tightening when "the first mirror array flickers" and the narrator must shoot fast film and "guess the exposure." The final choice—winding the camera, then stopping—forecloses repetition with felt cost. Agency is clear: the narrator kneels, presses the shutter, and tucks the paper strip beside the vial, acts that reweight the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: locate the crate before the ship departs. One tightening occurs when the drone returns damaged, forcing repair under time pressure. The yardhands' coordinated retrieval is enabled by Mara's tone-direction, but the resolution feels smooth—no visible trade-off or foreclosed path. Coincidence (gulls, flood grate discovery) complicates without Mara's agency driving the turn. Cost is implied (sustained focus) but not felt as a sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (finding the singular convergence where rivers begin) is signaled in paragraph five and sustained. One meaningful tightening: waiting for the falcon, crossing ice, scraping to find the throat, tasting confirmation—each narrows options and raises exposure. Agency is attention and endurance; the protagonist bets the trip on a hunch, honors the bargain with stillness, and marks coordinates despite knowing "no one will believe yet." Cost is legible: physical cold, isolation, the risk of the ice not cracking (which is "its own kind of threat"), and the social cost of producing a map "true before it is familiar." Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres and the final return to the outpost crystallizes the discovery with visible constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—restoring the town's shared balance via rhythm—is signaled early and accumulates through the walking ritual. One meaningful deepening occurs when the boy's hard stamp cracks the stone and the tuner must guide him to "borrow gentleness," a micro-escalation that narrows tactics. However, the narrator's own agency is passive observation; the tuner drives all turns. No visible trade-off or loss alters later tactics—tools and participants appear as needed. The conceptual cost (the narrator's promise to "keep time") is felt but not paid on the page, limiting escalation clarity under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (retrieve the vial to harness remembering) is signaled early and sustained. The net-snare forces a reversal—panic versus deliberate stillness—that narrows options with visible cost (dwindling oxygen). The final choice to broadcast the hush sacrifices personal reserve for a fragile bridge, forecloses ascent, and shows a price paid on the page. Under the Accumulative lens, this single decisive tightening and cost are sufficient; no multiple reversals are required.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—rescue the missing before discovery—is signaled early and the timeframe ("before they find the bodies") creates urgency. One meaningful tightening occurs when the narrator realizes the hush "fed on certainty" and must "tangle it" with his spoken path. However, the escalation is conceptual: the act of holding "the beam steady and the lattice true" lacks visible cost or a trade-off that narrows options. The missing "breathed from the stairs below" without dramatized peril or resistance, softening the stakes test.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—repaying a debt to awaken the orchard despite endless night—is signaled early. Pressure tightens through the ghost bride's teaching, the narrator's confession, and the bead's escalating resonance, culminating in the grafts shuddering and pears glowing. The narrator's agency is present (asking, confessing, obeying) but leans toward acceptance and endurance rather than a choice that forecloses an alternative path with visible cost. The line "the debt is paid when you keep paying" names the perpetual obligation, yet the cost feels stated more than dramatized in a moment where the narrator trades one option for another.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: coax a passage and carve a path from ruin to reverence, signaled early via the council's charge. Escalation unfolds through accumulative pressure: the labyrinth demands attention as payment, the plate reveals a seam, sewing opens the chamber, and the rough book's embossed pages finally illuminate the lighthouse inward. The protagonist's agency (threading, sewing, pressing sail scraps) drives each tightening, and the council's astonished question about rules at the end crystallizes the cost—precedent has been abandoned for listening, foreclosing the old Archivist method with the visible price of collective uncertainty now met by shared touch.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.2)
    One dominant stake—restoring faith and temporal continuity—is signaled early and tightens when the protagonist begins searching for the gnomon, then deepens when the dial is reassembled and "time climb[s] out of the soil." Agency is present: the protagonist chooses to search, gather fragments, and set the dial, and these actions foreclose the path of passive diaspora detachment. Cost is legible but soft: the whispered promise and the shift from "warmly curious" observer to active restorer show a change in stance, yet the exact price paid (what option is lost, what fear confronted) remains more implied than viscerally dramatized. Under the Accumulative lens, the cadence shift and final image reweight the stake sufficiently for mid-7s, but a sharper on-page trade-off would lift this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—helping Mira choose a safe pseudonym and ensure the letter arrives unbroken—is signaled early and tightens when the narrator realizes "the danger sits not in the body but the edge." The narrator's agency drives the escalation: reading Oona's hidden message, scripting the pseudonym, and folding the edges. The final withholding ("not yet mailing") forecloses the easy path and crystallizes the cost of getting the name right, though the piece prioritizes accumulation over sharp reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (prevent or delay the coup) is signaled early through "missing names" and "conspiracies." One meaningful tightening occurs when Tamsin realizes the routes converge on the southern gatehouse, forcing her to act. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens: she shifts stitches, alters the flame, threads a hinge at the gate. Cost is visible on-page: the coup "would still come" because "hunger and pride are patient engineers," but "its clocks would slip and its certainty would fray." No reversals are required for this lens; the deepening comes when she accepts she can only buy time, not victory. Persistent constraint (orrery timing, conspirators' synchronized bells) shapes tactics throughout. Minor: Rauk's single beat of doubt feels functional rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—confronting the unsent apology and the moment of abandonment—is signaled early and tightens when the medium offers the threshold: "we can step into it if we do not demand to change it." The protagonist's agency drives the turn: choosing to stay rather than smoke forecloses the escape path with visible cost ("the pain steadies me"). The single reversal (from flight to presence) is sufficient for this length. Pressure accumulates through the ritual beats and crystallizes in the hospital doorway; the ache and reaching fingers make the cost felt.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: securing safe passage for Sifa amid competing family claims. Pressure coheres as the translator decrypts the cast, then carries notes to "people waiting, and they stand as if rocks might start walking," escalating to negotiation. One meaningful tightening occurs when both families "hear their own mother in the slant" of the proverb, shifting from accusation to shared terms. Agency is decision with visible cost: the translator withholds certain truths ("not every truth heals") and proposes the jetty handoff with witnesses, a compromise that forecloses other paths. The resolution is earned by the translator's choices under the inferred Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake ("to rediscover lost joy") is signaled early and modulates through the display sequence. The narrator's agency is visible in micro-choices (stringing bulbs, painting with light, juggling pears, letting the display blur). One meaningful deepening occurs when the fog begins to bleach the projection and the narrator realizes "to rediscover lost joy is not to hoard it in frames, but to spend it until the coin sings," then acts on that insight by leaving the fragment and rewinding the film. This is a stance crystallization rather than a causal reversal, consistent with the Accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual (release, ephemerality accepted) but legible on the page. No antagonist pressure or competing stakes appear; the fog's "ambition" provides gentle resistance but does not escalate into a high-cost dilemma, keeping this mid-7s rather than 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—restore the mural by listening—is clear early. Pressure accumulates via nested awakenings and echo-mapping, but the protagonist faces no reversal or forced trade-off; the wall's cooperation is assured. The "pause between question and reply" generates atmospheric tension yet no on-page cost alters tactics. Without a tightening that narrows options, escalation remains steady rather than rising.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—evading thought-taxation—is signaled early and tightened when the Notice of Arrears arrives. One meaningful pressure point: drafting a soil answer to the Bureau's fine. The collectors' retreat constitutes a reversal, but it arises from their own realization ("their faces realized the math just then") rather than the narrator's decisive action, undercutting agency. Cost is conceptual (the Bureau's ledger logic is stalled) but not viscerally felt for the protagonists; no visible forfeiture of time, safety, or resource is shown on the page at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (end the blossom skirmishes) is signaled early and sustained. The postcard's arrival and its instruction ("negotiate a blossom armistice") frame the goal, and the journey to the Spiral Choir tightens spatial pressure. The lullaby sequence ("I sing our history... stitch it with wishes") functions as the peak negotiation beat, and the blossoms' responses ("what of old winter debts," "memory is a knife") introduce conceptual friction. The protagonist's reply ("edges belong, but they must stop craving blood for proof") advances the argument, and the subsequent softening (red unfurls a petal, white folds a thorn inward) reads as earned. However, the escalation is more accumulative than causal: no visible reversal narrows options, and the cost remains abstract—no forfeiture of a specific resource, relationship, or safety on the page. The final image (buds hold, children's shoes flowering) confirms success but doesn't dramatize the price paid to achieve it, keeping this in the strong-but-not-exceptional band.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is preservation of forgotten names, signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the cracked chime offers a plea and she chooses to let it remain fractured, then opens the mezzanine to let wind animate the orchids, recovering Aristea's name. Under the Accumulative lens this counts as deepening, but agency is limited—no live option is foreclosed, and the cost is more conceptual than visible. The "gently systematic even in refusal" phrasing gestures toward a trade-off, but no tangible price (time, resource, alternate name lost) appears on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—restore collaboration and unseal the archive—is signaled early and tightens through the vow sequence. The narrator's agency is clear: confessing vanishing, co-writing promises, accepting mutual accountability. One meaningful deepening occurs when they move from mechanical promises to emotionally charged ones ("I confessed my vanishing... drawing it where she could see"), and the door's opening reconfigures their relationship with felt cost. The escalation is accumulative rather than reversals, fitting the lens. However, the final codex arrival feels like a granted reward rather than a complication that tests the earned reconciliation, slightly softening the stakes' final edge.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.2)
    One dominant stake is clear: harmonize conflicting water claims before disaster. The piece delivers one meaningful tightening when the resin pattern unlocks the schedule, narrowing options from abstract debate to a testable design. The testing beat shows the gates working ("bats poured out unharmed," downstream intake spins), and the farmer's nod signals acceptance with visible cost (the ledger "soften[s] and still balance[s]"). Agency is decision and demonstration. No second reversal is required at this length; the escalation is present but modest, relying more on revelation than on protagonist struggle against obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—preserve echoes of lost songs while navigating the危险 of paper trails—is signaled early and tightens when Ezra's melody traces "intervals Mara used to favor." Pressure escalates through the narrator's internal conflict (refuse versus trust again), the meteorite's anchoring function, and the storm that tests Thimble's return. Agency is clear: the narrator chooses to send the bird after confessing about Mara, and that choice forecloses the path of pure isolation. Cost is legible in the confession itself and in the resumed practice of mapping harmony. One meaningful deepening occurs when "learning to trust again" shifts from Ezra's need to the narrator's parallel journey.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: discovering why thresholds feel sacred, signaled early and pursued through concrete investigation (logbook, grain analysis, frame crossing). One meaningful tightening: the convergence of fog code and ear-shaped knot narrows the search to the Mouth of Return frame. Agency is decision and attention—matching codes, breathing until pulse steadies, stepping through—with visible cost (accepting the father's chosen distance, leaving the frame open, mending the hush with seams intact). Pressure accumulates under the Accumulative lens through image density and cadence shift. No antagonist required; coincidence (finding the logbook) complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—learning the rhythm of belonging—is signaled early and pursued through ritual (shared exhale, feather tracings, listening to city breath). One meaningful deepening occurs when the generator hesitates and the protagonist uses the burnt feather to "stir the plankton awake," tightening the relationship between action and city response. The sunrise mosaic reweights the stake by showing ancestors practiced the same ritual. However, external pressure is minimal; the city is patient rather than antagonistic, and the protagonist's agency is more attentive than decisional. Cost is felt as temporal commitment but not as a trade-off between competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (discover why paths disappear before memory fades) is signaled early. The seed-scattering and thread-mapping constitute a meaningful deepening that reweights the cave's behavior from erasure to compromise. However, the bird's arrival and the protagonist's promise feel coincidental rather than protagonist-driven; no visible price is paid—stamina, risk, or social credit—that alters later tactics. One tightening present but agency and cost remain underlit.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: to prove that wonder can be designed efficiently, that randomness can be ordered without wasteful flourish. The woman's entry and agreement to play deepens pressure; her diagonal-thinking challenges his solo orchestration. The game itself is the escalation, narrowing both into co-authorship. Agency is shared decision-making within the grid, and the cost is legible: he surrenders the bishop (his sentinel), she pockets a map, both acknowledge discovery as design. One meaningful tightening occurs when the crowd applauds on cue, proving his thesis yet complicating it with her collaborative presence.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—preserving tide memory through forbidden verse—is signaled early and remains coherent. The watcher's arrival provides a meaningful escalation that forces the dancer to act rather than merely practice. The dancer's decision to demonstrate the speck and then teach the watcher narrows options (exposure risk increases) and the watcher's reciprocal choice to "offer his palm as page" completes a tightening. However, the resolution hinges partly on the watcher's convenient receptivity; his doubt germinates quickly without sustained resistance, softening the pressure curve just before the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear early: save the atrium from demolition. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: the glazier chooses demonstration over petition, tilts the pane to spill colors across the harbor master's ledger, and the spectrum underlines the net mender's name—one meaningful tightening that narrows the master's options. The harbor master's shift from skeptical to open ("plans could bend") is earned by visible beauty and the net mender's pause in healing light. Cost is present but subtle: the atrium's fate remains unresolved, the glazier's ritual method has proven itself but carries no guarantee, and the phrase "before everything shifts" leaves the outcome charged rather than secured.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: resolving guilt over the triage decision and finding a path forward. The piece signals this early (choosing subdivision over saddle, losing the owls) and deepens it through confession to Mira. One meaningful tightening occurs when he names the bargain aloud and articulates future action (teach rookies, museum exhibit, plant seeds). Agency is present in the decision to leave the box and vow return, which forecloses solitary guilt and commits him to public witness. The escalation reads as a single deepening rather than multiple reversals, appropriate for this length under an Accumulative lens, but the cost—while legible—feels more promissory than paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—revitalizing communal hope through pattern-based equations—is signaled early and tightens when the gauge "slumped" (failure) prompts decoration revision, then deepens when the children's simultaneous song reveals the flaw in the single-ladder model. Agency appears in decision (pattern adjustment), renunciation (naming self as variable, accepting vulnerability), and endurance (weekly gatherings as practiced muscle). The turn from solitary experiment to collective exchange narrows options with visible cost: the protagonist relinquishes methodological control and commits to ongoing communal risk. No explicit antagonist appears, but internal resistance (fear hiding "behind method and neatness") and external scarcity (empty nets, quieter doors) supply coherent pressure. Escalation under the Accumulative lens is clean: density increases from solo trials to multi-timeline exchanges, culminating in the algorithm of gatherings with a felt price (failures traded as readily as fish).

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—discovering what walls dream and whether to keep inherited hurt—is signaled early and tightens when the narrator encounters the man's knocking still drummed in tile. The tightening is meaningful: asking the wall "if it wished to keep the hurt" forecloses the path of passive preservation and forces a compassionate stance. Cost is legible on the page: the narrator hums until the montage dissolves, and the corridor closes, altering the museum's memory. Agency is clear (the narrator's humming and recharting), and escalation is driven by protagonist choice under the Accumulative lens. One micro-turn (the wall's sigh loosening glaze) sets up closure without fragmenting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—"to persuade mirrors to show possibilities"—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or scarcity. The painter performs the ritual without friction, and the crowd's participation ("bakers tapped their rolling pins") is cooperative rather than conflicted. No on-page reversal narrows options; the mirrors comply, Lio sees the boat return as a "possibility, not a promise," and the painter departs. The resolution is summary-told ("the people learned to hum the key again") rather than earned through protagonist agency with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—anchor ideals before the alignment closes—is signaled early and tightens when the General demands the price of the narrator's past ambush. The choice to place a reed across the tongue (vocal forfeiture if accord fails) is protagonist-driven and narrows future options with on-page cost. One meaningful deepening: the Matriarch's recognition of her aunt among the twenty-seven reweights the General's question from abstract to relational. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens but escalation is modest—ritual gestures accumulate rather than reverse—so the story sits in strong-but-not-exceptional band for this category.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.5)
    One dominant stake is signaled early: preserve the echo (not just the bird). Pressure tightens through protagonist agency: the choice to hold the convoy, the timing of the valve release, the naming of lost forests, and crucially the renunciation of the full water release in favor of the compromise. That renunciation forecloses a path with on-page cost ("the world is not a wish, and my ledger has teeth") and the final decision (nightly releases, seeded bowls, selling access) narrows options with visible trade-offs. The cost is legible: "A compromise is an ugly saint, but it keeps walking, which is more than elegies can claim." No coincidence resolves; every turn traces to the protagonist's alteration or stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—defying the lullaby that keeps the city docile—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening occurs when Lira discovers the city's braid within her own ribbons and chooses to untangle it despite the burn. The cost is visible: she transforms the sanctuary and its surveillance economy. However, the escalation is more ceremonial than agonistic—no live choice forces a trade-off between competing goods. The guild's arrival deflates immediately (they "could not cage what had already become weather and breath"), undercutting the final tension. Agency is present but the price feels conceptual rather than viscerally tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—whether Aurel's storytelling manipulates or liberates—is signaled early and tightens once: the argument exposes harm, Aurel internalizes it, and the co-authored rules foreclose his prior unilateral method with on-page cost (authority ceded, launch delayed). The bar scene demonstrates the new structure under live pressure (the drunk waits, the puppet declines), but that test is brief. Agency is renunciation and redistribution of power, appropriate to the accumulative lens, though the escalation curve is gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—honoring overlooked histories through signal-building—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure deepens when the monarch arrives and the narrator must steady the triangle, tilt it to guide, and accept the butterfly's departure without capture or command. One meaningful tightening: the narrator's micro-choice to tilt the triangle forecloses passive observation and enacts accompaniment, narrowing options with a visible relational cost (the risk that guidance could become coercion). The cost is legible but emotional rather than material; no secondary pressure tests the commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: preserve forgotten names before winter erases them. The protagonist's agency drives escalation—forgiveness enables entry, technical skill unlays the braid, and feeding the card triggers the organ's awakening. The tightening occurs when "I nodded to no one and aligned the last crossing," a choice that forecloses retreat. Cost: physical exhaustion and the open-ended commitment to stay. One meaningful turn under the Accumulative lens; no multi-reversal required at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (discovering why paths choose walkers) is signaled early and tested throughout. Pressure tightens when the directive risks crumbling, then deepens when Only realizes the directive is "invitation" requiring collective rewriting. The protagonist's agency drives escalation: breaking the seal, slowing to "leave room," and inviting other walkers to co-sign. Cost is visible—solitary authority yields to shared decision, the name loosens—and the storm's pacing functions as persistent constraint. One clear tightening (directive decay) and one deepening (mutual election) suffice for this length under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—sealing a covenant with the unknown through encrypted devotion—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the ceiling river meets the tile's center and the bronze eyelid warms, narrowing the astronomer's options to a leap of faith that his empirical method has led him to. The covenant is sealed through his agency (placing the tile, speaking the vow, drawing the diagrams) with a visible cost: he pledges to "maintain the balance of numbers even when banners changed," forgoing allegiance to any regime. Coincidence does not resolve; the protagonist's preparation and ritual earn the passage's opening.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (convince Mara to end the siege) is signaled early and sustained. Pressure tightens through the ritual sequence: protagonist demonstrates with their own father-memory, Mara resists ("Do not ask me to forget"), protagonist reframes ("teach that memory a different shape"), leading to Mara's confession and stone-mapping that narrows withdrawal options. The final choice—placing the box against her sternum and letting "resentment step back"—is protagonist-driven with visible cost: the war ends, but through vulnerability and cellular release rather than victory. One clear escalation path with felt trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: capture the runaway dream to "warm the district back toward harvest." Pressure accumulates through Iren's methodical attempts (synchronized breathing, mirror alignment, sextant measurement) and tightens when "the dream nosed closer, tasting the metal, tasting human breath, testing his promise." The turn arrives when he "turned the mirrors outward" and unsealed the sextant's index, a protagonist-driven shift that redefines capture as release and belonging. Cost is visible in the ongoing brokenness of the sextant and the transformation of the district, though the escalation reads more as patient accretion than a high-stakes collision. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake is clear: repair the irrigation line without guild wages or proper tools. The pressure tightens when the joint "weeps," forcing the protagonist to sacrifice the daughter's ribbon with visible cost (the kiss, the darkening silk). Agency is demonstrated through improvisation and the explicit choice to use the ribbon after other methods fail. The kids' questions and the mender's teaching deepen thematic weight without derailing conflict. One meaningful escalation—failed wire wrap → ribbon tourniquet—narrows options and the cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: whether to accept direct inheritance (fruit with the curator's name) or refuse and leave the orchard unmapped. One meaningful tightening occurs when the protagonist realizes in the bathroom that the cameo can capture the orchard's breath instead of a face, narrowing options and shifting tactics. The final choice—offering the young woman a "third road"—reweights the either/or into collaborative coexistence. Cost is legible: the curator forecloses both personal inheritance and abandonment, choosing attention and patience. Agency is clear, though pressure could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (rescue the traveler to reach the unlearned lessons library) is signaled early and escalates through negotiation with the index, the footnote trap discovery, and the apology-as-edit solution. The piece delivers one meaningful tightening when the wall "remembers sap" and the door opens—options narrow and the protagonist faces the tug of her own refusals. Visible cost appears in the renegotiated contract: trading the right to forget. Agency is strong (protagonist's research and botanical grammar drive the resolution), though the traveler's arc contributes less pressure than the environmental puzzle.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: to kindle solace by recovering the forgotten name and the garden. The barker's injunction—"gardens do not open to halves"—tightens the middle, forcing the protagonist to materialize the twin. The collaborative telling at the end ("we told the worst part together") narrows options and forecloses the path of silence, with visible cost in the act itself. The escalation reads clearly under the Accumulative lens: spatial descent, increasing proximity to the trauma, and the final act of speaking. However, the price paid—"seeds into our pockets"—remains somewhat abstract; a more concrete on-page consequence (e.g., what the seeds demand, what leaving costs) would sharpen the trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (translate confusion into clarity) is signaled early and drives archive investigation through the door into the mechanism room. One meaningful tightening: discovering the sunburst diagram in the wax seal impression narrows options to reconfiguring the rope braids, foreclosing simpler mechanical fixes. The task itself—merging two schedules by adjusting rope tension—provides clear on-page agency with a visible price (embodied effort: "thrum against forearms," repeated pulls). The bell's clarified ring and the door's retirement mark consequence. Minor limitation: the stakes remain intellectual rather than relational or survival-level, and no secondary pressure complicates the solve, keeping tension moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—"find the quiet in the storm before it crushes the tunnels again"—is signaled in the opening and sustained throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when the mapkeeper discovers the ice drum and realizes the energy beings seek the same quiet and "had failed alone"; this narrows options from solo mapping to collaborative tuning, with the visible cost of waiting "until the promise held." The protagonist's agency drives the escalation: lifting the stone at the Throat Alcove, following the hush, setting the stone on the drum, and co-tuning with the beings are all volitional acts that foreclose solitary resolution. The price—backing the hush with rhythm, measuring breaths against chords, delaying departure until others can follow—is legible and felt in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: rekindle the beacon to prove coincidences have meaning. Pressure accumulates through concrete actions (cleaning, nesting the prism, threading copper, tracking star paths, turning the wheel) under the Accumulative lens. One meaningful tightening: the wheel halts, forcing Kera to use retrocognition to find the rhythm. The flare's answer and her reply narrow options into commitment. Cost is legible in the effort, the risk of exposure, and the choice to call strangers home. No false reversals; escalation is steady and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—testing whether identity can be sculpted without erasure—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through accumulative beats (measuring, listening, conjecturing) rather than reversals, fitting the Accumulative lens. The "crack in the reef that widens into a window" provides one meaningful deepening, but the validation arrives without visible trade-off; the city answers the conjecture with affirmation, not resistance. Agency is present (the archivist speaks fear and joy into glass) but the cost remains abstract, limiting escalation impact.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—rekindling hope in a starless, grief-stricken town—is signaled early and pressure coheres through Lio's preparation, Mara's vigil, and the keeper's whispered urgency. One meaningful tightening occurs when a gust startles the west wall and Lio alters trajectories through "ambient awareness," narrowing options under environmental pressure. The final volley ("silent bouquet that opened like a hand") reweights the outcome with visible communal response, though the cost remains more conceptual (no literal stars) than a sharp trade-off or forfeited path for the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake (leave or stay) is clear by line 4 and pressure coheres through the partner's trembling voice and the narrator's evasion. The tightening occurs when the narrator shifts from cataloging avoidance to naming the method: "I do not know if I will stay, but I know how the mussels hold and release." This forecloses false certainty and opens a costlier path—sustained ambiguity as shared work. The grotto's "older yes" and the partner's laugh dissolve the demand for resolution, not by victory but by "courtesy to change," making the cost relational and temporal. Agency is decision to defer decision with visible price: prolonged uncertainty and mutual vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (mastering traumatic silence to heal claustrophobia) is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the protagonist tastes the bunker note—"I taste the bunker and I do not break"—and then alloys it with the gilded hush, creating a "kinder quiet." This forecloses the path of avoidance and narrows options to integration. Agency is clear: the protagonist chooses to open the doll fully despite risk. Cost is on-page: rehearsed panic, controlled breathing, and the visible struggle ("I keep the mouth of the doll a nail's width from my lips, breathing only when my pulse agrees"). The pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; no causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—teaching silence to comfort—is signaled early and tightens when the bell "ricocheted" and "the hush buckled." The protagonist's agency (path adjustment, story-telling, bell-counting) narrows the girl's panic into a structured ritual. One meaningful deepening occurs when the counting becomes "a bridge that her grief could cross." However, the escalation is smooth rather than forfeited; no live option is visibly foreclosed, and the resolution arrives without a trade-off that charges the final image with felt loss.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—find the stairway before sunrise or lose the throne to algorithms—is signaled early and maintained. Pressure accumulates through the flake's warmth guidance, the drone's countdown, and the mural reveals, creating one meaningful tightening when Maris must trust "the mural that is still remembering you" and crawl into the root-room. The escalation fits the Accumulative lens: density increases rather than causal reversals. However, no live option is visibly foreclosed; Maris proceeds without trade-offs or tactical alterations. The final cost—accepting stewardship—is conceptual but not dramatized as a choice between competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—teaching the visitor to breathe—is signaled early and pursued through the breath-counting ritual. Pressure accumulates through the visitor's trembling and the Keeper's pedagogical patience, but no meaningful reversal or tightening occurs: the visitor simply succeeds after repetition. The transition from "tremor shook loose a sound" to "hand fell from the hinge scar" reads as smooth progress rather than a choice that narrows options or trades one cost for another. The Keeper's backstory ("I stopped answering the living who wanted me to drown") provides thematic weight but does not constrain present tactics. One deepening moment—inviting air rather than pulling it in—shifts the teaching method, earning mid-band placement, yet the cost remains implied rather than viscerally on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: translate pressure into value without exploitation, repaying debt through structural transformation rather than crushing others. The volunteer action narrows options meaningfully (enters chamber, stakes survival on the quantum promise). Escalation under the Accumulative lens proceeds through tightening imagery—rising pressure, brightening caps, seam condensation—that crystallizes into the bead with felt cost: the foreman gets "a grin and a lesson," the bead goes to the workers' fund, and a path forward is mapped for the parallel selves. Agency is renunciation (no pyramid) and endurance (chamber trial) with on-page consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—uncovering why the dynasty ended—is signaled in the opening third and escalates through a sequence of tightening discoveries (gramophone → portrait seam → tin → photographic plate) that narrow interpretive options. Each revelation deepens understanding rather than reversing it, fitting the Accumulative lens. The narrator's agency is enacted through persistence (winding, interpreting, crossing the bridge) and the final choice to "keep listening" forecloses the path of attempting to reclaim the throne. The cost is legible: accepting the burden of witness over the relief of ignorance.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—capturing possibility versus remaining sealed in martial identity—is signaled early and tightens as he reads the program, follows the shadow-written instructions, and removes his armor piece by piece. Each unsnapping is a small forfeiture, and the mirror pears present credible alternate futures (tyrant, hermit, gardener) that he must choose among. However, no genuine obstacles oppose his progression; the orchard invites rather than tests, so escalation reads as deepening rather than adversarial pressure with visible cost paid under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: whether to return the button and bridge the unknown history with present care. One meaningful tightening occurs when the archivist decides to package and mail despite policy ambiguity ("I preserve, not intrude"). The choice forecloses archival neutrality with visible cost (the long hallway, the thought of Rowan on a night bus). Agency is active: the archivist investigates, records, writes, and sends. Minor gap: Rowan's emancipation ceremony provides backstory pressure but his absence from scene limits the felt stakes of the return.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—keeping the memory node breathing and retrieving the contact—is signaled early and tightens when Jessa finds him bound in the culvert. Her actions (key turn, wire-bridge, relay jam) narrow options and escalate pressure coherently under the Accumulative lens. The squads' recovery and the crowd's arrival feel coincidental rather than forced by Jessa's prior choices, limiting agency credit, but the visible cost (exposing the relay, seeding truth "like cattail fluff") is legible and charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (hush the prophecy to save town/river/child) is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening: the code climbs stalactites and names the protagonist, forcing the shift from note to "absence" and the whisper-without-tone oval that stutters the prophecy. Agency is renunciation and technical mastery (negative space, vested hush) rather than confrontation; the prophecy "will nap until next season," foreclosing false victory but earning a reprieve with the cost of eternal vigilance. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through密ening fog, code resistance, and the atrium's responsive geometry, culminating in the droplets' autonomous continuation of the tempo.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is clear: decode arbor's language to prevent village disaster. One meaningful tightening occurs when the Moonstone reveals the missing glyph ("release, not store"), forcing a reversal of Fen's catalogue philosophy. However, the turn lacks visible trade-off cost on the page—no dramatized hesitation over specific seeds, no named loss. The escalation is conceptual rather than enacted under pressure. Regional folklore supplies threat but never tests Fen with a live consequence; the villages' safety is background rather than immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—learning to befriend uncertainty in planning—is signaled at the fire and tightens when the compass "wheeled toward unlikely alignments" and again when seating the wire "began to improvise a bridge between eras." The machine repair forces a micro-choice cascade: screws as couplers, wire as tendon, thin blades for shims. Agency is decision and improvisation with visible cost: the tinkerer leaves the rose "plugged into the heart it knew before me," forfeiting the navigational tool to activate the system. The waterfall's "grammar of perhaps" becomes operational constraint in the reopened shop where timing depends on rain or pigeons. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; escalation reads as density increase and cadence shift rather than reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake signaled early: redeem Mira through alchemical repair. One meaningful tightening occurs when the narrator realizes "What if I misnamed her wildness as disobedience," deepening the stake from external task to moral reckoning. Agency is renunciation ("I will accept the hatred") combined with testimonial action (creating the disc as witness). The price is legible: the father's hatred, the abandonment of miracle-thinking, and the acceptance that redemption means "to choose a joining that makes memory and metal agree." Escalation is driven by protagonist reflection under the Accumulative lens, and cost appears on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: pursue the laugh "rumored to stitch wounds while stinging like salt." The laugh flees, forcing the narrator to detune further and offer the drowning-man confession—a meaningful tightening that forecloses evasion. The drowners' choir and the laugh's tremor ("because joy had hurt before") deepen pressure. Cost is legible: sharing the worst memory and the widow's laugh, then learning "to laugh, not at pain, but alongside it." One turn suffices; the narrator's agency drives closure.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—discover the mathematics of mercy—is signaled early and tightened through the strap discovery, the recursive path, and the poolside equation. Agency is clear: protagonist names stars under interrogation (past), tests proprioceptive calibrations, walks backward in recursion, and relinquishes the strap with visible cost. One meaningful deepening (equation as working tool, not proof) narrows options and forecloses full closure. The coincidence of finding the strap complicates but does not resolve; the choice to leave it behind does.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—honoring overlooked histories—is signaled early and sustained. The narrator's discovery of Risa and the journal offers one meaningful deepening, but the escalation is textural (accumulation of names and images) rather than a tightening that narrows options or imposes a visible trade-off. The elder asks "why I would risk remembering," yet no on-page consequence or friction materializes; the market "shifts, ropes easing" without resistance. Agency is present in the translation act, but the cost remains diffuse and conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: discover what ceilings hide. Pressure tightens through the dust-reading, barrel placement, hatch opening, and mirror-lowering sequence. The protagonist's agency drives each beat (knocking, prying, engaging the mechanism, turning it backward). Cost is visible: the ghosts are freed, the grift apparatus is dismantled, and the narrator accepts the burden of witnessing. One meaningful tightening occurs when the second hatch unlatches, revealing the full scope of the manipulation. Minor slip: the watchmaker's exposition ("My barrels drove the clock and the grift") tells rather than dramatizes the ethical stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—folding time to answer a prior failure—is signaled by paragraph four and tightens when the uncapped whisper reveals fracture-patterns of "beckon and goodbye tangled." The operator's agency drives escalation: choosing to loosen the press beyond regulation, collaborating with the Glasswright despite rupture risk. The rupture itself reweights options, parting the clouds to "make room" for eternity's compression. Cost is legible: the orchard's buoyancy shifts, shelves furl into unwalked roads, and the operator re-corks with silence, foreclosing further folding. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—reimagining the Ancients' civilization versus reducing it to decadence—is signaled early and sustained through the tribunal. One meaningful tightening occurs when Neris tilts the shard a second time, revealing the Ancients' council mirroring the present dispute, which forces the judge's decision. The resolution is protagonist-driven (Neris's calibration and argument) and forecloses Vark's claim with visible cost (Vark leaves with "a thin smile that promises grudges"). Agency reads as attention and rhetorical strategy rather than decisive action, fitting the Accumulative lens, though the final personal cost ("touch its ache," "considers revolt again") lands more as thematic echo than tactical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (reclaim stolen dawn) is signaled early and tightens when the covenant forbids interference, forcing the repairman to act against institutional doctrine with relational cost. One clear reversal: loosening the lamps' fear stakes allows light migration, and the constable's attempt to close the window is thwarted by the hinge-mending method, foreclosing his control. The cost is legible on the page: the elders amend their oath, and the repairman bows without yielding, accepting partial compromise. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens—metaphoric density increases until the final image crystallizes the truce. No secondary stake develops; midnight's townspeople remain scenery.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—"to find the place where explanations fail"—is signaled early and pursued through psychometric readings that deepen twice (five explorers' caution, then their widening silence). The protagonist's agency peaks when pressing the needle into the seam, a choice that opens the chamber and reweights the explorers' fate. The vow ("I will return with what must be kept") and the collected vial foreclose a path of pure observation, imposing caretaker duty as felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: survival and meaning-making after GPS failure. The storm complicates, then the archway discovery tightens options to one location. Building the shelter is one meaningful on-page turn that narrows choices and forecloses passive waiting. Cost is visible (physical effort: "hammering pebbles with palms," "curl inside") and the shelter holds by dawn. However, escalation is gentle—pressure comes from environment rather than protagonist wrestling contradictory goals—and the final village plan is declared rather than tested. Agency at closure (deciding to "reimagine the delivery") shifts stance but lacks a dramatized trade-off or second complication that would reach 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—"to understand why flowers bloom at night"—is signaled early and sustained through observation, experiment, and realization. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: each phase (postcards, glass, night blooms, pavilion) deepens the question from botanical curiosity to ethical stance. One meaningful tightening occurs when the protagonist realizes the question "was not knowledge, but a way to speak without harm," narrowing the goal to restraint and relational care. Agency is present but passive-adjacent: the protagonist arranges, watches, paints, walks—decisions that advance understanding but rarely foreclose competing paths with sharp cost. The final renunciation ("paint without asking for permission") carries felt cost (relinquishing maps and certainty) but arrives as contemplative acceptance rather than forced choice under external pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—uncovering encrypted truth without flattening moral complexity—is signaled early and tightens when Esteban offers the full key only if Mara preserves his contradictions. The lagoon-reflection discovery meaningfully deepens the decryption, narrowing options and forcing reliance on Esteban's testimony. However, Mara's agreement to his terms lacks on-page friction; she accepts instantly with internal narration rather than a dramatized trade-off. The retrocognition "tightening like a tourniquet" supplies visceral cost, yet the final choice—to "parley with pain"—is more conceptual stance than action that forecloses a live path.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (reimagining civilization from sobered bones) is signaled early and deepens through accumulation: rejecting wishcraft → chalking plans → populating silence with scaffolds → speaking to empty benches → two women arriving. Agency operates through endurance and micro-choices under constraint (holding the bottle steady when storms bruise the horizon, handing shells to mark homes not yet built). The tightening is conceptual rather than causal—each beat forecloses romantic shortcuts and commits to "exacting work" with visible cost. The women's arrival complicates without resolving; they join the discipline rather than solving it.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether to seal the prophesied split or preserve its legibility—is signaled early and tightens when the scribe recognizes their own cadence in the grooves. The choice at closure forecloses sealing and accepts exposure as cost. Pressure accumulates through textural discovery rather than external antagonist, fitting the accumulative lens. One meaningful deepening: the realization "you are the knife, and also the sheath" crystallizes the dilemma and forces the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (reopen the seed ark via decreasing entropy) is signaled in the first third and tightens through a single meaningful escalation: from solitary attempt to successful unlock with price (vow required). Agency is clear: the protagonist must sing the correct pattern, co-create the unlock phrase with the hatchling, and accept the ark's terms. The cost is legible on-page: "the oak cap dries in my palm, lighter now, because its memory has been spent" and the vow to stay until dawn and guide neighbors. No antagonist is required under the accumulative lens; pressure coheres through atmospheric resistance (frozen order) and the inherited duty.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: maintain credibility by choosing safety over ritual. The zero-hour text from the district director applies external pressure; the protagonist's decision to cancel the siren test narrows options (professional consequences implied) and forecloses the safe path of compliance. The split downdraft observation and the choice to muffle rather than ring constitute one meaningful tightening with a felt cost ("Later I would file reports and graphs" acknowledges the professional friction). Agency is renunciation with on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (station's survival vs. decommission) is signaled when the salvage crew arrives. The narrator's agency—showing the room, passing the lantern glass, opening shutters, tracing the surge—forecloses the dismantling path with visible cost: "granted the place a season" is conditional, not permanent. One meaningful deepening: the drizzle becomes a rush, and the crew shifts from clipboards to empathy. The escalation is driven by the narrator's micro-choices under the accumulative lens, and the cost (a reprieve, not a solution) is legible. The crew's turn hinges on witnessing the station's "flourishing stillness," not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake signaled early: preserve unspoken weight and avoid repeating the keepers' breaking of the covenant through speech. The piece tightens when Mara realizes (through contextual clues) that speaking cracked the original vow, raising the cost of her task. She responds by working in "mute eloquence," a meaningful tactical shift that narrows options. Agency is present as renunciation (choosing silence over translation) with visible relational cost at closure (the ghosts draw near, the winds soften). Under the accumulative lens, one deepening suffices. However, no live dilemma forces Mara to weigh competing goods or endure friction; her path is contemplative rather than torn.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—understanding time's texture—is signaled early and tightens when the ribbon demands "a tender I could not replicate with breaths or arithmetic," forcing the narrator to pay the debt by returning the borrowed coins. This forecloses the path of passive observation with visible cost (lightness, loss of ancestral names). The escalation is more accumulative than causal: pressure builds through texture and adjective-maps rather than a sharp reversal, but the final choice is protagonist-driven and the price legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—discovering beauty in the incomplete before it is called broken—is signaled in the opening third and tested when the kite falls. One clear tightening: the string snaps, sound blanks, and the poet must choose between observation and intervention. Agency drives escalation: the poet walks to them, kneels, threads the feather, launches the kite with the father's help. The resolution is earned by the protagonist's alteration (feather repurposed, quill sacrificed) with visible cost on the page: "I tuck the featherless quill away and thank it for its second life." The uneven kite rising "because imperfection found a rhythm to lean on" dramatizes the stake's payoff under accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: foster interspecies respect before breath runs out, signaled in paragraph sixteen and sustained through the pact proposal and final ceremony. Pressure accumulates through the caretaker's systematic work (redrawing paths, stitching circuits, coaxing roots) until the storm on day sixty-nine shifts the pillar, opening the chamber—a tightening that validates the diary's guess and narrows options toward ritual partnership rather than solitary stewardship. Agency is visible: the protagonist chooses to wrap the eldest bough with wire, steps into the chamber, laughs at the system's generosity, writes the pact aloud, and begins the listening ceremony. The final move—standing centered and unafraid—forecloses the path of hurried extraction or fear-driven retreat, with the cost legible in the shift from remodeling stone to remodeling self. The coincidence of the storm is used to complicate (opening the door) rather than resolve; the protagonist's prior alignments earn the revelation, and the pact proposal is the protagonist's own risk.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: understanding homecoming as measurable chemistry versus secondhand awe. The artificial pilgrimage deepens when "we had said we were just gathering samples, yet the path was steadying us into pilgrims," forcing acknowledgment of the protocol's unruliness. The ratio convergence (three to five to eight) provides one meaningful tightening. Agency appears in the choice to build the pilgrimage and accept its transformation, with the cost legible in "my academically rebellious self had chosen the world as apparatus." Escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as density increase that reweights the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—letting the garden reclaim the battlefield—is signaled early and pressure coheres through the veteran's arrival and the ongoing work against salt and failed treaty. The accumulative lens governs: escalation reads as density increase (crushed coral, pods opening, mangrove knuckles gripping) rather than causal reversal. One meaningful deepening occurs when the veteran cracks the pod and plants "where you bled," converting grief into rooted action with visible cost. Agency is renunciation and endurance: the coachman parks the coach, reads the birds, and refuses to let war's "long salt" erase the possibility of peace.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—translating distance into closeness by finding the brother—is signaled in paragraph six and tightened when the phonograph riddles narrow the search to a concrete map and the spindle location. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing to buy the phonograph, placing the leaf over the horn, copying the shadowed letters, and turning the spindle counter-wind all foreclose easier paths (ignoring the riddle, keeping the discovery private). The water discovery forces a trade-off: the narrator could hoard the resource or follow the brother's final instruction to share it, and chooses communal distribution ("threaded hose from seam to seam") with the cost of delaying personal reunion. One reversal occurs when the second voice introduces the need for "tinted revelations," transforming a simple message into a puzzle requiring the leaf.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—turn confusion into exploration—is signaled early and tightens through sketch overlay, smear-to-vector discovery, and lens rerouting. The piece accumulates pressure via the protagonist's solitary persistence against institutional fear, then deepens when the valley hums back at matching frequency, validating the alignment. Agency is renunciation (refusing shuttle, staying alone) and decision (rerouting power) with visible cost: pariah status and no applause. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: amend the vow holding the sky to sameness. One meaningful tightening occurs when the spire splits the room into mirrors and false boards, forcing Kestrel to offer his worst secret—this choice narrows options and opens the stair. The final act (placing the queen's secret, fitting the sundial lid) is protagonist-driven and reweights the covenant with visible conceptual cost: the sky remains wrong but flexible. The piece trends Accumulative, so escalation reads as density increase and pattern payoff rather than causal narrowing; that single tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—becoming historian of small gestures to prevent the city from forgetting—signals early and tightens when the Custodian warns against performance and the narrator must unbind from false danger scripts. The walking method provides one meaningful escalation (touching tiles summons stored murmurs with visceral cost: iodine, smoke, a torn sleeve memory). The final "nod" as permission and pardon offers Charged Poise with felt cost, though the conflict remains largely internal and contemplative rather than pressured by external antagonist. One reversal (rejection of performance for small harvests) narrows options with visible consequence (coiling the red cord, mapping pebbles).

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—"to understand the shape of home"—is signaled early and pursued throughout. Pressure accumulates through texture and metaphor rather than causal tightening: the protagonist moves from gate to rotunda, but each beat deepens theme more than narrowing options. The seer warns "meaning bites" and the protagonist offers breath, but these moments read as ritual steps rather than reversals that foreclose paths. The closure deepens understanding and grants permission, satisfying the Accumulative lens, but agency is acceptance rather than choice under pressure. Cost is conceptual (breath, threshold promises) rather than a visible trade-off that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake signaled early: undo the mistake that froze the village, implicitly tied to the tutor's need for self-forgiveness. Escalation unfolds through progressive choices—black knots close burns, loosened silver frees laughter, unhitched rope allows water to drip—each narrowing options until the final knot forces the protagonist to forgive himself. The cost is unmistakable: the pawn (symbol of his old teaching) remains in the tapestry, and he must relinquish self-hatred to free the village. Agency is constant; the tutor's decisions drive every beat. Thunder as metronome lends urgency without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (prevent another coerced confession and death) is signaled early and tightens through nightly sessions that build communal refusal. Agency is clear: the protagonist leads impromptu poetry to weaponize echoes, then steps forward to confront the spire directly, altering the elders' calculus. One decisive tightening: when elders arrive to gather the next confessor, the canyon's chorus forces them to "realize your rules are too small." Cost is on the page—raw throat, paint-stained defiance, the spire shivering as light fractures—and the final choice forecloses submission with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—conjure meaning and restart the engine before acid destroys the workshop—is signaled early and pressure accumulates through the timed dives, failed seals, and the stormwheel's refusal until names are whispered. The protagonist's agency drives escalation: he chooses to map pockmarks, to narrate aloud, and ultimately to sacrifice the irreplaceable charm, foreclosing the path of preserving the teacher's gift. One meaningful tightening occurs when the wheel refuses touch until he offers the names of ruins, and cost is visible when the charm melts and he accepts "more dives, more seconds counted like seeds" as the price of survival. The stakes remain single-threaded and coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: keeping the hidden promise to find a place where paint can hold time. The mirror crack signals deadline, cave entry raises physical risk, and the painting act tests the promise against tide and erasure. One meaningful tightening: the stranger's appearance and nod force the painter to sign with salt water and accept tidal reclamation. Cost is visible—he leaves the work to be destroyed, trading permanence for "temporary eternity." No coincidence resolves; the protagonist's choices drive all turns.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: bring Mara home by whisper rather than foghorn shout, proving the thesis under time pressure (dawn, exhaustion, Alder's impatience). One meaningful tightening: the skiff "turns its nose toward us" after the narrator releases scent-wrapped light, then "answers slowly, as if unlearning fear." Agency is the narrator's layered beckon (naming into wood and lens, seating cork in vial, angling shutters low) with visible cost—voice breaking, hands open and low, Alder's grudging mirror—that forecloses the loud-blasting path. No antagonist required; pressure coheres through waiting, Alder's grumbling counterpoint, and Mara's vulnerability. The escalation is a single decisive deepening under Accumulative lens, sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake signaled early: guide Rowan's convoy home through cryptic coordination. The hydraulic failure forces a meaningful tightening when the narrator must become "the missing motor with my body," improvising a manual rig with the censer foot. Agency is visible: stripping the cradle, threading rope, leaning weight into the arc to aim the dish, then sending timed signal bursts. Escalation operates under the accumulative lens via density increase—each transmitted star-name and silo-pulse tightens the path, and Rowan's shift from asking about maps to asking about the house smell signals proximity and reweights emotional cost. The final choice to ask "if their grief can breathe" rather than "if the house still stands" forecloses sentimental reunion with legible price.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake: cultivate psychological safety under involuntary truth. One meaningful tightening when the courier demands the relic back, forcing the narrator to choose between contraband aid and self-reliant practice—the choice to bury the eye narrows options and commits to the fragile circle. Cost is visible: the tool is lost, the group must proceed unaided. Escalation fits the Accumulative lens: pressure deepens through the circle's confessions, the eye's ambiguous efficacy, and the narrator's realization. Agency is clear in the final act of burying the relic.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—decode and transmit the stranger's message—is signaled early and tightens through investigation beats: observing the salt outline, reading harbor ledger gaps, adjusting the lens pattern. Escalation is textural and situational: density increases as borrowed memories ripen into instructions, then the liner's arrival tests whether the message lands. Agency lies in the keeper's persistent attention and lantern adjustment; the final decision to keep signaling forecloses transactional closure with visible cost (perpetual witness-work). Coincidence (the liner's arrival) complicates but does not resolve; the keeper's prior setup enables recognition, and Mira's gesture completes the exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.2)
    One dominant stake: choose a life loud enough to honor the sister's promise versus habitual drift. The rising creek supplies external pressure that tightens the window for decision. Escalation under the accumulative lens: discovery of the map/chip → following ants into unknown terrain → inserting chip and confronting the seam of alternate paths → withdrawing and acting (footbridge, shelter, shared maps). The final choice—returning to help neighbors—narrows options (he forgoes solitary retreat) with visible cost (the word "lonely" no longer fits, but he accepts communal obligation). Small deduction: the cavern's mechanics (press, seam, shifting maps) arrive without prior constraint or failed attempt, which slightly softens the sense of earned agency; the decision to withdraw the chip reads more as acceptance than struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—stopping the bleeding starlight and restoring breath between the grottos—is signaled early and tightens when the queen enters the cobalt vault, sees her own history braided in light, and realizes the wound traces to her wedding fire. The climactic beat (palms to basalt, naming birds, cooling the ember grotto) narrows options and produces the wind, but the mapmaker's passive witness role and the queen's unopposed success leave the escalation curve gentle. One visible friction or trade-off (fatigue, resistance from the grotto, a cost paid beyond the circlet) would raise this into the mid-7s.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—capturing presence's density—is signaled in the opening third and pursued through the reactor calibration. Pressure coheres through the accumulative lens: the narrator and Lio "have tried before, and our numbers kept evaporating," establishing prior failure and raising the stakes for this attempt. One meaningful tightening occurs when Lio whispers the secret, which serves as the catalyst for the reactor to accept the experiment and for presence to "compress." The secret's content is withheld from the reader but its weight is dramatized, and the cost is felt: vulnerability was required. Agency is present in micro-choices (mixing the palette, timing the laps, deciding when to stop), but the escalation feels more like completion of a ritual than a trade-off that narrows options. The resolution is earned by the shared intimacy, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake signaled early: "to distill chaos into narrative, to compress the wild into sentences that could carry heat." Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens as envy → interrogation → dream verbs → writing → reading aloud. One meaningful tightening: the grave "solved a question nobody asked" and the protagonist chooses to "edit its silence," narrowing options from passive witnessing to active ledger-keeping. Cost is visible: "older again, but kinder to the versions," and "awe is better when it knows the bill." The turn is protagonist-driven (envy as method, the choice to return to the ridge). Minor: the dream's surveyor/lover/child trio provides answers rather than complicating, which slightly softens pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—honoring history while restoring function—is signaled early and tightens when the midwife asks "if a birth went wrong this week." The protagonist's agency (warming hands, naming sounds, easing the screw "just a fraction") drives the resolution with visible cost: the convenience of full removal is foreclosed in favor of the shrine. The tightening is quiet but decisive, and the midwife's "breath that could have been a name" marks a felt release. No antagonist is required; the clock's stutter and the midwife's held-back grief supply sufficient pressure under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—inscribe three runes during a held breath before the storm arrives—is signaled early and remains coherent. Escalation under the Accumulative lens: the lattice thickening into frost when fingers falter (a reversal), Elder Nam's rim-tap offering a path, and the protagonist's micro-choices (counting heartbeats, pressing the sugar pebble) that loosen the lattice and allow the rune to breathe. The final hinge rune reweights the central question ("scars as bridges") with visible cost: the held breath drying out at the edges, the fear shed on the page. Agency is present (the protagonist chooses to shed the last fear and let the quill listen forward), and the resolution is earned by the prior ritual and reflective arc. One friction: the reversal at the lattice-frost moment feels slightly convenient (Elder Nam's tap arrives precisely when needed), though the cost (breath held, silver ache) remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—deliver apology and reconnect—signals early and tightens when Mara watches "shaking hands" and asks "if this would fix anything." The exorcism ritual is protagonist-driven agency; cranking the generator and speaking the apology aloud forecloses the gossip-column path with visible cost (hairline crack, scar acknowledgment, new column commitment). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: scent uncoils, voice pencils into pages, hymn title surfaces. No reversal required; deepening suffices. Minor: Aunt Lin's voice arrives as "urge" and "not words," slightly reducing confrontation sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake signaled early: unravel cosmic illusions before they harden as law. The spiral arbitration provides a frame for escalation, and the three-circle structure offers a visible progression. However, each circle deepens understanding without narrowing options or imposing cost; the protagonist's whispered words ("this, now, we") and the placement of the dictionary are symbolic gestures rather than choices that foreclose alternatives. The "chorus of revisions" complicates perception but does not force a trade-off. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful tightening is sufficient, yet here the intensification reads as thematic accretion without a felt price, capping the score in mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: understanding why the tide readings have slipped and what clocks really measure. Pressure accumulates through the "eminently peculiar" drift, the counting-backwards rituals, and the valve adjustment that steadies the floats. One meaningful tightening: the valve correction narrows the problem to glacial split-flow, foreclosing the option of simple mechanical failure. The narrator's agency is renunciation and endurance (shepherding rather than commanding), with visible cost in accepting unresolvable braided tempos. The Accumulative lens holds; escalation is deepening rather than reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—managing the father's care while cataloging an archive that unexpectedly bears his traces—is signaled early and tightens when his handwriting appears. One meaningful deepening occurs when the map reveals the childhood signal phrase, prompting the ward visit with the lantern. Agency is present: she chooses to follow the markers, bring the lantern, and stay. The cost is felt (her pulse miscounting, the tension of holding space for someone who refuses care) but could be more concentrated; the ending scatters the price across philosophical reflection rather than a single forfeited option.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: to teach endings how to begin by creating wrong-number friendships without stepping into lives. The widow/violinist pairing demonstrates method; the baker/custodian sequence escalates by showing ripple effects ("a line of grateful, feathered regulars"). Final beat raises cost: the operator loops two "orphans of intention" then deliberately fades ("let my melodically haunted voice fade"), forecloses direct presence, and sits alone polishing the disc. Agency is renunciation with visible cost—the operator removes self from the bridge built. One meaningful deepening: the shift from facilitator to ghost. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; coincidence complicates (wrong numbers) but does not resolve. The price of cultivated estrangement becomes legible in the final solitary image.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—renewing the covenant without erasing grief—is signaled early and tightens when Kellen asks if she'll "write her back into the roll." The archivist's refusal ("I can only write the ache she made useful") forecloses restoration-through-denial, a visible trade-off. One clear deepening: the act of pressing the locket into the ledger reweights the ritual from mechanical duty to charged memorialization. The tidal pulse and Kellen's witness apply coherent external pressure. Agency reads as renunciation with on-page cost; the final choice to close the locket preserves grief's weight rather than resolve it.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: moving help to break isolation; signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mara places the rock and tells a rumor "that had not yet been true," transforming individual loneliness into collective solace—the queue and market of sorrows. Agency is attention-as-action: she listens, trades, and architects rumor chains. Escalation under Accumulative lens: the fragment catalyzes a visible market (bread for sorrows, mended zippers for memories), and the ledger "bulged with trades." Cost is understated—Mara's loneliness "still prowled, but now it had fewer places to hide"—visible but not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (finding the stillpoint to navigate emotional depths without drowning) is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through sensory density and the protagonist's steady progression, consistent with the Accumulative lens. The clearing's balance and the ring's refusal to move provide a tightening moment, but escalation is shallow: no live option is foreclosed en route, no secondary pressure (the deer's warning, the cold note of "You left") materially alters tactics. The resolution—kneeling, tracing, internalizing—unfolds without visible cost or trade-off on the page; the consequence ("his map had been made in him") is declared rather than dramatized as a forfeiture or transformation that closes a prior path.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (repair the array's error) is signaled early and tightens when "contingency net had tightened into a snare of equivalences." The protagonist's agency drives escalation: fatigue causes the mistake, then active pen-warming and cartridge unbending alter tactics. The resolution earns cost—five safe tomorrows traded, ornamental beads cataloged—and the final docking forecloses the path of heroic overwrite. One meaningful deepening (pen revival) suffices for this length under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake (translate silence into music for the grieving) is signaled early and accumulates through choreographed signing. However, pressure plateaus rather than escalates—the police captain's capitulation removes opposition without cost, and boats simply "slow, then stop" by curiosity alone. No live option is foreclosed; the regatta disruption succeeds without tactical sacrifice or visible tradeoff. One meaningful deepening occurs (the crowd's "joyful sorrow" ripple) but lacks an on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—rescue Mira without betraying the archive—is signaled early and tightens when the narrator must interpret crossed-out eyes as invitation rather than erasure. The accumulative pressure of clue-solving (mural coordinates, clay date, cipher, breath-map) narrows options until the tapestry unlocks the chamber. Agency appears in the choice to "keep the blaze outside" by storing matches in water, a renunciation with visible cost. However, escalation relies heavily on discovery rather than forced trade-offs; Mira's survival and the archive's accessibility arrive without on-page obstacles that test commitment or extract immediate price during the search itself.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake signaled early: revive Jonah through entangled memories. The midpoint consent ("tapping yes with two knuckles") is protagonist-driven and narrows options by accepting deeper coherence with visible risk ("we might wake neither in flesh"). The final choice—carrying auroral sorrow and promising return despite outline blur—forecloses solo survival with on-page cost. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure deepens through drumming repetition and memory layering until the hour thins and the narrator must choose endurance over safety. The garden's systematic warnings frame agency throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—prove whispers travel farther than shouts by guiding the lost courier—is signaled in the opening third and tested throughout. Pressure tightens as Otero bellows uselessly, the narrator follows the courier's dragging left foot, and the teenager's panic rises. The protagonist's agency drives escalation: selecting vents, rapping the coin, refolding maps "so that sound ran downhill." The courier's emergence and Otero's concession provide a decisive tightening with visible cost (the wager, tickets traded for tea and oranges). One deduction: the storm itself remains atmospheric rather than imposing a time-based urgency that narrows tactics further; dawn is mentioned but never becomes a ticking clock that forces a hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—save the boy without speech—is signaled early and pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens through escalating ritual acts: mirror angles star, shutters tap sequence, light weaves into the arch. The hand surfacing is the key tightening that narrows outcome. Agency is present in every choice (shutter rhythm, mirror steadying, finger-raise) and the cost—preserving the vow while lives hang—is visible. No causal reversal required under this lens; the density and cadence shift suffice.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—preserving the library and grotto against bulldozers—is signaled early and tightens through the synchronized window display plan. The escalation is Accumulative: each window lighting deepens pressure, culminating in the mayor and council member's internal shifts. Agency manifests as organized attention rather than confrontation, with visible cost (the kids' labor, the coach's strategic patience). The council member's request for "studies and stays" provides a meaningful tightening that narrows options. One micro-deduction: the method's success feels slightly convenient given the scale of opposition, though the text earns this through the careful accumulation of "second thoughts."

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—finding freedom by embracing true nature—is signaled early and tightens through the journey: pushing off (detachment), planting the scrimshaw (relinquishing), returning to teach others (alteration of role). The whale's call and island's refusal of ownership provide external pressure. One meaningful deepening occurs when the island speaks its exhaustion and the protagonist realizes performance must end. Cost is legible in the shift from solitary dock worker to communal ferryman, though the escalation reads more as accumulation than a single high-pressure reversal that narrows options with visible tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: cultivating lightness in grief without erasure, tested when the inspector measures compliance. The performer's agency is renunciation and performance—he offers the bouquet, narrates tasks with mockery-and-prayer balance, answers "faithful" not "cheerful," and refuses both smile and tears. The cost is legible: his answer "looks similar on paper" but is not the same, and he accepts the gap. One meaningful tightening (inspector's arrival) and deepening (the show as both mockery and prayer) under the Accumulative lens. No second reversal required at this length; the dusk ritual extends the stance with visible cost (birds planted, petals tucked, no applause).

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (stride through boundaries without violence) is signaled early and the paraphrase method tightens once (colonnade hum drop, ice reconsidering). The poet's agency drives the path-opening, and custodians follow. However, no live trade-off or visible cost appears—the ice simply "reconsiders" and the path "stays." The resolution feels granted rather than earned through sacrifice or foreclosure. One meaningful pressure point but without felt price to enter higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—transforming flaw into function, "bartered awakenings"—is signaled early and accumulates pressure through the traveler's request, the apprentice's protest, and the community's skepticism. The reed insertion is a single meaningful tightening driven by Ilias's agency, and the cost is legible: he risks his reputation ("fraud because he sees no colors") and the phoenix's integrity. Under the Accumulative lens, the deepening arrives when the phoenix sings and the courtyard's posture shifts. No secondary reversals are required at this length, but the escalation is more textural than confrontational—pressure accrues through client visits rather than a sharpening dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—discovering the texture of connection in a city bruised by outages—is signaled early and tightens through the pilgrimage's assembly: archive table, salvaged door, bell choices that guide feet. The protagonist's decision to let the child ring the warning bell narrows options (renouncing control) and the final paragraph's realization that "an artificial pilgrimage must change with those who travel it" forecloses the path of static ritual with conceptual cost. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens via density increase (stations accumulate) and cadence shift (final reflection reweights the premise). One meaningful deepening is achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake signaled early: transform grief into generative attention (teach withering to bloom). One meaningful tightening when the narrator confesses near-unmaking of craft, then chooses to "thread light through ash" via the stencil's alignment—a renunciation that forecloses escape with visible cost (staying exposed to grief's weight). Agency is clear in pulling the cord, designing lockets, leaving cranes. No antagonist required under Accumulative lens; pressure accumulates through the ritual's exacting demands and the seeds' response. Cost legible: ongoing exposure, no closure of mourning.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—mapping cultural patterns to bridge a divided neighborhood—is signaled early and coheres across beats. The multiplying-paths method and pin-to-pin traversal constitute on-page work, and the gap "like a mouth" introduces a tightening. But the resolution is ambient rather than driven by protagonist agency: people arrive drawn by "steam, song, and rumor," not by a choice the narrator makes that forecloses an alternative path. The arrival feels like coincidence solving the stated problem, and no visible cost or trade-off is dramatized; the kettles cool and the room hums without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: access forbidden knowledge without dissolution by the archive's guardian questions. Pressure tightens when the first atom floods the room with gardens and questions line up, testing whether she will answer or hoard. The release of purified cages is a genuine forfeiture—betrayal of her teachers, surrender of exclusive access—with visible cost in the final image of child/scholar split. The archive's shiver and stair-unscrolling feel slightly deus ex, but the choice itself is protagonist-driven and forecloses the hoarding path.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: preserving the shape of hope by cataloging an irreplaceable, unreturned dream eaten by shadows. The pressure is situational and accumulative—the shadow's hunger and the narrator's method (comparing footage, offering the stone) tighten when "it pours its yearning into my open hands." Agency is enacted through witness and inscription; the narrator does not merely observe but shelves, inscribes, and splices, foreclosing the shadow's drift. The cost is visible: time, attention, and the risk of the library tilting. One meaningful deepening occurs in the stone-circuit moment; escalation under the accumulative lens is sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—trust and ethical repair—is signaled early and tightens through Karim's confession and the handler's conditional offer. One clear tightening: "the sanctuary could be his repair, but not his hideout" forecloses easy resolution with visible cost (Karim must "earn back trust the way paint does"). The handler's decision is driven by agency under accumulative pressure. Coincidence does not resolve; the inspector's visit complicates but the narrator's choice drives closure.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is the protagonist's need to reclaim the displaced miracle while learning a less violent method of reading scars. Pressure tightens when the ivy withholds the miracle and demands to be read first, forcing a new bargain. The protagonist's agency drives escalation: choosing to tunnel down, kneeling to read the ivy's scar, asking the elm for consent, and making the cut that retrieves the miracle. The final cost is legible on the page: the protagonist's own scar "opens like a book that stays intact," memory is accessed without erasure, and the old method of opening wounds is renounced with visible consequence (the elm's wound, the shared breath, the protagonist's changed practice). One meaningful deepening through negotiated consent.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake: to locate where unused love is stored. The gazer's agency is observational and interpretive rather than contested; no on-page reversal complicates the search, and the manager's trembling does not escalate into opposition. One meaningful deepening occurs when the gazer identifies the clear leader and splice tape, narrowing from general sensing to specific harvest. The final act (threading blank leader, labeling the archive) reconfigures meaning but lacks a visible tradeoff or foreclosed path—cost is conceptual (letters "breathing together") rather than tactical. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through density increase and cadence shift, sufficient for mid-7s but not the tight escalation that would reach 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity before it starves—is signaled early and drives the protagonist's journey under the arch. Pressure accumulates through the protagonist's method: tracing star-routes, breathing on scratches, combing the night with needles until sparks drift free. The fledglings' sealed beaks and the calendar-trap provide external resistance, and the unlocking sequence offers one meaningful tightening when the protagonist "shaped the silent chorus into a key" and "unlocked the fear sewn across the calendar, stitch by stitch." Agency is present but operates more through ritual than contested decision; the protagonist's choices feel guided by remembered stardust rather than forged through doubt or trade-off. The cost—"a thin line of cold remained inside me"—is felt, though the escalation relies on accumulative density rather than a sharp reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—cultivating sparks to light unlit corners—is signaled early and tightens when the archive demands proof, forcing the guard to pay with his sleep and frozen veins. One meaningful deepening occurs: the wave-function dispersal allows him to see fifteen sidings and plant sparks in multiple locations, reweighting the scale from single-point charity to distributed seeding. The cost is legible on the page: he remains dreamless, his midnight "freezes further inside his veins," and the clock "waits, a small moon he can neither spend nor forgive." Coincidence does not resolve; the guard's method and sacrifice enable the sparks to tumble out. However, the agency reads more as enactment of a ritual than a choice that forecloses a live alternative path, keeping this below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—rediscovering the wild frontier of the mind—is signaled early and persists, but pressure remains diffuse across symbolic encounters rather than tightening through a decisive trade-off. The figures testing with questions and the tower's caliper-mouth create momentary obstacles, yet each is resolved by metaphor (the gear clicks, the protagonist whistles) without visible cost or foreclosed options. The mirror revelation (the frontier shrank because the protagonist fenced it with worries) delivers thematic deepening but no on-page choice that narrows tactics or alters consequences. Escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as pattern accretion rather than rising constraint; the protagonist moves from grove to grove without setback or sacrifice, and the final "chew" is symbolic rather than a causal turn that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—recovering the lost dog—is signaled immediately and tightens through a clear tactical shift: from panic to patience, chase to vigil. The fox sighting and pawprints provide one meaningful reversal that narrows options and forces the protagonist to hum rather than call. The guides' persistent instruction that "panic tramples tracks" imposes a credible constraint with visible cost (restraint, vulnerability). The reunion earns its moment through the protagonist's kneeling and invitation rather than pursuit, though the escalation could sustain slightly more pressure in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether to bless safety with complicity or refuse and invite storms—is signaled early via the protagonist's stated search for "an answer" and "the cost of safety." One meaningful tightening occurs when the bellhop shows the missing bolt and the protagonist must choose; reversing the pitch rather than sealing the hush narrows options with visible cost (remaining to "stand with those whose hands kept the fortress breathing"). The bellhop's tremor and unshaped syllable provide a secondary pressure point. Agency is clear: the protagonist's decision to reverse the bolt forecloses complicity and charges the ending image with "a choir breathing in, getting ready."

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—unmask the pretender—is signaled early and sustained. Escalation is textural rather than causal: Lys leaves cryptic messages, gathers the faithful, and finally confronts the pretender when the pause settles. The ledger's appearance and the pretender stepping from shadow feel coincidental rather than earned by Lys's prior moves. The gardener's naming of the river-name is the first reversal with cost (the ledger stiffens, minnows snap to bones), but it arrives late and depends on off-page preparation. One meaningful tightening is present, but agency is diffuse and the cost (the pretender's title crossed out, his signet flaking) reads more as symbolic than a choice that forecloses a live path.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: discover why the Trace disappears. The narrator moves from passive witness (coral bleaching) to active investigator, assembling data across months. One clear tightening: boredom leads to tapping dates, Jun's note "node," then the atlas margin "nodes?"—reversing ignorance into pattern. Agency is decision (mark the path anew, write to council) and endurance (months of measurement). The climax is a realization that alters tactics: flexible beacons, reflective paint, a bell for wider tides. Cost is on the page: "We do not restore the reefs" anchors the victory's limit.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—reignite the ship without breaking the sheltering quiet—is signaled early and remains coherent through accumulative pressure. One meaningful tightening occurs when the protagonist threads wire from the circle to the coil, trusting the hum; the escalation is completed when the ferry "hears and chooses" and the startup succeeds gently. Cost is legible: the protagonist maps safe routes, exposes hidden medicine, and asks for stories in return, binding the community at personal risk. Agency drives the closure: the decision to ask for reciprocal stories and the careful hand that allows the ferry to "choose" rather than forcing it.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (evolve tradition with intent versus obedient destiny) is signaled early and tightens through the kite decode, the unsealing ritual, and Mara's alteration of the sigil. The protagonist's agency drives escalation: decoding the script, timing the heat cycles under reed guidance, and swapping command for question. The council's arrival is coincidental timing but does not resolve—Mara's prior choice has already altered the embryo's trajectory. Visible cost: she defies council authority and accepts stewardship responsibility, foreclosing the altar/display path. One meaningful tightening (ritual failure if rushed, success when slowed) narrows options and the cost is legible in her final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—anchor optimism in realism—is signaled early and pressured by the board's demand for the dramatic overlook versus Samira's somatic reading of danger. The tightening occurs when she pivots ceremony location mid-morning, narrowing the board's options and forcing the chair to accept safety over spectacle. Cost is visible: she refuses the photo-op, confronts the chair, and renounces display by placing the photograph under the basin. One harbor-drone freeze demonstrates persistent constraint. Agency is renunciation with on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—redesigning how her eyes hold a life—is signaled early and tightens through the untangling action, which forecloses the path of fragmentation-as-failure and opens fragmentation-as-honoring. The physical task (freeing knots) interweaves with internal shift, and the restored beam functions as a visible tightening that narrows her options to acceptance. The cost is more conceptual than visceral: she must abandon the "steady gaze" model, though the full price of this renunciation could be more legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—discovering why time slows in crisis—is signaled early and tightens through the drone mapping, ink threshold, and the sister's lantern-moment. One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator confirms the rule by bracing the beam, forecloses the past, and carries the algebra back. Under the Accumulative lens, the density increase and cadence shift reweight the grief into communal training, satisfying escalation. Minor issue: the elders' instructions and the final training plan feel externalized rather than tested by internal friction or a live tradeoff between personal closure and communal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether to seal or release the letter—is signaled within the first third and tightens through escalation: discovering the letter's content, testing the network, adding a preface, pressing send, then facing the shadow. Each beat narrows options under Accumulative pressure: the archivist moves from trembling doubt to calculated risk to shared silence. Agency is clear: the protagonist's sequence of choices (willing switchboards awake, tucking the letter into encryption, adding their name) drives the ending. The cost is visible—the oath broken, the slot misaligned, fear acknowledged—and the final "conversation now happening between people who did not move their lips" reweights the initial silence. One micro turn (the shadow asking for tea) sets up closure without multiplying reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: weaving continuity versus trimming with vengeance. The father's return narrows options by demanding her participation in violence; her refusal and counter-offer ("Stay") creates immediate pressure. The storm provides a second tightening that forces the father to adopt her method, and the visible cost is his identity shift (looping the sheath over the peg, burning his map). Agency is clear: she pours the dust line, sheathes his knife, repairs the dome, and teaches him her method. The resolution is protagonist-driven, earned by her sustained demonstration under pressure, and the cost—expanded vulnerability to fifty strangers, the father's renunciation—is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—catching the goddess's echo to finish the girl's lullaby—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening: the echo tests him with loved voices (hooks), and he must transliterate emotions back to breath or lose control. The cost is legible when "the letters keened, the rail spike turned cold as stars, and the skiff tilted," forcing him to zigzag with the pull rather than against it. Agency is present (he chooses to answer by voicing silence and to pull "slow as winter"), and the final sealing with breath forecloses other paths. Under the Accumulative lens, this pressure and tightening suffice, though the fisher's unshaken competence limits the felt difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—prevent the paper from printing a fraudulent sky and preserve institutional credibility—is signaled early and coheres under causal pressure. One meaningful escalation: Kline's evasions are refuted by on-page proof (calibration lamp in logs, histogram "top hat"), then the technician's cursor moves toward deletion, forcing the protagonist's stair-climb and second round of proof-by-contradiction with visible cost (the logs stay, the donor loses, anger "burns clean"). Agency is clear: her logical arguments and the symbolic weight of the pen nib drive both surrenders. No coincidence resolves; the cost (reputational friction, donor displeasure) is legible in "the anger burns clean" and "slightly of pen and contrition."

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—hushing firmware dissonance to address personal guilt—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the eight-letter sequence: each instruction (ink constellations, breathe into port, translate, hum to amber, tattoo the name) tightens the ritual and narrows evasion. The waveform's cry "Do not leave me in the static" and the narrator's answer "I will not" constitute agency under the Accumulative lens, forecloses the path of avoidance, and delivers felt cost. One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist realizes the letters are self-authored, reweighting the repair as self-forgiveness earned through craft; escalation could be sharper if mid-sequence reversals tested commitment more directly.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: discovering meaning in communal mess, signaled early ("small ruins… story they wished to sand down"). Pressure accumulates through drawing (circle, spiral, gate), water threading the mandala, and the group standing "where standing hurt"—one meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. Agency is distributed (artist nudges, others place offerings) but coheres around the mandala as shared ritual. The man's banister-need and the woman's dawn-departure memory are brief friction points, yet neither costs the protagonist a visible choice. The ending reconfigures ("noise learned to lean") with felt cost (lilac unease as ongoing weather) but the price remains interior mood rather than a foreclosed external option.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: save the people from the patrol by renaming danger, tested when the leader arrives rifle-ready. Escalation tightens through the tessera-reveal sequence: narrator kneels, speaks the fig-mother story, names "ordinary, ordinary, ordinary" until the leader lowers his weapon—agency and renaming both forecloses the violent path. Cost is visible: the narrator exposes augmented arms and oath, risking capture. The patrol's stand-down is earned by protagonist action under accumulative pressure. One micro turn (leader's mouth shaping lost summer) sets up closure without multiplying reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is Rowan's recovery of courage/possibility, signaled early ("she thinks possibility has died"). The ghost's agency—flipping the coin, producing echoes, coaxing the orchard—tightens pressure by making the past accessible, which forces Rowan to confront her abandoned blueprint. The maze's rearrangement and the blueprint's reappearance create a meaningful tightening: Rowan must choose whether to risk hope again. Her promise to return with volunteers and the ghost's pre-dawn rehearsal with the pears to "tune the hedges to a softer path" show earned escalation with visible cost (renewed vulnerability for Rowan, continued facilitation-binding for the ghost). One clean deepening drives the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: "to illuminate hidden pathways, not as metaphor, but as navigable lines." The tightening occurs when consent is invoked, Mara offers memories, and the wristband triggers wand colors—each step narrows the experiment's variables and raises intimacy cost. The ladder appears as earned discovery, leading to the grounding coil that softens the voices and foreclosses unmediated listening. Agency is decision and renunciation: the protagonist replies to the recall, keeps the shard, and accepts Mara's anchor. Cost is felt in the final promise ("keep my feet on the floor") and visible in the choice to ground rather than consume more pills.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—"to become the voice of the unknown"—is signaled in the opening third and drives the protagonist's decisions (following the sorrow lane, trusting plankton light, pressing the fossil into the wall). One meaningful tightening occurs when the protagonist enters the chamber and discovers the larger imprint; the alignment moment forces a choice to feed the chord into the sleepers' dream loops, foreclosing a safer path (returning without acting). The cost is visible: the protagonist sits alone afterward, aware the procedure is "only half of the truth," and the sleepers' response remains unknown. Minor escalation clarity issues (the surge moment feels decorative rather than pressure-adding) and the lack of a visible secondary trade-off prevent higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake is clear: prevent the cliff-swallowing prophesied doom by transforming fatalism into collective agency. The protagonist's escalation proceeds from solo cataloging (buttons) to interpreting the echo, forming the spiral, summoning the town, and co-enacting the rain road ritual—each step narrows options and raises relational cost (ringing the bell risks communal rejection). The turning point is the unsealing of the echo, which "unravels" the withheld truth; this reversal reweights the prophecy from sentence to opportunity. The collective hourglass-turning and cord-threading are high-cost acts (vulnerable cooperation, labor to fetch salvage), and the rain road's conditionality ("keeps the path attentive to us") establishes ongoing price. However, the mechanics by which these actions open the cliff and summon rain remain asserted rather than causally prepared; the story teaches the echo's power but not the hourglasses' seam-opening function, so the climax feels more symbolic than physically inevitable. Agency is genuine—the protagonist's choice to share the pattern drives the resolution—but the final collaborative success arrives with less friction than the stakes promised.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: reconnect with Mina's network and reclaim agency after the burn notice. The stranger's revelation that "Mina is alive" and the radio assignment constitute one meaningful tightening under the Causal lens. Agency is demonstrated through the climb, code-writing, and radio repair. The cost is legible: "use your burn to fix the breakers" explicitly trades the protagonist's erased tether for operational value. No on-page reversals; escalation is a single deepening rather than multiple pressure points, which fits the length but limits upward scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—distilling a palimpsest promise into a weddable vow—is signaled early and tightens through ambient listening, the coachman's intervention, and the protagonist's single-line stitch. The tightening is meaningful: the protagonist arrives unable to unpick, listens, and stitches one line with visible cost (all prior layers abandoned). Agency is clear (the decision to wait, to stitch simply), and the final crossing forecloses ornament with felt relief. One strong deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding why places resist change—is signaled early and pursued through observation and two small tests (mending trough, brushing crown) that trigger responses (leaf, moth). These tests narrow options by confirming the phototropic-kindness hypothesis, but personal cost is minimal; the narrator risks neither safety nor cherished belief. The thrum-answer at closure deepens meaning under the Accumulative lens, yet the tightening is gentle rather than a forfeiture that visibly alters the narrator's path forward. Pressure accumulates through textural density but lacks a moment where competing goods force a trade-off with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—reflect light to gentling the building's fear—signals early and tightens once: the padlock yields to patient measure, enabling installation. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through recurring rhythm (oars in water) and a cadence shift when Theo walks alone and Mrs. Gallo hums. Agency is decision and action: climbing, opening, guiding the mesh. The cost is legible—tooth will rust, rosebush emptied, hope left exposed—and forecloses retreat. One reversal: the stuck door becomes passage. No second major turn is needed at this length, but a slightly higher mid-scene complication would elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake: translate isolation into independence. Pressure accumulates through reflective density rather than narrowing choices; the narrator's agency is largely attentional and contemplative until the final vow, which arrives as declaration rather than a choice tested under competing pulls. The Librarian encounter and ledger reveal deepen understanding but do not force a visible tradeoff or foreclose a live path with on-page cost scaled to the claim.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: rejoin the lost woman through public art rather than private pleading. The tightening is clear: the protagonist moves from solitary letter-drying to public installation, inviting strangers and thereby exposing personal longing. The woman's arrival and their walk to the nest crystallize the cost—silence becomes shared witness, foreclosing the option to retreat into secrecy. One micro turn (the crowd's participation) deepens pressure without fragmenting the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (stop tricksters' division-amplifying riddles) is signaled early and tightens when "students turn against professors, professors against administrators" and rumors threaten license sale or booth occupation. One meaningful escalation: the narrator's subsonic scaffold provokes a "sudden wave of dissonance that shakes the tower and trips the breakers," forcing a confrontation with campus police and the provost—agency-driven choice (handing headphones) narrows options by risking shutdown to convert authority. Cost is visible (studio dark, administration scrutiny, community barricades), and the resolution (tricksters' squeal snaps, vacancy fills with breath, barricades loosen) is earned by the protagonist's tactical patience and coalition-building. However, the tricksters' final "promise shaped like applause" evaporates without on-page resistance or price paid by the narrator beyond another hour of scaffold humming, softening the climactic trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—retrieve the vital key and negotiate spatial mutiny—is signaled early and tightened when the organ notes hold the alleys still, creating a live window for extraction. Agency is clear: the protagonist chooses patience over force, presses keys to transfix rather than bind, and accepts ongoing obligation. One meaningful escalation occurs when the seam opens above the square, narrowing the retrieval window to the duration of the chord. The cost is legible: the protagonist must return when mutiny turns cruel, forfeiting closure and accepting perpetual vigilance. No forced reversals; coincidence does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (awaken empathy to solve the cold case) is signaled early and tightens when the ribbon snags and the captain's rehearsed story unravels. One meaningful deepening occurs: Lio's question "which side of the ribbon should face the wind to find her" forces the captain from observer to accomplice, narrowing options. The painting itself becomes the pressure instrument that forecloses the captain's escape, creating a visible cost (confession, legal exposure). Agency is clear: Lio's methodical choices (metronome pacing, ribbon testing, portrait construction) drive the turn. Minor deduction: the captain's internal resistance is compressed—his "no, then yes, and then nothing" could sustain one additional beat to show the calculus of surrender rather than rapid capitulation.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (earn passage home via proving Seraphine's dismissed story) is signaled early and tightens when journals arrive, nail bridges sensor, samples are found, and approval comes. The narrator's agency drives escalation: petitioning for journals, decoding stanzas, using the nail, retrieving samples. One meaningful reversal: approval to leave arrives, but the narrator stays—choosing ancestor's name over immediate return with visible opportunity cost (one more cycle). Mirek's warning that usefulness is the only guarantee raises the price of staying without fully dramatizing what happens if the Ministry withdraws approval.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—recovering the vanished hitchhiker—is signaled early. Escalation is minimal: the fiddler's question ("what I would do if the hitchhiker had not just vanished but chosen to decloak") does not narrow options, and finding the hitchhiker whole and waiting eliminates rather than reweights tension. The narrator's agency is observational until the final beat; the choice to leave the flake carries no visible price or foreclosed path. Pressure accumulates lyrically but does not tighten under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—understanding inherited circularity versus chosen linearity—is signaled early and tightens when the startup's "rings" are revealed to replicate the father's criminal loops. The reversal (neighborhoods lose traffic, board exits) is earned by the protagonist's choices and narrows options to acceptance or further flight. The ending scatters bills with visible cost: the protagonist walks into the dark "like a train," forecloses the option of breaking the pattern, and pays the price of circularity. Agency is decision (placement of bills, leaving three for the kid) and endurance (accepting the loop). The courier hit and contract losses create escalation under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (decode inscriptions to restore language to grief) is signaled early and tightens when Mara's silence breaks, allowing the algorithm rewrite. The narrator's agency—asking Mara to describe the collapse sound—narrows options and enables the translation breakthrough with visible cost: Mara's throat "bruised" by silence is healed, and the narrator "finally let go" after the radio transmission. One meaningful escalation under Accumulative lens: the deepening from ornamental mention of variable stars to their use as the decryption key, which forecloses the path of solitary witnessing.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: discover the truth that refuses reflection. One meaningful tightening: the seed eats spells, letters coalesce, confession reveals Master Ren drowned the orchard using her hands. Issa's agency drives escalation—she unbends the rings she herself wove, reads aloud to the lake, feeds the seed the final binding—each choice forecloses reconciliation with her teacher. The cost is felt: "ache in a clean way" and the orchard "handed a final order to stand down." No forced reversals; pressure coheres under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—finishing the eclipsed covenant—is signaled early and pressure accumulates through the maze map welts, the girl's arrival, and the convergence toward the crosswind center. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the density increase and pattern acceleration (sap memories, bell rings in marrow, moths into geometry) provide one meaningful tightening. However, protagonist agency is diffuse: the narrator waits, listens, and is guided by the covenant and maze more than making choices that narrow options, and the cost of alignment remains largely symbolic rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: restore the brother's traded future. The protagonist's agency—kneeling to soothe roots, scribing to inlay meaning—drives escalation under the Accumulative lens. One clear tightening: the Keeper's condition ("graft will hold only if you accept the scars") narrows options and the protagonist's pledge ("never again to bargain alone") forecloses solo action. Cost is legible but abstract: "accept the scars" and shared breath are conceptual prices rather than a visible on-page forfeiture. The orchard's bristling roots attempt to trap, then loosen—opposition that tests commitment but resolves quickly without compounding difficulty. No major reversal; the regraft succeeds as a single turn.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (discovering purpose after public failure) is signaled early and tightens when the rental logo connects the cloth to Abel's tour, forcing the protagonist to choose between professional distance and emotional excavation. The decision to treat Echo Bench "like a patient" and write "Dear Echo" forecloses the redemption path with visible cost—shifting from name repair to witnessing. Agency operates through attention and renunciation; coincidence (Lark's invitation) complicates but does not resolve. One meaningful deepening narrows options under accumulative pressure as artifacts accumulate emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: understand the physics of transition and reestablish the mentor's orchard. Pressure tightens when the seed shivers and aligns, coil tastes absence, and the narrator hears the mentor's final breath encoded in the fruit—each beat narrows options from retrieval fantasy to acceptance of departure as "rotation, not disappearance." Agency drives escalation: the protagonist chooses to hum calibration, rotate rails, and finally place the fruit back rather than consume it, a renunciation that forecloses immediate closure (biting would "feed" rather than "listen") in favor of sustained commons-building. Cost is visible in the abandonment of "haunted ambitions" and the commitment to return with students, sharing rather than owning the threshold. One meaningful deepening occurs when the hollow of the mentor's last breath reveals she "measured her exit," transforming the loss from rupture to teaching and reweighting the narrator's goal from mastery to stewardship.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: preserving identities (and wonder) for visitors whose names migrate. Pressure is situational and accretive rather than escalatory; the baker and boy arrive, are catalogued without conflict, and depart with tokens—beats that illustrate process but do not narrow options or raise cost for the librarian. The final act (closing the ledger, opening windows) reconfigures stance but is contemplative rather than a turn forced by rising opposition. No on-page reversal where the librarian's own options are tested or a visible price paid; the visitors' departures ("a sigh," "a hiccup") suggest resolution without dramatized cost to the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—whether to certify the bunker per protocol or honor the "abandoned hopes" and dissolve division—is signaled early and tightens when the inspector reads the shell's confessions and feels "the tug of old doctrine." The act of crowning the stalagmite and signing the non-standard decree narrows options with visible cost (agency rejection, potential career consequence). Under the Accumulative lens one meaningful deepening suffices, and the cost is legible. However, the external pressure (the "sensors," the "official who came after") remains abstract; no on-page antagonist tests the choice in real time, so escalation reads more as internal resolve than contested turn.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—finding self-forgiveness without evasion—is signaled early and tightens through a deepening that changes the protagonist's knowledge and options. The turning point occurs when graffiti wisdom and the WSP arrow converge, revealing the clog the narrator once labeled "irrelevant"; clearing it becomes the on-page cost that forecloses the path of aesthetic evasion. Agency is renunciation and endurance: the protagonist commits to "unglamorous maintenance" and accepts the busker's unspoken directive to "tell the town, fix the note, keep the gate cleared." Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; the final image—answering the accordion's measure—crystallizes the stance with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—finding the library of unspoken words—is signaled early and maintained. One meaningful tightening: the plaque's requirement to answer "in the language of unspoken words" forces the protagonist to translate intent into timed pulses, narrowing options. The cost at closure (taking responsibility for the second letter, looping through time) is conceptual and felt but lacks a sharp trade-off or foreclosed path. Escalation reads as accumulation of cipher steps rather than a decisive turn that raises price. Agency is present but leans toward obedience to instructions more than protagonist-driven reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: "weigh a dream against an empire" and "decide before the promise loses its glow." Pressure accumulates through the protagonist's solitary deliberation, plant consultation, and coffee-stain divination, then crystallizes in the act of playing—one meaningful tightening that narrows options (play and melt vs. preserve and enable theft). The cost is legible: the violin becomes "a handful of shining rivulets," the empire loses its alibi, and the protagonist accepts "mulberry ache" as the price. Agency is renunciation with visible cost. No requirement for multiple reversals at this length; the single turn (decision to play) suffices under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: to "capture one last spark before oblivion" for the mother, with the emotional/professional cost of performing the ritual on kin. The emerald's warming and the aurora's descent provide one meaningful tightening when "the chip shone brighter, the shape resolving into a glimmer." Agency is present in the choice to dare the ritual and later to renew the calling. The cost is felt in the protagonist's perpetual commitment to the grotto vigil, foreclosing ordinary life. Friction: the escalation unfolds gradually through ritual accumulation rather than a sharp reversal, and the middle third recounts prior teaching without on-page complication.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: finding contentment through caretaking after forgiving the unforgivable. Pressure accumulates through the narrator's daily practice—scalloping basins, pruning vines, climbing for decision—and tightens when a new tendril tests the shade, forcing a micro-choice (tie without piercing). The resolution is Earned Stasis with visible cost: the narrator accepts that "contentment is not found but grown," renouncing the search for a fixed source in favor of cyclical renewal. Agency is clear in the tendril-tying beat, though most escalation occurs through reflection rather than on-page reversal. One meaningful deepening occurs when the pilgrim encounter reframes contentment as harvest, not discovery, which the narrator enacts in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: whether Mara signs the demolition order and how she presents it. Pressure tightens through the wind-chime decoding and the mirror-shard exchange, culminating in a decision to "sign with conditions that honor memory." The protagonist's (narrator's) agency is present but mediated—he facilitates rather than decides, meeting the rubric's allowance for renunciation/endurance paths. Cost is legible: Mara must speak "not clean but clear" and wear doubt visibly. One deduction: the narrator's role trends passive-observational in key beats, and the campfire setup that arranged the chimes is summarized rather than dramatized, reducing escalation visibility.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—learning the nature of vanishing—is signaled early and tightens once when the narrator "read the message in the iron" and demands the answer. However, escalation is thin; the narrator never faces a trade-off or chooses between conflicting goods. The researcher withholds, the narrator waits, and the answer arrives on schedule. Agency is minimal; the cost (the researcher's erasure) belongs to him, not the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—learning to navigate without moving—is signaled immediately and remains coherent throughout. The piece offers one meaningful tightening when the pulse "sidles into my tone until our two waves beat like mismatched hearts," forcing the narrator to "shave the note, thinner, colder." The cost is legible in the commitment to motionless waiting and the rejection of the "old urge to chase." However, the escalation is more textural than action-driven; the wandering pulse's resistance feels more atmospheric than a genuine threat that narrows options with visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—finding the sacred in the simple versus automated cleverness—is signaled early and tightens when the protagonist unstrapps the assistive charms, forfeiting marketable correctness. One meaningful turn: removing the pack narrows options, leaving only "shivering breath and the listening cold." Cost is legible: "I had come to find the sacred in the simple, and what I found was a way to hold small things without selling them." Agency operates through renunciation and endurance. Minor cap: the keystone interaction could press harder before yielding.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—discovering the color of sound—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the protagonist descends during low tide while the crowd looks up, narrowing the window of opportunity. The underwater cabinet moment deepens pressure: the tag becomes a tuning plate, and the protagonist must offer "luminous vows" (a new truth as path) to receive the color. Cost is felt but oblique: the protagonist forgoes hiding and returns visibly changed, waving to the foreman without shame. Agency leans receptive—the cabinet "opened without moving" and "the water vibrated"—which slightly softens the protagonist's role in the transformation, though the choice to descend and the offering of vows are deliberate.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—tuning the newborn field's note via honest scatter—is signaled early and remains coherent. One clear tightening: initial casting identifies the need (lullaby/hello balance), prompting the narrator to "turn the dial until the static bursts tighten into a single ribbon" and commit to the patient-hello choice. Agency is decision and renunciation (keeping scatter honest, not steering longing) with visible cost: exhausting coolant reserves and sustaining unresolved doubt. The backwards prophecy acts as external pressure forcing the narrator to translate rather than impose meaning, and coincidence (where coins land) complicates rather than resolves—the narrator must interpret and act on the pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—giving names to nameless fears—is signaled early and tightens through each recording/naming pair. Agency manifests in renunciation: the reaper names "Enough" and folds the atlas, foreclosing further mending with visible cost (leaving the snowfield memory unresolved). The echo of sacrifice applies pressure as "companion whose cloak stays near," holding the reaper responsible. One meaningful deepening when the reaper's own fear crystallizes.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—righting the cosmic imbalance that emptied nets—is signaled in the third line. Escalation under the Accumulative lens: drip arithmetic → shared pulse with Aro → bell ringing three times → seam stitching with fish rising. Aro's memory-gift ("give it back, not the body, but the moment") narrows options and raises cost. The resolution (Aro's restraint vow, bell left as pendulum) is earned by Nera's enacted ritual and carries visible cost: patience over harvest.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether to enforce county rules or honor town memory—is signaled early and tightens when the warden radios for a pause in enforcement. The white-haired woman's arrival provides pressure, but it also resolves tension too easily; the communal gathering unfolds without visible opposition or cost to the protagonist's job security. One meaningful tightening occurs (the enforcement pause), yet the absence of on-page consequences or trade-offs prevents higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: harmonize logic and intuition before the final transformation. One tightening occurs when the murmuration's patterns teach her that "meaning thrives on relation," prompting her to map starlings into ratios and breath. However, the stake never faces a concrete test that forces a visible trade-off; the orchard conspires to answer her question without demanding sacrifice. The decision to defer the transformation feels like acceptance rather than a hard choice, and the cost is conceptual rather than immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserve trust under pressure—is signaled early and tightens when Lio's harness slips: the narrator must guide him through muscle memory without looking, a choice that narrows options and raises cost. The refusal/retry beat ("he refuses, then tries") deepens the autonomy/care tension. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: revising the signal, pacing words to breath, directing the longer landing run. The resolution is earned by the narrator's alteration (voiding self until patterns remain) with visible cost (pride locked against teeth, choice to stay). One meaningful tightening forecloses the path of leaving the arbor.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—defeating emotional numbness through the custody hearing—is signaled early and escalates when Kana must "vivify the witness." The brain's testimony ("no one could own a seed after the forest arrives") provides a meaningful tightening that forces the kata response and the shared-guardianship resolution. The cost is legible: numbness cracks "not from violence, but from being asked to carry weight and being trusted to drop it." Under the Accumulative lens, the kata of complementary opposites deepens pressure and narrows the question from legal ownership to communal responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (restore lost laughter) is signaled early and tightens once: the thin laughter "thickening" into the child's laugh wavering "like a candle relighting itself" narrows options from failure to conditional success. Agency reads as devotion and method rather than decision under pressure; the conductor executes a known ritual without visible tradeoff or mistake that alters tactics. The withholding choice ("never to keep more than necessary") is stated principle, not dramatized cost. One meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens is sufficient here, but agency remains procedural.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—learning to "make friends with uncertainty"—is signaled early and tightens when the guardian requires the protagonist to "wait without freezing" before teaching the method. One meaningful pressure point: the sundial reset that opens the inward path, a choice that leads to the threshold and forces the final renunciation. The decision not to cross the line forecloses reunion with the guardian's old sky, a visible cost that charges the ending. Under the accumulative lens, escalation reads as density increase (garden opens → names hover → seam appears → threshold materializes) rather than a causal chain of reversals, and the final image reweights the opening stake: uncertainty is befriended not by crossing but by waiting. Agency is clear in the shared acts of waiting, resetting the dial, and choosing restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—interrupt the destiny marching children into mills—is signaled early and sustained. Escalation occurs through successive approximation: first fire yields slag, second fire blisters the shard, third fire (with blood as solvent) produces the frozen bloom and transforms the crozier. Each failure narrows options and raises urgency. The alchemist's agency is clear in his adjustments and final vivification. Cost is visible: he steals the staff, bleeds into the mix, and accepts that "loss was the currency of renewal." One friction: the bishop's men arrive as a final obstacle but yield almost instantly ("they dropped their intent") without a dramatized struggle or negotiation beat, which deflates what could have been a stronger climactic turn and makes the resolution feel slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (find beginnings in endings) is signaled early and tightens through the tuning attempt. The decision to aim "at the space between swing and stillness" narrows options and produces the tone that demands tuning, forcing protagonist and Sela to "let the coupling choose." The bucket retrieval and the tasted instruction constitute a clear pivot with visible cost: the city "sagged, then steadied" under the weight of beginnings, and the protagonists commit to carrying forward. One substantive deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—merging parallel timelines so the ferry docks reliably—is signaled early and tightens when the protagonist learns one deckhand must become the permanent transient. Agency is renunciation with visible cost: the protagonist chooses to "become the gap between whistles" so commuters can arrive. The plan's risk ("one of us will be chosen instead") creates a credible pressure point, and the resolution follows from the protagonist's choice to nod and release the final knot. The cost is legible: the protagonist loses form and destination but holds the ferry steady.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Mara's wish to discover connection and forgive herself—is signaled early and tightens when she steps into the arena and the rigging "reads her" by summoning the phantom witness. The reversal (geometry failed to protect; love might require risk) is meaningful but arrives through realization rather than a decision that narrows options with visible cost. The visitor vignettes (woman at staircase, courier in vanishing corners) accumulate pressure, but the escalation is textural rather than causal. Under the Accumulative lens, one decisive intensification suffices; here it lands, though the price at closure remains oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—proving edge geometry can navigate from the benthic city to the surface—is signaled early and drives all moves. The council's narrow approval narrows options; weeks of practice add caution as cost; the timed ascent through the pressure gap raises physical risk. Agency is clear: the instructor petitions, drafts the route, practices, and leads the ascent. The final act (rising by the chart) forecloses the alternative of remaining blind beneath the sea, with the conceptual cost of leaving the safety of darkness. The escalation is steady accumulation rather than a sharp reversal, and while the price is felt, it remains more conceptual than visceral—enough for strong 7s but shy of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: protect Eli from self-harm and predatory actor. The narrator's agency drives escalation—tuning the aid, speaking assurance, staging witness presence—each narrowing Eli's exit options and the suit's opportunity window. The glass panel's fall delivers visible cost (empty benches, man departs) and alters the atrium's state. One meaningful tightening occurs when the narrator reframes the donor's heart ("she chose to share her heart with you, not her ending"), forecloses the debt narrative, and enables Eli's laugh. Price is legible: attendance paid with attention, incidental heroism without applause.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake signaled early: to coax back colleagues' encoded traces and hold vigil. Pressure accumulates under the Accumulative lens through tidal urgency, the electroscope's flicker, and the file index waking—each tightens options. Ivo's agency is renunciation with visible cost: he does not print or export, promising instead to return and "keep vigil while it lived." The choice to leave at the siren's toll forecloses permanence but honors presence. One friction: the tightening is more temporal (flood threat) than driven by Ivo's internal contradictions, keeping the score below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake ("fetch wisdom from failure") is signaled early. Pressure is more accumulative than causal: the protagonist asks the ghost, the ghost shares a memory and a metaphor, the protagonist accepts the corridor as lesson. No on-page reversal narrows options; the ghost's offer arrives without complication or cost to the protagonist's immediate tactics. The decision to descend is stated but not tested—no visible trade-off (e.g., weather risk, physical toll, social consequence) is dramatized. The piece lacks escalation under the Accumulative lens because the ink-map gift is convenient rather than earned through protagonist struggle or sacrifice; coincidence (ghost generosity) resolves rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake (to translate texture into sound before silence seals it) is signaled early and pursued throughout. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: the diamond's curse asks for names, the birds veer, the tunnel braids echoes. However, there is no single on-page reversal or tightening choice that narrows options mid-scene; instead, the protagonist proceeds through a sequence of guided steps (palm, diamond press, wire-drawing, name-surrender) that accumulate cost without visible constraint or trade-off. The ending shows agency (surrender of names, transformation into instrument) with legible cost, meeting the baseline, but escalation reads as density increase rather than a forced decision that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: trace the harmony untamed, transform bitterness over Marko's loss. Pressure accumulates through the phone voice's challenges ("bring stone to leaf," "turn your bitterness into a cosmic joke"), and the protagonist's pun—initially self-mocking—becomes the hinge that unspools the cryptid and reweights the grief into pedagogical vow. One clear tightening: the cryptid's appearance and directive force the narrator to abandon observational cover. Cost is felt (giving up revenge-research, accepting a teaching role), though the escalation leans more on external revelation than protagonist-driven tactical shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—reawakening beauty versus mechanical control—is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful escalation: the protagonist's music causes the orchard to uproot the iron rails, a physical manifestation of breaking free that forecloses return to sanctioned performance. Agency is clear (choosing to descend, to play differently, to use the locust shell) and the statues' response creates a reversal that narrows options. The cost is legible: "tomorrow the city would send inspectors" and the protagonist commits to meet them "with measures they could not tabulate." However, the conflict operates more through symbolic logic than tactical friction—the statues simply "swivel to listen" without meaningful resistance, and the orchard's liberation feels more inevitable than hard-won. One visible price (future confrontation) charges the ending under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: repair broken connections across a militarized boundary. Escalation accumulates through meaningful deepening: the boy's missing letter, the crossing negotiated with the guide, the crowd growing over seven nights, the commander's threat. Agency is clear—the mailman's decision to release the storm, to trade lists, to persist despite loudspeaker warnings—and each choice forecloses safer paths with visible cost. The final night's "storm rises on its own" delivers a charged poise where pressure crystallizes without resolution, fitting the Accumulative lens. One tightening intensification is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—restoring the carousel—is signaled early and coheres throughout. However, escalation is mild: the carpenter hunts, finds, installs, and sings without meaningful opposition, narrowing of options, or visible trade-off. The wrong turn that leads to the oasis is serendipitous rather than earned by protagonist agency, and the ending action (breathing a note) succeeds immediately without a prior failure or cost. Under the accumulative lens, one meaningful tightening or deepening is required; here the arc is smooth accretion without a pressure point that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: finding "the place where stories live." Pressure accumulates through hyperbolic traversal, the atlas slot click, and shelves becoming "lungs." The tightening occurs when "I stepped into a cul-de-sac that was wider inside than out"—geometry narrows escape and forces the librarian into direct encounter. Agency is present in "I began to shelve the air," a renunciation of mere observation. Deduction: the coincidence of the scarf catching in the atlas complicates but does not resolve; however, the patron responses (woman's "quake," boy's star-sentences) feel more atmospheric than a test that narrows the librarian's options with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—capture the dream before dawn—is signaled immediately and pressure accumulates through the ticking clock ("the cipher appears only in the first light") and the narrator's method (patient waiting, sunrise photography). The realization mid-story that "the wish to capture a runaway dream is really the wish not to be alone" reweights tactics: the narrator shifts from trapping to "letting it pass through," a meaningful deepening under the accumulative lens. The cost—releasing control, leaving the door open—is felt in the final line's quiet surrender. Escalation is driven by narrator agency and the sunrise deadline constrains choices.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear early: free the trapped idea/unspoken mercy. Pressure accumulates through ritual actions (the ribboned hair, the locksmith's listening, the star's breath) and the valley's physical response. One meaningful tightening occurs when the locksmith tastes the curl and exhales against the keyhole, narrowing the path to this singular method. Agency is visible in the scholar's choice to summon the locksmith and the locksmith's decision to align rather than force. Cost is felt in "trembling hands," the years of folded feeling, and the locksmith's retention of the empty box as reminder. The escalation is driven by accumulative density rather than causal reversals, fitting the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: recover stolen memories by correcting a past bargain. Agency materializes in the step through the ring, the hand-slide that blurs the wrong name, and the spoken correction—all protagonist-driven micro-choices under pressure. One meaningful tightening occurs when she detects the gaps in constellations/portholes, identifies the wrong name, and acts to unwind it. The cost is visible: she trades the eels' trick (fogging glass to forget) for iron-and-mint clarity, accepts the returned sensory fragments as "buttons" that straighten her spine, and bows to honor the debt. The resolution is earned by her hands-on method and childhood promises. Escalation reads as density increase and pattern convergence rather than causal reversal, consistent with the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—reversing the brother's exile—is signaled early and tightens through the tea-leaf reading (triangles/circles/hinge), the mirror alignment, and the shadow's self-forgiveness challenge. Agency is clear: the archivist's annotations bind, the girl's choice to carry without breaking matters, and the brother must "push from inside." One meaningful escalation occurs when the shadow must speak forgiveness "like a challenge," a turn that narrows options and produces visible cost (the shadow coughing dust, the archivist's own exile remaining unreversed).

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: preserve wonder against the Gray's encroachment. One meaningful tightening occurs when the Gray waits at return and the pruner offers succor instead of striking—a choice that narrows options and redefines the conflict. Agency is present but the protagonist's near-invulnerability (capturing essence, crossing bridges, teaching neighbors) reduces felt cost. The reversal (Gray as hungry, not malicious) arrives late and is told rather than tested; no on-page resistance follows the revelation. Cost is asserted ("every severed branch must be told why") but rarely demonstrated as a tradeoff that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: grounding the fisherman's restless spirit by unmooring him from the net. The pressure is ritualistic and accumulative rather than causal; each knot undone deepens the atmosphere and the daughter's tremor provides emotional tightening. The final knot's release and the coffer's emergence constitute one meaningful turn, and the cost is visible when the restorer asks for the sack "because every binding wants a new promise." However, escalation is more tonal than decision-driven; the protagonist never faces a moment where the ritual might fail or demand a trade-off, so the stakes remain declared rather than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (how to interpret and share fragile knowledge without violation) signals early through "shielded openness that soothes without inviting too much confession." Escalation unfolds through accumulative pressure: the tear's mystery → the sealed panel → the choice between forcing and listening → the discovery of breath-pattern maps → the final decision to leave access partial. One meaningful tightening occurs when the video comparison narrows options from brute force to attentive observation. Agency is dramatized through renunciation—the protagonist could secure or fully announce the chamber but chooses partial revelation. Cost is visible: professional closure sacrificed, future visitors must earn access through patience. The restrained ending "some places reopen when you whisper to them" articulates the trade-off with conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake signaled early: "to understand the physics of letting go… as a measurable release." Pressure tightens through discovery (tape → pulses → message → stub), each narrowing interpretation until "LET GO TO LIVE" crystallizes as both historical instruction and present imperative. The final act—releasing the snow globe—is protagonist-driven and forecloses the path of clinging to evidence; the cost is legible when the narrator forgoes proof and notes "the math forgive me finally." No antagonist is required under the Accumulative lens; escalation operates through density increase and pattern convergence rather than reversals. Agency reads as renunciation with visible cost, satisfying the lens and scope.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: articulate unspoken community needs to the ghost before the interval closes. The protagonist encodes progressively bolder requests (laundry hours, hall lights, public console access), and the ghost's sampling/reply constitutes a meaningful tightening—static grounds, dew arranges into lines, status chimes rhyme—that narrows the protagonist's options to waiting for the ghost's systemic patch. Cost is legible: the protagonist asks for structural change ("let the council read the seams") and the ghost asks in return what the balladeer needs, forcing the reframe from individual to collective. However, no reversal tests commitment; the escalation is additive (more daring requests) rather than a pivot under opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake signaled early: deliver the goggles as instructed. Pressure coheres and tightens under Accumulative lens as each floor's revelation deepens understanding—diary discovery (floor two), goggles' function (floor three), map to forgetter room (floors six–nine). The reversal occurs when the narrator realizes the delivery is an act of grief management, not simple archival, reweighting the errand's cost. Agency is clear: the narrator chooses to read, to follow the map, to witness without "fix, not solve, not judge," enacting the vow of detachment. Cost is legible in the renunciation—"I loved her...with limits and with ringing, and with a vow to turn away"—and the final image of placing the objects and stepping back. One micro-constraint: the elevator's fixed ascent enforces real-time pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—proving that empty spaces remember—is signaled in the opening third and drives every beat. One meaningful tightening: tying the fresh line to the absence and feeling it hold narrows options from passive measurement to active architecture with visible cost (the narrator becomes tethered to the wake). The experiment structure (categorizing, tracing, tying, ribbon descent planned for the next night) escalates through accumulative pressure. Agency is renunciation and endurance that forecloses rescue with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—finish the final work before demolition sirens break stillness—is signaled in the opening and sustained. Pressure tightens through the coin-map discovery, rubbing translation, and racing against the crane's cough; each act narrows options (find safe → decode → paint before the siren completes its test). The artist's agency (choosing to quicken without haste, whispering names, leaving the note) forecloses the path of simple escape with visible cost: they give the room a knowable face rather than fleeing. One meaningful deepening when the rubbing reveals coordinates and the sky becomes layered/folded "within" rather than "above."

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: chart stranded luminance. The hopscotch discovery tightens the path (north by east, climb), and the murmuration "escorts" complicate approach. The net sequence deepens involvement, but the luminance "yields...like a promise" without resistance, cost, or trade-off; coincidence (birds cooperate, strand craves the dog-ear) resolves rather than complicates. No on-page reversal or competing pressure tests the narrator's skill or forces a renunciation. Agency is present in plotting and folding, but competence goes unchallenged, so escalation under the Accumulative lens feels decorative rather than constrained.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (learning and enacting the rhythm of repair) is signaled early and maintained. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: reading scraps of prophecy → uncapping oil → arranging gears → speaking to the frost → the machine wakes. One meaningful tightening occurs when the lockwork ticks then falters, "asking for a story," and he must shift tactic from mechanical work to narrative offering. Cost is legible in "the art of teaching a hurt how to keep moving" and his departure carrying "not triumph but a listening," which forecloses the option of mastery-as-conquest. The piece delivers the required deepening for this length, though escalation remains contemplative rather than viscerally pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (coax rain from the nebula) is signaled early and pursued through the relay. The piece delivers one meaningful tightening (carrying the bell to the archway at dusk, tilting toward sunset), but the escalation is choreographic rather than driven by protagonist decision under duress. The nebula arrives on schedule; no live option is foreclosed, no visible price paid. The resolution reads as cosmic gift rather than earned agency, and no secondary pressure (interpersonal friction, resource scarcity) complicates the attempt.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—granting the world a reprieve through the lullaby—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates texturally (nested patterns, storm glass darkening, the sequence of switch/lever/tick/breath) rather than through a causal tightening or reversible choice. The adjuster's agency is endurance and ritual execution; no live alternative or visible tradeoff appears on the page to test commitment. The final act—scattering the lullaby—deepens meaning but does not narrow options or impose a felt cost within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: guide three strangers to safety before frost and bird patrols close the paths. The travelers' arrival tightens options; night descending forces the sequence of subtle interventions. Agency is renunciation with visible cost—the caretaker empties the self to create survivable shapes for others. The nut wedged into the oldest bird's gear establishes the tactic, reused at climax. Coincidence does not resolve; every turn follows caretaker choice under mechanical and temporal pressure. The orchard's disappointment signals a live opposing force.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (reconnection with brother) is signaled early and tightens through the message, his delayed thumbs-up, and the bridge test. Agency is present: Mira's decision to build the polymer bridge, her on-page apology, and their shared crossing narrow options and foreclose the path of separation. One meaningful deepening occurs when he slips and she catches him—shared vulnerability crystallizes the shift. The brother's arc is compressed; his acceptance arrives in one scene without visible struggle, slightly softening the earned trade-off. Cost is legible: Mira's acknowledgment of wrongness and the promise of ongoing practice.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—finding where stories begin—is signaled in the opening third and drives both transactions. One meaningful tightening occurs when the protagonist mirrors the customer's trade, incising his own absence (father's silence) and narrowing options by committing his saved blank. Agency is visible: the protagonist chooses to measure, incise, and trade, each act foreclosing retreat. The customer's arrival and request create external pressure, but the piece leans heavily on Accumulative design; the escalation reads more as deepening than as a causal reversal that raises immediate cost. The final trade's price (father's silence) is legible but arrives late without prior friction over that specific absence.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (to sandpaper rough memories without losing their grain) is signaled early by the castellan's charge and drives all beats. Pressure tightens causally: pools point east → pavilion found → ice harvested → broth simmered → city steadied. The chef's agency is decisive at each node—choosing to cook, to warn the boy not to touch, to pour one bowl for coral—and the visible cost (absorbing contagious grief, risking contamination) narrows tactics throughout. Escalation accumulates texturally through mounting specificity: siege ash, truce stickiness, mason's silence all enter the broth, and the resolution (hands meet without storm) forecloses the old pattern with felt relief.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—constructing a bridge from silos to rehabilitate a conversation—is signaled early. Mara's decision to unshelve voices and lower the weight provides one meaningful tightening. However, the councilman's opposition dissolves without dramatized friction, and the elevator's "loneliness pilled off like old paint" through Mara's choral liturgy is asserted rather than tested. The bridge's completion by morning compresses escalation into summary, making the cost of her night's labor feel told rather than felt in a pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—excavating entangled memories to modify future grief—is signaled early and tightens through the ritual's progression. Pressure accumulates as the narrator moves from apparatus assembly to theta-wave adjustment to the hardest memory layer: the flooded-quarter decision where caution and audacity were both "shelter and prison." The Cost Proof Test is met: the vow to stop fossilizing and the dawn packing gesture foreclose the protective stance with visible emotional cost. One meaningful deepening occurs when the mirror splits and rejoins their faces, forcing the narrator to see complicity rather than blame. Agency is renunciation with on-page cost scaled to this length.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake (recover forgotten combinations) is signaled early and drives the journey. The inverted hour provides urgency, and the panel-opening sequence tightens options briefly. However, escalation is mild—the protagonist encounters obstacles (mist, threshold, panel) but each yields without meaningful trade-off or failed attempt. The tokens are grasped without cost beyond the time limit, and the return is promised rather than tested. One tightening (reaching the chamber) is present, but the cost at closure is conceptual rather than a visible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: to create music in a silent world, signaled in line 4. One meaningful tightening occurs when the hedgehog nods and "permission to continue" is felt—a small ceremony of witness that gates the protagonist's strumming. Agency is expressed as patient endurance and attention that forecloses rushing; the protagonist's decision to wind the wires and leave marks a trade-off (stopping now to preserve the grove's lesson). The cost is legible: the protagonist collects tools and promises to return, accepting that this phrase is complete and tomorrow requires fresh listening. Escalation reads as density increase and cadence shift under the Accumulative lens, sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: mend the eclipsed covenant before the registry seals their names as oathbreakers or custodians. The treaty's collapse a year ago establishes prior failure; the tutor's exile and lesson ("listening") deepen motive. Pressure accumulates through the chess sequence—each placement tests whether the field will "consider us again"—and the needle's twitch, rail's song, and covenant's "unshadowing" constitute a meaningful tightening with cost (custodianship "if only until morning"). The student's queen reaching back rank and the tutor's tipped king function as the culminating gesture, though the final act reads more as completion of ritual than a decision under competing pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—cataloging silences through resonance rather than force—is signaled early and tightens through the clasp's gradual warming and opening. Agency is present in the choice to tune frequencies and wait rather than pry, and the ending reweights the stake when the narrator finds no script but accepts the "lexicon of silences" as sufficient. However, the escalation is a single deepening (one meaningful turn) rather than a series of narrowing options; cost is legible but oblique, more conceptual (renouncing words for pauses) than viscerally dramatized in a high-pressure choice.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: cultivate serenity within motion by teaching the village to endure the corpse flower's stench. One meaningful tightening occurs (bud swells, bloom bursts, crowd breathes together), and the protagonist's choices drive it. However, the escalation lacks a visible trade-off or live option foreclosed—Mara succeeds without apparent cost, and no reversal tests her commitment. Thepiece meets baseline pressure under an Accumulative lens but does not reach the 8.0+ band's requirement of a felt price that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—restoring resilience to the orchards—is signaled early ("the planet were trying to speak while biting its tongue," trees "bow and tremble, and some do not spring back") and tightens when the protagonist discovers the shard drinking light and bleeding echoes into silence. Agency is clear: she shoulders through the veil, fits the tip to the wound, and the system responds. The escalation is Accumulative: pressure builds through the hour's arrival, the upward flight, the discovery of the chamber, and the repair. Cost is visible in her shaking hands and the undeniable shift in resilience's definition. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: preventing future accidents by understanding the singular convergence. Pressure accumulates through forensic discovery (patch, soot V, shift sheet, storm timing) and culminates in the drafted order that transforms the maze into a breathing grid. Agency is clear: the investigator's survey and recommendations foreclose future traps. One meaningful tightening (chain identified, then broken) is sufficient. The escalation is textural rather than causal, fitting the lens. Minor: opposition is atmospheric (wind, silence) rather than interpersonal; no antagonist challenges the investigator's conclusions.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—certifying wonder to the council—is signaled early but remains abstract; no on-page council refusal or test dramatizes the opposition. One meaningful tightening occurs when the protagonist must "walk a measure through the colors of the aurora, and not fall asleep," introducing the danger of repose as immediate threat. The sculptor's parallel strike provides a temporal hinge, yet the bell-ringer's agency is passive observation rather than forced choice. Cost is implied (the protagonist rests, awaits "the next first strike") but no live option is visibly foreclosed on the page. Under Accumulative lens, the pressure coheres and deepens through layered imagery, but escalation driven by protagonist decision is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming failure into insight without hiding it—signals early and remains coherent. The flute-playing scene is the key escalation: each note opens a corridor, introduces the twin-valley self, and forces the protagonist to "teach edges to share" rather than stitch them closed, meaningfully tightening the options. The ending forecloses the path of "carrying banners" in favor of "carrying driftwood," a renunciation with visible cost (the protagonist gives up authority). One meaningful turn is sufficient at this length. To reach 8.8+, the escalation would benefit from a second on-page micro-choice that raises the price or narrows tactics before the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: "understand the mathematics of emotion." One tightening occurs when the operator sets "the line that will not lie" and the lever drops, forcing the transposed empathy moment. However, agency is diffuse—the narrator holds the fragment and counts, but the operator drives the action. The cost ("spikes with initials we dared not say aloud," shoulders drop, hands stop shaking) is told via summary rather than a visible forfeiture that narrows later options. The piece meets the lens-appropriate escalation requirement but misses higher bands due to protagonist passivity and summarized consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: learning to practice notice/invite/release without letting the gift become hunger. The encounter with the woman provides one meaningful tightening—the moment "begins to stretch, sweet and dangerous"—that forces the protagonist to lift the pendant and ask it to release, a choice with visible cost (giving back sharpness, accepting limits). Agency is enacted through renunciation with on-page consequence. The mentor's absence operates as persistent constraint shaping tactics (the protagonist speaks aloud to him, works through his teaching). Escalation under the Accumulative lens arrives as deepening: each encounter adds density until the release choice crystallizes the practice.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: prove objects absorb emotion, signaled early and tested throughout. The ritual tightens when the narrator names the father—"tasted like smoke and rain"—and the frost responds, a visible pivot from skepticism to belief. The closure forecloses the narrator's former detachment: treating keys as sentient is a permanent posture shift with conceptual cost. One beat shows felt cost on the page: "the cabin air took on a density, like a room after laughter leaves." Agency is attention and naming, sufficient for this accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (reaching the sister across impossible distance) is signaled early and tightens when the spinner must choose between crossing herself and preserving the orchard as a living place for return. The reversal—releasing the bead instead of herself—narrows options and carries visible cost: seasons of waiting, feeding lantern oil and patience. Agency is clear in the spinner's renunciation (stopping at the threshold) and the bead's dispatch. Under the accumulative lens, pressure coheres through the layered ritual and deepens when the sister's footfall finally answers.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (prevent arch collapse, save orchards) signals early and tightens through three barter cycles, each costing more (sound → surname → laughter) and narrowing the protagonist's voice to "thread." Agency is clear: deliberate descent, wrapping silk, offering memories, humming the bell's tune. The tremor mid-sequence raises physical risk and tests resolve ("counting to keep panic from inflecting the song"). Closure cost is visible—voice thinned, memories spent—and the final stance (listening, continuing work) forecloses the path of withdrawal. Under the Accumulative lens, the deepening barter price and the final reconfiguration of threat into livable place constitute sufficient escalation and earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering and measuring the weight of withheld truth—is signaled early and maintained. Pressure accumulates through sensory investigation, log discovery, and the crate unsealing; the protagonist's agency drives each beat. The climactic redirection narrows options (voices now public, weight distributed) but the cost remains conceptual and oblique: no visible trade-off, injury, or foreclosed personal path is dramatized on the page. Under the Accumulative lens one meaningful deepening is sufficient, and the weight-lifting image reweights prior material, but the lack of a felt personal price or visible trade-off prevents 8+ entry.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: protecting the anonymous letter chain's meaning from commodification. The Board's automation and archival threat supply coherent pressure. One meaningful tightening: Doyle's revelation that letters "would be archived, cataloged, displayed behind glass" escalates from abstract automation to concrete theft of intimacy, narrowing options to immediate counter-action. The final ritual—soaking letters in oil, sealing the jar—forecloses museum capture with visible cost (the letters become unreadable, the light bottled but never burned). Agency is renunciation and endurance; coincidence does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: prevent the gyre from drowning the town while honoring the storm's sentience. Her laugh "betrays" her, pivoting the gyre toward harbor, which tightens pressure; her ritual with the wick and beam forces a single decisive action under stress. Agency is clear—she steers the storm through embodied craft—and the cost (physical toll, recursive responsibility) is visible on the page. One escalation point (gyre pivots) is sufficient for this length under the Accumulative lens, though a second micro-reversal would have cemented the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—learning why some magnetize stories—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when the dye master reframes it as structural rather than mystical. One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist realizes the donor heart's nature ("tuned to echo, not drum") forces a tactical shift from seeking answers to accepting lens-work. The cost is visible: protagonist must relinquish the desire for fewer moving parts. Agency is present in the final acceptance and the decision to follow sun trails home.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: to discover what trees witness. Pressure accumulates through the ritual of dream-mapping and sextant reconstruction, tightening when the narrator asks aloud and the storm pauses. The trees' answer—"they witness our maps… and they hold them until we return to read"—reweights the ledger work and delivers a cost: the narrator must accept indirect, texture-based knowing rather than declarative proof. Agency is clear in the decision to carry measurements to the roof and ask "the clumsiest way." One meaningful deepening (the sextant clicking, numbers opening) and one Charged Poise moment (the final pin falling, "the map would hold") suffice for this length under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—rekindling a dying realm—is signaled in the opening and tightens through escalating collective need: individual memories, then village grief, finally "the last village" with "fires gone to salt." Pressure accumulates through song-gathering that "knits communities together," and the climactic weaving forecloses the keeper's solitary holding ("I am emptied"). Agency is clear: the keeper chooses to "open the doors," "begin their song," and "raise the woven dawn," each act narrowing reversibility. The cost is legible on the page: "My scattered memories fly toward their owners" makes the emptying concrete and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara's mistake caused harm or held hidden value—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the woman's explanation ("the forward becomes kind only when it meets the backward halfway") reframes the problem, narrowing Mara's options from self-blame to integrated mending. Agency is clear: Mara chooses to write the note and visit the patron, foreclosing her reclusive stance with on-page cost. However, no direct opposition tests her commitment; the library woman guides rather than resists, so escalation reads as accumulative deepening rather than contested pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake signaled early: "to find the sacred in the ordinary" and restore what the city forgets. Pressure accumulates through guerrilla gardening tasks and the group's shared confessions of complicity. One tightening occurs when morning threatens and they must decide what to leave visible, forcing a trade-off between sanctuary and survival. The ending reweights the stake (cyclical return) but the cost remains diffuse—no single choice forecloses a live option with sharp consequence. Under Accumulative lens, this is sufficient but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving recoverable vows and deciding what to release—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the three projections: the wedding succeeds, the courtroom pledge fractures, the scribes' vow trembles but is coaxed into coherence. The narrator's own vow (to keep the library awake) arrives late but reweights prior material. Agency is visible in "I revised the metadata to include conditions never spoken, and the tremor softened," a micro-decision that alters outcome. Cost is felt but diffuse: "I do not know how long we can hold the passing back" admits uncertainty without foreclosing a path on the page. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful tightening suffices; the final persistence choice deepens the stake but does not transform it decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: capture the sound of trust breaking, not revenge. The protagonist's agency is active throughout—she controls the false starts, lets silence multiply, and uses stillness to "bend his route like warm glass." The belt-buckle moment is the meaningful tightening that narrows options; the partner's mask holds but the pier "groaned disagreeably." Cost is visible: she renounces revenge, pours moonshine he refuses, and accepts a silence that confesses. One deepening under the Accumulative lens is sufficient and the price charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—learning why people carry weather—is signaled early and pursued through tasting and conversation. The convergence at the crest tightens options (flavors turn saline, ring requests spilling), and the carriers' release narrows the ritual to completion. Agency at closure is collective (Naira opens hands, child breathes fog) rather than a choice by the protagonist that forecloses a live alternative; the narrator observes and tastes but does not alter tactics under pressure. One meaningful deepening occurs (the emergent compass "clicks" and duties are set down), but the cost reads as ambient relief rather than a visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—uncorking suppressed creativity before it "ferments into silence"—is signaled early and tightened through the lock puzzle, which literalizes the internal block. The protagonist's agency drives each beat (lifting canvas, threading string, turning key, opening book, drawing), and the cost is visible in the trembling wrist and the choice to "feed it image after image." The escalation is somewhat muted; the lock's mechanics yield more easily than the setup suggests ("tug once, and a hinge clicks"), softening the earned difficulty of breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—finding lost conversations—is signaled early and sustained. The progression from fragment to map to corridor to spindle provides one meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens. The Ear's demand for candor creates a threshold that narrows options, and the confession sequence ("I told the panels how I hoard...") supplies on-page escalation. However, the cost of candor is more atmospheric than tactical; no live relationship or resource is visibly forfeited, and the protagonist's confessions don't foreclose a competing path with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserve the color of wonder before it thins—is signaled early and coherent. Pressure tightens when the iceberg fragment begins to melt ("fear pricked the crowd as precious water fell"); Mara's on-page response (motioning for basins, guiding apprentices to repurpose the water into percussion) narrows options and deepens the sculpture's effect. The aurora thickens again, delivering one meaningful escalation under the Accumulative lens. However, the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt: no specific personal path is foreclosed for Mara beyond her seasonal muteness, which was already established. The villagers' emotional releases are told more than dramatized in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear: resolve inner static by staging the burn before the shift resets bearings. Accumulative pressure tightens through compass stutter, window spider, dome breach—each narrows options until escape becomes necessary. Agency is decision and renunciation (leaving the museum-tour behind) with visible cost: dome slumps, paint curls, old enclosure abandoned. The burn doesn't destroy but "unsticks time," and the android's gathering of packets shows tactical adaptation. One meaningful deepening suffices; the cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—proving that listening heals—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the inspector arrives with bolt cutters and a deadline ("until the kettle whistled a second time"), narrowing the window. The curator's agency at the climax (pressing the half-moon into the lock, asking neighbors to listen) is present but the price paid is unclear; no live option is visibly foreclosed on the page. The letters resolve the mailbox mystery and soften grudges, but the resolution feels granted by Maria's prior action rather than earned by the curator's sacrifice or renunciation. Escalation is legible but cost is diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—liberate the drowned minds—is signaled early and sustained through accumulative pressure: each coded entry tightens the daemon's new instinct, each dance step teaches the cameras. The protagonist's agency is renunciation of legibility (encryption as defiance) and endurance under interrogation ("state your loyalty"). One meaningful deepening occurs when the final entry posts and the locks relax, narrowing options from covert prep to irreversible action. Cost is visible in the conceptual gamble: if the dance is misread, the revolt fails. No causal reversal or second character pressure complicates the arc; escalation relies on density and cadence rather than turn-based conflict, fitting the Accumulative lens but limiting high-band eligibility under tighter escalation gates.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—to find where deleted memories go—is signaled early and guides Ilya's moves through chamber and shore. Pressure accumulates through the gravity-pocket constraint, the coffee-ground spiral pointing him beneath, and the cube's wildflower memory sweating back into voice. The final altar-building is a deepening rather than a reversal, and the cost (building the altar, waiting among lanterns) is felt but not explicitly foreclosing a live option. Under the Accumulative lens one meaningful tightening is sufficient, and the ritual satisfies that bar, though the stakes remain more atmospheric than concrete choice-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—hushing a prophecy before it unlocks a sky door—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates via imagery and ritual steps (listening, anchoring the wing, breathing with banks, turning the wing) but no reversal or narrowing of options occurs; the summoner faces no setback, adaptation, or trade-off. The resolution is achieved by method rather than agency under opposition, and no visible cost or foreclosed path appears on the page. Under the Accumulative lens one meaningful deepening suffices, but the lack of felt price or contested choice caps the score.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—learning the building's language—is signaled in line two and tightens when the tutor demonstrates the seal, then deepens when the narrator must speak a truth back to answer the building. The final promise forecloses casual tourism and commits the narrator to sustained practice with visible relational cost (weekly return, carrying questions). Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through recurring ritual (tea, seal-stamping, meteor punctuation) and the narrator's shift from passive observation to active response. The coincidence of the meteor shower complicates timing but does not resolve the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—translate isolation into independence—is signaled early and tightens through one decisive question: "Must I let you loose, or must I become the door?" The narrator's agency (carrying the shell through the archive, asking the avoided question, standing until bones ring) drives the turn; no coincidence resolves. The cost is visible: the narrator transforms from clasp to passage, losing the role of keeper but gaining fluency. The shell's harmonization with closed doors escalates pressure, and Reina's departure forecloses the prior containment with undeniable consequence ("quarantine sign dissolves").

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—unlinking the tax-chains without shattering the city—is signaled early and tightens through the forging act. The protagonist's agency is evident (choosing to "unlink what could stand alone," refusing to touch the personal hinge), and the cost (the blood-dot, the renunciation) is on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist discovers and then declines to open the hinge in their own name, foreclosing a path. The pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—learning why some echo and others swallow their names—is signaled early and pursued consistently. One meaningful deepening occurs when the protagonist learns the council banks stolen voice-halves for profit, but this revelation is told in summary rather than dramatized through a scene that narrows options or forces a visible trade-off. The decision to sing for all the stolen halves and "ensure their return" arrives without on-page resistance, cost legibility, or a credible loss that alters later tactics. The council's threat ("hissed") dissolves instantly when the shell pours surf, removing tension rather than escalating it.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake is clearly signaled: salvage truth and the girl's name from erasure. One meaningful tightening occurs when the narrator reads "Leda" on the globe's base, transforming investigation into testimonial mission. Agency is present in the decision to speak the name aloud and promise exposure of the owner's lie, which forecloses retreat and commits the narrator to a public role. The cost is visible in "windows of connection follow me" and the shift from solitary investigator to bearer of witness. Coincidence does not resolve; the dreams complicate by providing fragments the narrator must weave.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: repair the nets and identify the "thief" before dawn while addressing hunger and debt. Pressure tightens when Li brings torn meshes and his father's demand; the philosopher's choice to investigate (whistle, follow moon paths) narrows options. The widow's revelation adds moral complexity (mercy vs. survival), and the teaching scene reweights the conflict from blame to compassion. One meaningful escalation (discovery) and one tightening choice (teach rather than condemn) with visible cost (elders' surprise, Li's pay refused). Agency is clear; coincidence (fireflies rising) complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—excavate truth from comfortable lies—is signaled in paragraph four and drives every beat. Pressure tightens when the narrator steps into the stillpoint and feels the trees drink, then escalates with the letter assembly revealing corporate cover-up. The peak choice (write the truth but omit names) arrives with visible cost: the narrator must compromise the debunking mission to protect Klay. The escalation is causal (investigation → discovery → ethical dilemma) and the final trade-off forecloses the clean debunking path. One meaningful deepening occurs when the diamond's crooked ring is understood as engineering, not curse, reweighting the entire premise.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake (broadcasting resistance to shape a new order) is signaled early and the council's attack provides external pressure. One meaningful tightening occurs when the council sends cutters and then traitors, forcing the narrator to deploy "ancient shadows" and Kestrel to stand exposed. However, the escalation bypasses protagonist agency—the lightning "favored the portico" passively, the crowd's choice is described in summary, and the council's retreat ("blinked") lacks on-page consequence. Cost at closure is conceptual (visibility of the work's strings) rather than a visible forfeiture or injury that narrows later options, fitting Accumulative lens but not charging the final image with urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—translating between generations via captured sound—is signaled early and coheres through the narrative. One meaningful tightening occurs during the storm, which forces the protagonist to question whether "redemption had refused me or whether it waited inside a jar I had not opened," narrowing options to survival versus transmission of kinship. The widow's request for the jar and the children's intermediary role demonstrate earned escalation under the accumulative lens. Agency is expressed through micro-choices: following the fox, cleaning the music box, selecting three jars to open during the storm, giving the jar to children with instructions. Cost is visible: the protagonist remains isolated, risks the storm, and gives away irreplaceable work. Minor gap: the storm itself arrives by coincidence rather than protagonist action, complicating but not resolving stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (protect the artifact) is signaled early and tested when the Collector demands proof. One meaningful tightening occurs when the protagonist opens the vault and tunes the Lens-Heart, narrowing options to demonstration or refusal. The Collector's emotional collapse and withdrawal constitute a reversal driven by protagonist agency (the choice to hum and match vibration). Cost is visible—"leave the harbor its listening"—but the protagonist's internal trade-off (risking misuse to prove efficacy) could be more explicitly foregrounded in the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (speed versus patience) is signaled early and tightens through the council demonstration, where the needles slacken and the narrator wins a three-night compact—a clear narrowing of options with visible cost (return barren, return to haste). The expedition beat delivers a secondary reversal (success beyond the viaduct) that validates the new method. The final paragraph crystallizes the stance: "we choose running instead of being driven." One deduction: the middle expedition is summarized ("solve three winter shortages before dawn breaks thinly") rather than dramatized, so the peak test lacks on-page friction. The cost at closure is felt but oblique—social adoption rather than personal sacrifice—which fits the Accumulative lens but reduces visceral charge.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (proving preventable death and defying pressure to erase) is signaled early and tightens through discovery of the contractor connection and hidden egress route. The protagonist's agency drives escalation: measuring, photographing, timing the escape route, then unclipping the earpiece and summoning witnesses. The choice forecloses paths (career safety, institutional compliance) with visible cost. Under the accumulative lens, the tightening occurs through the investigator's methodical gathering of evidence that makes evasion impossible, culminating in the defiant "report will move the same way, toward daylight." One clear deepening and one decisive stance crystallization with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: can the chaplain offer the parole board more than words? Pressure tightens through one meaningful turn—the heart's repair demonstrates that "the first sound is only intention," prompting the apprenticeship structure that transforms apology into measurable deeds. Agency is clear: the chaplain's decision to arrange remote work forecloses simple advocacy and commits time/reputation. Cost is visible: the plan requires sustained coordination and exposes the chaplain to failure if Hector relapses.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (ring the bell no one hears yet) is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening: the arrow tip fits the bellframe, Sera pulls the clapper, the bell rings. Cost is felt in the "unlonely moment" and the inward-braided map, but the climax is more a ritual completion than a choice that forecloses a live alternative. Under the accumulative lens, pressure coheres through gathering fragments (clue, map, coordinates, bell) and the final image reweights prior yearning. No explicit antagonist or reversal; coincidence (rain-whale arrival) complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (find where deleted files go / expose corporate cover-up) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when the narrator opens the forbidden vault. The lie escalates from "memorial escalation" to each door passage to the final withholding decision. Agency is clear: the protagonist chooses to "let deletion be a home" rather than export, foreclosing the exposure path with visible cost ("company logs every export like a pulse"). One meaningful deepening occurs when Lia's voice notes reveal systemic murder, raising the stakes from curiosity to justice.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—map empathy onto action—is signaled early and tightens when the protagonist must commit to "acts, not poses" under mirror pressure, then again when the globe's survival depends on walking with each team to ensure words find legs. One reversal: the shard cuts when the protagonist hesitates, teaching that posture breaks the tool. Agency is decision and endurance (the walk into slush) with visible cost. The envoys' promises feel slightly convenient—first and second offers align too neatly—but the protagonist's choice to pocket the fragment "as reminder that humility belongs in every mechanism" forecloses the option of neutral observer status with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake is clear: learning the grammar of endings to resolve her "changed" state and mistrust of mirrors. Pressure tightens through disaster work discoveries, culminating in the ice-crack rescue where "an ending arriving and not arriving" crystallizes her understanding. The postponement decision forecloses the clinic path with visible cost (continued tourist status, living in "a fold in patience"). One friction: the boy's near-fall feels slightly convenient, though it does teach the lesson that endings can be averted. Agency is consistent—her repeated choice to trawl and postpone—and the final stance (tomorrow she'll trawl again) reconfigures the initial death-seeking into vigilant apprenticeship.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—nurturing intersubjective understanding between the traveler and their partner—is signaled early ("answer with a pour, then with a shrug") and tightened when the traveler confesses hoarded-silence paralysis. The sentinel's agency (sharing the letter, pouring libation, advising "Try spending them") drives escalation under the Accumulative lens, and the phone call is the protagonist-enabled reversal that narrows options with visible cost: the traveler commits to bridging, the sentinel remains alone. The burned letter's instructive function and the cane-tying parallel impose constraint on tactics. The final question ("if mismatches must be fixed") and answer ("companioned, curated, celebrated") crystallize the stance without forcing resolution, and the departure leaves consequence on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—preserve the echo of wisdom without flattening it—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when Lio warns against creating "a cage" and the narrator learns to "cinch the ropes so the wind played scales," then applies this in conjuring clearings for the woman and child. Agency is largely enacted through ritual work (walking lines, tying knots, boundary prayer) rather than decision under duress; the echo's arrival feels more like validation than a hard-won turn. Cost is present but diffuse: the mention of listening "even when the listening hurts" and Lio's scar backstory imply sacrifice, yet no on-page forfeiture narrows options at closure. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens but lacks a sharp escalation that would push the score higher.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—shaping remembrance that can "breathe on its own"—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates as participants add photos and name what they see, and the storm tests the structure without breaking it. However, escalation is largely external (weather, community response); the archivist's own agency remains facilitative rather than decision-driven. The final image reweights collective healing, but no on-page reversal or trade-off forecloses a path with visible cost scaled to individual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: proving language grows in silence to the custodians. One clear tightening: the summons to Archive Court forces the scholar to compress his method into testimony, narrowing options to listening vs. declaring proof. Agency is decision and stance crystallization: he chooses to share authority ("listen with me, not to him") with visible cost—no harvest, only care. The custodians' lowered eyes register consequence. Escalation under Accumulative lens is sufficient; the testimony is earned by prior mapping. Minor deduction: the custodians arrive late and apply no visible counter-pressure on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—capturing the sound of growing older—is signaled early and tested through escalating attempts: planting markers, recording fog, chalking commands. The middle tightening occurs when the tide shifts arrows and "knowledge evaporat[es] before the forgetting even arrived," narrowing options. Agency reads as endurance: the prophet obeys his future instruction not to rewind, foreclosing immediate understanding for the sake of future return. Cost is felt in the sustained pressure of memory loss and the fragile anchors he must trust.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—capturing the comet's shadow before thermal tides wreck the shutters—is signaled early and tightens once when the governor seats and exposures are set "by the sound of a leaf falling." Agency appears in the protagonist's decision to "let her thought restructure me" and in the hands-on repair that forecloses further malfunction. The reversal (hand spinning → hand settled) is modest but earned; cost is legible in the acceptance that "there is no cure for longing, only art."

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is Ruth's reconciliation with her sister before death, signaled early and tightened by the narrator's call to Lena. One meaningful reversal when Lena arrives and the sisters apologize. The final chord-stopping moment narrows options (the "flawless goodbye" executed with visible cost). Agency is shared between narrator's facilitation and Ruth's choice, which slightly diffuses protagonist pressure but remains coherent under the Hybrid lens.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—finding where shadows go at noon—is signaled in paragraph four and sustained to closure. The tightening occurs when the Archivist warns against prying and the protagonist must honor the circuit by building a model that "eats only its own tail," narrowing options from extraction to respectful witness. The final choice to "close the ring and thank them" forecloses taking and stabilizes the isle, with cost legible in the renunciation of shortcuts. One meaningful deepening (shadows as teachers) reweights the stake under the Accumulative lens. Agency is clear; coincidence does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: repair the winter misjudgment by finding the boy and restoring belief. The substitute body incites pursuit; the tooth discovery tightens by opening the hedge; the underground chamber deepens when the narrator heals the fox and earns the boy's trust. Agency is consistent: the narrator chooses to follow clues, ease the thrush, set the fox's leg, and walk the boy home. Cost is legible—admitting error to the father and relinquishing clinical certainty—but the escalation is gradual rather than urgent; the garden sequence unfolds more as revelation than conflict. No antagonist opposes; the pressure is interior and accumulative.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: share light without flame, serve the community and seals. The pearl's arrival introduces a stated choice (quiet sea vs. carrying voices), but the resolution—polishing a "shared breath"—sidesteps the trade-off without visible cost. No on-page reversal narrows options; instead, the pearl "brightened by being shared" and villagers' fears are "caught" in a net of hush. Agency is processual (polishing, suspending) rather than a decision that forecloses a path. Pressure accumulates through density but does not tighten toward a choice with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake signaled early: to graft new meaning onto old wounds through daily labor rather than performative confession. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: each act (stringing pendant, sewing moss, placing trays, bringing cuttings) deepens commitment and forecloses the option of immediate public return. One meaningful tightening occurs when Miri asks if the narrator will speak again publicly and the narrator chooses "later, when the work has grown enough"—a renunciation with visible cost (delaying voice, accepting that fear may break the work's stem). Agency is clear: the narrator's micro-choices (showing the pendant, grafting cuttings, sitting beneath the pendant) alter tactics and reweight the ending. The final image—"hands steady, and a hush so honeyed the lens cannot manufacture it"—reconfigures the viral confession as secondary to sustained, unglamorous labor.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—collecting and solemnizing the shapes of abandoned hopes—is signaled early and accumulates pressure through cameo encounters that each hand the protagonist a charged object (star, knot). The girl's refusal ("that was not mercy, that was erasure") provides one meaningful tightening that narrows options and forces acknowledgment. The protagonist's agency is renunciation and testimony rather than decisive action; the cost is conceptual (admitting brevity, releasing rather than keeping) but not a visible forfeiture that alters later tactics on the page. Escalation reads as density increase and cadence shift under the accumulative lens, sufficient for this length, though the wolves and nexus growl without advancing pressure in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—"to restore sacred practices"—is signaled early and coheres under the Accumulative lens: Lio's ritual layering (bells, thread, song) builds pressure toward the arbor's answering shiver. One meaningful deepening occurs when "something snagged like a burr" and the child's observation prompts the pivot to align the shadow wheel, tightening the remedy's conditions. The resolution is earned by collective action (rotation, song, vow) with implied cost (daily renewal), but no on-page forfeiture or trade-off that visibly narrows future options. Agency is present but ceremonial; coincidence does not resolve, yet the escalation remains atmospheric rather than choice-driven with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—finding Fen via pulse-mapping—is signaled early and shapes all actions. Pressure is coherent but does not escalate: she unpacks, arranges, etches, lights flash paper, prints, and leaves in a steady accumulation without reversal or tightening choice. The "three pulses braided like paths" moment deepens her method, but no visible cost or narrowed option appears on the page. The protagonist's agency is active (she executes each step), yet coincidence and prior preparation do most of the work; the orchard "rewarded quiet" rather than testing her.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—repair the broken timer by harvesting cave echoes—is signaled early and pursued consistently. One meaningful tightening occurs when the escapement reveals "misaligned teeth" and the locksmith must file a new gear train keyed to echo intervals, narrowing method. Yet the process unfolds without complication, reversal, or visible cost: every echo returns as needed, the mechanism consents to "breathe," and the cave "approves" without resistance. No live option is foreclosed, no trade-off forced; the locksmith's agency reads as skilled execution rather than decision under pressure. The lack of a second beat that tests or transforms the first caps escalation in the mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—collecting burdens versus staying bound—is signaled early and persists. Pressure accumulates through the valley figure's question, but escalation is conceptual rather than action-driven: the protagonist listens, reflects, and accepts without a visible trade-off or foreclosed option. The widow's absence and the boat's grief are collected off-page; the boy's tremor is mentioned but not tested. One tightening occurs when the lamp and star align, yet the resolution ("I accepted the circle") feels asserted rather than earned through a micro-choice that alters tactics or costs. No antagonistic friction forces a renunciation or shift with on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—shaping grief into livable form without trapping memory—is signaled early and tightens through the craft sequence. Agency is renunciation and endurance: she refuses spectacle, chooses the door ajar, practices the steadying her husband taught. The escalation is textural: each shaving writes a path, the door clicks on its hinge, the loop and crystal go inside. The cost is legible on the page: permanent solitude, the ache in her wrist, the choice to carry him "here and gone" rather than fixed. One reversal: the cage becomes not a trap but a home that opens.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: restart the carousel or let the settlement lose rain, with the ghost's warning as counter-pressure. One meaningful tightening occurs when the ghost demands tribute and Mara pays with the library vow, narrowing her options and foreclosing hoarded memory. The final paddle-catch reweights the trade-off under the Accumulative lens. Escalation is driven by Mara's wheel-turning agency, though the ghost's pivot from refusal to acceptance compresses quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—resurrecting the fountain as a test of hope's systemic rebuild—is signaled early and tightens through Mara's sequential problem-solving: tracing water lines, rerouting solar power, threading tubing. The reversal arrives when the fountain coughs and gurgles, then the townspeople appear, adding a social vector to her technical grid. Agency is clear (her decisions drive each beat), and the escalation follows the Accumulative lens (density and modest stakes rather than life-or-death conflict). The cost, however, remains conceptual (time, patience, modest scale) rather than viscerally felt; no live option is foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (making peace with the abandoned dream) is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful turn: the protagonist's realization that the dream was "not the bell but the listening it required." Agency is renunciation with visible cost—the anthem becomes a lullaby, the bell does not ring but is borne. The "tremor" that answers the stroke narrows options by proving the hush can accept sound "patient enough to become part of the glacial hush." The price is legible: the protagonist remains faithful to silence but now carries an object that redefines the terms of that fidelity. Under the Accumulative lens, this deepening is sufficient and the cost is on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: expose the flood's architecture and secure proof. One meaningful tightening: photographing evidence and leaving the sundial visible narrows options—escape becomes impossible once the foreman arrives. Agency is decision and staged provocation: "I rearranged the scene to speak." The watchman's siren blast forces public witness, escalating from stealth to open accusation. Cost is legible: the narrator trades safety for accountability, and "steady and inescapable" paperwork implies institutional pursuit. The foreman's deflation—"like a man placing a heavy bucket down"—registers defeat without requiring explicit consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake signaled early: preserve ancient methods before the dock falls. Pressure coheres and tightens under the Accumulative lens: each knot message deepens the archive, the tar seal's opening raises stakes, the fisherman's offer to argue the council forecloses passivity. Agency is decision and instruction with visible cost—time spent, knowledge shared, dependency created. The resolution earns the protagonist's departure and the fisherman's new role. One meaningful tightening (the dock's deadline) drives escalation; the cost (reliance on the fisherman's success) is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—writing obituaries to understand the geography of healing—is signaled early. Escalation under the Accumulative lens shows as density increase: the narrator moves from one client (Mira) to multiple petitioners (baker, teacher), and reflection deepens from observing others' absences to drafting their own. Mira's letter is a meaningful turn, narrowing hope to acceptance and prompting the seed-planting. Yet protagonist agency is diffuse; the narrator receives and transcribes rather than forcing choices that foreclose paths. The cost of staying is stated ("no ship tomorrow") but not viscerally tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—reawaken beauty vs. mechanical law—is signaled early and tightens when the Keepers demand the egg and the prince refuses, forecloses obedience with visible relational cost. The egg quickens, hatches into a hybrid creature, and its song silences the Keepers' anger, recalibrating the court. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres and deepens: the discovery, assembly, refusal, hatching, and song-driven stand each narrow options. Agency is clear in the refusal ("because refusal was the only prayer I had left") and the final offer of the song as metronome. Minor gap: the Keepers' clamps and laws vanish after the song threads their helmets without further dramatized consequence or visible trade-off in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—proving scars can sing—is signaled in paragraph four and sustained through grafting acts. One meaningful tightening: the boy's question ("why I bothered") forces articulation of mercy versus fire-watch, crystallizing the stance without a decision that forecloses an alternate tactic. The coin-whisper and trunk throat-note demonstrate the proof-of-concept, but no reversal narrows options or imposes visible cost. Agency is attention and endurance rather than renunciation; the closure reconfigures inherited harm into chorus, meeting Charged Poise under the Accumulative lens, though the price paid (leaving the coin, walking away) is more symbolic than a trade-off with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—liberate trapped memories to wake the city—is signaled immediately and tightens through the breadcrumb trail, the stuck panel, and the alignment wait. The protagonist's agency drives escalation: choosing to whisper at dry fountains, prying with the brass blade, offering the secret that unsticks the pitch. The constellation-key moment provides a meaningful deepening that narrows options to sidereal patience. Cost is visible: memories fly toward owners but some remain orphaned, the protagonist must release his own memory rather than hold it, and the city will forget again unless someone repeats the search.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: sharing light gently, teaching without burning. The stranger's arrival and desire to learn intensify pressure, and the orrery rebuild narrows tactics, but the escalation remains textural accumulation rather than a choice that trades off live options. The stranger's epiphany ("maybe escape had become their only tradition") is asserted, not dramatized through a visible fork. Cost is felt but not foregrounded at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—discover the shape of collective grief—signals early and tightens through ribbon-tying, carving intersections, and townsfolk contributions. The peak question ("how to finish what had no edge") forces a meaningful choice: loosen the braid, let gaps glow. The resolution is earned by the protagonist's obedience to spectral guidance and prior accumulation of voices. Cost is visible (letting go of control, permitting incompleteness) but the dramatized friction leading to the grandmother's final poem could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clearly signaled early: restore shared balance through ethical clock adjustment. Pressure tightens when the protagonist reads their own name on the handle and must decide whether to remove pellets tied to personal guilt. The pellet-by-pellet decision ("If the harm was repented and mended, the pellet goes in a jar; if not, it stays to drag us") narrows options and charges the closure. Agency is clear: the winder replaces three shots, removes two, and promises future action. One meaningful deepening under Accumulative lens is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—"to discover the shape of intentions"—is signaled early and pursued through the ritual, but pressure never escalates into a genuine turn or trade-off. Rowan learns the chess tutor's intention and performs a symbolic correction (running the clock), yet this act is unopposed and costs him nothing visible on the page. The uncharted echoes "thinned, not vanished," which suggests continuation rather than closure, and no live option is foreclosed. Under the Accumulative lens, the tightening or deepening required is missing; the ritual completes but does not reweigh options or knowledge with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.2)
    One dominant stake is signaled early: seed innovation within constraint without "snowing the city under with unchecked certainties." The pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens as the narrator unpacks maps, models, and metaphors, then faces the Council's demand for a "billboard of certainty." One meaningful tightening occurs when the narrator argues for a trellis over a wall and the Council's "resistance softened like frost in sun." Agency is present—offering the lattice, marking the fogs, agreeing to "write the trellis first"—but the escalation is more conceptual than a narrowing of live options with visible trade-offs. The cost is felt (choosing humility, risking the city's fate on a flexible model) but not sharply embodied in a specific forfeiture or failure on the page. No explicit antagonist; coincidence does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: resistance to "story famine" through dust-story transmission. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mara keys a reply naming the ridge, which escalates from passive reception to active broadcast and draws boots past the door—coincidence complicates but does not resolve. The warning in the reed-ladder melody forces a tactical shift (cutting lamps, audience breathing on count). Cost is visible: exposure replaces concealment. However, the escalation is smooth rather than abrupt; no sharp reversal that narrows options dramatically mid-scene. The boots "faded" feels slightly convenient, softening the peak danger.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: whether the drawing-to-ash ritual can convert Soren's unspoken grief into something bearable. The narrator's agency drives the sequence: choosing what to draw ("the way she waited for him to tell her the last truth"), tearing the portrait, lighting it, and scattering the ash into the mask's seams. One meaningful tightening occurs when Soren asks to take the drawing and the narrator refuses—"here the end is always ash"—forcing the ephemeral path and its cost (no keepsake, only internalized weather). The cost is legible: the image is destroyed, Soren flinches, and the gray "looks like a thought that will not heal yet." Under the Accumulative lens, this deepening reweights the mirage of safety with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—preserve ancient methods and restore navigation—is signaled early and coheres under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Escalation reads as deepening rather than reversal: the narrator moves from solitary salvage to vault discovery to teaching, each beat narrowing the path toward independence. The decision to distribute copies but keep the method forecloses faction dependency with visible cost (ongoing isolation, reliance on children's persistence). Agency is clear: choices to dive, copy, teach, and wind the chronometer all arise from the narrator's values. One meaningful tightening occurs when the rebuilt machine "held time steady across even the slack tides," altering harbormaster tactics. Coincidence (finding the cog, the vault door's polite failure) complicates but does not resolve; resolution depends on the narrator's labor and teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: braid diverse voices into harmony as a way to look at one another without flinching. One meaningful tightening occurs when Reza and the nurse reveal their fears and choose to sing together, narrowing the possibility of refusal. However, the escalation is more textural accumulation than a causal squeeze that forecloses options with sharp cost; the dusk resolution (neighbors pause, a child hums) declares victory rather than dramatizing a trade-off or loss that reshapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—creating beauty to awaken suppressed memory and community against the Quiet Diet—is signaled early and tightens through the ritual's steps. One meaningful turn occurs when the seed sprouts and Kye moves from fear ("Is this dangerous") to agency ("arranging is how I will refuse him"), crystallizing stance with visible emotional cost (tears as irrigation). The celestial alignment functions as a time constraint, though its mechanics remain decorative rather than tactical. The resolution relies on the seed's stipulated awakening rather than protagonist decision; the chef executes a faithful recipe without a trade-off that narrows live options. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens but lacks a second reversal or tactical pivot that would elevate escalation into the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: restore the drones to preserve wonder and power the tower. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mara diagnoses the algorithmic failure and the keeper must reveal the riddle, then the coil introduction narrows options decisively. The protagonist's agency (choosing to reveal, mounting the coil) drives the resolution with visible cost: his compulsion to truth and his isolation are the price. The escalation is textural (harp silent → coil wound → drones remember → tower speaks) and coheres under the Accumulative lens. Minor: the firmware-patch coda slightly diffuses the earned causality, though the keeper's closing stance reclaims it.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding why houses feel alive—is signaled early and pursued through the displacement ritual. Pressure accumulates gently as objects are repositioned and the house "softens," but there is no reversal, tightening choice, or moment where the protagonist's agency forecloses a live option with visible cost. The work proceeds without friction; the narrator never faces a trade-off or complication that narrows tactics. Under the Accumulative lens one deepening suffices, but the final "agreement" lacks the felt price or foreclosed path required for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: to welcome nuance into certainty, signaled early and threaded throughout. Escalation under Accumulative lens reads as density increase—revelations cascade, the ampoule passes through the city, statues soften—but no single tightening forces a trade-off or narrows options with visible cost. The protagonist facilitates rather than struggles; the bishop releases the ampoule without friction. Agency is present (threading thoughts, asking, praising) but the final reconfiguration arrives as atmospheric shift rather than a choice that forecloses a path. Pressure coheres but does not force a crystallized stance with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (to capture the texture of a missed opportunity) is signaled in paragraph four and tightens through the proof structure. The protagonist's agency is dramatized in dice rolls, proof-writing, and the final wager with the rupture; each roll narrows options ("spent my life on the chalkboard"). The rupture-seam moment deepens pressure by returning Tuesday's voice, forcing the theorem ("desire subjected to recurrence becomes motion without fuel"). The ending crystallizes an Earned Stasis: the protagonist accepts perpetual ascent as the cost of holding texture. Cost is conceptual but legible—the infinite climb forecloses all escape.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: prove strangers remember kindness through tending. One meaningful deepening occurs as Anya records each kindness in the ledger, converting hope into practice. The cost is visible—nightly labor, waiting, methodical faith—but pressure remains static; no live option is foreclosed, no tactic altered by a reversal. The strangers' arrivals feel serendipitous rather than driven by Anya's agency. The final palm-glyph ("keep") crystallizes her stance without a choice that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (rescuing dying arts from erasure) is signaled early and tightens once: the narrator moves from passivity ("waiting felt like erasure") to crossing the waterfall. The crossing forces a concrete cost—timing for dawn, wearing learned-hush coats, carrying rationed bread—and the discovery of the trunk narrows options by providing material that enables the grandmothers to sing and the displaced persons to find "a craft that parented them back." The beekeeper's absence and dwindling wax create situational pressure, though the escalation remains a single deepening rather than multiple reversals. Agency is clear: the narrator gathers the group and reads the spray through the twin lenses.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—"to step beyond fate's design" and bring the sister home—is signaled early and tightens through the yoyo puzzle, the mechanism's assembly, and the sister's outline appearing. The reversal occurs when the narrator realizes "shattering fate is cruder than stepping around it," reframing rescue as rendezvous with visible cost (feeding the stone yearly regrets, living in margins). Agency drives the peak choice: the narrator initiates the reversal, binds the yoyo, and commits to the vigil. The cost is legible in the final image of tools, waiting, and the sister's voice reaching backwards.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—trick fear into revealing its weakness—is signaled early and drives all major moves. Escalation deepens through accumulative pressure: placing the clasp, confessing hidden love, entering the booth, speaking the ringmaster's name. The protagonist's agency (confession as bait, deliberate self-exposure) narrows options and traps fear in its own outline. Cost is visible: shame exposed, the predator drawn close, emotional vulnerability weaponized. The unraveling of fear's shadow and the advisor's dissolution provide a meaningful tightening. Minor friction: the advisor's final unmasking feels more asserted than earned by prior escalation, slightly softening the climactic turn.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—turning the swell's threat into tuned passage—is signaled early. Escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as density increase (mapping, striking, adjusting) rather than narrowing options, and the wave's cooperation ("seemed to" listen, then passes) lacks friction or tradeoff. No moment where the prophet's choice forecloses a path or faces a credible loss; the resolution feels atmospheric rather than earned by agency with on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake: learn the fate of the lost expedition and the teacher. The gate-cracking is the protagonist's agency under pressure, breaking the city's paralysis. The watchers' answer—expedition folded into navigation—tightens the choice: the cartographer cannot retrieve the lost but can honor their paths by reorienting the city. One meaningful turn where knowledge narrows options and forecloses rescue. The cost is legible: "I thank them in shell grammar for the return of what could not return." However, the escalation reads as accumulation (density increase) rather than rising jeopardy, fitting the Accumulative lens but capping urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—rescuing buried names and truths—is signaled early and guides every beat. Pressure accumulates through the cipher work, descent, and ledger discovery, with Tomas's resistance providing situational friction. However, escalation plateaus after the ledgers are hauled up; the neighbors' arrival and the decision to publish unfold without a tightening choice or visible trade-off. The line "mercy or memory" gestures toward moral calculus, but Mara's stance is already fixed, and no on-page cost (risk, sacrifice, forfeiture) is dramatized to earn the resolution. One meaningful deepening—exposing the council's detour rather than fire—shapes tactics but does not force a pivot with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving memory against erasure—is signaled early and shapes each beat (note placement, inkwell filling, sealing seams). The piece tightens once when the surveyor finds S.G.'s prior work, validating his method and deepening his commitment to the lineage. No external opposition materializes; pressure accumulates through the water's patient return and the implied futility of preservation. Agency reads as endurance and ritual repetition rather than a foregrounded choice with visible trade-off; the final commitment to becoming "listening notation" reconfigures stance but the cost—what he renounces—remains atmospheric rather than concretely dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake signaled early: trace honest origins in warped records. One meaningful tightening occurs when the narrator discovers the smooth crescent lacks teeth, exposing forgery and implicating the harbor judge. Agency is decision and renunciation—refusing to let rage drive the index, drawing an alternative hypothesis tree, stamping notes with visible cost (methodical restraint forecloses immediate accusation). The blackout as coincidence complicates but does not resolve. Cost is legible: "revenge writes crooked, and crooked writing is another way water wins."

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake is clearly signaled: to fold grief into form and recover the shadow/balance. The narrative tightens once when the protagonist completes the thousand cranes and ascends to the basilica, a choice that forecloses passivity and commits to the ritual. The shadow's return reconfigures the protagonist's understanding (it sought balance, not Lio), a deepening under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible: the torment persists ("still luminous"), and the protagonist accepts perpetual labor ("I will keep making lanterns") rather than closure. Weakness: the middle stretch (gem-polishing, patron interactions, crane-folding) feels iterative without a clear reversal or complication that narrows options before the final ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake signaled early: finding where unused potential pools while navigating survivor trauma. One meaningful tightening occurs when the spectral map reveals the crater-rim pool ("right where the convoy dust once hung like a flag"), forcing the narrator to choose between extraction (grant/board/turbines) and refusal (letting ghosts sleep). Agency is renunciation with visible cost: professional defiance, locked coordinates, and the knowledge that "the institution will hate us by morning." The choice is earned by prior pressure—geode placement, breath monitoring, memory intrusion—and forecloses the institutional path. Under the Accumulative lens, escalation reads as density increase and pattern break: the hunt protocol stalls when personal history floods the readout, reweighting the technical mission into moral calculus.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—decoding the frequency of belonging—is signaled early and tightens when the chip cannot cast letters, only spaces. This single deepening narrows the method and reweights the goal under the Accumulative lens. Agency is shared: the pilot calibrates, the pilgrim stands and turns, together they translate pauses into directions. The cost is conceptual (route marked by blanks, arrival undefined) rather than a trade-off that forecloses a live option. No antagonist; the obstacle is absence itself. Escalation is modest but coherent, sufficient for this length and lens.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is the withheld truth anchoring the narrator's name, signaled early. Pressure tightens when the watch hand seats in the groove, then escalates when the crescent splits to reveal the hair coil linking the narrator to Mara and the master's barter. The final act—writing the letter and committing to stand—is protagonist-driven and forecloses the silence with visible cost ("I would not sell her comfort"). One meaningful deepening occurs; the cost is legible in the refusal to invoice or evade.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (neutral exchange) is signaled early and tightens when Daro refuses, forcing the narrator to hand Neris the ledger and ask for specificity—protagonist agency narrows options and changes tactics on the page. The resolution is earned by the narrator's renunciation of speed ("this parapet holds only neutral weight"), foreclosing a path with visible cost (the young guard's haste denied, future exchanges implicitly harder). One meaningful deepening suffices at this length; the accumulative lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—whether the protagonist will confess and align heart and action—is signaled early and tightens through the paddle crossing. One meaningful deepening: the protagonist moves from rehearsed patience and excuse-hoarding to speaking "words [that] tasted like seawater." Cost is legible in the apology and the visible shift from metronomic regret to "slack load...shift and settle." The backlash-of-regrets motif recurs but remains thematic accent rather than a dramatized obstacle mid-crossing. Agency is protagonist-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—kindle empathy where none remains—is signaled early and held. Pressure tightens at midlake when the sentinel demands confession "not polished, not forgiven, just true," forcing the protagonist to narrate the fire and who slept above the store; the water "bruised bright" in response, a visible cost. The vial-release at the fountain narrows options (no absolution, only repair) and the final image shows people "hands twitching toward strangers' coats," demonstrating the stake's partial fulfillment. Under Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening (confession → vial → release) suffices, though the brother's locked-door gaze and planted headline remain reflective rather than on-page confrontations.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (reforge bond beyond death) is signaled immediately and drives all beats: the narrator must barter with the orchard, inhale spices, and undergo metamorphosis to meet the beloved in a form that can "hear" them. The fox's counsel ("Halfway is a bridge if both sides step") and the beloved's arrival as embers tighten options, forcing the narrator to complete transformation or lose reunion. The reluctant metamorphosis ("my bones protest, heavy with human weather") imposes felt cost—abandoning species—and the final flight scatters "petals into bright futures," reweighting the opening mourning. One clear escalation arc suffices under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—recovering lost time to honor new motherhood—is signaled early and escalates through the card spread (Hourglass covers Cradle, Bridge crosses both), the path lifting, and the act of catching minutes with specific promises. Agency is present: she climbs, unfastens the satchel, speaks to the glade, steps onto the path, makes promises, and pours the minutes onto the cloth. The resolution (tracing the baby's hand, whispering promises) is earned by her willingness to repent and her concrete acts of recovery. One meaningful tightening: the moment the crack aligns and the path opens narrows her options to stepping forward.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—opening the locked dimension without violence—is signaled early and tested when the warhead software argues for impact. The door's resistance forces shadow work with visible cost: confronting "how gently spoken neglect had bruised me" before the seam yields. Escalation reads through Accumulative lens as the narrator layers navigation, confession, and stitching until the threshold opens. The final bargain ("to hold what we could not heal") forecloses triumphalism and commits to ongoing labor, making the cost legible.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—rescuing the boy's mother before the volcano or tide forecloses access—is signaled early and tightens through the celestial low tide window and the fumaroles' "warning drum." Mara's agency assembles the tools (oar, rope, skiff, lightning bugs) in a meaningful convergence, and the "coil of rope fit the jut of rock" narrows options at the rescue beat. However, the neighbors and tools arrive as orchestrated luck rather than earned struggle, and Mara's orchestration is frictionless competence without visible cost or trade-off during the rescue itself. The final coin donation gestures at price but occurs after resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—sparking a silent revolution of permission rather than toppling thrones—is signaled early and coheres under the Accumulative lens. One meaningful tightening occurs when the wheel needs "one bridge across two corroded teeth" and the manuals fail, forcing the protagonist's improvisation with the quill holder. That choice forecloses the tool's original function and alters the city's state, with cost legible in the post-act line "it lived now as a tooth in the wheel." However, escalation remains more textural than causal: the blackout and the companions' arrival feel coincidental rather than pressure-driven, and no visible loss (time, discovery risk, stamina) tightens tactics mid-scene. The ending reweights options—doors "knew how to open," people "discovering their own hands had always been lanterns"—but the path from invention to city-wide light lacks on-page resistance that would drive high-band scores.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: fulfill the promise to return with "a breath to hold the shore in place." The accumulative pressure comes through repeated ritual failures implied by "sometimes a future shows me failing" and the escalating complexity of stone patterns (primes → Fibonacci → triangular lattices → her name in base twelve). The final tightening occurs when "she" appears and they hold the bowl together, forcing the herder's agency into collaborative enactment. Cost is conceptual—becoming "hidden by the math"—rather than viscerally dramatized, and the story does not show a prior failure on the page to anchor the stakes' urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: understanding the cartography of scars (poetic defiance of censorship). The storm and Mara's arrival deepen the vigil, and the final recitation narrows options by making the hidden public. However, the escalation is textural rather than conflict-driven; no live resistance tests Ilya's commitment, and the cost of speaking remains conceptual rather than materially dramatized. One meaningful accumulation under the Accumulative lens, but the final act feels permission-granted rather than a trade-off with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake – delivering the overture-as-peace-protocol – is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. The duel provides one tightening: the courier wants the card without the peace, forcing a test. The protagonist's choice to offer the card "as trust that trusts him back" lacks visible cost; the courier's acceptance comes easily, his "pride steps back" without dramatized internal friction. One meaningful pressure point exists but the resolution feels granted rather than earned, and no live option is visibly foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—forge beauty from anarchy by rebuilding the condemned library—is signaled early and tightens when the patrol car prowls past and the protagonists choose not to stop, foreclosing the compliant path. A second tightening occurs when the neighbor and others join, raising the social cost and widening the gate, which narrows options for retreat. The final sign and the child's question crystallize the new stance with visible community exposure. No antagonist appears on the page to apply direct opposition, and the escalation reads as accumulative deepening rather than reversals, fitting the inferred Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—reuniting with Mara after the quarrel and her train's disappearance—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through discovery (the film reel, the minute hand), passage into the arbor, and the protagonist's act of playing the unfinished prelude. The arbor scene tightens options (the compasses steady, the corridor opens) and the final winding of the broken clock forecloses a path with modest cost (four beats of ticking, then silence). However, the escalation feels more lyrical than urgent; the protagonist's agency in the arbor is somewhat passive (playing, asking, sitting) and the visible price paid for Mara's return is under-dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—protecting cultural memory by planting the seed correctly before monsoon—is signaled early and pursued. Pressure coheres through the timeframe (monsoon approaching), the ridge "counting" the villagers (some leave), and the discovery of the missing reef treaty. One meaningful tightening: learning the treaty and reciting it prevents the tide from "correcting us, sanding our truths smooth." Agency is present (narrator chooses to stay, recites the treaty, marks the audit complete), but the escalation reads procedural—each complication is met with a ritual solution rather than a trade-off that forecloses a live option. Cost is conceptual ("leaving my instruments," "chose to release") rather than viscerally felt. Under the Accumulative lens, the cadence shift at closure is present but soft.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—finding the color of unspoken apologies and voicing regret—is signaled early and pursued through escalating ritual (unwrapping, crushing, cutting, speaking). The pool's glow constitutes one meaningful tightening that narrows options to acceptance. Agency is clear: the narrator performs each step and chooses to release words rather than retrieve Mara. The cost is felt (letting go of control, accepting separation) but remains somewhat abstract; a more visceral trade-off or foreclosed option would lift this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake of adapting to decay escalates through protagonist's agency in assessing damage and planning repair. Under accumulative lens, density increases with patterns like dust maps, and cost is visible in the commitment to gradual change. No coincidental resolutions; escalation is driven by on-page choices.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake of discovering purpose escalates under Accumulative lens through protagonist's agency in retracing the route and interpreting patterns. Cost is unmistakable in the transformation from loss to arrival, with the creation of "Scorched Testament" foreclosing other paths.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes in translating silence escalate through protagonist's agency, with cost legible in performances and the bell scene. Escalation is driven by heat-mapping and emotional shifts, narrowing options meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake of giving rest a permanent address escalates through the undertaker's agency under the Accumulative lens, with a meaningful tightening when he occupies the seam, foreclosing options and paying a cost in embodied effort.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake of survival and community cohesion escalates under accumulative lens through Noor's doubt and Farid's accusation, resolved by Mara's plan braiding their routes. Agency is in shared work, leading to intergenerational support with cost visible in the carried "impatience like fire." One meaningful tightening occurs when the run forces character growth and reaffirms anonymity.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake (finding unused love) escalates under Accumulative/Textural lens through protagonist's agency in breathing changes, deepening to a reweighting with cost in the "ache to flow" becoming light. Pressure coheres via density increase in imagery and cadence shifts, foreclosing options with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake of discovering time's texture escalates under the accumulative lens through density increases, such as the paths braiding with earlier footfalls and the photographs fading faster. Protagonist agency drives tightening, as prizing the halo fragment and setting it down force a trade-off with cost legible in the garden's shiver and the lost details. Pressure coheres until the final reconfiguration reweights options.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake (planting vs. archiving hope) escalates under causal lens through protagonist's agency (decoding, chaining, offering seeds). Cost is legible on-page in the hinge scream and shared climb, forcing a trade-off that reweights options. Pressure coheres and tightens meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (finding the sound of trust breaking) escalates under the Accumulative lens through density increase and protagonist agency (e.g., building the device, confronting the father). Cost is unmistakable in the confrontation, where the device releases a "kindness" that underscores the fracture.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (pressing ear against destiny's door) escalates through the man's hesitation, driven by protagonist agency. The final choice to not act narrows options with visible cost. Pressure tightens meaningfully under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake of creating safe zones escalates under accumulative lens through protagonist's agency in narrating tasks and counting breaths. Cost is visible in the effort and transformation, foreclosing past haste. One meaningful tightening occurs when the bell cools, reweighting options without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.2)
    Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens, from decrypting the cast to calling Kellan and setting the trap. Dominant stake of identity and truth tightens through meaningful turns, with cost visible in the confrontation and the protagonist's shaken hands. The climax forces a trade-off between vulnerability and power, foreclosing old paths.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation is driven by the scribe's agency under the accumulative/textural lens, moving from failed horizons to retelling silence, with cost legible in the booklet shedding flakes. The dominant stake of mapping the night tightens meaningfully, foreclosing options through the oracle's guidance.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation under the accumulative lens is driven by the robot's agency in bowing the violin and tracking loops, deepening the stake of discovering thought origins. Cost is unmistakable in the multiplied chalk flecks and melting violin, foreclosing haste with visible trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal doubt to public truth through protagonist's agency (using lens, displaying doodles), with cost legible in Rell's resignation and the cellist's marking of harm rerouted.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (proving gardens know gardeners) escalates through protagonist agency under the accumulative lens, with cost legible in the Auditor's confusion and maze's lean. Pressure tightens meaningfully through marble placement and ceremonial acts.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes around proving sideways time escalate through Hale's agency, like pulling the lever and adjusting gain, with cost visible in the gentle handling of the gliders. Under the accumulative lens, density increases meaningfully, though the escalation is subtle rather than dramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.4)

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—how to respond to the greenhouse’s damage in a way the community can sustain—arrives early and tightens as the narrator moves from solitary assessment to writing a concrete, resource-bound plan. Escalation is quiet but real: the initial forensic gaze widens into shared responsibility (salvaging the botanist’s data, drafting the report, triaging with her, then opening the space to children) and forces trade-offs (what to save, what to compost, how slowly to rebuild). The price is the relinquishing of both total restoration and cathartic drama in favor of constrained, gradual renewal. The conflict is more philosophical and logistical than perilous, so the pressure never becomes sharp, but it coheres well for this scale and mode.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the meaning behind the arson and deciding what to do with that knowledge—is legible from early on and deepens as she discovers the hidden kiln and her mentor’s secret work. There is one solid tightening when the frost map reveals a missed turn and leads to the concealed door, reweighting the investigation. However, on-page pressure remains relatively low; the smugglers’ threat is mostly retrospective and never directly tests her in the chamber, so options never feel sharply foreclosed. The resolution is earned but more contemplative than pressured, with cost implied rather than actively extracted.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.6)
    The central stake—whether the narrator can transform silence and trauma into sustaining “music”—is established via the ferry vow and steadily deepened. Escalation is quiet but real: private experimentation → community performance → civic responsibility with the school bell, culminating in Sura’s explicitly framed question about sufficiency. Agency operates through endurance and creative choice (designing Unshaken Marvels, composing for survivors, rectifying the bell) rather than confrontation, which fits the mode. The price—ongoing survival with the memory of capsizing and the burden of holding others’ emotions—is legible even if no single decisive external crisis occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the restless drowned can finally be shelved into true rest—is legible early via the undertaker’s history with signals and dead sailors. Pressure escalates coherently: the tapping invades his body, the sea “opens,” and the library’s failure is revealed, culminating in his choice to physically occupy the seam and then undertake the labor of cataloguing Unknown Persons. The cost is conceptual but real: he trades some measure of his own autonomy and safety for the dead’s rest and for the library to hold his “address” as well. A marginally clearer moment of fear or hesitance before the seam-occupation might have sharpened the felt price further.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stakes—feeding people under sanctions while protecting each other through anonymity and mutual trust—are clear and under steady pressure from hunger, watchers, and Noor’s challenge to the elders. The Noor vs. Farid conflict provides an effective tightening, forcing Mara to devise the braided route that tests and reconfigures their positions. The ethical trade-off (safety and trust vs. personal recognition) runs under the whole piece and crystallizes in the anonymous note and the choice to keep it nameless. What keeps this shy of top-tier is that the danger from the watchers never spikes in a specific on-page confrontation; the risk remains atmospheric rather than tested in one sharp, consequential beat.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—discovering where unused love is stored and how to open it—is clear from early on, and the pressure does deepen as the breathing/exposure experiments move from abstraction to encountering the waiting woman and decoding forgiveness. The key tightening comes when the narrator and friend synchronize their breath so the woman can “step in,” and then when the narrator reframes unused love as something that must be spent. However, opposition is almost entirely internal and soft-edged; there’s little risk of failure or meaningful negative outcome beyond continued ache, which keeps tension from fully cresting.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether and how the protagonist can engage time without being trapped by it—is clear and sharpened when the shard retro-activates all prior crossings. Pressure escalates as photographs decay faster and the maze doubles itself, effectively threatening both orientation and memory. The decisive act of placing the shard on the cambium plate forecloses a path (clinging to fixed representations of the past) at real conceptual and emotional cost. The escalation is more contemplative than visceral; it works for a lyric piece but leaves a slight sense that the “trap” itself could have been dramatized with one more concrete constraint or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—getting and deploying seeds before the Collectors can ossify them into archive—is clear and escalates from puzzle-solving to a moral confrontation. Pressure tightens once the Collectors arrive and the chained bench tactic means they must take her or abandon the vault, forcing her explicit stance. Her decision to share and “apprentice” them is an earned resolution that trades control for influence. The only soft spot is that the external opposition yields quickly; their resistance is summarized (“they want to arrest me”) rather than dramatized, slightly muting the sense of real external cost.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—capturing and surviving the sound of trust breaking—threads from the opening through the forge sequence to the father encounter. Escalation is primarily internal and methodological: failed/muddied data, the risk of burning the oilskin promise, then confronting the father with a live device tuned to detect retreat. The cost is subtle but clear: the narrator trades the possibility of comforting rationalization for a precise, cold understanding given audible shape. The only slight limiter is that external consequences remain muted; the piece chooses interior moral pressure over overt reversals, which it executes well but quietly.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether the older self catches the train and potentially lets his mother die—is clear and arrives on the page in time to reweight everything before it. Pressure escalates via the florist’s coded warning, the jar’s humming, the uncanny recognition, and finally the act of listening at the door as the announcement looms. The decision to stay is an explicit forgoing of a path with visible emotional and practical cost. The story is more quietly tense than sharply agonized; a slightly sharper on-page sense of what the man loses by missing the train (beyond implied itinerary) could heighten the conflict band.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—can she truly make and inhabit a “safe zone for inquiry” after past harm—is clear, and it tightens modestly as she moves from solitary ritual to creating an invitation for strangers. Meaningful pressure points include her memory of the hail-like critique, the moment of posing a dangerous question under the new bell, and the generator’s near-failure which she meets with stubborn care. However, tension is almost entirely internal and gentle; there is no sharp reversal or cost that significantly narrows her options beyond the quiet decision to stay and continue. For elite venues, one more concrete on-page test of that ideal, with some visible risk, would deepen the sense of escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—exposing Kellan and claiming ownership of her bruises/identity at potential professional and physical cost—is signaled early and sharpened by the decision to call him in. Pressure escalates from internal panic to tactical preparation (microfilm threaded, rotten boards mapped) to a direct confrontation with a credible chance of bodily harm. The climax turn (letting him cut the projector, stepping into the dark where only she knows the safe path) is clearly the result of her agency rather than luck. The ethical contour—saving him from the fall to avoid becoming “his kind of script” even as she ruins them both—adds a tangible, non-abstract cost.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—how to respond to an “endless night” that threatens the coasts—is clear, and pressure deepens when the oracle insists the map must retell silence rather than mark edges. The key tightening comes when the commander asks if the map leads “out” and is told it leads “through,” forcing an acceptance of endurance over escape. However, the conflict remains primarily conceptual and internal; there’s no sharp on-page test or irreversible choice beyond adopting this new stance. The tension is sustained and thematically apt, but never quite sharpens into a painful trade-off or visible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether JN-3 can understand where thoughts come from without being swallowed by quotas and civic control—accumulates pressure via loops, the violin’s fragility, and the threat of forgetting. The key tightening is the violin cracking when the janitor forgets to listen, concretizing the cost of haste and inattention. Agency shows in bowing the violin despite surveillance and later in deliberately slowing down to recover the note and preserve the instrument. The conflict remains primarily conceptual and quiet; a slightly sharper on-page external consequence could have pushed stakes into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether to preserve a gentler lie or risk rupture via honesty—is clear and sharpened by the revelation of Rell’s substitutions. Pressure escalates as the registrar moves from private discovery to a deliberately public, inescapable showing, forcing Rell (and herself) into a stance. The final mutual, silent admissions and Rell’s offer to lead “unsoftened” tours constitute a visible narrowing of options with ongoing cost. The escalation is more moral and atmospheric than combative, but it remains coherent and does not stall.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the gardener’s relationship with the maze can withstand the regime of measured luck—is clear and tightened by the Auditor’s arrival and accusations of deception. The main escalation is conceptual rather than perilous; social and economic consequences for “cheating” luck remain mostly implied. The kneeling measurement of humidity and discovery of new roots create a satisfying, quiet reversal in his favor. Still, the sense of real risk to the narrator’s livelihood or freedom could be sharpened to heighten tension.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—Hale’s drive to prove sideways time without harming the gliders or violating the station’s ethos—is clear, and the lever operation provides a concrete point of potential overreach. Pressure escalates as the nexus is pinned, the field deepens, and uncanny temporal signatures appear in the flock. However, the conflict remains very gentle: there’s no real sense that Hale might push too far or that the birds are in imminent danger, so his decision to ease back feels like a careful continuation of who he already is rather than a hard-won sacrifice. The story reads as a beautiful, low-intensity ethical calibration rather than a sharp test.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether she will break ritual to avert a hinted disaster—is clear and present throughout. Escalation is well handled: from uneasy listening to deciphered warning to the ticking clock of the conductor’s raised baton and the audible groan of the mezzanine. Her harsh harmonic is a single, potent act of agency that reconfigures everyone’s options and exposes her to reputational risk, even as it saves lives. The only slight limitation is that her personal downside (career/social cost) is gestured at rather than dramatized after the event, keeping the conflict just shy of maximal sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    The central conflict—whether to keep swallowing truth for comfort/reputation or to warn at real social and emotional cost—intensifies steadily. Past failure with Luca and the donors’ expectations load the choice to close the road, while the present convoy and oracle printout focus the external stakes. The weighing of graphite is an excellent deepening turn that reframes guilt into something she can finally act against. The resolution grows from her agency and leaves a visible price: closures, curses, and no absolution, only a more honest model.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether she can exchange a corporate lie for a heavier but truer story of her father—appears early and drives all action. Escalation is subtle but real: from abstract mapping of psychic calls to the concrete risk of turning a long-stuck valve, then physically entering the niche and confronting written proof of “hush paid.” The main reversal is epistemic rather than physical, but the choice to act (turn the wheel, descend) clearly narrows options and forecloses the possibility of remaining in ignorance. The emotional price of that choice is articulated in the closing lines as she walks out “awake in that drowsy alertness,” bearing the burden of what she’s learned.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—how to remain a nonjudgmental steward amid mounting ruin and need—is clear and well sustained, with escalation as the library moves from solitude to hosting a child, then refugees, then structural instability. The key tightening comes when “a crack stitched the ceiling” and the swan wants to open new doors; the narrator’s decision to wait and witness transformation instead of fleeing is a real stance with conceptual cost. Internal and external pressures are nicely braided, but tension remains mostly contemplative rather than visceral, and there is no moment where a concrete alternative is painfully foreclosed on the page. As a result, conflict is resonant but relatively low-temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—creating a safe, inviting home for Felix’s voice—is signaled early and tightened through the eclipse’s ticking clock and Lena’s anxious hope. Escalation is subtle but present: from silence to whispered pitch-matching to the charged “mama,” with the key tightening at the decision to link the first haircut memory to the bowl’s sound. The therapist’s softly adaptive stance becomes an internal pressure, balancing the wish for breakthrough against the risk of forcing. Still, the conflict never quite bites; there’s no significant resistance or reversal on the page beyond initial quietness.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the post-dream world can relearn to listen to itself—is clear, but pressure is mostly atmospheric rather than oppositional. Escalation is present in an accumulative sense: generic wall-memories → named people and specific losses → cosmological “displaced axis” → his bodily alignment and decision to inscribe. The key tightening is when he aligns his spine to the tapestry’s axis and then commits to writing, transforming passive reception into active stewardship. Because there’s little overt friction or visible cost to his choices beyond implied burden, tension feels beautifully textured but low-amplitude.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—whether the island will continue to live on corrosive pretense or step into an open, shared acknowledgment of its “open secrets”—is signaled and pursued. Escalation is subtle but present: from private artifacts (booklet, fortunes) to the assembly in the lighthouse to the blooming of the message and collective exhale. Mei’s agency in designing the gathering and message earns the resolution, but opposition and risk are soft; there’s no explicit on-page pushback or hard alternative path she might have chosen. The emotional cost is there in the knot-untangling exhale, though it’s more conceptual than viscerally pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—preventing the possession from completing—is clear and present early via Ruan’s request to meet “before the possession completes.” Pressure escalates through increasingly pointed rhetorical moves and the demon’s pushback (wind that smells of “receipts and rain,” blue pulsing, chapel taking weight), culminating in a decisive conceptual challenge to ownership and flatness. Ruan’s agency is central; he chooses questions and figures of speech instead of ritual violence, and each formal device (anaphora, chiasmus, antithesis) tightens the net. The cost is mostly on the demon’s side and remains abstract rather than dramatized in bodily or relational consequence, which keeps this just shy of maximal intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—organizing the unhearable into a livable home for time before exhaustion and silence reclaim it—is signaled early and tightened by the climb, the ticking of fatigue, and the deepening cold. Conflict is primarily internal but pressure escalates through increasingly demanding orchestral summoning and bodily cost, with the lake’s cracks and the tower’s trembling ribs marking turns. Her final choice is a quiet but clear renunciation of control: “make the whole score stand and breathe without you forcing breath upon it,” culminating in letting the tones hold her. Stakes remain intimate and abstract, but they are consistently sharpened rather than static.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—escape/transform the cyclical, fractured self-timeline—is signaled early and tightened steadily through increasingly specific tests (retracing the mother’s steps, facing alternate selves, negotiating with the guard). Escalation is more internal than external but real: by the time the tablet “warmed until the runes pulsed,” the only way out is to pay the price of falling and relinquishing his habitual defiance of gravity. The choice to “let gravity adopt me” forecloses a prior identity and mode of survival, with a felt cost. The only slight limitation is that opposition feels more ritualized than resistant; no single test threatens true failure as sharply as it could at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—overcoming emotional numbness for herself and her students—is established early and tightened when we see her students “copy” her deadness. Escalation is internal but real: the ritual with the backward songs and the filament pushes her into palpable vulnerability as grief “walks back to its doorway” and her chest’s pulse starts answering. The decisive reconfiguration is her choice to bring this fragile, newly tuned drum into the classroom, risking mirrored feeling in a space she previously kept flat. Stakes are more textural than dramatic, but they are coherent, specific, and carry an implied ongoing price.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—smuggling out unowned truth from a quarantined zone without being co-opted—is clear and sharpened by the pigeon’s plea and the woman’s brother. Escalation is measured but present: from wary solitude after surveillance to accepting a co-conspirator and committing to a specific, if oblique, plan. Pressure remains mostly conceptual, with no immediate on-page confrontation or irreversible act beyond sending the pigeon back and agreeing to the perimeter strategy. That keeps the felt cost and narrowing of options a shade too abstract for higher stakes scores at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator will continue to defend against scent-triggered grief or confront it—appears early and tightens in a single, clean escalation. Pressure coheres around the timed opening of the violet and the looming possibility that its scent will collide with the vial’s contents; the UV reveal of initials raises the emotional cost. The decisive act of opening the vial is clearly framed as a trade-off: surrendering “practiced caution” in exchange for honest, if painful, mourning. Conflict remains internal and reflective, but it is not static; each technological and sensory beat deepens the dilemma rather than repeating it.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—how to respond to the offer to “smooth the second” at the cost of the map/braid—is clear and sharpened by the narrator’s commitment to layered, ethical engagement. Pressure escalates as the visitors’ bargain moves from map to braid and the prison’s frozen second is directly experienced through the escapee, forcing a choice between an easy purge and a more complex, partial remedy. The narrator’s agency drives the resolution via listening harder, re-knotting the rope, and choosing to trade a poem instead of surrendering his work, with the cost being continued travel “blind again” in some respects. Stakes remain more philosophical and emotional than visceral, but they feel real and consequential within the story’s frame.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether sound and communal story can return in a burned, hushed world—is clear and deepens as the gathering forms, the fire is lit, and they move from improvising around drips to hauling up the bell. Pressure escalates texturally rather than through overt peril, but there is a meaningful tightening when the hush “tightens, then cracks,” and when Mara chooses imperfection as her method of fully unbinding it. The retrieval and hanging of the incomplete bell are concrete actions that alter options for everyone in the harbor. The emotional and moral cost (accepting loss and incompletion instead of longing for what was) is present but remains quiet, which slightly softens the felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—can Liora complete a memorial perfume without drowning in grief, and can the narrator facilitate that without losing detachment—is clear and tightened when the counterfeit courage might either “fracture or ripen.” Escalation comes through the deepening of intimacy and risk: the static link, her confession about “perfected molecules to avoid imperfect mourning,” and the moment belief “kissed doubt and decided to go steady.” The cost is visible in Liora’s tears that “smelled of salt and vetiver” and in the narrator’s admission that what they make “rarely keeps” for them. Pressure is primarily internal and could feel higher if one concrete consequence (professional, relational) were more sharply at stake.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether this quiet project of gratitude can be initiated and sustained—is clear and deepens as they move from private idea to a public gathering. However, opposition is mostly atmospheric and anticipatory (“the tremor of good news that knows the sea can take it back”) rather than embodied, so pressure never tightens into a hard test. The main turn is the decision to institutionalize the ledger and invite others, which is earned but low-friction. The commitment to “restraint and persistence” functions as an ethical choice, yet the on-page price remains mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator will be accepted into this community—is clear and active from the outset. Pressure escalates texturally through the shared search and the risk-laden promise that if they find the tag, the narrator must dedicate a first work. The appearance of the sigil specifically answering their reeds meta-intensifies the emotional cost of either stepping back or stepping in, and the decision to weave and dedicate the bench is a credible, consequential commitment. The conflict remains mostly internal and gentle, so the sense of risk is quiet rather than sharply agonizing, which keeps it just below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether her meddling to birth an echo will warp the city’s rhythm and wake the giant—is signaled early via guild warnings and escalates as she intensifies her interference. The key tightening beats are the deliberate sluice-lift (risking the rhythm), the giant’s twitch (consequence brushing close), and the watcher’s appearance at the end. Agency is strong throughout, but the cost feels mostly postponed (future “clumsy pauses” and the finite span of the giant’s nap) rather than acutely biting on the page. A slightly sharper sense of immediate jeopardy at the giant’s movement or the watcher’s arrival would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—negotiating ambiguous loss by trying to quantify emotion—is clear early and deepens as the ritual elicits an apparition that sits exactly on the life/death boundary. Pressure rises via the orchard’s slowing drip and “numbers wobbl[ing] toward a limit,” culminating in the apparition offering the missing theorem line and forcing a choice of whether to seek proof or embrace partial presence. The resolution (“dovetail grief with practice”) is an earned stance crystallization with a felt price. Conflict remains mostly internal/ritual rather than externally contested, which keeps it just shy of the sharpest tension bands.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.3)
    The stakes are quiet but coherent: can the narrator convert hidden care into a contact that gives Mara something of her father, and at what cost to their anonymity. Pressure escalates from exploratory (following the hum) to targeted (rigging the atlas case) to exposed (stepping out as Mara listens). The outage and early arrival compact the timeframe just enough to feel like a live situation rather than a static vignette. Because the conflict is primarily internal and relational, the cost is more implied than sharply dramatized, keeping this just under the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.2)
    The primary conflict—control vs surrender in running the nursery under relentless storms—is clearly signaled and tightened, especially when the gale threatens to destroy the trellis. Escalation comes through environmental pressure (storm season → gale) and the narrator’s choice to rebuild “by releasing control to water,” culminating in a new operational philosophy. The stakes remain modest in scale (livelihood, ethics of care) but are consistently tied to concrete losses and adaptations (fewer customers, risk to stock, resistance to the father’s bracing imperative). The cost is quiet but unmistakable in the narrator’s ongoing anxiety and conscious renunciation of mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether they can recover a new way to live with water—is clear and escalates from private curiosity to communal tool. The main tightening comes at the cistern discovery: will the brooch’s convergence reveal anything real, and if so, what they will do with it. However, there is little resistance or real risk on the page; once the brooch is found, each step succeeds without significant setback or moral tradeoff. The final choice to publicly paint the map is resonant but comes without a sharp on-page price or tested opposition, keeping pressure in the “strong but gentle” band.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether and how to honor the pilgrim’s promise and the cave’s wish to “magnify everyday magic”—is signaled early and developed with the introduction of the cave pearl and the child’s belief. Pressure meaningfully tightens when the listening shadow reveals its desire for a home; that request complicates what had been an unambiguously benevolent ritual. The narrator’s decision to help the shadow inhabit the vowel is a clear act of agency that resolves the central tension. Still, the conflict remains mostly conceptual and serene; we never fully feel a live, risky alternative path being refused.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.5)
    Conflict is primarily conceptual and communal—how to live after a misread silence—rather than sharply dramatized, but it does escalate: from a mysterious exile to the discovery and reinterpretation of the failed warning. The valve’s fitting and the decision not to sound the trumpet but to listen and document instead function as the key tightening. Stakes remain mostly in the register of meaning and practice, not immediate jeopardy, which keeps pressure gentle. Still, the piece credibly forecloses the old punitive order and commits to a costlier, slower mode of response.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator will genuinely pay with their own truths to enter and use the fortress—is clear and escalates from following arrows to offering increasingly costly memories. The key tightening arrives when the fortress demands “proof of courage” and the narrator responds with specific relational failures, foreclosing the option of remaining a detached mapper. Tension operates largely on an interior, lyrical plane; there is little overt resistance or risk of failure beyond self-betrayal, which keeps the pressure from feeling fully acute. Still, the final act of raising the punch to summon the train reads as an earned stance crystallization with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether to build a space that holds whole, painful truth rather than comforting half-memory—is clear early and tightens decisively when the two “open squares” demand the very memories Lio and the narrator most wish to avoid. Agency is central: choosing to include Lio’s winter of anger and the narrator’s night of abandonment constitutes the story’s real turn and visible cost. External and internal conflicts braid smoothly, with no easy out or magical erasure; the magic only works through confronting the avoided. The only slight limitation is that pressure remains relatively quiet, though it still escalates meaningfully under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—escaping immortality/learning what happens after goodbye—is clear early and tightens steadily as the experiment moves from preparation to active mutiny to the allegiance transfer. The key escalation comes when Mara produces the cancelling twin metal and the narrator chooses to ride that double-cross into a higher-stakes gambit, leading directly to the corridor and release. Internal and external conflicts are well braided, though Mara’s own jeopardy and resistance remain underplayed, softening the sense of contested pressure at the peak. The price paid is legible but felt more strongly on the narrator’s side than on hers.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are clear early—Yusef’s life and the narrator’s ethical ledger—and escalate coherently through the risk of discovery. The main tightening beats are the waiting strategy, the tap signal, the move into the alley, and the sudden shout and police confrontation; each step narrows options and raises potential cost. Resolution depends on the narrator’s active choice to lean into professional habit and paperwork as a shield, not on luck alone, though the officers’ relative ease in waving her on softens the perceived danger slightly. The moral stakes deepen at the end with the exchange of names, but the physical danger could use a slightly sharper on-page bite.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how the narrator can keep time and memory alive in the face of total social silence—is clear and sustained. Pressure deepens through the faltering power, the memory of the last normal evening, and the possibility that “nobody comes,” which foregrounds the emotional cost of continuing. However, there is no substantial reversal or new constraint; the movement is a refinement of stance rather than a heightened choice between sharply competing options. The Earned Stasis still feels earned, but the conflict never quite tightens to a knife-edge.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—how a person without legal existence can preserve erased lives—is clear, and pressure deepens when the poison label links to a dockworker’s father and an amended report that declares “no one harmed officially.” The visit to the clerk’s office is the closest thing to a confrontation, revealing systemic indifference and pushing her toward her off-the-books archive as an Earned Stasis. However, the conflict remains largely internal and atmospheric; there is no strong on-page narrowing of options or explicit trade-off beyond her continued refusal of paperwork. Tension is sustained, but escalation is more tonal than decisively situational.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator can “solve” the universal riddle versus accept a gentler, unresolved relationship to story and regret—is clear and tight. Pressure deepens meaningfully when the compass turns from cosmic questions to the avoided kitchen-table memory, forcing a choice about whether to finally speak the apology. The resolution (speaking it, accepting a non-totalizing answer) is clearly earned and forecloses the fantasy of complete solvability. The conflict is largely interior and quiet, so tension never feels sharp-edged or dangerous, which slightly reduces impact for an elite market.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.3)
    The central stake—steering the city’s economic and symbolic current away from gentrifier control—is legible early and tightens through the conflicting demands of Guild and Council. The decisive turn is the narrator’s choice to reroute the “glitter current” and then defend that compromise to both Yano and Miri. The ethical calculus between spectacle, safety, and financial survival is clear, though the on-page price (beyond risk and tension) could be sharpened. Escalation is more moral and strategic than dramatic, but it coheres and deepens under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—the race to capture a last unbranded dawn before corporate mirrors bloom—is clear early and coherently tightened by the dawn’s approach, the vial’s warming, and the consortium’s countdown. Internal and external pressures interweave: grief and mentor’s message sharpen, rather than compete with, the timing and framing of the final shot. The key tightening is the mentor’s imperative (“Take it, now, before the billboards teach your eyes new names for light”), which forces the narrator into a single, irrevocable action. Escalation remains quiet and lyric rather than sharply reversed, which suits the piece but slightly softens sense of overt trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake (recover the crate before the ship’s maiden departure) is legible and the patch-and-search sequence provides a gentle tightening. Yet tension remains low; there’s no genuine reversal, near-miss, or hard trade-off, and each step succeeds with modest friction. Internal and external conflicts are well-aligned in concept (listening vs. noise), but the on-page pressure never truly forces Mara to pay a visible price or foreclose a meaningful alternative. The story reads as a beautifully rendered, low-conflict success rather than a genuinely tested outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stakes are epistemic and existential rather than survivalist: proving an implausible hydrological truth, honoring a bargain with stillness, and risking solitude in belief. Pressure escalates appropriately for a quiet story—from uneasy waiting, to the tense crossing on uncracked ice, to kneeling at the under-ice pupil and tasting the source—but there is little sense of urgent jeopardy beyond atmosphere. The key tightening is the decision to trust the condensation/compass argument and physically commit to the ice, which narrows options and commits the narrator to consequence. The ending’s cost is mostly conceptual (future disbelief, living with a destabilized atlas) rather than dramatized through a concrete sacrifice or irrevocable loss on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether shared rhythm can reanimate and rebalance a broken city—is clear early and deepens as the walking begins to alter the environment. Escalation is primarily textural rather than confrontational: the silence intensifies, then stones shift, then structures right themselves, and social divides soften as rivals stand side by side. The boy’s disruptive stamping and the crack it causes provide the one explicit complication, elegantly resolved through the tuner’s gentle recalibration. Because opposition remains minimal and relatively easily harmonized, the pressure is strong but not razor-edged.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stakes (survival vs. fulfilling the mission of retrieving and using the vial) are clear early and escalate convincingly through the net entanglement and oxygen countdown. The crucial tightening comes when the narrator chooses to stop fighting the net, sacrificing speed and the instinct to ascend in favor of calm unsnarling and, later, turning down their oxygen to stabilize the “fragile bridge.” Internal and external pressures interlock well, and the wave of hush broadcast becomes a meaningful, if quiet, climax. The only limiter is that consequences after the risk are more conceptual than concretely dramatized on the narrator’s body, keeping the cost just short of harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—rescuing the missing and refusing his inherited pattern of false alarms—is established and coheres, with a clear tightening as he commits to following the hush into the island’s depths. Escalation is primarily conceptual rather than peril-driven: the realization that “truth takes work, and the lazy truth takes people when tired” raises the cost of inaction or of reverting to easy alarm. His agency at the climax (speaking his path, using lattice + light) directly produces the partial restoration of the missing. Some stakes, like “before they find the bodies,” remain more atmospheric than concretely pressing on moment-to-moment choices, which keeps tension slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether and how the narrator can atone for a past-life betrayal while coaxing life in an impossible season—is signaled early and steadily tightened as the ghost demands confession and the speaking of the shared name. Escalation is internal but real: from watchful routine to being haunted, to accepting instruction, to re-opening the old wound in order to bind the orchard. The price is an ongoing, self-imposed servitude to the debt and to the trees, along with the risk of “failing her twice,” though concrete external consequences remain implicit. Within a lyric frame, the conflict feels coherent and resolves in an earned stance rather than a neat fix.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—finding a new path from communal ruin to reverence—is clear and present from early on, and the journey into the labyrinth deepens it meaningfully. The key tightening is the seam-opening and entrance into the older chalked chamber, where the protagonist must improvise a new ritual (the embossed book) rather than rely on precedent. However, opposition is gentle: the stone asks only for attention, and there’s little sense of what happens if she fails beyond a diffuse continuation of grief. As a result, escalation feels more like a steady unveiling than a pressure-cooker, keeping this in strong rather than top-tier territory.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.2)
    The primary stake—can she rebuild a relationship to time/faith/ancestry after exile—is clear and present from early on. Pressure escalates quietly but distinctly through the search for the gnomon, the reconstructive labor, and the decision to bake bread by the old timing, which tests whether this restoration changes anything. The key tightening is the reconstruction scene where the fragments are “stitched” together and the gnomon clicks into place, after which bones and bread are both reinterpreted. The cost is internal and conceptual (abandoning the safe story of lost faith as a mislaid heirloom), which fits the lyric mode but keeps the stakes more contemplative than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—getting Mira’s words safely past an invasive postal system—is clear, and the pressure coheres around that. Escalation arrives primarily through a deepening of knowledge (Oona’s margin warning, the scanners’ focus on edges) rather than sharp reversals, which fits the lyric mode but keeps tension relatively gentle. The meaningful tightening is the realization that habitual margins betray senders, driving the choice to redesign both chalk code and envelope layout. However, risk remains abstract; we never glimpse concrete consequences of failure or feel the danger close in beyond implication.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the coup’s perfectly-timed certainty can be disrupted—is clear, and tension escalates from pattern recognition to experimental intervention to on-page consequences (wrong bells, foiled gatehouse maneuver). Her agency directly drives the key turn: she chooses quiet sabotage over exposure. However, pressure remains mostly atmospheric; no character on the opposing side ever pushes back in the moment, and her personal risk is more implied than acutely felt. The conflict is intellectually and thematically rich, but slightly under-embodied as danger.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she will continue to flee the pain of that hospital-room moment or finally stay present—is established early (“I am here to find the moment before deciding”) and tightened through the ritual’s terms (witness without demanding change). Pressure escalates from atmospheric unease to a precise ethical/emotional crux when the hospital hallway reappears and the doorframe becomes both literal exit and symbolic escape route. Her choice to endure the discomfort, grounded in the splinter and in her brother’s stirring, forecloses the prior avoidance pattern with tangible cost but without melodramatic theatrics. The conflict remains internal yet never static; wants (relief via smoking) and needs (apology/presence) grind effectively against each other.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—Sifa’s future custody and safety, negotiated through his own coded wishes—is established early and tightens as the narrator realizes the cast contains a deliberate map and plea. Escalation is more ethical and interpretive than dramatic, but the pressure coheres: deciphering smudged jokes turns into decoding a survival plan, which then must be translated into a fraught on-page agreement between factions. The cost is palpable in what the narrator withholds and in the risk of misrepresenting the boy’s consent. The only slight limitation is that external jeopardy remains implicit; there’s no explicit threat of immediate violence, which keeps tension a shade more contemplative than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—how to handle fragile, joyful memory—is present early and tightens credibly when the fog begins to bleach the boy and summer, forcing a concrete choice. The protagonist’s agency drives the key turn: deciding not to fight the fog by preserving frames, but to relinquish and “spend” joy instead. Pressure is more contemplative than harrowing, yet it escalates in a clear pattern under the accumulative lens, from playful experimentation to a genuine risk of losing what’s been summoned. The cost is conceptual/emotional rather than dramatic, which fits the piece but keeps tension at a quiet, high-craft level rather than maximal.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake is internal—whether the restorer will hold to curiosity and patience instead of grasping for conclusive answers—and it’s signaled early. Pressure escalates more by deepening pattern than by reversal: nested awakenings, recognition of multiple selves, and the discovered civic diagrams all reweight what “listening” means. The main tightening is the shift from private restoration to realizing the city once “bewitched its own impatience,” which reframes the narrator’s practice as part of a larger ethic. However, the conflict remains low-temperature, with little felt risk that the narrator will genuinely betray their stated goal, so stakes never quite bite as hard as the premise could allow.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether unpriced thought and defiance can survive in a taxed-regime—is present early and escalates meaningfully with the Notice of Arrears and the collectors’ arrival. The shift from quiet subterfuge to a direct encounter in the greenhouse is a strong tightening, and the garden-grammar demonstration is an effective, character-driven response. However, the collectors’ retreat feels almost too easy; there is little on-page loss, sacrifice, or visible narrowing of the protagonists’ future options beyond the ongoing ambient risk. Tension is consistently interesting but never quite bites down.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—achieving a blossom armistice to ease a centuries-long ache—is explicit and consistent, with pressure crystallizing in the Spiral Choir confrontation. Objections from red, white, and thorn (“old winter debts,” fear of losing edges) give the conflict texture and test the poet’s proposal. The escalation is primarily conceptual and emotional rather than dramatic, and the treaty arrives with relatively little cost or failure beat, which slightly softens intensity. Still, the poet’s endurance and the decision to accept un-solved insomnia as the price of ongoing work are credible and thematically aligned.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how she can continue to preserve forgotten names in a world of deserted marvels—remains coherent, and pressure does deepen when the shelves’ new “hunger” manifests and the names seek a home. The meaningful tightening is her choice to leave the chime cracked, sacrificing a “purer tone” for the ability to shelter fragile syllables, which produces a visible trade-off. Additional escalation comes from the influx of remembered marvels needing rooms and light, forcing her to reconfigure the library. Still, tension stays mostly atmospheric rather than sharp; we never quite feel a concrete risk of failure or an alternative path she nearly takes.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—can they rebuild trust and regain access to the sealed room together—is legible from the outset. Pressure escalates through the successive vows, each one forcing the narrator to name a harder truth (“my vanishing,” the boundary between focus and forgetting) and tying that to the magical test of the door. The “click” and later “sigh” of the door provide tangible turns that track their progress and commitment. What keeps this just below top-tier is that all conflict moves in one direction (toward success); there’s no moment where a vow goes wrong or is refused to sharpen the sense of genuine peril.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central conflict—equitable water management between farmers and habitat—comes through clearly and is meaningfully tied to the protagonist’s internal conflict (engineering as compassion). Pressure escalates with the puzzle of the envelope and the need to earn the council’s trust, then culminates in the live test with bats and intake. However, once the code is solved, resistance and cost diminish; the council yields quickly and the trial proceeds without hitch or serious risk. The piece opts for a gentle, almost inevitable-feeling reconciliation rather than sharper trade-offs or visible sacrifice, which limits the sense of hard-won stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator will risk repeating Mara’s fate by sending an untrackable message for Ezra—is clearly signaled and tightened when we learn how a past letter betrayed them. Pressure escalates through Ezra’s fear of “numbers” finding her brother, the narrator’s confession, the commitment to Thimble, and the storm that threatens the bird’s return. The final beat, with Thimble’s gray scuff and the brother’s reply, makes the cost legible: she has recommitted to this dangerous calling and to trust, not merely performed a routine job. The conflict is more internal and quiet than dramatic, so readers hungry for an overt, high-stakes confrontation may find it subdued, but within its lyric mode the escalation is convincing.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether and how to cross the emotionally loaded threshold to re-encounter the father’s design—is established and coherently intensified. Discovery of the logbook and decoding the map steadily narrow options toward confronting the cedar frame. The key turn is the decision to cross and “let the distance step into me,” crystallizing her stance on his departure and on sacred thresholds. Pressure is primarily internal and quiet, but it does escalate meaningfully within this lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator can find a felt sense of belonging with this place—remains clear and is tested by the moment when the generator falters and the city becomes “suddenly unreadable.” That beat is the main escalatory turn, prompting an active response with the feather and a recommitment to listening. However, tension overall is gentle and meditative, with limited sense that real options might be foreclosed or that meaningful harm could occur beyond emotional disappointment. The final stance crystallization is satisfying but comes at relatively low experiential cost.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—balancing preservation of tender stories with keeping paths navigable—is clear and tightened by the realization that total erasure strands travelers. Escalation is primarily conceptual: each new layer (glyphs, negative corridors, sprouting threads) deepens understanding rather than raising palpable danger. The key turn is the narrator’s conjecture about the cave’s motive, which enables the compromise with the bird and cave, but the pressure never quite feels like it might break them or cost them something immediate. The result is a beautiful but relatively low-suspense conflict profile.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake is whether he can reliably conjure authentic wonder through controlled randomness, and the woman embodies the test of that method. Pressure deepens as she steps into the grid, laughs “she did not expect,” and consents to a rule-bound game, culminating in the shared applause square and his relinquishing of the bishop. Still, escalation is gently modulated rather than acute; nothing truly imperils him or her, and no major option is starkly foreclosed. The result is a beautifully tuned mood piece with modest, rather than gripping, stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central stake—whether she can smuggle forbidden memory/affection past an agent of forgetting—is clear and tightens once the clerk appears and invokes enforcement. Escalation is subtle but real: from solitary practice to confrontation, to her risky choice to inscribe herself, to finally inscribing him and altering his mission. The question of whether forgetting can be “gentle” crystallizes the conflict between decree and inner tide, and her answer is embodied in how she dances and writes on him. The main limitation is that external consequences remain potential rather than concretely tested, keeping stakes more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.6)
    The core conflict—saving the atrium from demolition within a modernization push—is clear and the glazier’s non-verbal strategy to influence the harbor master gives it shape. Pressure escalates modestly as the harbor master arrives with proposals and ledger, and the demonstration of light over the ledger creates a meaningful tightening around specific human consequences (the net mender). However, the opposition yields smoothly, with limited sense of risk or true loss if this persuasion failed, keeping the stakes emotionally quieter. The ending holds a charged poise more than a hard-won or sharply costly turn.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—how he lives with his triage choice and what kind of firefighter/teacher he will be—arrives early and stays coherent. Pressure tightens primarily when Mira asks what language he wants to speak, forcing him to articulate a concrete future ethic (teaching rookies, museum exhibits, planting seeds) instead of circling guilt. The emotional cost is clear: he accepts that forgiveness won’t come from the sky but from ongoing, imperfect work. However, escalation is more gentle deepening than sharp reversal; stakes never feel in danger of collapsing, which keeps tension strong but not blistering.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.3)
    The core stake—whether hope can be structurally rebuilt for a wounded community—remains legible and is tested through successive pattern-making attempts, with the altitude gauge tracking real change. Pressure escalates texturally rather than via sharp reversals: first private experimentation, then multi-timeline children’s singing, then the riskier step of inviting neighbors to bring what they’re willing to risk and trade. The decisive tightening is when the narrator includes their own fear as a variable and the community formalizes ongoing gatherings, foreclosing mere solitary tinkering in favor of committed mutual vulnerability. The conflict is consistently gentle and could feel more viscerally fraught, but within the chosen serene mode, the escalation is coherent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—how to bear legacy’s burden in the face of past harm—is signaled early and tightened when the narrator discovers the man her grandmother let drown. Pressure escalates from curiosity to confrontation with an inherited cruelty, and the protagonist’s decision to rechart the echo into a lull is a clear, agency-driven turn. The cost is conceptual and ethical rather than visibly consequential in the outer world, which keeps the conflict intimate but slightly softens its bite. A sharper sense of what the narrator risks (losing fidelity to the family canon, destabilizing the museum’s memory) would intensify stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether possibility can be conjured for a child who’s lost a parent, and by extension for a city gone literal—is clear and sharpened when the painter shows Lio the upriver door. Pressure escalates modestly through the ritual, the crowd’s attention, and the ticking bells, culminating in the bittersweet revelation that what’s offered is potential, not certainty. That said, conflict remains largely one-sided and non-resistant; neither Lio nor the crowd significantly oppose or complicate the painter’s aim. The cost is conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized, keeping tension in a mid-strong rather than high band.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—securing a durable peace at personal moral and professional cost—is clear and tight. Pressure escalates from ceremonial beginnings to the personal naming of the atrocity, forcing the negotiator into a vow that forecloses her future as a negotiator if violence returns. Internal and external conflicts braid well: her guilt becomes the leverage that makes the accord credible. The piece opts for a single deepening rather than multiple reversals, which works at this length but leaves a trace of calmness in the middle stretch.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—whether she will sacrifice leverage/wealth to release water versus managing a controlled mercy—is clear and threads through the scene. Pressure escalates from ritualistic hatching to the temptation of “a drastic thing” (full release) before settling on the nightly-hour compromise, which forecloses a radical path. External pressures (directors, contracts, “ledger has teeth”) are present but mostly off-stage; a slightly sharper on-page sense of immediate consequence could intensify the peak. Still, the ethical trade-off and its cost are legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether the city remains docile under a lullaby of obedience or reclaims its full emotional range—is clear and escalates through one strong tightening: the discovery of the city’s great braid that goes beyond private whispers. Lira’s agency drives every major turn, from attempting the door conventionally to choosing to sacrifice stored confessions and then to unbraid the deeper civic spell. The conflict is primarily structural and ethical rather than combative, and while the late arrival of the guild provides a hint of external opposition, they pose no real obstacle on the page. Increasing visible resistance or risk (personal or institutional) at the moment she alters the braid would deepen the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central stake—whether Aurel’s pursuit of “ethical storytelling” will itself be unethical toward his troupe and audience—is clearly signaled and tightened as he recognizes his failure of consent. Pressure is more moral and interpersonal than suspenseful, but it escalates: from Ferro’s accusation to the risk of launching a show that uses people as experiment, to Aurel’s decision to halt and renegotiate the project’s rules. The new rules (anyone can call pause, puppets can refuse, images can be erased) concretize the conflict and its resolution in specific procedures. The cost is subtle but real: Aurel surrenders unilateral authorship and accepts ongoing vulnerability to audience veto.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator can meaningfully accompany and signal to the last monarch in the face of irreversible loss—is clear and threads the whole piece. Escalation is quiet but real: from preparatory building to the charged visit of the last monarch, to the key choice not to grasp, to tilt the triangle, and then to dismantle the structure rather than freeze it into monument. The cost is conceptual/emotional rather than dramatic: accepting ephemerality and impotence against extinction while continuing the practice. The conflict remains mostly internal and never becomes sharply binary, so pressure is strong but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether she will successfully translate and preserve the names, and whether she can bear the emotional cost—is clearly signaled early and deepens throughout. Pressure escalates through the decoding and rebraiding sequence, especially around the “last braid” where risking error and confronting guilt converge. The story is more meditative than sharply adversarial; there is no strong external antagonist or real possibility of catastrophic failure once the method becomes “clear enough,” which keeps tension from reaching a higher pitch. Still, the internal ethical and emotional stakes, especially around guilt and endurance, provide a credible sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Only will remain bound to an inherited directive or step into co-authorship with the path—is clearly signaled and tightened by the decaying directive and the storm as a soft clock. Escalation is modest but real: from solitary seeking, to the fragile, time-sensitive reading, to leading a group at a literal fork and committing to the leftward, “mercy”-bent choice. The resolution is grounded in protagonist agency: they accept the work of “lift, mend, listen, choose, and choose again.” The main limitation is that conflict stays largely contemplative; the price of the final choice could be more sharply etched on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—achieving a verifiable yet devotional covenant—tightens as his rational methods unlock genuinely uncanny responses from the palace. Escalation is subtle but present: from quiet setup, to the arrow and bronze eyelid, to the niche and animated ash mirror, each step narrows his options and demands greater commitment. His key choice—touching the eyelid with the tile despite “doubts pull[ing] him back”—is clearly motivated and paid off in the ash’s transformation and reconfiguration of his self-image. The constraint is that danger remains existential rather than situational, keeping tension at a contemplative pitch rather than a sharper risk of loss.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central stake—whether Mara will relinquish resentment enough to release a war—is clear early and pressed throughout the dialogue and ritual. Escalation is internal but effective: from skepticism, to visceral reliving of atrocities, to naming hatreds and older reasons, culminating in a morally costly choice to withdraw without the cover of victory. The price (humiliation, loss of the war-identity that sustained her) is legible but presented in a relatively gentle key. The tension is more ethical and emotional than perilous, yet it’s coherent and builds toward the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—reconciling with the runaway dream so it can warm the orchard back to harvest—is signaled early and coherently pursued. Escalation is gentle but real: from repeated attempts, to the third-night manifestation, to the dream’s resistance “like a river cupped in hands,” to Iren’s tactical shift (turning mirrors outward, sacrificing the sextant’s torn index). The protagonist’s agency directly shapes the resolution, and his choice to allow movement/belonging rather than trapping constitutes a meaningful deepening. What’s missing is a sharper sense of what’s at risk if the dream refuses; the threat remains more atmospheric than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stakes are quiet but clear: whether and how to mend in the wake of a breached contract and frayed generational ties. Escalation appears primarily in the repair attempt—each failure (the weeping joint) forces adaptation, culminating in the personal cost of using the daughter’s ribbon. Internal and thematic stakes deepen meaningfully through the kids’ questions and the deciduous vows discussion. However, pressure remains gentle; no option is sharply foreclosed beyond the symbolic sacrifice, so tension never fully tightens into a sharp dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—how to engage with a system of nonlinear inheritance without becoming a self-cataloging trap—is signaled early and tightened through the fruit-choice dilemma and the rule of only one direct question. The narrator’s agency drives escalation: choosing “attention” instead of fruit, then reimagining the cameo’s function turns an apparent either/or (take fruit or refuse) into a riskier third option. The ethical cost is implicit: abandoning a neat personal inheritance in favor of an open, less controllable exchange system. Conflict stays largely internal and intellectual, which slightly mutes visceral tension, but the pressure is coherent and does deepen.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—rescuing the time traveler in a place that punishes unlearned lessons—emerges early and tightens as they descend into more volatile, memory-slick zones. The key pressure point is the realization that the walls are built from the traveler’s unlearned doubts, forcing the narrator to find and script a self-directed apology rather than solve the problem mechanically. The internal pull between leaving her own burdens and honoring the rescue-only ethic adds complexity to the mid-climax moment before she knots the thread and leads him out. While the stakes are quiet, the narrowing of options and necessity of a costly choice are clear.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming forgotten names without being destroyed by the original erasure—is clear and tight. Pressure escalates through the automaton’s conditional demand for the twin, the ship tilting until the twin manifests, and the final requirement to “recapture the night that drowned them, without drowning ourselves.” The decisive tightening is the choice to tell “the worst part together,” which pays a visible emotional cost while preserving them. Stakes remain largely internal and metaphysical, so while they feel sincere, they never quite achieve full visceral urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—resolving a temporal/archival contradiction before rumor hardens—is clear and thematically rich, and there is a meaningful tightening when she realizes the tower has kept two schedules that must be merged. However, the pressure stays largely conceptual; there’s no strong sense that failure will carry felt consequences beyond abstract misrecorded time. Her decisive action with the rope resolves the situation, but the path is relatively smooth, with minimal resistance or visible price paid, which keeps the conflict from fully punching at elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—finding a survivable quiet so maps and travelers endure the resonance storms—is clearly stated and threads through the piece. Escalation comes via deepening: from reading cracks to confronting the “tuned darkness” room and committing to merge the stone’s power with the beings’ hunger. The protagonist’s agency in setting the stone on the drum and refusing to leave until the hush can guide others resolves the stake credibly. Still, the danger remains largely notional; we’re told of crushing storms and erasure, but the present-tense conflict never quite tightens to a felt brink.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—rekindling the beacon to reach others and prove meaning in coincidence—is clear early and tightened when the first light falters and the wheel snags. Pressure escalates through an earned reversal: initial near-success fails, forcing Kera into a deeper, riskier use of her retrocognition to realign the prism “to the old inhale,” and only then does the beam truly take. The external answering flare introduces a new layer of stakes (others exist; she can summon them) and demands a consequential reply. Still, consequences of failure remain somewhat abstract; a more visceral sense of danger, loss, or cost-of-hope would amplify the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant conflict—whether and how to submit her own memories to a collective medium without losing herself—is clear and tightened by her explicit conjecture about placing fear beside joy. Pressure rises through small but meaningful turns: testing the reef for personal accuracy, confronting her hoarding of memory, and finally choosing to unbind fear and offer joy together. The city’s answer (the crack/window) gives a satisfying sense of risk met and rewarded, with the implied price of surrendering some autonomy. The main limitation is that the conflict remains almost entirely interior and contemplative, with relatively low external friction or risk of genuine failure.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—can Lio and Mara create a sky that gives the town a livable relationship to its grief—is clear and continuous. Pressure escalates via the mosaic’s unfolding patterns, the gust that forces Lio to adjust, and the children “counting their breaths,” tightening the need for the display to work tonight. However, risk is mostly emotional and abstract, with no strong sense that failure is a live possibility or that any specific choice might backfire beyond disappointment. The result is a beautifully sustained tension that never quite sharpens into a hard-edged dilemma or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether and how the narrator will answer the stay/leave question and thus alter the relationship—is clear and sustained. Escalation is subtle but real: from fear of the answer “springing like a trap” through the sideways observational tactic to the crystallized answer about not choosing tonight but crossing together. The cost is emotional rather than event-based: both characters accept continued uncertainty in exchange for a more honest, process-respecting bond. The one limitation is that pressure remains largely contemplative, with no external complication to sharpen options further.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—relearning silence so it doesn’t reproduce bunker panic—is signaled early and tightened as she progresses from safer silences to the bunker note. Pressure escalates through the deliberate sequencing and increasing intensity of tastings, with real risk of regression (“walls sprinting inward, my ribs fencing with themselves”) if she takes too much quiet. The decisive move is opening the doll fully and alloying the bunker hush with the gilded one, which forecloses the old avoidance tactic and commits to integration. Stakes remain internal and intimate rather than outwardly perilous, but the emotional cost is clear and on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the operator can reshape a volatile, grief-rattled soundscape into a comforting silence—is clear and escalates when the child’s bell “buckles” the hush and spikes both instruments. His responses (adjusting wind, dimming light, story, counting, route around the glass orchard) form a tightening series of interventions that gradually stabilize the emotional and acoustic field. The cost is subtle but present: he must work delicately within an inherently fragile medium, and the mother’s release feels like something hard-won rather than given. The conflict stays mostly internal and atmospheric, so while tension is finely sustained, it never quite reaches the sharper edge that would justify a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—claim the throne as stewardship before algorithms do—is clearly signaled and present throughout, with the countdown and sunrise deadline adding situational pressure. Escalation is primarily accumulative: each tree, mural, and coordinate tightens focus toward the oldest trunk and root-room, and the climb through the trunk into the waterfall’s throat is a satisfying deepening. However, opposition is largely conceptual rather than dramatized; the threatening algorithms never manifest, and no step of the journey seriously risks failure or forces a painful tradeoff beyond time pressure. The final choice to accept stewardship is thematically weighty but almost frictionless on the page, keeping the conflict band strong but short of elite.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—can the suffocating figure learn to breathe without destroying the Keeper—emerges early and tightens through the breathing exercise. The main escalation is internal but clear: from knock, to failed/stuttering attempts at breath, to a tremor that breaks into a new sound and the hand falling from the scar. The Keeper’s refusal to re-open old bridges while still helping constitutes a real cost and limits their options. The conflict stays mostly one-note (no sharp reversal beyond the breathing breakthrough), but for this length and mode it remains sufficiently pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator will submit to and repurpose pressure without reproducing exploitation—is clear and tightens once when they impulsively volunteer for the chamber. External risk (being the test subject under improvised pressure tech) interweaves with internal risk (recommitting to an anti-pyramid ethic, possibly for others’ profit). The escalation beat inside the chamber, with gauges rising and the need to finish the spoken promise before easing off pressure, is well-judged for this length. The conflict resolves through endurance and redefinition rather than dramatic reversal, but the price—accepting a gentler, slower, less lucrative path and giving the bead to the workers fund—is concrete enough.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the buried truth of why the dynasty ended and what role the narrator really played—is clear and active from the outset. Escalation comes through deepening revelations: grandmother’s encoded refusal, the inverted crest, the father’s note, all of which narrow the narrator’s interpretive options and force a new stance. The conflict is mostly internal and interpretive rather than oppositional, so pressure feels subdued; there’s little in the way of visibly foreclosed alternative actions beyond emotional realignment. Nonetheless, the final choice to embrace listening instead of reclaiming or contesting power is an earned tightening with a credible cost of renounced ambition/status.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether he remains a sealed-off war relic or consents to become a caretaker of possibility—is present early and tightens as the orchard offers him progressively more binding invitations (the pledge, the strings map, the pears’ hum). His agency drives the main turns: unsnapping armor, following the forgotten patterns, stepping into the selected “lens,” and finally vowing to tend what may be. The tension remains largely internal and contemplative, so while escalation is real, it never feels sharply perilous, which modestly limits peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant conflict—whether to remain a neutral preserver or intervene by returning the button—is clear and escalates as more intimate artifacts appear (coat photo, Alvarez’s history, “be warm”). The archivist’s eventual decision to treat the act as a “return” rather than a “gift” is an ethically charged stance that forecloses inaction. Stakes are emotionally and morally grounded rather than plot-heavy, appropriate to the mode, but they never quite reach a knife-edge of risk or consequence. The escalation is effective yet remains muted enough to fall short of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes—preventing the erasure of people and histories—are established early and escalated concretely when the contact is found bound near revision squads actively “cutting us from the records.” Jessa’s interventions with the key and wiring under increasing pressure drive the major turns, culminating in a risky, irreversible act (breaking the ground plate) that transforms the situation. The cost is more communal and conceptual than personal; she and the contact escape without visible individual loss, which slightly softens the felt price. Nonetheless, pressure stays coherent and tightens appropriately for the scale.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—preventing a coded prophecy from destroying town, river, and child—is clearly signaled and coherently resisted through his chosen method of silence. Pressure escalates as the code “implicates me by name” and tries to pry open the hush, prompting increasingly pure, costly absence rather than notes. His resolution to keep returning, unpraised, reads as a genuine narrowing of options and acceptance of burden. The conflict stays somewhat abstract and meditative, with less visceral jeopardy than the declared stakes might support, which trims a bit of edge from the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—interpreting the arbor correctly to protect its balance and the villages while preserving Fen’s identity as an order-keeper—is signaled early and coherently escalated. The Moonstone’s new grammar raises both potential insight and danger, and the folklore about misreading phrases adds ethical pressure. The decisive tightening comes when the decoded phrase contradicts his lifelong storing impulse, forcing a concrete, potentially catastrophic act (emptying all seeds). The conflict remains slightly more conceptual than visceral, but the cost is still legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake is the narrator’s stance toward uncertainty: cling to old deterministic fixing or accept a role in a probabilistic, living system of time. Escalation is gentle but present: curiosity with the compass → physical risk in the cistern and cavern → the high-stakes decision to join the rose to the machine and then to leave it behind. The pressure is mostly internal and philosophical; physical danger (the ledge, the descent) is evocative but never quite feels like it might cost him dearly. The resolution is clearly earned, though one more concrete, on-page brush with loss or failure at the machine could sharpen the sense of price.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—how to “redeem” Mira without lying about weight—is clear early when the father presses the coin into the narrator’s palm. Pressure escalates as the narrator questions their own past choices (“What if I misnamed her wildness…”) and commits to a method of honest, visible repair, foreclosing the easier path of false consolation. The decision to present an imperfect disc and accept the father’s hatred is a clear narrowing of options with visible emotional cost. The conflict remains primarily internal and lyric rather than overtly dramatic, but within that mode it tightens convincingly.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator can coax this wounded, wary laugh into a healing role—is signaled early and escalates as he detunes further, summons more painful confessions, and finally risks his deepest guilt. The key tightening is his decision to “share my worst memory first,” which forces a moral cost and unlocks the laugh’s approach. Conflict is primarily internal/ethical but coherently externalized via the gorge, drowners, and the elusive laugh. The only limit is that tension stays low-simmer rather than sharply spiking; pressure is steady and meaningful but never quite harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator can reconfigure their relation to past harm via this engineered penance—is signaled early and tightened by each triggered memory beat. Escalation is textural: sensory cues provoke harsher flashbacks (mask strap, camera/beetle, the night of naming), forcing the narrator to test their “theorem” in real time. The key narrowing occurs at the pool and strap: will they reenact the chair or set a new boundary. The cost is more internal than external, but the renunciation is clear and not easily reversible.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator can truly surface and honor the market’s hidden histories—intensifies from initial intention to the concrete acts of voicing names and opening the painted door. Pressure escalates as the translation moves from paint to an actual room and journal, deepening the moral weight of what is uncovered. The cost remains mostly conceptual/emotional (defying what “the city prefers forgetting,” accepting the burden of memory) rather than sharply dramatized as immediate danger or loss, which keeps the conflict relatively quiet. Still, the decision to leave the painting as a communal map rather than a private artifact reads as an earned, narrowing choice.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator will expose and unwind what the ceiling hides for the ghosts—is clear early via the girl’s request and tightens with each mechanical discovery. Escalation is structurally sound: a single secret hatch becomes a whole grift apparatus, culminating in the risky choice to reverse the barrel and dismantle the system. The ghost watchmaker’s guilt and the sense that these “agreements” bind the dead add ethical pressure, but the narrator never seems in real danger or tempted to walk away, so the conflict remains contemplative rather than truly fraught. The visible cost is conceptual (unmaking a once-powerful machine, accepting that illusions were built into the circus) rather than sharply dramatized loss.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator will risk destabilizing the library’s perfect systems to capture that one eternity-laden moment—is signaled early and tightened when the anomalous whisper appears. The key pressure point is the decision to “loosen the press beyond regulation,” fully aware it could trigger the rupture the Glasswright fears. Internal conflict (grief and regret vs. duty to stability) and external risk (orchard buoyancy and catalog integrity) interlock cleanly. The rupture and remapping register as a real price, even though the world survives, preventing the conflict from feeling purely abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the ancient city is framed as decadent quarry or living conservatory—is clear and present from early on, and it meaningfully tightens when the judge demands “law, not longing” under the approaching storm. Neris’s agency drives the escalation: devising the calibration, choosing how to interpret the shard’s scenes, and explicitly asking for “liberty to reimagine an entire civilization.” The shard’s second tableau (the Ancients debating how to transmit their works) is an effective deepening turn that reconfigures the terms of the dispute. If anything, the external risk feels slightly soft—the judge’s eventual siding with Neris reads almost inevitable once the visions appear—but the ethical stakes and conceptual cost still land.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring dawn without shattering cosmic balance—is clear and tightened by the rust covenant’s doctrine. There is a solid escalation from felt absence of dawn to ethical confrontation (oath vs children) to physical incursion into midnight and direct defiance of the constable. However, obstacles rarely bite hard: the constable is dispatched via one clever maneuver and the covenant yields quickly once morning returns, so visible cost remains low. The conflict is meaningful and thematically rich but could use a sharper loss or consequence to push into higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake is experiential and epistemic: will the narrator reach and withstand the place where explanations fail while keeping faith with her vow. Pressure does escalate: from surface quiet to cave entrance, to discovering the seam, to inserting the needle and entering the inner chamber with an explicit vow and tether. However, the sense of danger or potential loss remains subdued; the cord and “sensible” testing reduce felt risk, so the cost is more conceptual than visceral. Still, the decision to take only one vial and preserve the secret constitutes a credible, if quiet, narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stakes—physical survival in the storm and the internal decision to transform her practice into communal “timewoven work”—are clear and present early. Pressure coheres as she loses GPS guidance, must improvise shelter, and then emerges with a redefined mission. Her agency drives the key turn (choosing to read and enact the slide’s “plans” rather than wait passively). However, the external danger never bites quite hard enough on the page, so escalation feels more meditative than truly narrowing or agonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—how to pursue her art and her question without harm or coercion—is consistent and does tighten as the postcards run out and the work nears completion. Pressure escalates texturally rather than through overt conflict; the key deepening arrives when the question reframes itself at the pavilion and she must choose how to proceed without her prior scaffolds. The cost is quiet but real: she forgoes didactic meaning and external permission in favor of vulnerability and restraint. The only limitation at this level is the almost frictionless path—no strong counter-force ever threatens her goal beyond interior unease.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—how to tell a dangerous, compromised truth—is clear and sharpened by Esteban’s confession about bartering routes and his conditional offer of the key. Escalation is primarily intellectual and ethical, but the diary’s retrocognitive pain and Esteban’s visible guilt keep it from feeling purely abstract. The major tightening comes at the promise to preserve “mercy that had wronged the marchers,” which forecloses a simpler, purist narrative path. A slightly more acute sense of what Mara personally risks (professionally, politically) would heighten the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—can effort and method replace the lethal ease of wishes as the basis of a civilization—is clear and present early. Pressure deepens as the alchemist moves from solitary resolve to concrete, memory-bound planning and then to accepting collaborators without invoking miracle or spectacle. The refusal to pray for rescue in the storm and to name the skiff’s arrival as magic are quiet but meaningful choices that foreclose easier paths. External opposition is muted and mostly environmental, keeping the conflict slightly abstract and lowering intensity a notch.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether to bind the coming split or preserve the integrity of the emotional archive—is introduced clearly and sharpened by the prophecy naming him “the knife.” Pressure escalates as the shaving’s noise coheres into a phrase, then becomes a personal, time-bound choice once the tree confirms the dilemma. The final decision forecloses the path of intervention and accepts the risk of damage to a future vow in exchange for preserving legible feeling. Stakes remain largely ethical and conceptual, but they are rendered concrete enough through craft to carry weight at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—reopening the seed doors and accepting the attached inheritance—is signaled early and carried through. Escalation occurs as the ritual deepens: the narrator’s song alone fails to be enough, the hatchling joins, the ark demands a vow, and only then do the locks yield. The cost is conceptual and vocational (vow, spent cap, commitment to “keep turning the wind”) rather than sharply dramatized jeopardy, which keeps tension textured but relatively gentle. The conflict remains coherent and thematically rich, just shy of the sharper trade-offs or losses that would push it into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—safety through listening vs. safety through audible alarms—is clearly signaled and tightens as zero hour approaches and the shear lines gather. Pressure escalates in a quiet but legible way: the repaired sensor reading, the prediction of a split downdraft, and the texted insistence on the scheduled test all converge on the switch-throwing moment. The renunciation of the siren blast in favor of mufflers and whisper alerts is a real narrowing of options with conceptual and implied institutional cost. The only limit is that opposition remains largely atmospheric and bureaucratic rather than embodied in a second on-page agent, keeping stakes slightly more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether this overlooked, tenderly held station (and its mode of attention) survives—is signaled clearly when the decommission crew arrives. The internal conflict (whether to stay hidden in private ritual or risk exposing it) tightens into the choice to share the glass and open the shutters, and that act drives the outcome. The meteor storm’s escalation provides a clear intensification, and the temporary “season” reprieve keeps some pressure alive. The ease with which the crew is won over slightly softens the sense of price paid, keeping this just below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the broken covenant and its unspeakable weight can be reconfigured without repeating the past’s destructive “speaking in fear”—is clear and resolved. Pressure escalates through deepening understanding rather than overt opposition: finding the box, realizing the covenant’s nature, then choosing a nonverbal, bodily way to retie it. However, there is little on-page resistance or risk of failure beyond conceptual dread; everything proceeds with a calm inevitability that softens tension. The cost (taking on the burden of unspoken weight) is real but felt more in idea than in a sharply pressured moment.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—how to live with borrowed/warped time and its debts—is clear and does deepen when the ribbon reveals that payment is required. Escalation is mostly conceptual rather than dramatic, culminating in the decision to release the coins and risk whatever that loss entails. However, conflict remains relatively low-friction; the protagonist never seriously contemplates refusal or an alternative path, so trade-offs feel a bit too easy. The piece succeeds as quiet pressure but doesn’t fully test the narrator’s commitment on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether the moment of fracture (the broken kite) will become a wound or a transformed joy—is clear and sharpened by the string’s snap. Pressure escalates gently but decisively at that break, which forces the narrator to act in line with their philosophy rather than merely observe. The repair method (“We will not repair it like a clock… we will tend its unruliness”) entwines external and internal stakes, and the uneven-but-alive flight is a credible, paid-for outcome. The conflict is more emotional and conceptual than perilous, which limits intensity but suits the piece’s scale.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the caretaker can forge a respectful, reciprocal relationship between species before she dies—is clearly signaled and deepens as she discovers the chamber and formulates her pact. Escalation is quiet but present: from routine tending to architectural unlocking to proposing terms to the pillars themselves. However, opposition remains largely atmospheric, and few options are visibly foreclosed; the danger or possible refusal by the island is gestured at rather than tested, so tension stays more meditative than taut.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator can reconcile skepticism with a chemically grounded sense of homecoming in the context of alien contact—is clear and threads the piece. Pressure deepens through each experimental escalation (amber mist, bell rope with vials, data convergence) and the risk of empty ritual versus honest evidence. However, the conflict remains largely conceptual and gently paced; there’s little sense that anything vital could be lost beyond an abstract epistemic failure. The ending provides a satisfying stance crystallization but not a sharply felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring a genuine, lived concord where war and reef-collapse erased the prior one—is clear from early on. Pressure escalates quietly rather than through sharp reversals, deepening when the veteran appears and the abstract mission becomes a specific interpersonal act tied to past harm. The story never presents a real possibility of abandoning the task or failing publicly, so tension is more spiritual than situational. For a top-tier venue, the conflict feels a fraction too static, even though the accumulative structure is thematically apt.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are clear and well braided: finding the brother (or at least his message) and securing water for the community, both anchored early and paid off late. Pressure escalates as each riddle demands a new interpretive leap and concrete action, culminating in turning the spindle and literally listening for water under iron. However, the protagonist’s path is relatively unopposed—solutions arrive smoothly, with little risk of failure or meaningful trade-off beyond time and emotional vulnerability. The final “choice” to answer with “Listening” is thematically beautiful but not strongly contested by an alternative, so the climax feels more like revelation than a pressured decision.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether this “failed” array will be abandoned or re-understood—is clear, and the piece escalates from passive observation (smear) to active recalibration (aiming the lens at the valley, broadcasting results). Internal and external conflicts intertwine in her decision to act without institutional sanction. However, opposition is mostly off-stage, and her actions feel low-risk in the moment, so pressure tightens intellectually rather than viscerally. The cost is real but quiet (isolation, professional exile), keeping the conflict strong but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—amending an ancient vow and testing whether they can truly “embrace the unknown”—is evident early and steadily tightened through trials: the chess exchanges, the mirror-room crisis, Kestrel’s thorny confession, and the demand for a personal secret to amend the covenant. Each turn asks for more vulnerability, culminating in the narrator sacrificing a cherished teaching to reweight time itself. The moral/psychic cost is clear but the consequences of outright failure remain somewhat abstract, slightly softening perceived pressure. Even so, escalation reads coherent and earned under the hybrid lens.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator will move from hollow rehearsal to a meaningful role in preserving the city’s living memory—is clear and tightened by the Custodian’s demands and the rule-bound space. Escalation is mostly internal but legible: initial listening → initiation into walking-grammar → temptation to perform vs. pruning → decision to unbind the cord and actively inscribe LISTEN/STAY/MEND. The price is subtle but present in renouncing performative scripts and taking on the weight of others’ grief. Pressure could be sharpened slightly with one more explicit moment where refusing the role or misusing it carries a visible risk.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—transforming a painful, toothy memory into a livable concept of home—is clear early and tightens as the protagonist moves from gate, to stone, to feather-reading, to offering. Escalation is largely internal and conceptual but real: from needing entry, to facing the cost question, to being warned that “meaning bites,” to surrendering an offering “not made of memory.” The decisive pressure point is the choice to place the seed of breath and accept the new practice of seeding thresholds with welcome, effectively renouncing the prior pattern of hiding. The only limiter is that conflict is almost entirely lyric-internal; there’s little overt resistance beyond the conceptual warnings, so tension stays more meditative than sharply agonistic.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.8)
    The core stakes—freeing the village and confronting his own complicity—are clear early and tighten meaningfully when he realizes the final knot must link to his own wrist. External conflict (undoing the hush without harming people) and internal conflict (clinging to self-hatred vs. risking forgiveness) are tightly interwoven. His agency drives every escalation; each thread he chooses to knot or loosen tests his evolving ethic, culminating in the self-forgiveness trade-off. Stakes are more moral/psychic than perilous, but the felt cost is strong for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the community will submit another “single story” confession or force a plural truth—is clear and escalates from private grief to collective action. The turn from playful secret verse to an organized, echo-braided public confrontation is a meaningful tightening rooted in the protagonist’s agency. Stakes are morally and socially weighty, but the on-page price at the climax is mostly risk and fear rather than a visible loss or irreversible consequence. That slight softness of concrete cost at the end keeps the pressure just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central conflict—can he restore the stormwheel/engine before acid erodes everything, and can he forge meaning rather than merely find it—intensifies through clear stages: deciphering the statue, discovering the fissure, and deciding what material and intention to pour into it. Escalation is most tangible at the moment he locates the crack and realizes tin is inadequate, forcing him to pay with his mentor’s charm. Stakes remain mostly personal and conceptual rather than viscerally urgent, but the piece does show a narrowing of options and a visible trade-off. Pressure is coherent and sufficient for this length, though a bit more on-page sense of imminent failure could push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—can he fulfill his hidden promise and find a bearable form of “temporary eternity”?—is clear and present early via the mirror-as-deadline. Pressure escalates through the journey, the flooded split, and the act of painting and then relinquishing the canvas to the tide, but all at a contemplative, low-friction register. The key tightening is his decision to leave the work to be judged or erased by the sea, which forecloses the path of safe preservation. Emotional cost is acknowledged but felt more as serene acceptance than as a hard-won, high-friction tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—Mara’s safe return and the wager on how to call her back—is signaled early and held. Escalation is subtle but real, moving from quiet vigilance to a principled refusal of the horn and an active, risky choice to rely on whispers and scent; that philosophical conflict with Alder sharpens the external danger. The arrival of the dark shape, the skiff slowly “unlearning fear,” and the pale, lined face at the lee of the rock give visible payoffs to the earlier tension. Stakes remain intimate and never become brutal, but for this length and mode the tension feels appropriately scaled and resolved through the protagonist’s stance.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—getting Rowan’s convoy safely “home” while bearing the emotional load of their losses—is clear early and tightens naturally after the hydraulics fail. Escalation comes through the physical demand of becoming the “missing motor,” the delicate timing with moon/static, and the convoy’s progress past specific hazards (drowned orchard, sinkholes, harbor). The cost is visible in bodily strain and in the narrator’s refusal to ask about the house, prioritizing others’ grief over personal closure. The conflict is primarily situational and internal rather than adversarial, but it maintains real pressure throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.5)
    The central stake—can they create a space where compulsory truth doesn’t wound—is clear early and threads through every beat. Pressure tightens when the eye proves to soften speech, then again when the courier returns and the narrator must choose between reliance on contraband and building unaided trust. The renunciation of the tool at cost (losing its “shade”) is a strong, character-driven resolution. What holds this just shy of top-tier is that tension remains contemplative rather than viscerally acute at any one moment.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the keeper can successfully interpret and transmit the stranger’s final gesture—is clear and narrows as he commits to more specific tactics (modulating the light, returning nightly, adopting the signal pattern). Pressure escalates in an accumulative way: from curiosity to obligation to ritual collaboration with the dead man. The arrival of the liner and Mira’s silent reply provide a satisfying tightening and visible price (the keeper’s acceptance of his role as in-between). The conflict is intentionally quiet and mostly internal, which fits the piece but keeps perceived stakes modest rather than knife-edge.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will continue drifting in isolation or actively choose a life of connection and responsibility—is clear and coherently tied to the flood situation. Pressure escalates from the minor, interior tension of his promise through the external urgency of the rising creek and the existential choice at the cavern press. His decision to reopen the shop as a refuge and advisory hub is an earned resolution driven by his agency. The cost remains somewhat quiet and interior, with limited on-page friction between competing external obligations, which keeps this just shy of a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether she will confront and mend a war she helped ignite—is clear and tightens as she moves from dreamy unease to literal engagement with the sky’s wound. Escalation is primarily internal and ritualistic, but we do see a meaningful narrowing: the wound “would not close unless she named the fire that had started it,” forcing her to face her wedding/coronation as the source and surrender the circlet. The subsequent descent to the ember grotto to balance the “lungs” is a credible final deepening rather than a reset. The tension remains more solemn than suspenseful, but it’s consistent with the piece’s lyric, high-myth register.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether presence can be given measurable mass without betraying its mystery—is clear and tightens through the laps and the secret-sharing. The main escalation comes when Lio finally whispers their long-held secret, moving from abstract experiment to a concrete emotional risk that allows the reactor to succeed. Stakes remain mostly interior and conceptual; there is no strong counterforce beyond prior “evaporating” numbers and the risk of failure, so pressure is controlled rather than intense. Still, the resolution is earned by their chosen vulnerability and revaluation, which forecloses the option of going back to unmeasured presence.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether and how the narrator will accept the burden of remembering and “keeping the ledger” in the face of their own grave—is clear and tightened through envy, lucid dreaming, and the encounter with past selves. Escalation is primarily internal and accumulative: from disorientation and “feral nostalgia” to an explicit method (jealousy), to a direct council scene, to revising the grave’s silence. The visible “cost” is conceptual and emotional rather than situational; the story leans on resonance over concrete loss, which is apt but slightly soft for the very top band. Still, the final acceptance to be both tomb and mouth forecloses a path of disavowal in a way that feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.5)
    The central stake—can they restore the clepsydra’s function without erasing the midwife’s history and implied failure—is legible from the moment the screw is introduced. Pressure deepens as the narrator hears apology and recent loss in the uneven drip and then must choose a solution that honors both technical and emotional demands. The decisive move (easing, not removing, the screw; adding the bone pin) is a clear act of agency with ethical and emotional weight. The conflict remains quiet and intimate, so its escalation feels more like a deepening than a sharp reversal, but it is sufficient for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—can the narrator complete the runes within a single breath without freezing the tea and failing the rite—is clear early and escalates credibly. The lattice crystallizing from hesitation is an effective midpoint reversal that forces a new tactic (revisiting superstitions) rather than just more effort. Cost is felt in the physical pain of the held breath, the risk of public failure before Elder Nam, and the vulnerability of confronting the hidden question about their stories. The only limiter is that the external consequences of failure remain implied rather than sharply dramatized, keeping stakes intense but intimate.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stakes—whether the narrator can meaningfully atone to Mara and Aunt Lin before the orchard is erased—are clear and present early. Pressure escalates as they begin the risky, improvised ritual and as the ghost’s presence forces the narrator to voice the long-delayed apology. The cost is legible: Mara does not fully forgive, the orchard is still lost, and the narrator’s career and self-concept must fundamentally change. Because the exorcism proceeds without a major on-page setback, the escalation stays emotionally sharp but never quite becomes harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether and how to “unify what language has scattered” before history hardens—is clear but remains largely philosophical, so tension never sharpens into real peril or painful trade-off. Escalation is structured (first, second, third circles; chorus thickens then thins), and the protagonist’s choices to stop counting and to share the book do narrow options toward a unifying stance. However, conflict is almost entirely internal and serene; the “chorus of revisions” offers resistance but not real opposition or risk. The final realization feels earned, but the sense of what might be lost if it failed stays abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the station can truthfully track the shifted water rhythm and what that reveals about time—is clear and coherent throughout. Pressure escalates modestly from “whisper” drift to “eminently peculiar” anomalies, his near-panic, and the decisive tweak of the valve with the key. The internal conflict (clocks as honest about flow but coy about time) entwines with the technical problem, leading to an earned stance of guided acceptance. The emotional and practical costs remain relatively low-key, keeping this just below the strongest band for conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central stake—whether the farm’s network will be treated as a rigid border system or a living gradient—emerges early via the alert and tightens once Mira is revealed as Ren’s sibling and architect of the membranes. The narrator’s key choice not to stop Mira, and later to reconfigure the sensors, is clearly an escalation in conceptual stakes. However, the on-page risk remains relatively soft: investors’ demands and potential repercussions are implied rather than concretely pressing in the scene, so threat and cost feel mostly intellectual. The conflict is rich but quiet, lacking one sharp external consequence that would fully test the new stance.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are primarily relational and ethical—can she use her way of thinking to keep her father alive and reachable without capitulating to his destructive logic—and they’re clearly signaled early. Escalation is subtle but real: from checking whether he’s eaten, to the shock of his handwriting on the map, to the discovery of their childhood code and her urgent decision to go to him now. The main tightening is the recognition that this isn’t abstract grief but an active conversation with him in the present, forcing a choice to act rather than remain in the cocoon of the archive. The resolution, getting him to eat and accepting their “lucid contradictions,” is an earned endurance rather than a clean win, and that cost is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are quiet but coherent: can she keep holding others’ endings while living inside her own chosen estrangement. Pressure escalates texturally: a series of past interventions leads to the present-night pairing where both callers fear that “starting again is treason,” the most explicit and ethically fraught version of her mission. Her agency—asking permission, looping lines, then fading her voice—is a clear, if subtle, choice that narrows options (she foregoes personal involvement to let them risk connection). Because the conflict is mostly internal and situational rather than oppositional, stakes never feel urgent, but they are emotionally legible and scale-appropriate for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether and how the town will renew its covenant with a now-dangerous sea while the narrator carries private grief—is clear and steadily pressured. Escalation is subtle but present: from preparation to speaking old words, through cataloguing proximate changes, to the choice to press the locket into the ledger and then close it “to preserve the weight of small moments.” The final renunciation (she cannot write the woman back, only the “ache she made useful”) forecloses a path with an evident emotional cost and ties directly into her sense of duty. The conflict stays mostly internal and textural, so the pressure never becomes sharply adversarial, but it coheres and tightens appropriately for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—transforming scattered crisis survivors into a community that counters loneliness—is clear and advanced, but the pressure remains gentle and mostly unopposed. The main tightening is the escalation from abstract rumor to a literal queue of people answering each other’s unspoken sadness, which reweights the social stakes. Costs are implied rather than dramatized: Mara’s ongoing partial loneliness and the fragile, thread-based nature of “polite anarchy.” The piece could reach higher if there were one more concrete, risky choice or visible loss on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—finding the stillpoint so he can survive emotional depths—is signaled early and revisited at the clearing. Pressure does deepen through the echo-deer’s warning and the sense that “the stillness could cut,” and his choice to proceed is a mild test of resolve. However, escalation remains mostly tonal and textural; there’s little sense that a genuinely harmful alternative outcome is near. The final gain is clear, but the on-page price and narrowing of options feel gentle rather than bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—how to respond to a dangerous, guilt-inducing alteration of history—is clear and coherently pursued. Escalation is primarily internal: from abstract regret through recognition of the tightened “contingency net” to the decision to seek “a smaller kindness” via the pen rather than another high-stakes edit. The external conflict (shuttle approach and bent docking spine) provides concrete scaffolding but is mostly summarized rather than dramatized moment-to-moment. The cost and narrowing of options are legible, but tension operates more as philosophical pressure than acute peril, keeping this just below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether the protagonist can honor forgotten grief by quietly “disrupting” the regatta—stays legible and coheres with each beat. Escalation is subtle but real: from private planning to recruiting strangers, to a harbor-wide choreography, to the potential clampdown via the police launch, resolved via the emotionally charged “home” signing. The cost is emotional and conceptual rather than catastrophic: exposure of private grief and vulnerability to public view, and a permanent reconfiguration of what “disruption” means for the narrator. For an accumulative, lyric piece, this is a strong and appropriate pressure curve, though it never presses into genuine danger.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—protecting/locating Mira and the archive’s heart vs. the city’s erasure and the narrator’s own destructive methods—is signaled early and escalates through increasingly intimate discoveries (clues in public art → private chamber → literal breath in reels). The key tightening comes when the cipher in Mira’s crossed eyes reads “keep the blaze outside,” forcing a painful re-evaluation of the narrator’s past arson right before the reunion. The resolution, founding Ember Lending and submerging the matches, is an earned stance crystallization that forecloses the option of future “heroic” arson without sentimental absolution. External antagonistic pressure is more implied than dramatized at the end, which slightly softens the sense of on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central stake—reviving connection with Jonah at risk of her own selfhood—is clear and sharpened by the explicit warning that they might “wake neither in flesh but as a chord the garden remembered.” Escalation is driven by her agency: persisting with the abandoned method, consenting to deeper coherence, and choosing to continue despite knowing the cost. Conflict is primarily internal and situational rather than opposed by an antagonist, but the ethical/emotional calculus feels live and tight. A slightly stronger on-page snag (e.g., a moment of nearly pulling back) could intensify the pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—proving the efficacy of whispers while safely guiding a panicked courier under storm conditions—is clear and coherent. Pressure escalates through the failure of shouts, the radios’ degradation, and the need to keep “moving my vents ahead” as she wanders, but the path to success is relatively smooth, with no on-page moment where failure feels imminent. The wager with Otero gives social cost and pride on the line, which helps. A single visible near-miss (wrong turn, obstruction, or vent misfire) could have deepened the sense of narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stakes—recovering the brother without breaking the vow, and coaxing the dark rather than commanding it—are clear and organically seeded. Pressure escalates from the boy’s charged entrance and gesture toward the arch to the use of shutters and star-light as a quiet contest with the canal’s inertia. The key turn is the choice to proceed entirely through ritual and silence instead of direct intervention, culminating in the brother’s emergence and the transference of the mirror to the younger boy. Yet the conflict remains very one-sided; the night “softens” readily and there is little visible price paid beyond sustained effort, which mutes the sense of narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether the town will sacrifice its deep, quiet spaces for development—is clear early in the “future made of glare and parking lots.” Pressure escalates through the planning and execution of the synchronized displays and the visible effect on key power-holders (mayor, council member). The ethical conflict (non-coercive action vs urgency) is there but underplayed; the narrator never faces a truly wrenching choice beyond committing to the plan. As a result, costs are more conceptual and prospective than sharply felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator will cling to old identities and control or surrender to a new, truer role—is clear and escalates through the summons, crossing, encounter, and return. The island’s demand “to argue with my fear until my kindness outlasts it” crystallizes the internal conflict in a way that reweights prior beats. The resolution is earned by the narrator’s choice to ferry songs and teach surrender, with the cost of relinquishing performance and ownership. Stakes could be marginally sharper if a tangible consequence of refusal were more foregrounded, but the emotional and conceptual stakes still read strongly.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central pressure—whether he will perform mandated cheer, resist, or find a third way under inspection—is clear, and the inspector’s arrival tightens that pressure effectively. His choice to conduct a “show about nothing” and answer “faithful” instead of “cheerful” is a credible, ethically charged compromise that forecloses a return to his old role. Stakes remain mostly internal and conceptual rather than concretely risky on the page (the inspector never truly menaces), which keeps tension from fully peaking. Still, conflict is coherent and deepens meaningfully through the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—transforming a formerly violent, exclusionary boundary into a permeable, shared passage—is clear and tightened as the scene progresses from expectation to paraphrase to physical crossing. Escalation is subtle but present: the risk moves from linguistic (reframing the ban) to architectural (altering the colonnade) to physical (stepping onto the ice) to social (inviting custodians to follow and reframe “sacred”). Resolution stems from the poet’s chosen method (paraphrase, softness, listening) rather than coincidence. The main limitation is that danger and loss are primarily conceptual; a sharper sense of potential failure or backlash would heighten felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake is whether beauty and meaning can be reclaimed from failure (Mara’s phoenix, the traveler’s lost music, the child’s cracked prism), and this is signaled early and kept tight. Pressure escalates through the decision not to discard the failed phoenix, culminating in Ilias’s risky choice to embed the reed and effectively make the crack a throat. The phoenix’s song is a clear tightening and turn, forcing the courtyard—and then city—to reinterpret what counts as success. Stakes remain interior and communal rather than catastrophic, but for this scale they’re sharp and the cost (letting go of the “safe year” guarantee) reads.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—can curated listening foster connection in a bruised city?—is clear and threads through planning, skepticism from the director/logistics priest, and the actual opening. Pressure escalates gently via doubts (donors’ desire for a “destination,” the child’s question about forgiveness) and resolves in a choice to measure success by lingering, not spectacle. However, the conflict remains mostly conceptual; there’s little sense of a real alternative path or palpable risk if this fails beyond disappointment. The quietness fits the piece, but a sharper moment of tested commitment would further tighten the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether grief will collapse the narrator’s craft or be transmuted into a shared, sustaining practice—is legible early and tightened through the failed plant and trembling hands. Pressure deepens at the ritual’s apex when the lockets are placed in the beam and everyone waits to see if the seeds respond, tying internal grief to an external, observable outcome. The escalation is quiet but clear: from private rock bottom to risking a communal experiment that could fail, to committing to repeat this work for others. The cost is more conceptual than dramatized loss (ongoing vulnerability and responsibility), which keeps this a notch below maximal intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—how to recover a working sense of meaning and connection after financial belief collapses—is clear and sharpened by the discovery of the “gap… like a mouth” between neighborhoods. Escalation is subtle but real: moving from abstract mapping to targeting that dead zone, to the narrator literally walking the routes and then hosting a risky, untexted gathering. The pressure is more conceptual and communal than visceral, yet the potential failure of the bridge (and the vulnerability of asking others to show up) is legible. A slightly clearer sense of what’s at stake for the narrator personally, if no one came, would make the cost even sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether she will use this forbidden method to hoard or release knowledge—emerges clearly and tightens around the second atom and the archive’s “questions” sharpening into shapes. Her choice to release the purified cages is a true turn that forecloses the path of singular authority and invites danger, and the pagoda’s physical response locks in consequences. Internal and external pressures (guardians, social distrust of elders, future self-misuse) are well braided, though the conflict remains mostly internal and lyric rather than sharply contested. The tension is strong and sufficient for elite short work, if more simmering than jagged.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether this unbound grief-shadow will continue to drift/eat or be rooted in a kinder form—is clear early via the report of an “unreturned dream… eaten by shadows.” Pressure escalates through the discovery that this shadow is tied to an irreplaceable, missing donor, and the investigative turn using the reels meaningfully narrows options. The narrator’s agency in choosing to bind the shadow (rather than banish or ignore it) resolves both external situation and internal mission, with a visible emotional price. The conflict is intentionally low-boil and lyric rather than suspenseful, which slightly softens moment-to-moment tension but suits the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether and how to keep Karim while restoring the sanctuary’s moral integrity—is clear and sharpened by the inspector’s exposure and the donors’ shame. Pressure escalates from the abstract ruin of trust to a concrete decision: firing him versus structuring his atonement, with the animals’ status as non-props explicitly at issue. Her choice to keep him under strict ethical terms forecloses the easier path of excision and aligns with her desire to “be tender toward the future but firm enough that the past did not repeat.” The conflict is quiet and interior-heavy, but it still produces a meaningful tightening and visible ethical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—finding a non-destructive way to achieve closure—is clear early and sharpened when the ivy sets a price: the miracle “is not only yours” and requires a consentful wound. Escalation is internal-ethical rather than external, culminating in the choice to cut the elm and accept a scar that stays open, which forecloses the old, more violent path. The tension is mostly quiet but persistent, with each consultation (fern, coffee, ivy, elm) tightening the moral calculus. The only modest constraint is that physical jeopardy is muted, so pressure remains more contemplative than viscerally tense.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central stake—locating and responsibly handling “unused love”—is clear and present throughout, but the pressure is quiet and conceptual rather than acutely dramatic. Escalation comes via deepening insight rather than reversals: from reading the images, to probing gutters between frames, to the revelation about leader and splices and the decision to physically harvest them. The manager’s anxiety about the building’s “heaviness” provides just enough external urgency to keep this from feeling purely meditative. Still, there’s little sense of an alternative path or significant risk if the attempt failed, which keeps the tension modest.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—liberating the town’s suppressed creativity before it “starved in attics”—is clear and motivated, and there is one meaningful tightening when she steps through the doorway into the deeper night. However, the process of freeing the fledglings proceeds almost entirely without resistance: once she uses the instrument correctly, no real threat, trade-off, or on-page setback challenges her. The cost is mostly retrospective (that thin line of cold, the new obligation), so moment-to-moment tension never quite crests to match the ambition of the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—salvaging and planting future “sparks” at the cost of his own rest and freedom—is clear and tight. Pressure escalates through his approach to the dune, the drawing of the railman’s circle, the archive’s demand for proof, and his decision to place his palm on the clock and let midnight “freeze further inside his veins.” The conflict remains primarily conceptual and spiritual, so tension is more atmospheric than acutely felt, and there is little explicit pushback beyond the archive’s test. Still, his renunciation of dreaming and acceptance of ongoing duty at the end constitute a credible tightening with a lasting price.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator can access and redefine the “wild frontier” of their own mind—is signaled early and tightened by the forest’s rules and the tower’s conditional entry test. Pressure escalates from being passively transported by sleep to actively deciphering sound-currents and then staking success on remembered listening in the tower’s dark, culminating in the mirror’s indictment of self-built fences. The cost is conceptual but legible: relinquishing old protective boundaries and accepting that exclusion of “storms, birds, and strangers” also shrank the self. Conflict stays mostly internal and philosophical; a touch more visceral risk would deepen the sense of jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—recovering the dog without betraying the new leashless paradigm—is clear and consistently pressed. Escalation is quiet but real: from ferry crossing to ridge vigil to reading faint pawprints and finally inviting the dog without chasing, with the tension between panic and patience peaking at the fold. The choice to kneel, let the dog set the pace, and descend “through indirect routes” crystallizes agency and forecloses the old pattern of control. The price is largely internal (surrender of urgency, acceptance of uncertainty), which fits the mode but keeps the pressure in the high-quiet register rather than sharp crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central stake—whether to reinforce or subvert a system that buys safety with silenced testimony—is legible from early on and tightens as the bellhop leads her toward the engine. The primary escalation is the moment she is asked, without words, to contribute her bolt to deepen the hush, forcing her to choose between protection and complicity. Her solution (threading then reversing the bolt, then choosing to remain as a guardian of that hinge) is clearly her agency and forecloses the path of comfortable silence. The cost is mostly ethical and conceptual rather than dramatized via concrete consequences, which keeps this just shy of maximal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central stake—exposing and disempowering the pretender—is clear early and deepens coherently through the cryptic recruitment and the ritual at the mosaic. The decisive act (drawing a line through his title, triggering the rune’s response) properly resolves that stake. However, opposition is largely conceptual; the pretender offers no meaningful resistance and Lys encounters no setback or real risk on the page, so escalation feels elegant rather than pressure-filled. The conflict is beautifully framed but relatively low-friction for this level of ambition.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—making the Pilgrims Trace predictably and safely crossable—emerges early and is maintained to the end. Pressure escalates in an accumulative way: repeated ambiguous openings/closings of the Trace, village worry, and the narrator’s boredom culminate in the nodal insight that materially changes community tactics. The cost is primarily conceptual and communal rather than personal harm; the piece chooses a quiet, solutions-focused resolution over a sharper test of her commitment or a visible loss. This works for the mode but keeps the conflict from feeling fully acute.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—reviving the ferry and lines of communication without shattering the protective quiet—is clearly signaled and coherently pursued. Pressure does deepen as the protagonist wires ancient stones into old engines and begins to broadcast sensitive information, with a meaningful turn when voices answer back and the ship “chooses.” However, external jeopardy (patrols, potential discovery, technical failure) remains mostly atmospheric, so the risk never tightens into a sharp on-page threat. The resolution feels earned but somewhat low-friction, with cost more inferred than viscerally tested.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether the embryo will embody council-approved implanted destiny or some new, consent-based tradition—is legible early and tightens as Mara discovers the script’s obedience clause and chooses to alter it. Pressure escalates through the ritual cycles and the embryo’s emergent voice, culminating in her deliberate intervention in the glyphs before the council arrives. The conflict is largely ideological/internal rather than physically perilous, so the felt price is conceptual and social rather than visceral, but it is credible and consequential for this world. A slightly earlier or more active on-page pushback from the council could have sharpened the external pressure, but what’s here is still strong.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.5)
    The central stake—how to honor both safety and truthful memory versus institutional hunger for drama—is established early via the board’s desired dedication and Samira’s desire to “anchor optimism in realism.” Pressure tightens through the incoming storm, drone flyby, and live resistance from the chair, culminating in the decisive relocation and her choice to show the photo. Stakes remain largely internal and social, but the physical risk from the cliff and the risk of self-exposure make the choice feel consequential. The cost is visible in her defiance of institutional expectations and her partial relinquishing of the photo’s private grip.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stakes—whether she can find a way to see and paint that doesn’t shatter her subjects or herself—are clear and present early (“every canvas inhaled a luminescent ache”). Conflict escalates as she discovers the literal snarl blocking the lighthouse’s beam, forcing a choice between remaining in paralysis and engaging in slow, uncertain repair. Her agency in “untangling threads” functions as the central tightening move, linking external maintenance to internal reorientation and foreclosing a purely avoidant path. The conflict remains primarily internal and conceptual, so the danger to ships and the world beyond her is more implied than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding and harnessing crisis-time to answer the sister’s death—is clear early and tightens as the tracker moves from theory to bodily risk. Escalation tracks through concrete turns: initiating the experiment, crossing the threshold, homing in on the preserved crisis, then choosing to physically intervene in the widened second. The price is legible (relived trauma, potential injury, and the ethical limit of not rewriting events), and the resolution—using the discovery to train others—feels like an earned stance rather than an easy fix. Stakes remain intimate yet consequential, fitting the length.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to keep the treasonous letter sealed or release it and risk scandal—is clear and drives the narrative. Pressure escalates as she goes from discovery to ethical weighing to reviving dead infrastructure, then to actually sending the letter with her name as “a fuse.” The arrival of the silent shadow and the observable ripple through readers (the “shared flinch”) deepen the sense of risk and consequence. Stakes remain primarily ethical and conceptual rather than viscerally concrete, which softens but does not erase the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether she and her father will pursue vengeance or continuity under immediate physical threat—is established early and tightened by the combined pressure of refugees and the incoming storm. The dust line between them, the choice to sheath rather than draw the knife, and the co-operative repair of the dome are all decisive turns that narrow options and make the cost of either path concrete. Internal and external conflicts interlock neatly: philosophy becomes literal survival strategy. Escalation is coherent and sufficient for length, though the abstract off-page mission about the felled tower never quite bites hard enough to feel like a live alternative in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—can he secure the goddess’s echo without being undone by it—is clear and escalates when the note with footsteps appears and “wears his bones like windchimes.” The pressure tightens through the echo’s tests (beloved voices as hooks) and the physical struggle with the net and skiff, and his agency clearly drives the outcome. However, the cost he pays in the moment is more conceptual than felt; we don’t see substantial damage, exhaustion, or moral compromise, which slightly blunts the sense of risk. The conflict remains compelling but never quite feels like he might lose.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether to expose fabrication and risk scandal or collude in a flattering lie—is clear early and stays central. Pressure escalates credibly from suspicion to direct questioning to the high-stakes moment where the technician is about to delete the logs (the cursor “blinks like a fuse”), forcing an immediate, consequential intervention. The narrator’s agency drives all major turns, and the choice to halt the article and publish a confession instead entails reputational and institutional cost. Internal conflict (legacy, donor pressure) and external conflict (Kline, technician, looming article) interlock tightly.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—can the narrator transmute paralyzing guilt into a bearable cadence—is clear early and steadily sharpened by the letters and the re-emergence of the nephew’s cry. Each procedural step increases pressure, especially when the machine articulates layered pleas (“Mama,” “Water,” “Do not leave me in the static”) and the fourth letter demands tattooing the feared name. The final choice to inscribe the nephew’s name and then say “Rest now” reads as an earned, costly stance rather than a free catharsis. Escalation is primarily internal and ritualistic, so tension is deep rather than edge-of-seat, which keeps it just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central stake—finding a way to hold personal “ruins” and noise without erasing them—is signaled early and steadily tightened via the hush rule, the gate in the mandala, and the water that forces everyone to confront avoided “inlets.” Escalation is quiet but real: from tentative silence to collectively standing “where standing hurt,” with the narrator’s choices (where to draw, when to interject) guiding that movement. Cost is present but mostly conceptual and emotional, which fits the design but keeps the tension from feeling truly knife-edge. Still, the shift from chaos to “noise learned to lean” reads as an earned, pressured stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.3)
    The main stake—whether the narrator can protect the people from the patrol’s punitive hunger using their aberrant mercy—is clearly established and tightened by the ticking approach of noon. Escalation is modest but coherent: anticipation → arrival → the high-stakes naming scene where any misstep could trigger violence. The protagonist’s agency directly shapes the outcome by choosing to expose the leader’s past and rename everyone as “ordinary,” foreclosing open resistance in favor of moral judo. The danger feels real, but the patrol’s stand-down comes slightly quickly, with limited visible cost beyond ongoing burden and risk; a hair more resistance or near-failure would deepen the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Rowan will reclaim a sense of possibility—is clear and present from early on, and pressure accumulates as the ghost intervenes, Rowan follows the echo, and the abandoned blueprint resurfaces. The key tightening comes when Rowan explicitly bargains with the orchard to “keep the path tomorrow,” effectively committing to action. However, obstacles are largely atmospheric; the orchard is cooperative, there’s no serious chance that Rowan will refuse once the blueprint appears, and potential external pressures (budgets, city ledger) stay off-stage. As a result, escalation feels emotionally persuasive but somewhat low-friction for elite-conflict standards.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—how to live with a suddenly widened, pill-altered empathy—is clear and pressures choices, from consenting experiments to the decision to ground the room. Escalation is subtle but present: ambient chatter → structured test with Mara’s thoughts → increasingly elaborate “roads” → uncovering a hidden, practical solution (the strap) that changes their condition. Agency drives the key turns (opting in to the somatic system, following the painted path, replying to the recall), and cost is the commitment to a constrained, moderated version of this new sense. The piece remains low-drama, so the threat never feels dangerous in a visceral way, keeping the stakes a notch below maximal.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stakes—whether and how the narrator can ethically translate the “unknown” for sleepers and a damaged planet—are clear and increase as she follows the mapped sorrow into increasingly constrained spaces. Escalation is textural rather than confrontational: narrow passage, intensified emotional mapping, discovery of the larger fossil, and then the decision to use the chord in dream loops. The price is mainly ethical and conceptual (choosing to shape dreams with a partial translation) rather than a sharp on-page sacrifice, which keeps tension more contemplative than urgent. Still, the final act is unmistakably her decision, crystallizing her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether the town will submit to a fatalistic prophecy or reclaim agency—is clear and present from early on. Pressure escalates conceptually as the pattern in the buttons hums, the echo is opened, and the withheld part of the prophecy is uncovered, culminating in the communal turning of hourglasses and the cliff’s response. Yet the conflict is notably gentle: there’s minimal on-page resistance from the town, no moment where the plan seems in jeopardy, and the rain road appears without any real price extracted. The story gains in wonder what it lacks in hard-edged tests of commitment or true trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether she will risk using her burned status to re-enter the game—is clear and thematically rich. There is one meaningful tightening when the contact appears, reveals Mina’s survival, and offers a mission only she can do. Still, opposition is soft: the “watchers” never manifest, the path poses no real hazard, and the radio repair succeeds without friction, so tactics never need to adapt under pressure. The piece leans on internal stakes and atmosphere more than on tested conflict, which slightly blunts escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake — whether and how to reshape an overburdened promise — is signaled early and tightens as the narrator fails to unpick stitches and time passes under the ticking gutters. Pressure escalates through enforced waiting and the coachman’s interventions, culminating in the choice to strip the vow to “stay, and labor beside,” which forecloses the path of endlessly revising history. Internal and external stakes interlock via the ferry crossing, with the potential refusal by the bride and the possibility of the vow “sinking” as genuine risks. The conflict remains quiet and mostly internal, but the narrowing of options is nevertheless clear and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—can the narrator understand and honor how this place resists change?—is clear from the outset and tightened by the discovery that the oasis responds to moral texture rather than mere survival inputs. Escalation is subtle but present: she moves from passive observation to active experiments with kindness, then to leveraging the precise hour when timelines braid closest to act within the oasis’ rules. The cost is conceptual and behavioral: she commits to a discipline of small, future-facing repairs rather than extracting power or answers without responsibility. The relatively low level of overt jeopardy keeps this from feeling more viscerally pressurized, but within a lyric mode the pressure is sufficient and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—can she gently alter a fearful communal space without betraying her guardedness—is clear early and steadily tightened through the padlock, roof navigation, and the delicate adjustment of the mirror net. Escalation is quiet but real: the moment Theo lets go of his mother’s hand and walks into the light is a concrete test of her goal, and the padlock yielding “to the patient angle of the gauge” foregrounds agency over luck. There’s no sharp reversal, but the deepening from private intention to communal effect reads as a meaningful narrowing of options (she is now implicated in their safety and comfort). The cost is subtle yet present in her willingness to invest effort and emotional inheritance in a fragile, rust-prone solution.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator can reconfigure isolation into independence without resurrecting the dead—is clear and grows as the ledger exposes his earlier, colder self. Pressure coheres around accessing and enduring that memory, with the sundial calibration and hum alignment providing a tangible tightening. The key turn is the vow not to “invent new ghosts” and to coexist with absence, foreclosing the path of nostalgic possession and dramatized reunion. Escalation is more deepening than overtly conflictual; one more concrete resistance or failed attempt might have heightened the sense of risk and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator will risk transforming her secret, static longing into a vulnerable, shared act—is signaled early and steadily tightened. The meaningful turn is her choice to build a public spiral instead of sending a direct letter, then to persist as strangers accrete their own confessions, raising emotional cost and visibility. The ex-lover’s arrival escalates pressure into a charged walk through the maze of other people’s words toward the nest; their choice to “tie our own silence” rather than speak is an earned, high-cost endurance. The tension remains largely internal and contemplative, so while effective, it never quite reaches a visceral pinch point.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether the station becomes a divisive weapon or a healing bridge under cosmic manipulation—is signaled early and tightened effectively through the spreading power plays and rumors of license sale/armed occupation. Escalation is clear: trickster signals → community polarization → tactical counter-broadcast → direct institutional pressure (police + provost at the door) during the key maneuver. The narrator’s choice to “interfere not with silence but with form” is an excellent, character-driven pivot that shapes the climax. The quickness with which external pressure dissolves (provost calmed, breakers reset, community talking) slightly softens the sense of lasting cost, keeping the stakes more elegant than punishing.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—recover the “vital key” without violating the city’s autonomy—is well signposted and interwoven with her fear of enclosed space. Tension escalates as she mounts the loft, freezes the square with music, opens the seam, and then lets “the final chord crumble” as the air tightens again. However, the danger remains mostly implied; we never see a true, tangible consequence for failure beyond conceptual unease. The moral/ethical conflict is compelling but the physical or social cost stays relatively soft-focus.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether buried truth and culpability will surface in a town that “learned to look away”—is clear early and deepens coherently. Escalation is quiet but definite: from Lio’s solitary probing to shared manipulation of the pole, to the ribbon snag and memory-bell, to the portrait that forces the captain into a chamber where he cannot maintain his rehearsed story. Internal and external conflicts braid nicely, though Lio’s personal risk (beyond moral/empathetic cost) remains somewhat abstract. The climax and aftermath still register as a real narrowing of options for the captain and a costly stance for Lio.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—knowledge in exchange for a reversible exile, intertwined with honoring Seraphine—is clear from early on, and pressure escalates from decoding in safety to physically retrieving hidden samples to facing institutional judgment. The midpoint discovery of the intake and vials provides a solid tightening of external stakes, and the radio’s “official mercy knotted with conditions” reframes the situation. The final refusal to immediately return is a credible internal climax that forecloses the easy path. However, the on-page sense of immediate risk (what happens if she fails or stays too long) remains a bit soft, keeping tension more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake is the narrator’s need to understand/locate the vanished hitchhiker and, beneath that, to renegotiate their relationship to loss and “never.” Pressure escalates modestly: from bewildered disbelief at the pullout to following an uncanny map into burned terrain to the crevice discovery and decision to relinquish the flake. Conflict remains primarily internal and contemplative rather than sharply contested; no choice feels catastrophically costly, though the emotional trade-off (keeping vs. leaving the flake, clinging vs. releasing) is real. The escalation suits the mode but could gain from one more concrete test of what the narrator risks by going—or by not going.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake is an ethical one—how to live with, and through, systems that fence others in—and it’s signaled early and deepened through the startup’s unintended social costs. Pressure escalates texturally: from the quiet pride of “cities that needed mercy” to the loneliness and economic fallout of over-quiet neighborhoods and lost contracts, culminating in the present attempt to repurpose his tools at the train. The resolution (refusal to stay inside loops; a gentler model of territorial marking) is clearly his agency. What prevents a higher score is the lack of a more acute on-page dilemma in the present; all conflict runs at a contemplative simmer.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stakes—unlocking the inscriptions to reframe grief and repair a relationship—are clear early and deepen as the work forces Mara to revisit her brother’s death and the narrator to risk emotional exposure. Escalation comes through intensifying emotional pressure rather than reversals: asking Mara to describe the stone’s fall, revising the algorithm to match “grief,” and finally reading the translation over the radio. The cost is in vulnerability and shared mourning rather than tangible loss, but it’s legible and scaled well to this lyric mode. The only constraint is that we never truly feel a live alternative (to stop, to refuse); conflict is more about how deeply they will engage, not whether, which keeps the tension just below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.4)
    The main stake—whether Issa will unearth and enact a truth powerful enough to undo Ren’s erasure—is clear and escalates from calming the lake, to stripping spells, to reading and then weaponizing the confession. Her agency drives each turn, and the interweaving of inner conflict (guilt, anger) with external magic keeps tension alive. However, obstacles yield to her will with relative smoothness; no attempt fails or seriously backfires, which softens the sense of risk and narrowing options. The conflict is rich and textured but never quite bites as hard as it could at a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—how to complete a prematurely triggered covenant without being destroyed or lost—is clear and escalates as the maze moves from object to skin to shared wound. The main tightening is the decision to press the clipping into the wrist and then to “say yes with our wounds,” foreclosing inaction and solitude. However, antagonistic pressure is largely atmospheric; there’s little concrete risk of harm beyond inference, and no serious alternative path is tested on the page. As a result, tension feels finely textured but never quite sharp-edged.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—repairing the damage of bartered destinies, specifically the brother’s—appears early and deepens when the Keeper reframes the market as exchange rather than theft and reveals the brother’s choice. Escalation is primarily conceptual and moral: instead of a showdown, the narrator chooses to offer her craft, accept permanent scars, and pledge shared breath, trading the option of righteous destruction for collaborative mending. That ethical trade-off is clear and proportionate to the piece’s scale. What keeps this just shy of top-tier is that external pressure feels relatively gentle; the outcome never seems seriously in doubt once the Keeper proves receptive.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether he’ll stay entombed in shame or engage with this risky, personal excavation—is clear and consistent. Escalation is quiet but real: the cloth as generic artifact, then as specific amp lineage, then as Abel-linked relic with a rental logo, each step tightening the emotional cost of involvement. Lark’s need for proof and the ticking depletion of the quarry add just enough external pressure. The final choice to “treat Echo Bench like a patient” and write “Dear Echo” reflects a meaningful, costly commitment rather than a neutral acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—how to relate to transition without doing damage—is established early and deepens rather than flips: from an urge to retrieve the mentor to an ethic of listening and stewardship. Pressure escalates as the ritual succeeds (coil, fruit, her mentor’s breath) and forces her to confront that haunted ambition, culminating in the explicit recognition that “mastery would only fracture the incline.” The choice to tune rather than reverse the current, and to share the orchard as commons, forecloses a path with conceptual and emotional cost. The piece remains meditative rather than sharply adversarial, which slightly softens moment-to-moment tension.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—people fearing loss of identity and seeking proof of return—is clear early and meaningfully addressed with the baker’s and boy’s visits. Pressure does deepen (from a baker fragmented across roles to a child unsure where “home” of self resides), and the librarian’s methods evolve slightly (from smelting a loaf to accepting ellipsis-like footprints). However, conflict remains mostly tonal and philosophical rather than genuinely pressured, with no real foreclosure beyond an implied acceptance of endless tending. The gentle escalation suits the mode but limits tension by elite-venue standards.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central stake—whether she upholds isolating protocol or risks connection—is signaled early and tightens through the reading of the shell and the cave’s “request.” The decisive turn is her refusal to condemn the bunker and her active crowning of the stalagmite, which forecloses a path of professional safety in favor of communal risk. Internal and external conflicts interweave effectively, though the external jeopardy (institutional repercussions) remains soft-focus rather than viscerally felt. Tension is more moral/philosophical than suspenseful, but it escalates coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.5)
    The stakes—owning causal responsibility for a child’s death versus clinging to a romanticized narrative—are clear early and grow as evidence accumulates. Pressure tightens meaningfully once the graffiti points to the WSP: she must confront that she literally labeled the danger “irrelevant” and then decide whether to open the portal and physically engage with the muck. The interplay of inner conflict (desire for forgiveness vs. refusal of self-excuse) and outer action (clearing the clog “one twig, one rag, one stone at a time”) reads as an earned escalation rather than a static lament. The cost is primarily moral and emotional, but it is made concrete enough in the work, confession, and ongoing duty.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—reaching and correctly engaging with the library to earn a second letter—is clear, and pressure does accumulate through increasingly intricate uses of distance, echoes, and timing. However, conflict remains mostly procedural and contemplative; the protagonist is never meaningfully at risk of losing the library, the letters, or any relationship, so escalating tension is more intellectual than visceral. The key turns (solving the door, choosing to write the second letter) are smooth and minimally opposed, limiting the felt cost of the final stance. Effective, but not yet gripping at a “prestige” level of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—keep or betray the mountain people’s pledge in the face of imperial heritage-making—is signaled early and stays sharp. Pressure escalates through the ticking approach of dawn, the coffee-stain map converging on a single uncut line, and the plants’ increasingly insistent responses. The climactic act of playing until the violin becomes water visibly forecloses the “safe” path of institutional complicity. The only mild limitation is that external antagonistic pressure (donors, director) remains mostly off-stage, keeping the tension fractionally more interior than it might be at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—whether she can fulfill her mother’s last request and preserve a spark—is legible and tight. Pressure escalates as she tests the emerald, dares the main attempt at her lips, and reads the aurora’s response. However, the conflict is mostly internal and contemplative, with minimal sense of jeopardy or trade-off beyond generalized emotional cost; the ritual succeeds without visible complication or near-failure. This makes the piece feel more like a beautifully rendered rite than a pressured decision with sharply narrowed options.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—the narrator’s stance toward harm, forgiveness, and contentment—tightens through the pruning vs. mercy calculus and the repeated assertion that “kindness without decision rots, but decision without kindness spoils.” The key escalation is the discovery of the new tendril where a dead spur was and the choice to tie it with the hairpin, concretizing her ethic in a fresh, vulnerable life. Pressure stays mostly internal and textural rather than sharply dramatized, which slightly blunts urgency. Still, the final stance feels earned and forecloses a path of bitterness or abdication.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Mara signs off on demolishing the quay—is clear early and remains coherent to the end. Escalation is mostly deepening rather than turning: the chime readings and cloak removal/reattachment gradually narrow her stance from binary (sign/don’t) toward a conditional, ethically burdened “yes.” There is no strong on-page reversal or concrete loss; the council’s pressure and the community’s likely pain stay hypothetical rather than tangibly dramatized. As a result, the tension is textured and morally alive but never quite as sharp or inescapable as it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether and how the narrator will receive the truth about the researcher’s condition and the nature of vanishing—is clear and coherent throughout. Pressure escalates quietly via withheld answers and deeper ritual involvement (breath trance → pebble → reading the iron-sand message → confronting the choice embedded in the research). The final reveal that continuing the experiment will erase the researcher provides conceptual stakes, but the on-page sense of dilemma or urgency is muted, leaning more toward contemplative acceptance than hard trade-off. As a result, conflict feels consistently engaging yet never quite sharp enough to reach a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether she can learn to navigate via echo, and whether the wandering pulse can be restored—is clear and threads the piece. Pressure escalates as she locates the pulse, confronts the invisible barricade of forgetting, and must choose still negotiation over pursuit or force. The traders’ old fear, the pulse’s wariness, and her commitment to non-theft create a subtle but credible tension that tightens around the boundary scene. The cost is primarily conceptual and spiritual rather than visceral, but it is legible in her disciplined refusal to move and in her commitment to an ongoing, never-finished audit.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether the mage will continue outsourcing creativity or risk being ordinary but genuine—is established early and sharpened at the moment of unstrapping the pack. Pressure escalates through the climb, confrontation with the keystone, and the decision to set it back rather than wield it, each narrowing options in favor of a costlier authenticity. The conflict is primarily internal but legibly intertwined with tangible actions and tools. The overall tension is quiet and could bear slightly more felt jeopardy or friction, but the single central turn is clear and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator will risk literal and psychic submersion to stop hiding behind “truth” and seek the color of sound—is clear and tightens credibly. Escalation comes from his decision to break routine, trespass into the “bad luck” wreck, and offer his own vows, culminating in the room “becoming a bell” that reconfigures him. Internal and external pressures interweave, but danger and loss remain somewhat underplayed, keeping tension more contemplative than gripping. The climax is earned, though the price paid is felt more conceptually than viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—how to ethically set the new universe’s “note” without corrupting it with singular intention—is signaled early and deepens via the prophecy and the two coin throws. Pressure escalates when the first casting reveals they’ve “already sang,” reframing their task from invention to keeping the process honest, and again as she chooses which potential promises to risk subliminally embedding. Cost shows in her refusal to steer (forgoing stronger moral impositions) and in spending the final coolant, but tension remains contemplative rather than sharply agonized. The conflict is coherent and meaningful, though a slightly sharper sense of what might be lost with a wrong note would heighten stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the reaper can responsibly name and thus hold fears, including their own—is established early and tightened by each new, more intimate recording. Escalation is quiet but clear: from anonymous voices to the snowfield memory to the final tape in the reaper’s own voice. The cost is an ongoing acceptance of burden rather than a single sharp sacrifice, which fits the mode but keeps tension at a simmer rather than a boil. Still, the final act of naming Enough closes off continued evasion and feels like a genuine narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—restoring the sea’s breath and reversing the overfishing-induced imbalance—is clear early and ties directly to Nera’s ritual and Aro’s guilt. Escalation is quiet but real: initial observation → counting and tuning → Aro returning the “moment” of the last fish → the sea’s visible response → their decision to stop casting. The costs (foregoing fishing for a season, relinquishing old rules and professional security) are conceptually strong but played in a muted register. The story favors lyric density over hard dilemmas, which slightly softens felt tension even as the arc remains structurally sound.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether the resurfaced town will be treated as a liability to be erased or a locus of shared memory—is clear and sharpened by the county’s order to “expunge illegal memorials.” Pressure escalates as the narrator moves from solitary patrol to following the photographs, to confronting the keeper, to an on-the-spot decision to suspend enforcement and organize a communal act. The conflict is quiet but real: job vs. inheritance, legality vs. lore, and her choice forecloses the path of uncomplicated obedience. The stakes stay mostly ethical and emotional rather than materially dire, which fits the mode but keeps intensity in the strong rather than searing band.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.3)
    The central stake—whether and how to proceed with a transformation that may alter her capacity for tenderness—is clear and coherently pressured throughout. Escalation is inward rather than dramatic: the murmuration and her mapping of ratios intensify the conflict between proof and wonder until she must choose a stance. Her agency at the end (closing the ledger, packing the crystal, deciding to wait for the starlings’ return) forecloses immediate transformation and embraces a costlier, open-ended path. The pressure never feels life-or-death or sharply antagonistic, but for a quiet lyric piece, the tightening is sufficient and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—Lio’s survival intertwined with the preservation of mutual trust—is clear early and tightens meaningfully at the harness-slip reveal. Escalation is clean: misaligned glide, resisted signal, admitted malfunction, on-the-fly fix, and a revised landing, all under the narrator’s constrained agency (no direct control, only guidance). Internal and external conflicts are well braided, especially in how the watcher’s anxiety about over-commanding influences the way they revise signals and instructions. The price paid is subtle (self-negation and ongoing vigilance rather than a visible loss), which slightly softens the felt sharpness of the final trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stakes—legal/ontological custody of the clones and Kana’s battle with emotional numbness—are signaled early and braided effectively. Pressure tightens when Kana is explicitly tasked to vivify the witness despite her fear, making her internal conflict inseparable from the external hearing. The cost is legible: she risks the return of pain and responsibility, and the resolution forecloses the path of dissociated safety. What keeps this just below elite is that institutional opposition (city advocates, formal legal consequence) recedes somewhat quickly once the kata begins, muting the sense of an adversarial test.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—preserving the brook as a space for innovation against developers—is clear and increasingly tied to action as the protagonist moves from private puzzlemaking to communal, politically inflected play. There is one real deepening when the map fragment reveals the condo plans and the seed’s intended use as deterrent, and another when neighbors test “Seed” and become allies. However, pressure rarely sharpens into hard, on-page tradeoffs; interactions with developers and any real sacrifice remain offstage. Tension stays mostly conceptual and tonal rather than viscerally escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether and how the conductor can restore laughter without harm—is clear and threads the entire scene. Pressure escalates texturally rather than via overt jeopardy: starting the blowers, coaxing the sputtering one, thickening laughter from brittle to almost-true, then choosing to withhold some. The ethical tradeoff about not returning all the laughter is strong but arrives as an assertion rather than a dramatized dilemma under time or opposition. As a result, tension is quietly compelling rather than gripping, which is effective but not maximally charged.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stakes—how to live with uncertainty and whether the guardian will reclaim or relinquish his old dimension—are clear and steadily deepen. Pressure escalates via new modes of access (pendant, ice comma, seam, path) culminating in the recovered sky that forces a concrete choice. The refusal to cross the window is an earned renunciation with evident cost for the guardian and a clear stance crystallization for the narrator. Conflict is primarily internal and philosophical, which fits the mode but keeps tension at a luminous simmer rather than a sharper flame.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.7)
    The central stake (freeing the town’s children from the mills’ “stifling destiny”) is clearly signaled and meaningfully tightened by the failed firings and the arrival of the bishop’s men. The key escalation is his shift from repairing power to disabling its illusion—choosing to remake the crozier as an absence—under immediate social and symbolic pressure. The external confrontation remains relatively soft (the bishop himself is absent, and his men fold quickly once the staff changes), which keeps the tension slightly more conceptual than visceral. Nonetheless, agency drives the resolution, and the cost—accepting partial, incremental rescue and permanent damage to the old order—is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether they can use this experiment to retrieve beginnings from endings and thereby redefine the city’s future—is clear and tightened by the rare window of lunar perigee. Pressure escalates meaningfully via their choice to discard assumptions in aiming the horn, which yields the map and forces a re-evaluation of what the gorge and city are. The external risk and cost are more inferred than felt (we don’t see something concrete endangered or sacrificed in the moment beyond effort and belief), which keeps the stakes a bit abstract. Still, the internal and conceptual conflicts deepen each turn, and the final instruction crystallizes a charged, if not yet paid, cost.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether the ferry and its commuters will be anchored to a single, reliable timeline at the cost of one self’s embodiment—is clear and escalates from anxious observation to irreversible self-sacrifice. The turn in the grotto, where the hourglass patterns reveal that “one deckhand must become the hinge,” is a strong tightening that forces a trade-off. However, external resistance is minimal: the other self, the harbor master, and even the cave itself largely cooperate, so pressure stays mostly conceptual rather than contested. As a result, tension is high but not quite as sharp or dynamically tested as it could be at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara can transmute a logic-built refuge for loneliness into a site of genuine, mutual connection—emerges early and tightens as she threads the sinew and observes visitors’ small releases. Pressure deepens when the installation reflects her own unresolved abandonment back at her via the “realistically imaginary witness” who asks why she left. The climax is quiet but real: she renounces the belief that geometry protects her and risks stepping onto the shared curve, foreclosing her prior stance of safe abstraction. The conflict remains mostly internal and gentle, but its escalation is clear and proportionate to the story’s scale.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether to keep turning further into the safe trench or risk orienting by the distant sky—is well signaled and sharpened through the discovery of the corridor and the council’s trench-expansion plan. Escalation is present via the reveal of the pressure gap, the precarious petition, and the eventual choice to rise during a narrow “time-soft window,” with real implied physical risk (“snapped like brittle threads”). However, direct on-page opposition and concrete consequences if they fail are kept more abstract and tonal than dramatized in scene. The conflict between survivalist pragmatism and visionary curiosity could bear one more explicit test at the moment of departure.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—Eli’s life and his relation to the donor heart—is clearly on the page early (pills, vanished meeting) and tightens through the appearance of the exit-selling man and the impending glass failure. Escalation is coherent: her listening reveals danger, his hesitation keeps the threat live, and the last-minute coordination of surrounding people both raises and then resolves the immediate physical risk. Agency is centered in the narrator’s decision to intervene, to speak to Eli in specific terms about debt and courage, and to treat bystanders as latent allies. The cost is largely emotional and conceptual (Eli’s shaken laughter, the dead steering them), which fits the piece but keeps it just shy of maximal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stakes—retrieving/attending to traces of erased colleagues within a narrow tidal window while managing claustrophobia—are clear and coherent. Escalation is quiet but real: from preparatory listening to the first electroscope flicker to the partial “laughter” recovery as the tide clock bears down. The siren and encroaching flood effectively foreclose further attempts this round, clarifying the cost and forcing endurance over resolution. The piece stops short of a sharper on-page dilemma or sacrifice; tension remains more tonal than knife-edged.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—how to live after being prematurely declared dead, and whether failure can be reworked into a survivable path—is clear early and coherently developed. Pressure tightens through the recollection of the death certificate night, the collaborative reading of the ink, and the ghost’s request that the narrator confront those who “wrote my ending.” Escalation is primarily internal and thematic, culminating in the decision to leave by the newly understood corridor and seek a “wiser ending,” which earns the quiet resolution. Still, the on-page sense of risk in the present (they might not make it down, might be rejected) remains atmospheric rather than sharply dramatized, keeping tension strong but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—preserving the cliff language at the cost of the narrator’s identity—is set early and sharpened as the curse’s appetite becomes explicit. Escalation is clear: the diamond goes from tool to hungry agent, demanding first small memories, then “two more names,” culminating in surrender of “the left and right of my own” and bodily integration into the canyon. Internal and external conflicts braid well: the more the language is saved, the more the self is eroded. The resolution is an earned renunciation rather than a convenient miracle, with irreversible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—transmuting personal and civic trauma into an “untamed harmony” that doesn’t shatter people—is clear and tightened through the phone’s demands and the risk of exposing her rawest hurt as a joke. Escalation comes from moving from covert listening to active ritual, then to the vulnerable choice to weaponize self-mockery (“sedimentality”) as the required key. The cost is conceptual and emotional: she trades protective bitterness and professional distance for a public, ongoing obligation. The conflict could feel even sharper if one concrete on-page consequence of failure or refusal were more present in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—risking sanctioned order to awaken forbidden beauty—is clear and escalates as the narrator abandons the sky-bridge, enters the policed orchard, and actively asks the roots to rebel. The beat where the statues begin signaling back and the rails uproot provides a strong, earned tightening. However, resistance feels relatively soft: the system yields quickly once the right frequency is found, and we never see a serious on-page counterforce or near-failure. This keeps the conflict affecting but more lyrical than harrowing, slightly limiting stakes’ visceral bite.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—sustaining and enlarging a fragile cross-border channel for promises and reunions—is clear early and grows as more people gather. Escalation is mostly situational/accumulative: first the small boy’s missing letter, then the risky crossing via the storm, then the creation of the shared mail drop, and finally open tension with a commander threatening to revoke permission. The courier’s agency under pressure (using the bottle, co-founding the crossing, answering authority with “receipts” and silence) earns the quiet climax where the border’s song diminishes. Costs are implied (risk of punishment, dependence on a tenuous arrangement) rather than dramatized as direct harm, which slightly softens the sense of price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—can he awaken the carousel while honoring silence—is clear but intentionally quiet, with pressure accumulating more texturally than through overt threat. The main tightening is the discovery and fitting of the halo fragment, which deepens possibility rather than sharply narrowing options. His choice to sing softly instead of forcing motion respects his earlier vow and gives the key internal conflict its turn. Still, the sense of price and risk remains low-intensity, which slightly limits escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—locating and understanding “where stories live”—is clear early and escalates through a deepening of conceptual pressure (from mapping to entering the lungs-room to taking up custodial duty). The scarf/atlas decision and the choice to follow the hyperbolic path serve as the main tightening, leading to the recognition that the narrator belongs to the stories’ “weather.” Internal and external conflicts (solitude vs. observed community, seeking vs. serving) braid effectively, though the piece favors contemplative intensification over sharp reversals. The subtlety of stakes and absence of a harder explicit trade-off keep tension from fully peaking at an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—capture a dangerous, meaningful dream before dawn—appears early and meaningfully tightens when the cipher reveals the plea about Aria. Conflict shifts from a simple retrieval job to a moral and emotional dilemma: document vs imprison, duty vs Aria’s warning that capturing is a proxy for avoiding solitude. The protagonist’s choice to build “crossings, not cages” and to leave the library door unlatched is a clear stance crystallization with implied cost (continued vulnerability and solitude). Escalation is primarily tonal and conceptual rather than dramatized through reversals, which keeps this strong but not maximal.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—freeing a long-trapped kindness from fear—is signaled early and grows as they move into the valley and the star realigns the space. Escalation is more deepening than reversal: pressure increases via accumulating ritual acts and the scholar’s remembered backstory rather than overt setbacks. The locksmith’s work proceeds with little resistance; success feels inevitable once the pattern is clear, so overt cost or risk is relatively muted. Still, the internal conflict between safety and tenderness does tighten into a credible, consequential release at the door.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central stake—recovering stolen memories and settling an old, misnamed bargain—is planted early and tightened through the active encounter with the ring and the film of the past. The meaningful turn comes when she recognizes the wrong name given to the glass, deliberately blurs the film, and substitutes the right name, paying a visible emotional cost to alter the past contract. Internal and external conflict align well, but the danger of failure remains mostly atmospheric rather than concretely pressured. A more legible sense of what she risks losing now if she fails would raise the stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—reversing the brother’s exile—is established quickly and carried through the tea ritual, hinge reading, and unlocking aisle. Tension escalates via the uncertainty of the tea geometry, the hush “tugging the windows,” and the hinge that “rattled and quivered like teeth” before the shadow unfolds. However, the piece largely forgoes overt obstacles or visible near-failure, relying on atmosphere rather than concrete reversals, which slightly softens perceived cost. Still, agency (the girl’s carrying, the archivist’s ritual, the brother’s self-forgiveness) credibly drives resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—whether wonder and color can survive the encroaching Gray—is established early and carried through to the communal practices at the end. There is some escalation: from local pruning to crossing the liminal bridge, to confronting the Gray directly. However, the pressure never quite bites; the echo orchard yields to gentle pruning, and the Gray trembles but swiftly accepts the offered succor without demanding a painful trade-off or visible loss. The result is thematically coherent but lacks a sharper moment where a real alternative path is foreclosed at palpable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether the fisherman’s spirit will be grounded so he stops dragging at his daughter’s sleep—is clear and emotionally scaled to the piece. Pressure tightens as each knot proves to hold a piece of his life, culminating in the shared unmaking of the “last stubborn knot,” which visibly raises the coffer and forces the daughter to confront her fear by participating. The cost is largely emotional rather than perilous, but the story earns that quiet register. Conflict between narrator’s professional control and their own precise unease threads under the external task in a satisfying way.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—how to engage with a vulnerable, secret place without violating it—is clear and consistent. Pressure tightens at the sealed panel: brute force is rejected, a more delicate and time-consuming method is chosen, and the narrator must decide how far to press in and how much to re-seal afterward. However, the conflict remains mostly ethical and contemplative, with little sense that any truly cherished alternative is foreclosed beyond abstract self-restraint. The cost is intellectually legible but only lightly dramatized in terms of risk, loss, or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator can reconfigure their relationship to “letting go” rather than clinging—is clear and tight, with the decoding of “LET GO TO LIVE” as the key deepening beat. Pressure builds more through accumulating correspondences (tape, message, stub, globe) than through overt peril, but the emotional stakes sharpen as those elements converge. The final choice to release the globe and acknowledge the dead is an earned internal reversal, not mere compliance with the message. The main constraint is that external conflict (hazard, time, survival) remains muted, so tension is intense but largely conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—getting the ghost to recognize and act on residents’ unspoken needs—is clear and sharpened by the storm’s narrow listening window. Pressure escalates as the interval opens, the ghost “comes nosing,” and the narrator progresses from basic requests to “bolder things” encoded more delicately, then faces the ghost’s direct question about what they need. The cost remains mostly conceptual/emotional (time-bound risk, the strain of representing others, the choice to subsume personal needs), so the escalation is felt more as deepening than as sharp reversal. That relative softness keeps this excellent, but short of the highest-pressure band.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central stake—whether the narrator will remain a properly detached servant or become an active, potentially transgressive witness—is clear and steadily pressured by the ticking ascent and the growing intimacy of the diary’s revelations. Each floor brings a deepening: confirmation it’s Madam Vire’s diary, the map to the forgetter room, the revelation of the captain’s death, and finally the instruction that redefines the errand. The sudden stop at the seventh floor and the “requesting a witness who would not fix, not solve, not judge” crystallize the internal moral conflict. The escalation remains largely internal and low-key, which suits the piece but keeps it just shy of the most searing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—testing whether absence can be proven to persist—is clear early and steadily pressured by the risk that nothing will answer back. Escalation comes through increasingly concrete, risky ritualizations of that stake: from naming clouds, to tracing the wake, to tying a physical line to the absence and planning a ribbon-test the next night. The key narrowing is her acceptance that this is “not rescue” but a proof with or without the desired result, which forecloses the fantasy of undoing the fall. Internal and external conflicts (scientific rigor vs. magical thinking; grief vs. professional lexicon) are tightly braided, though the pressure remains more inward than situationally harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—finishing a final, truthful “sky” for the room before demolition—reads clearly and is underlined by the crane, siren, and crew counting outside. Escalation is primarily deepening rather than reversal: locating the safe, discovering the coin’s map, decoding coordinates, then racing the siren while refusing haste. The internal conflict between fractal precision and the ticking clock is effective but could be sharpened further with one explicit moment of near-failure or trade-off. Still, the final choice to stop painting and leave the note, accepting loss, gives the pressure a satisfying, costly endpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—making a genuine discovery and giving the lost light a “harbor”—is signaled early and followed through. Escalation is subtle but present: first finding a heading in the chalk pattern, then threading the murmuration, then the delicate act of netting and folding the light. However, the process is relatively frictionless; there’s no serious setback, moral trade-off, or risk that would force a sharper choice or visible sacrifice. The tension is gentle and atmospheric rather than gripping, which fits the mode but keeps stakes in the mid-to-high band.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—can he learn and enact the “rhythm of repair” to wake the hall of mirrors—is clear but mostly internal and contemplative. Pressure modestly tightens when the machine “faltered, asking for a story,” forcing him into a vulnerable act of speech rather than purely technical adjustment. However, there is little sense of real risk if he fails; consequences remain abstract (a machine that stays dormant) rather than sharply felt. The escalation fits the lyric mode but lacks a strong sense of foreclosed options or tangible price that would deepen the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—coaxing moisture and rest back to a drought-stricken community—is clear and steadily intensified from dawn preparation to the risky dusk ascent. Escalation is more ritual-deepening than adversarial conflict, but pressure rises as the whole community commits, trades grudges and shifts, and finally entrusts the climactic act to Ana. The cost is quiet but legible: emotional exposure, coordinated labor, and the relinquishing of private claims to time and resentment. The resolution depends on their collective endurance and trust in Vine’s choreography rather than a convenient external rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how to buy the world “one more interval” of time—is clearly signaled and threads the piece. Pressure deepens through the onset of dusk, the storm glass darkening, and the initiation of the nested pattern sequence, with the key turn as the practical and moral crux. Internal stakes (can he keep granting mercy without breaking?) intertwine subtly with the cosmic ones. However, escalation remains primarily tonal and ritualistic; there’s no strong sense that tonight is more precarious than other nights, which keeps tension from fully peaking.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—getting the travelers out alive before frost while not triggering the birds—emerges early and tightens as night approaches and patrols “carve the orchard into separate islands.” The caretaker’s agency drives escalation: leveraging the nut, manipulating dust and shadow, and timing movement under aerial surveillance. Internal stakes (self-erasure, relationship to the curse) braiding with external danger add depth, though physical peril remains more implied than viscerally tested. The cost at closure—choosing ongoing emptiness and surrendering the nut’s power—is clear and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether she can begin repairing the rift with her brother—is clear early and tightens through successive moves: designing a bridge that physically embodies reconnection, sending an invitation, waiting through uncertain silence, and finally crossing together. Pressure is mostly internal but remains believable and cumulative; the risk is emotional exposure rather than catastrophe. The small slip at the center of the bridge and her non-heroic act of sharing the teeter is a strong, specific on-page test of changed dynamics. Stakes could read as quiet for some elite venues, but the escalation is coherent and proportionate for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—access to a real beginning via traded absence—is signaled early and tightened when the woman must surrender her unsaid name, then further when the narrator risks their father’s silence. The use of moonlight, ledger, and incisions provides a concrete escalation from theory to application to self-application. The cost is legible (she parts with the name; the narrator breaches a long-kept silence), but conflict remains serene and ritualistic, with little friction or hesitation at peak beats. The pressure deepens more than it sharpens, fitting the lyric mode but keeping it just shy of maximal tension.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—transforming stored communal grief into something bearable—is clear and present throughout, and the trip to the pavilion plus tasting the siege memories provide a real tightening. The protagonist’s agency drives the key turn when he chooses to subsume the grief into broth and then to share it with both boy and coral. However, external resistance is minimal and the operation succeeds on the first try, so the sense of risk or possible failure feels somewhat muted. The cost is more conceptual/emotional than dramatized, which keeps stakes from fully peaking.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—transforming isolation/fear into connection via a literal and figurative bridge—is clear and increasingly pressured as townspeople, the sentient elevator, and the councilman enter. There is one meaningful tightening when the councilman arrives with a frown, which could plausibly block the project. Yet his quick softening at the glove’s discovery and the relative ease of community mobilization keep external stakes from biting as hard as they might. Tension is more atmospheric and ceremonial than fraught, so escalation reads as deepening harmony rather than hard trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how to reconfigure entangled grief without lying about fault lines—is legible early and revisited through successive memory strata. Escalation comes from facing progressively more ethically fraught layers, culminating in the rescue-drone decision that sharpens the cost of both caution and audacity. Pressure remains largely internal and contemplative, which suits the mode but mutes visceral tension; no external constraint narrows options beyond what the narrator self-imposes. Still, the final renunciation of “salvation in thunderclap form” and commitment to ongoing, gentle excavation feels like an earned stasis with path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—retrieving forgotten combinations within a strictly bounded, disorienting environment—is clear and present. Pressure builds mainly through situational constraints (the maze-like grotto, the puzzling panel, the ticking inverted hour) rather than direct opposition, culminating in the realization that only “a handful” can be taken this time. The narrator exercises real agency in how to navigate and when to withdraw, but the conflict remains largely contemplative, with no sharp reversal or ethically fraught choice. As a result, tension is steady and engaging but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—creating authentic music through listening rather than noise in a vowed-silent world—is clear and gently tightened rather than sharply escalated. Pressure manifests in the need for permission (the hedgehog uncurling), matching the insulator’s refusal to hurry, and aligning with the grove’s minute shifts. There is one meaningful deepening: the backstory of ruins and stress cracks reweights the current act of tuning as an ethical practice, not just craft. Still, conflict remains mostly internal and contemplative, with no single on-page turn that significantly narrows options beyond committing to this slow, cyclical discipline.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—mending the eclipsed covenant under threat of being branded oathbreakers—is clearly signaled and threads the scene. Pressure escalates mainly through deepening engagement with the ritual (knight learning its route from the aurora, bishop aligned with the flock, breath and wires correlated), rather than through external reversals or hard choices. The legal and social danger (guard below, outlawed listening) adds situational tension but is never forced into a concrete dilemma or interruption. As a result, the story feels taut and purposeful but slightly under-tested; escalation is present, yet it never quite narrows options into a painful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.8)
    The primary stake—whether the narrator can open the clasp and “recover” the silence around the lost diary without betraying pacifist principles—remains coherent and does tighten as fireworks loom. Escalation is subtle and textural rather than confrontational: the hum builds, the clasp “remembers its pressure,” the city prepares to erupt, and the internal lexicon of silences grows. The cost is largely conceptual and internal (relinquishing the desire for explicit story, accepting soot and fennel instead), which suits the piece but keeps pressure gentler than top-tier work. Still, the final choice to keep listening and writing through the fireworks reads as a clear, earned stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara can introduce a monstrous bloom and teach serenity-in-motion without losing the village—is clear and threads the piece. Pressure escalates mostly through temporal and textural deepening (seasons braiding, the bud swelling, villagers gathering into the stench) rather than sharp reversals, which suits the accumulative lens but keeps tension relatively low-intensity. Her agency at the climax (leading breathing, framing the smell, deploying cedar baskets) earns the outcome, and the cost (communal discomfort, risked trust) is legible. A more palpable moment where the village might truly reject her or the flower would strengthen the sense of real jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring the planet’s resilience and fulfilling a generational promise—is established early and coherently escalated through the thinning song and damaged chamber. The key tightening is the reveal of the black-glass shard bleeding echoes, which forces a concrete act under pressure (fitting the arrow tip). However, opposition is mostly environmental and somewhat soft; the repair proceeds without serious complication or failure, so the sense of price and risk at the peak is muted. The conflict is real but gentle, more quest-fulfillment than hard contest.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—understand the accident well enough to prevent recurrence—is clear, and the pressure coheres as the investigator tightens from broad survey to specific chain (storm, rehearsal, new supervisor, empty square). Conflict is largely situational and intellectual rather than oppositional; the main resistance is the complexity of the environment and the opacity of past choices. The decisive act of “drafting an order that turns the maze into a breathing grid” is a meaningful narrowing of options with large implied cost. The piece could push higher if it staged at least one more concrete obstruction or risky inference in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—successfully sculpting and sustaining the hush at the crucial origin moment—is clear, and the key tightening beat is the synchronized first strike of bell and chisel. The internal risk of sleep and the waves of repose provide a nice atmospheric pressure, but they never truly close in or force a difficult choice beyond “stay awake, do the ritual.” Conflict is therefore more ceremonial than oppositional, with little sense that failure is genuinely imminent. The climax is beautiful and emotionally satisfying, but the tension curve remains relatively gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—how she will live with and reconfigure a catastrophic past failure—is clear early and sharpened by the prospect of re-engaging the seam. Pressure escalates when the flute-playing opens a corridor to the valley where she failed, forcing her to confront not only memory but an alternate self still carrying the same doubt. The key tightening is her decision to weave remorse into the loom and then to divert judgment to “listeners who were never sworn as guardians,” which forecloses the path of reclaiming authority. The conflict remains largely internal and contemplative, so while stakes are conceptually high, the sense of immediate risk is muted rather than tense.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stakes—can they use this uncanny presswork to withstand a universe that is literally dimming, and can the operator survive his self-fragmentation—are clear, if couched in lyric terms. Pressure escalates as the vanishings quicken and as we learn the cumulative cost of borrowing personalities, forcing the climactic choice to print a line that deliberately fuses their selves. The lever-drop and subsequent empathy-swap constitute a meaningful tightening: they risk identity and emotional stability to test their theorem. The conflict remains more internal and conceptual than oppositional, but for an accumulative piece the stakes feel real and the price legible.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stakes—honoring the woman’s vanished village and managing the pendant’s dangerous gift—are clear early and meaningfully tighten when the encounter risks overextension (“sweet and dangerous”). The key escalation is internal and ethical: realizing how the pendant’s extension can “thin the next dawn,” then choosing to cut the moment short and give sharpness back. The cost is subtle but legible: foregoing deeper connection/wonder in order to preserve balance, mirroring the mentor’s earlier renunciations. Some readers might crave a sharper external consequence, but for this lyric mode the pressure feels sufficient and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator will allow his grief and belief in “object memory” to surface—is clearly signaled and coherently pressured by Mara’s experiment. Escalation arrives through the narrowing focus on the car seat “where my father once sat” and Mara’s direct demand to “tell it what it wants to be called,” which forces a costly choice. The conflict remains mostly internal and understated, so the tension is more subterranean hum than sharp spike, but it does deepen decisively. The price—reopening the “jar” of his father and accepting a non-rational apology—is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—reaching the sister without destroying the orchard—is clear and tightens well as the frame opens and the “latent sacrifice” begins to tug. The critical turn is her refusal to fully cross, choosing instead to risk sending only the bead; that’s an earned trade-off with legible cost. The external pressure is more metaphysical than antagonistic, but it remains coherent and grows under the accumulative, ritual lens. Tension is a shade more meditative than sharp, which keeps escalation strong rather than ferocious.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—preventing the falling arches from destroying the orchards—is signaled early and remains coherent. Escalation comes through the increasing difficulty and cost of each repair (from a winter-evening sound to an unsaid surname to childhood laughter), plus the mid-journey tremor that physically tests resolve. Conflict is mainly situational and internal rather than interpersonal, but the pressure steadily tightens under that lens. The resolution is earned by the protagonist’s persistent, costly work rather than luck or handwaving.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether the heavy, panic-inducing cargo of voices remains suppressed or is released—is well-articulated and thematically apt. Escalation occurs through increasingly intimate contact with the crate’s fear across universes and culminates in the decision to unseal and redirect the voices, which is an active, ethically charged move. However, resistance is largely conceptual; there’s no moment where an alternative action genuinely tempts or where an external pressure nearly prevents the choice, so the peak doesn’t fully bite. The sense of cost is present but could be made sharper by dramatizing some real peril or backlash associated with release.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether the intangible safety embodied in the letters will be flattened into museum artifacts or preserved as a living promise—emerges clearly and tightens as automation looms. Escalation is quiet but present: from routine supply runs to the final night, to Doyle’s departure, to the clandestine act in the darkened lantern room. The skipper’s agency at the end (oiling the letters, constructing the stone message, sealing the jar) forecloses compliance with the Board’s vision and accepts personal erasure as the price. Pressure never quite tips into palpable risk or confrontation, which keeps the tension subtle rather than searing.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are legible and coherent early: her town’s safety and water supply, plus her obligation as the new “newspaper” of the community. Escalation is clear—the forecasted harmless gyre becomes dangerous when her laugh redirects it, forcing her to deploy deeper knowledge of the wick and beam—but the outcome unspools quite smoothly once she acts, with little sense of options closing or near-failure. Internal pressure (the risk of her prophetic joy) and external pressure (the town dousing lights, trusting her) are elegantly braided, though never pushed into a truly harrowing or ambiguous trade-off. The resolution feels earned and satisfying, but the conflict resolves without a strongly felt price beyond responsibility and exhaustion.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—how to live with a donor heart that “steers” the narrator toward others’ stories—is clear, and the pressure builds as questions shift from craft (“why some people magnetize stories”) to self (“Whose heart is this”). Escalation is primarily internal and textural, with a key tightening when the dye master reframes the heart as echo-tuned and offers the lens-vs-lantern distinction, forcing a choice of stance. The cost is subtle but present: the narrator accepts ongoing permeability rather than trying to seal themselves off, which implies enduring emotional exposure. The conflict remains low-external, so the sense of risk never quite sharpens to the highest band, but within a lyric mode it feels sufficiently taut.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—can the narrator translate/measure sorrow well enough to converse with what trees witness—emerges clearly and tightens through the pin’s fall and the rooftop consultation. The pin moment provides a genuine inflection point, leading to the ledger entry and roofward escalation. However, opposition remains largely atmospheric; there’s little sense that failure or delay would carry tangible consequence beyond continued quiet yearning. The conflict is thus rich in texture but modest in felt risk, keeping pressure below top-tier levels.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—rekindling a dying realm via memory-woven dawn—is established early and tightened by the recalled window failure and the “last village” setup. The sequence with the villagers’ layered song, the window rising “half broken, half brave,” and the trembling hands at the loom provides a clear escalation in pressure. Internal conflict (fear vs. duty) is acknowledged and constrains her sense of how tight to weave, but does not materially alter tactics at the climax, which keeps the tension more atmospheric than decisional. Still, the visible cost of emptiness and the transformed world gives the conflict credible weight.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central stake—whether Mara can understand and ethically mend the effect of her mistake—is signaled early and followed through. Pressure intensifies not through danger but via conceptual deepening: practicing “staying while leaving,” re-seeing the grieving patron’s experience, then choosing to write and physically go to the door. The cost is her exposure and relinquishment of the self-protective story that she only harms by accident. Because the conflict remains almost entirely internal and serenely staged, tension never quite tightens to a knife-edge, though it is coherent and meaningful.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stakes—honoring erased places and resisting creeping erasure through gentle, covert action—are clear and the story does deepen from quiet preparation into confessions and a fragile new ritual. There is a meaningful tightening when they confront their complicity (“sold herbs to the developers,” “documented, archived, and sent letters, but never chained myself to anything”) and then must decide what to leave visible in the tea house, balancing sanctuary with survival. However, pressure never truly bites: no external event or inner impasse narrows options in a way that feels hard to walk back, and the officials remain hypothetical. The ending reads as a beautifully weighted stance rather than the culmination of a sharply escalating conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.2)
    The primary stake—what promises are salvageable versus lost to oblivion—tightens from abstract duty toward personal risk as the narrator confronts vows that fracture, vows that tremble, and finally their own unmeasured oath. Each measurement scene raises the ethical and emotional cost: the river vow’s failure, the overburdened library oath, and the narrator’s quiet admission of limits (“I do not know how long we can hold the passing back”). The escalation is subtle but coherent for a lyric piece, ending in a charged decision to continue the work despite incomplete success. The conflict remains largely internal and conceptual, which keeps tension elegant but a shade quieter than maximal for this standard.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—earning a precise, survivable understanding of betrayal—is clear early and tightened through the fraught, silent negotiation. Escalation is subtle but effective: her intentional false starts erode his control, his attempted bolt, and his flinch when the fob slides across all mark rising pressure. The resolution, an earned stasis where she refuses revenge and accepts a record instead, forecloses the path of violent redress in favor of hard knowledge. The only constraint on a higher score is that the conflict remains almost entirely internal and understated, which is well-executed but leaves little room for further sharpening of visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding why and how people carry weather, and what that duty costs—is clear and threads through the scene. Pressure escalates as the “counts” near closing, the carriers converge, and the ring demands a decision that directs everyone to the spine. However, the potential consequences if the ritual or tally fails stay abstract; the forest’s unease and “storm debts” are felt conceptually more than viscerally. The protagonist’s agency is real but the on-page price for their choice is mild (trembling, belief shift) rather than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator can break through creative paralysis without betraying grief—is established early and tightened through the obstacle of the broken lock. The failure of the expected solution forces a new tactic (using Lio’s hidden mechanism) and deepens the emotional risk. Conflict is mostly internal but mapped onto concrete tasks, culminating in the frightening blank book and the choice to draw Lio laughing. Stakes remain intimate rather than sharp-edged, yet escalation and cost read clearly for this scale.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—recovering lost conversations in a world where words are a vital, tradable resource—is clear from early on and tightens when the Ear demands “candor in small moments” as payment. The escalation is primarily internal and procedural: choosing to investigate, to enter the Ear alone at dusk, then to offer increasingly costly confessions to open it. The decisive deepening occurs when her honesty literally unlocks the route to the chamber, tying her flaw/virtue to the world’s occult mechanism. While this is effective, the conflict never fully threatens to break her or the system around her, so the felt price remains more conceptual than viscerally harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether wonder’s “color” can be preserved through honest, nonverbal truth—is clear and indeed sharpened when the bells expose hidden grief and desire. Escalation is present but gentle: tension rises with the first symphony of truth, the villagers’ emotional reactions, and the fear when the fragment begins to melt and shed precious water. Mara’s responses (enlisting apprentices, redirecting meltwater into the sculpture) show agency but face limited resistance. The piece aims for contemplative rather than acute conflict, which keeps stakes feeling slightly soft for elite-tier tension.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—whether the caretaker will remain a static archive or risk destruction to carry life and memory forward—is legible early and tightens as the magnetic shift escalates from ambient unease to immediate structural threat (“windows spider in protest”). The staged burn is a strong pressure point driven by protagonist agency, and the breach moment cleanly fuses external danger with the internal fear of remaining a “museum.” The cost is felt in the dome’s collapse and in the implicit abandonment of a prior identity, with the final kneeling/planting beat reading as a committed new stance. Slightly more dramatized resistance or complication during the burn itself could have heightened the sense of jeopardy further.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stakes—opening the mailbox and proving that listening can counter intrusive, punitive systems—are signaled early and pay off in the confrontation with the inspector and the communal unlocking. Pressure escalates through the intrusion of the drone/developer and the inspector’s deadline, which narrows options just enough to matter. The emotional and material costs, however, remain gentle; there’s little sense that anyone risks more than fines and embarrassment, so the conflict never quite bites as hard as it could. The resolution is earned and satisfying but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—liberating the drowned minds without being caught—is clear and holds throughout, and there is a meaningful tightening as the code accrues toward “the last entry” and the tanks’ release. The conflict between the narrator and Caretaker/the State is more implicit than confrontational, embodied in the need to fool surveillance rather than face direct opposition. This fits the accumulative/lyric lens but does mean there’s no sharp test where a real option is foreclosed on the page. The risk and cost read as conceptually high but tactically smooth, keeping tension strong but not truly bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether erased grief and identity can be recovered or revoiced—is clear early and tightens as Ilya moves from curiosity to risky experimentation to public ritual. Escalation is primarily conceptual and emotional rather than peril-driven, but there is a clear deepening: from testing gravity, to extracting a personal cube, to confronting the scale of communal forgetting at the whale. Costs (potential loss of recovered memory when the pocket tightens; the weight of returning others’ pain) are present but under-stated. The conflict remains quiet yet coherent and resolves through an earned stance rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—preventing a dangerous sky-door from opening—is crisply stated, and the textural pressure of the code completing does build. Escalation is modest but present: the rising of a syllable “like mist” is the clearest tightening, prompting his decisive lean into the hush and later adjustment of the wing. Still, the conflict remains almost entirely one-sided and abstract, with little sense that he might fail or pay a price beyond concentration and vigilance. The result is a beautiful but relatively low-tension arc.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator will truly engage with the “language” of buildings versus treating it as theatrical play—is present and tightened as the lesson becomes a kind of covenant. Escalation is quiet but real: from observing to participating in the seal ritual, to offering a personal truth, to promising to keep coming. The cost is subtle (a life of attentive hospitality to structures and their lies) rather than acutely dramatized, which fits the mode but softens urgency. A slightly clearer moment where listening conflicts with an easier, disengaged stance would sharpen the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—whether to keep Reina’s laugh quarantined or let it transform both narrator and garden—is signaled early via the shell and quarantine frame. Pressure escalates from caretaking routine to an explicitly framed dilemma at the niche (“Must I let you loose, or must I become the door you wanted?”). The resolution is protagonist-driven and clearly forecloses the safety of custodial isolation in favor of vulnerable openness. The conflict is mostly internal and ethical, but it maintains real tension without flattening into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—altering imperial tax-oaths without collapsing the city—is clear and ethically charged, and it tightens as the narrator moves from abstract intention to specific acts on the stone. The key escalation comes when the work on public decrees is done and the hinge in the narrator’s own name appears; refusing to open it is a credible, costly choice. Conflict is primarily moral and internal, with external danger largely offstage, which suits the piece but keeps tension at a thoughtful simmer rather than a hard boil. Because there are no major reversals or concrete pushback beyond conscience and implied imperial risk, the pressure plateaus just shy of peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether voices remain commodified echoes or reclaimed halves—is clear and escalates from private curiosity to systemic challenge. Pressure tightens with the descent, the council’s guarded chord-like questioning, and the discovery that half of her mother’s voice underwrites the oppressive economy. Her decision to redirect all echoes and “ensure their return” is a genuine turning point, but resistance from the council feels brief; they “hiss” and flee without forcing her to pay much more than the risk of defying them. The conflict is thematically rich but skews a bit low on concrete peril or loss at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stakes—saving Leda from erasure and exposing institutional negligence—are clear and organically tied to the narrator’s vocation. Pressure deepens when the girl appears, when the snow globe reveals her name, and when the narrator chooses a public-facing promise over private communion. Escalation here is primarily conceptual and emotional rather than oppositional; there is no antagonist on the page or hard external obstacle, which keeps the sense of cost somewhat abstract. Still, the internal conflict between mere witnessing and risking action is resolved with an earned, higher-stakes commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—livelihood versus compassion for non-human life and “hidden effort”—is clearly posed and tightened as Li’s hunger and the elders’ impatience bear down. Escalation is quiet but real: the threat of punishment for a “thief,” the discovery that Yazhen is defying communal norms, and the public test of her methods through the philosopher’s lesson. The ethical calculus at the climax (“justice is a net that also learns to open”) arises naturally from this pressure. The tension remains more contemplative than visceral, which may limit peak intensity but suits the piece’s mode.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how to expose the truth behind a comforting myth—is clear early and sharpened as the narrator moves from itchiness about “miracles” to handling the diamond itself. Escalation comes through deepening knowledge rather than reversals: entering the stillpoint, piecing the letters, and confronting Klay’s explanation of the curse each narrow her moral options. The climactic question, “what will you write?”, lands as a genuine pressure point, with the compromise answer reshaping the place’s future narrative. The only shortfall is that the cost remains mostly conceptual; there’s limited sense of concrete risk beyond reputational or emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.4)
    Conflict escalates cleanly: from illicit broadcasts and emergent “variant allegiance” to council suppression, lightning confrontation at the portico, and finally the layered song that reconfigures the crowd’s stance. Stakes are concrete—civic control, bodily risk (Kestrel taking the strike), survival of the station—though they remain framed in often-abstract language. The decisive tightening comes when traitors move to “crack the glass” and Kestrel interposes himself, forcing the crowd to choose and enabling the narrator’s final tactical escalation with the ancient reel-to-reel. Because the narrator’s internal moral calculus is mostly stated rather than felt in conflict, the pressure reads slightly more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stakes—whether his marginal craft can actually bridge people and redeem his absence—are clear and tested by the storm and the errand to the widow. Pressure escalates from quiet collection to the risky emotional gamble of entrusting the children with the jar, then to the storm where he acts under genuine threat (“if the storm took me, it would at least take a town’s vocabulary”). The morning aftermath confirms that his gamble had real impact, foreclosing the path where he remains a mere eccentric observer. Still, conflict stays mostly tonal and internal; a slightly sharper external complication or cost on the page would intensify the stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the Lens-Heart will be kept sacred or exploited—emerges early and stays coherent. Pressure tightens as she chooses to open the vault and actively use the Lens in front of a dangerous buyer, risking both misuse and her own exposure to old shame. The turning point is the shared hum/vision sequence, where the conflict tilts from transactional threat to mutual confrontation with guilt, culminating in his relinquishing theft. The escalation feels more like deepening than sharp reversal, but it’s nonetheless effective and clearly tied to her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the village will remain enslaved to speed or risk adopting a slower, attention-driven method—is clearly signaled and tightened through the council confrontation and the three-night compact. Agency is strong: the narrator demands an hour, demonstrates the viaduct lull, insists on unyoking the dogs, and leads the first patient crossing. Internal and external conflicts interweave well (personal philosophy vs communal survival instincts), and the cost is conceptual and social: if they fail, they forfeit credibility and revert to haste. The crossing itself resolves a bit too smoothly; one more concrete brush with danger at the viaduct would deepen the sense of price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—truth vs. institutional containment and its cost to the dead and to her career—is clear from early on and tightens as she uncovers specific physical evidence. Escalation is primarily investigative but real: each discovery (gouged paint, fresh tool marks, cheap retrofit, nepotism) narrows her moral options until complicity is no longer bearable. The ethical turn where she discards the earpiece and contacts external accountability (union, journalist) is a genuine, costly choice rather than a foregone conclusion. The conflict remains mostly one-sided (the director pressures but never actively counters on-page), which keeps this just under peak tension bands.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.0)
    The core stake—how to responsibly support Hector’s bid for a second chance—is established early and stays coherent. Pressure escalates quietly but clearly as the chaplain moves from worry about breaking the heart to recognizing that his board report itself must change nature. The decisive tightening is his commitment to a structured apprenticeship and restitution plan, which narrows options beyond “praise vs. warning.” Still, the on-page sense of risk and potential fallout could be sharpened to fully match top-tier tension.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—daring to pursue an unheard, possibly futile destiny—is clear, and the discovery/ringing of the bell is a real tightening of that stake. However, conflict is largely internal and atmospheric; the environment menaces, but we rarely see a concrete “no” or a genuine near-failure that forces a change in tactics. Her agency is strong (choosing to follow the map, to slot the arrow tip, to pull the bell), and those choices do reconfigure her world, but the path feels more fated than hard-won. The absence of a sharper resistance point keeps pressure just below elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether and how to intervene in a system that turns disappearance into purchasable silence—is clear and coherently pressured. Escalation is mostly conceptual rather than kinetic, but it tightens meaningfully: each layer she penetrates reveals deeper corporate malfeasance and narrows ethical options. The peak choice (leak vs. obey vs. a third path of honoring Lia’s pattern) feels earned, though the lack of immediate external jeopardy keeps the tension at a contemplative, not harrowing, register. That quietness is a design choice but slightly mutes visceral stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether empathy can be turned into costly shared action rather than blame—is clear and escalates from abstract need to specific obligations (rescuing children, opening cellars, the narrator’s physical accompaniment). The middle tightening comes through the shard’s conditional repair: it responds only to committed, non-posturing choices, thematically prefiguring the envoys’ test. However, in the climax the envoys’ shift from readiness to flare to cooperative planning happens with relatively little resistance; we don’t see a full test or near-failure of the fragile truce. Stakes are morally and practically real, but the pressure curve is more graceful than sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to proceed with euthanasia or keep living in this liminal, listening state—is established early and deepened through the waiting-period law and the routines of volunteering. Pressure escalates not via big plot twists but through intensifying encounters with “approaching endings”: trawling storm debris, hearing reels squeal, then the high-stakes ice crack that nearly claims the boy. That near-disaster creates the clearest tightening, reweighting death as both imminent and postponable, and it pushes the narrator into a costly choice to defer the appointment again. The conflict remains primarily internal, but the external incident is well chosen to crystallize that internal calculus.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the traveler will continue in a painful pattern of “hoarded silence” or risk rediscovering their relationship—is clear and escalates from casual inquiry to a live phone call. The sentinel’s choice to expose their own past failure and pour out the second glass as libation is a credible tightening, making the counsel costed rather than abstract. However, the traveler’s shift from lost to ready-to-call occurs with little on-page resistance or back-and-forth, so the pressure curve feels smooth rather than truly testing. Consequences remain mostly implied rather than dramatized beyond the call itself.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether they can create a structure that preserves wisdom without caging it—is clear but stays mostly conceptual, with low on-page threat beyond Lio’s warning and the tyrant anecdote. Pressure deepens once (Lio’s scar story and the explicit hinge warning), and the arrival of the echo validates the risk, yet there’s no sharp reversal or concrete near-failure. The work proceeds steadily rather than under visible jeopardy; the cost (lifelong, sometimes painful listening) is articulated more thematically than through hard trade-offs in the moment. As textured-stakes fiction it functions well, but for elite venues the escalation could use one more pressured, specific test of their ethic.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether pain can be transmuted into communal art that holds rather than fractures them—is clear but remains quietly scaled. Pressure does deepen: skeptical questions (“why we were making garlands from sorrow”), the children’s reframing, the approaching storm that physically tests the corridor, and the choice to continue and reinforce the structure under weather threat. However, the narrator never faces a sharply narrowing choice or explicit loss; the piece opts for a gentle, steadily intensifying field of pressure rather than a pointed inflection. The resolution is earned but nearly frictionless, which slightly blunts the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether culture and language can still grow without new definitions—is clear and externally pressured by the summons to testify. Escalation is gentle and primarily internal: preparing his evidence, then risking it before risk-averse custodians, then relinquishing the crystal. However, the pressure never quite tightens into a moment where a genuine alternative path feels live; his course feels inevitable rather than contested. The cost is more conceptual than personal, which softens the felt stakes despite the elegant design.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving some trace of aging against erasure by time, tide, and his own mind—is signaled early and coherently tightened. Conflict escalates as his strategies (chalk, arrows) are partially undone by the environment, and the awareness of loss “occurring early” sharpens the cost. The choice to obey his own chalked command not to rewind and to leave the garden with only partial guidance is a quiet but decisive stance that forecloses easier reassurances. Pressure remains largely internal and atmospheric rather than sharply dramatized, but it does deepen credibly under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator can stabilize timekeeping enough to capture the comet’s dust while navigating their own fear of loss—is signaled early and carried through. Pressure escalates with the quake and the discovery of the floating governor, culminating in the decisive act of reseating it and trusting the leaf’s timing to set exposures. Internal and external conflicts interweave effectively, as Lina’s departure reshapes how the narrator meets turbulence and defines “repair.” However, the on-page sense of jeopardy remains more lyrical than visceral, so while tension is coherent, it never quite bites as hard as it could.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.8)
    The central stake—reuniting the sisters and executing a clean goodbye before Ruth dies—is explicit and consistently pressured by the ticking “days, maybe a day.” Escalation is quiet but real: uncertainty whether Lena will come, the fragile apology, and the high-wire act of timing words to the final chord. Agency is focused in the narrator and Ruth, whose decisions to call again, go to the rooftop, and practice the cutoff foreclose alternative, messier endings. The cost—Ruth’s death, the finite chance at reconciliation, and the sharpness of such precision—is unmistakable by the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—learning where shadows go without harming the isle or the sleepers—is clear, and pressure tightens when the Archivist reveals the pods’ function and forbids prying. Escalation is primarily conceptual rather than confrontational, with the main turn being the construction and activation of the loop-model that reveals the truth about shadows. The apprentice’s agency matters (choosing the respectful method, closing the ring instead of seizing more insight), but we never feel a strong, competing urge to violate the rules or a concrete risk of failure on the page. The result is a thoughtful, gently tense progression rather than a sharply escalating conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stakes—finding the real boy and redressing the earlier misjudgment of the father—are clear and remain coherent. Escalation is primarily conceptual and emotional rather than peril-driven; the risk of losing the boy to the garden is implied, but the on-page resistance is minimal and the garden reads as fundamentally benevolent. The key tightening is the choice to descend into the “cleft in certainty” and then to perform the reparative acts (fox’s bones, apology) rather than retreat into skepticism. Because overt danger and hard trade-offs are soft-pedaled, the tension is strong but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—how to hold or release the sea’s hush without erasing either safety or song—is signaled clearly once the pearl appears. Pressure tightens around the binary choice (“mirror-quiet sea” vs “storms with sharp teeth”) and is resolved through a third, risk-bearing option of integration that still recognizes cost. The conflict is largely internal and ethical but remains concrete via consequences for the village and sea life; it does not stall into abstraction. If anything, the stakes could be made slightly more immediate on the page, but for this length the escalation feels sufficient and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—how the narrator will live with the aftermath of their viral confession—is clear, and there is a meaningful deepening when Miri asks whether they will speak again publicly. The narrator’s choice of “maybe later… when the work has grown enough to carry my fear” forecloses the path of immediate re-exposure and commits to the more demanding, slower path of practice. However, escalation is mostly tonal and interior; pressure never quite reaches a sharp crux, so tension stays gentle rather than taut. For a lyric quiet piece it’s strong, but not maximally charged.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—the narrator’s willingness to confront and truthfully relinquish abandoned work rather than accept a comforting lie—is clear and tight. Pressure escalates as the current deepens, the cameos demand accountability, and the “easy ending” temptation is named then rejected in favor of pushing to the source. Agency is central: turning upstream, accepting the girl’s rebuke, and choosing to solemnize rather than erase are concrete stance shifts with emotional cost. The escalation is more deepening than sharp reversal, which slightly softens the sense of peril despite the strong internal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—renewing the sacred covenant so bees, roots, and water thrive—is clear and present from early on. Pressure escalates in a quiet, accumulative way: anticipation, Lio’s careful construction, partial success, the “snag,” the search for correct orientation, and finally speaking in the tree’s grammar once alignment is achieved. The snag and the shadow-wheel alignment provide a genuine tightening of options and a moment where the ritual might fail or misfire. Still, the conflict never quite sharpens into a felt risk with visible loss; it’s beautifully textured but emotionally low-temperature compared to elite-level high-stakes work.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—find Fen before “white noise” erases him—comes through clearly, and the mapping ritual functions as the on-page pressure test of that desire. Escalation is more deepening than tightening: accumulating beats of preparation, then the braid of heartbeats, then a map and a chosen direction. Conflict stays largely internal and situational; nothing seriously obstructs her ritual, and we never see an option foreclosed beyond general time and cold. The result is resonant but a shade underpowered for top-tier stakes/escalation bands.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—repairing/tuning the timer as an ethical instrument of “wonder”—is clear but gently pressured. There is one real tightening when he goes deeper to hunt “risky” seasonal voices, yet the danger never bites or forces a painful trade-off beyond mild exertion. Internal and external conflict are understated, resulting in almost no sense of jeopardy or loss if he failed. The resolution feels earned conceptually but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether to stay bound to the valley’s burdens or leave—is present early in subtext (“boundary-lessly trapped”) and becomes explicit when the valley arrives to ask about the cost of staying vs. leaving. Pressure escalates through the appearance of the valley-figure and the alignment of lamp and star, forcing a stance crystallization rather than mere drift. The choice to accept the circular freedom of service, with its binding “ribbon,” feels like a genuine trade-off. The conflict is mostly internal and textural, so the escalation is subtle rather than gripping, but it is coherent and consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—how to live with loss without erasing or being devoured by it—is clear from early on and remains coherent. Pressure deepens as she moves from intention to enactment: carving the cage, choosing to include the mane, adding the sugar “clock,” and finally pocketing the object and accepting its ongoing use. The escalation is textural rather than confrontational, but the narrowing of options is visible in her decision to commit to this ritual path instead of any grander or more avoidant gesture. It stops short of a sharp reversal, which keeps it just under higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.8)
    The central conflict between restarting the carousel (and the oppressive rhythm it represents) and letting the archipelago and rains fail is clear and sharpened by the ghost’s explicit opposition. Pressure escalates when the ghost forbids restarting and then demands a specific tribute, forcing Mara into a costly trade-off. Her agency drives the resolution: she argues via collected stories, reframes what “erasure” means, and chooses to pay with a deeply held vow. The stakes could feel even more immediate with a small additional beat of on-page consequence or hesitation after the payment, but the trade-off is already strong for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether hope and purpose can be re-engineered into a dead space via infrastructure—is clear and escalates as she moves from solitary tinkering to partial reanimation to sharing the space with townspeople. Pressure deepens via practical constraints (corroded valves, limited solar power, “how many lights she can afford to keep alive”) and an ethical calculus about sustainable activation. However, the conflict remains gently textured and largely unopposed; there is little sense that failure meaningfully imperils Mara or others beyond disappointment. The quiet escalation suits the piece’s mode but keeps tension below top-tier intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—can she find a way to honor her musical impulse without betraying the sanctuary—is clearly signaled and tightened as she actively tests the bell. Pressure escalates when the first tremor appears and when she presses again, risking a breach of the hush; the decision to bear the bell instead of ringing it is a genuine narrowing of options. Conflict remains primarily internal, but the institutional constraint of silence is a real external pressure that shapes every move. The stakes are subtle and literary rather than visceral, but for this mode they feel sufficiently sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—exposing deliberate flooding and its human cost—is evident early and escalates as the narrator moves from suspicion to hard evidence to a public accusation. The key tightening is the discovery of the crates and mechanical evidence, followed by the foreman’s arrival, which forces the narrator to choose between flight and a carefully staged confrontation. The siren blast driving neighbors to witness makes the cost and risk of that choice tangible, even if reprisals are only implied. Some potential dangers (legal, physical) remain offstage rather than dramatized, slightly softening the sense of immediate price.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stakes—rescuing braided agricultural knowledge before the dock (and thus the rope-language) is destroyed—are clear and present. Pressure escalates when the fisherman introduces the council’s deadline, forcing the narrator to balance “infinite patience” with the need to work quickly and translate knowledge into new forms. The choice to teach the fisherman and to plant the sprig in that moment constitutes a meaningful tightening and partial solution with real risk still hanging over them. The cost of potential failure is conceptually strong but could be made a hair more visceral in the closing beats to heighten felt tension.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—how to live with absence and whether to remain or keep “leaving without leaving”—is established early and tightened via Mira’s urgent request to pre-mourn her husband. Pressure deepens as the narrator commits to projecting presence, then confronts the cost of their vocation by writing their own living obituary and facing the lack of ships. The letter and the decision to stay while still “carrying their stories across horizons” form a credible escalation and earned stance. Conflict is largely internal and situational, but it remains coherent and culminates in a costly renunciation of literal departure.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—protecting the egg/beauty against a utilitarian, law-bound system—is clear and escalates through the Keepers’ missives, the palace’s instability, and the arrival of enforcers. The prince’s refusal, secret nurturing work, and final public presentation of the hatchling are credible, pressure-driven choices. However, when the Keepers arrive, their opposition evaporates almost immediately under the bird’s song, softening the sense of cost and narrowing of options at the peak. The conflict thus feels profound conceptually but slightly under-tested in concrete, resistant opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.3)
    The core stake—whether harm and inherited guilt can be transmuted into a sustaining, watchful mercy—is clear and is tested by the boy’s arrival and direct statement about her father. Pressure deepens as she must demonstrate (not just claim) that scars can sing, and the boy’s wrapped forearm makes the work’s cost immediate. Escalation is subtle but real: from private ritual to shared teaching to leaving the coin behind, a small yet genuine renunciation. The conflict remains almost entirely internal and never truly corners her, so stakes feel profound but low-intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—reviving the city’s memory—is legible early and tracked through the search, the confession, and the opening of the box. Escalation is subtle but real: from exploratory following of glass to the moral/emotional price of telling a self-unknown secret, then to the risk of unleashing unknown forces from the box. The resolution clearly stems from the protagonist’s choices under pressure rather than coincidence. The main limitation is a relatively assured victory once the box is accessed; external risk feels low, with most of the danger internal and somewhat underplayed in bodily terms.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—how to share light without harm, and whether traditions of fear or care will guide that—is clear and present early. Escalation comes through deepening: the stranger’s burned-garden past sharpens the cost of failure, and the joint rebuilding of the orrery is the key tightening choice. However, resistance is almost entirely conceptual; there’s little sense that their attempt might fail or that they might diverge in aims on the page. The result is emotionally satisfying but low-suspense, more contemplative than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—finding a faithful form for collective grief—is announced early and steadily pressured by the accumulation of ribbons, notes, and voices. Escalation arrives when the familiar braid method fails to resolve “what had no edge,” forcing the narrator to seek her grandmother’s guidance and then to break her own pattern by loosening the braid. That decision reweights the work from representation to receptivity and clearly alters options. The conflict remains contemplative rather than sharply oppositional, so the sense of risk is refined rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how he will adjust the town’s time to reflect true, earned forgiveness rather than convenience—is clearly signaled and sharpened as he moves from abstract complaints (“hours still limp”) to the concrete act of shifting pellets. Escalation is quiet but real: the pressure peaks when he reaches his own name on the handle and must decide whether to lighten his guilt. The choice to “replace three shots and remove two” and to withhold full absolution for himself, while easing others’, narrows options going forward and carries emotional cost. The only slight limitation is that all pressure remains fully interior; there’s no on-page resistance or counterforce beyond his own conscience, though it largely suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether unresolved intentions of the dead can be softened or re-mapped—is present early and tightens around the chess tutor’s unfinished game. Escalation is internal and accumulative rather than dramatic: Rowan focuses from general echo-listening to a specific case, decodes its “map of wanting,” and then enacts a costly, time-bound ritual with the clock and board. The price is subtle but legible: he commits time, attention, and emotional labor to revising a story he could have left hardened. The conflict never sharpens into true peril or dilemma, which keeps it strong but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—how the city will bind itself to its future—is clearly signaled when the Council demands a script to “prevail against famine, revolt, and thaw.” Pressure coherently increases with their fearful insistence on certainty and the narrator’s counterproposal of flexible, constraint-aware models. However, most tension remains intellectual and atmospheric; there is no on-page moment where the Council nearly imposes decrees or threatens concrete reprisal, so the risk feels slightly abstract. The eventual agreement to a trellis-first approach is satisfying but could benefit from a sharper sense of what is sacrificed or left dangerously unresolved.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—reviving forbidden stories under surveillance—emerges early and tightens meaningfully when the broadcast warns of searchlights and when boots pass outside. Mara’s choice not to cloak her answer, and later to trust the gathered group to breathe and hide as a unit, provides clear agency under pressure. The storm-of-strings sequence and dust-wall of rain offer a strong escalation, but the direct, on-page price for defiance remains relatively abstract (they evade danger rather than suffer a visible loss). The tension works well for a quiet, lyric piece, but a sharper sense of what might be irretrievably lost would deepen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stakes—whether Soren can bear a form of truth/forgiveness that does not promise safety, and how the narrator enforces the gallery’s harsher mercy—are clear and grow in pressure. Escalation is quiet but real: from conversational intake to the decisive refusal (“I say no, because here the end is always ash”) to the shared act of burning and scattering. The cost of losing the image he thought he came for, and accepting ash inside the mask instead, is legible and thematically apt. A slightly sharper on-page moment of resistance from Soren could have heightened the sense of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether knowledge and craft will be preserved as living practice or entombed in institutions—emerges clearly and tightens around the decision of what to do with the cog and ledger. Pressure escalates through the offers from Archivists and Choir and the need for tools/allies, leading to the “third way” choice and clandestine teaching. However, antagonistic forces remain mostly abstract; we’re told both factions “want what I found” but never see concrete threat or consequence beyond implication. The conflict works well at an intellectual/moral level but could feel sharper with one more on-page test of risk or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether people marked by neighborhood violence can risk genuine harmony together—is clear early in lines about calling them “not as escape, but as a way to look at one another without flinching.” Pressure escalates when Reza’s trauma is triggered and the nurse’s fear surfaces, forcing the session to decide between fracturing and deepening. The teacher’s choice to turn the rosette’s nick toward their fear and proceed with the exercise is a meaningful tightening that narrows options. The cost is mainly emotional/relational rather than materially sharp, but it’s felt and proportionate to the story’s scale.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether this forbidden act of culinary/mnemonic rebellion can begin—is legible, and the alignment deadline plus the risk of Quiet Diet orthodoxy provide soft external pressure. Escalation comes through density rather than reversals: cleaning, planting, celestial peak, Kye’s emotional breakthrough, and the seed’s sprouting all tighten the piece’s emotional and conceptual stakes. However, concrete antagonistic pressure is mostly off-stage, so choices never quite feel pinched or dangerous in the moment. The result is resonant but relatively low-tension compared to elite, high-stakes short fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central stake—whether the drones/tower will recover and thus whether “wonder” can persist in this mechanized city—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure escalates from diagnosis (drones spinning purposelessly) to discovery (hidden harp; algorithm overtraining) to an improvised, risky solution (mounting the storm’s “dowry” hum) that might not work. The price is mostly thematic—risking failure, eschewing easy lies or coin—but it is felt in Mara’s cliff-edge laughter and the keeper’s acceptance of his nuisance-burden. Tension is quieter than high-drama pieces but consistently present and never static.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake is the narrator’s need to restore conversation between house and inhabitant, and the pressure slowly tightens as subtle house-responses (photo, drafts, latch) test whether the ritual is “working.” However, conflict remains very low-key; there’s no real sense that failure would foreclose a specific path beyond a generalized loneliness or unrest. The key turn—recognizing the relationship as mutual company and making a vow—is earned but not heavily pressured, so escalation feels graceful rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the city remains trapped in rigid certainties or opens to nuance—is clear and gradually intensified through successive revelations. Escalation happens via deepening understanding and widening reach (from individual memory to city-wide humming) rather than through overt peril, which suits the mode but keeps tension more contemplative than urgent. The protagonist’s agency (choosing to use cracks, praising the tin fish, invoking the bishop, rereading inscriptions) drives the turn toward change. Cost is present but mostly conceptual and historical (acknowledging that care misjudged its dose, that certainty harmed children) rather than dramatized as a painful on-page sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether regretful desire can ever exhaust itself or instead becomes “motion without fuel”—is clear and sharpened by the bargain (keep hope if perpetual motion is only penance, or step off if disproved). Pressure escalates via the rupture that momentarily offers a way back to Tuesday, then tightens when the staircase demands a rigorous proof with his hope and confinement on the line. The climax resides in accepting continued ascent as duty, a choice that forecloses escape. The conflict is largely internal and conceptual, but the story maintains tension without feeling static.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether kindness between strangers can be methodically proven and kept alive—remains coherent, and each visitor incrementally raises emotional investment. However, pressure never forces Anya toward a sharp trade-off; she’s not tempted to abandon the project, close the vents, or weaponize the brush, so escalation is mostly additive rather than constrictive. The ledger and final vow do register a cost in ongoing vigilance and fatigue, but that cost is more implied than dramatized. It’s strong quiet tension, but not yet at the intensity or sharpness of a top-tier conflict arc.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central stake—whether memory/art will be lost to darkness and water or actively reclaimed—tightens effectively as the narrator moves from passive “museum hours” for refugees to organizing a dangerous recovery expedition. The arrival of Anno’s second lens is a strong mid-story turn that forces a real choice against prior caution. The crossing and trunk recovery pay off this pressure, and the emotional stakes of giving the displaced a “missing parent” craft are clear. The only limiting factor is that moment-to-moment jeopardy, especially physical peril at the waterfall, stays more lyrical than visceral, so escalation registers more conceptually than in the gut.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—defying fate long enough to retrieve or reconfigure the loss of the sister—tightens effectively once the device is activated and her apparition appears “wet with storm, her eyes full of refusal.” The key turn is realizing that true rescue is impossible and choosing instead to become guardian of an inward light that alters ships’ fates, sacrificing normal visibility and time. Stakes are metaphysical but grounded by concrete consequences (rooms emptying forever, or ships arriving unseen), and the ongoing need to pay with “a year from my hoard of regrets” keeps pressure alive past the climax. The conflict could register as slightly cool for some readers—more conceptual than visceral—but it escalates coherently within the chosen lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—confront and disarm fear using the curse—is clear and tightened through deliberate action (entering the maze, placing the clasp, stepping into the booth, speaking the name). Escalation is primarily internal but real: the key tightening is the confession of forbidden love, which enables the trap and risks profound vulnerability. The photo strip capturing fear, and its subsequent unraveling, resolves both external (being hunted) and internal (shame, secrecy) conflicts with costs in exposure and the loss of the advisor. While the pressure is more lyrical than harrowing, it remains coherent and builds to a satisfying, earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—saving the Tympanum orchard from being sundered—is clear early and tightened as the “singular swell” approaches and leans harder against the ring. Escalation comes through intensifying pattern and response rather than dramatic reversals, but the mounting pressure of timing, pattern complexity, and cloud-shift adjustments reads. The internal conflict between youthful defiance and present-tense conversation with the sea threads through the action, though the outcome feels relatively secure once his method is underway, softening perceived risk. The price is mostly conceptual and energetic (unceasing vigilance, humility before weather) rather than a sharply dramatized loss.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator will risk breaching the sealed boundary to seek dangerous knowledge—is legible and sharpened by the city’s “sunwashed dread” and memory of the lost expedition. There is a meaningful tightening when she cracks the latch and steps onto the elder turtle, foreclosing simple safety. However, once she commits, opposition is mostly atmospheric; the watchers answer without real resistance, and the city’s heaving shift reads as consequential but relatively smooth. The piece succeeds as quiet, situational pressure, but escalation never quite bites as hard as the premises’ implied risk.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central conflict—whether to exhume buried truth at the risk of social rupture—is well-defined, and the stakes are clear through Tomas’s fear of “blister[ing] the town” and frightening children from the west stair. Tension deepens with the physical descent and the factual revelation that the town grieved a phantom fire, which conceptually raises the cost of silence. However, opposition softens quickly: Tomas’s resistance collapses after a brief exchange, and there are no real setbacks or competing tactics under pressure. The final decision to publish feels ethically weighted but insufficiently hard-fought on the page, keeping escalation in the strong-but-not-searing range.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether and how he can preserve and reweave the pavilion’s “interlaced absence” into memory—is clear and coheres. Pressure escalates via the shrinking tidal window and the ethical weight of placing increasingly personal, specific notes (especially after discovering S.G.’s ghostly predecessor). His final stance—committing to return “until I am less man than listening notation”—constitutes an earned stasis with a visible existential cost. The conflict remains intentionally low-boil; a touch more on-page friction or threat (physical or institutional) could intensify the sense of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are primarily moral and epistemic—what will count as “authentic” history in a corrupted city—and that dominant stake is clear early (“summoned not to salvage but to understand”). Pressure deepens through the realization that the forged stamp legitimized dispossession, including the loss of the narrator’s own house, and through the choice to proceed methodically rather than indulge rage. Escalation is quiet but genuine: reordering the ledgers by imagery reveals the before/after frond shift, then the narrator stamps “four final notes,” foreclosing complicity in the smooth crescent’s lie. The conflict never becomes viscerally dangerous on the page, so tension remains high-level rather than bodily tense.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator can transform devouring grief into something bearable enough to live and work with—is clear early and tightens through the thousand-crane requirement and the labor it entails. Escalation proceeds via density: more dreams recorded, more cranes folded, body and time visibly spent until “fingers are thin maps.” The climactic ritual (lanterns opened, cranes rising, shadow’s return) is a meaningful turn that reweights the central pressure. Because the conflict is almost entirely internal and metaphoric, there’s a slight softening of felt risk compared to the intensity of the conceit, but the cost is still legible.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.5)
    The central stake—whether to exploit the reservoir of unused potential linked to a massacre—is clear and sharpened by institutional vs personal pressures. Escalation is primarily internal but legible: scientific curiosity and professional obligation collide with triggered memory as they locate the valley “right where the convoy dust once hung,” tightening until the choice to leave the pool intact. The cost (grant expectations, possible loss of a “miracle,” and refusal to weaponize trauma) is clearly stated and felt, especially in “saving nothing on purpose.” The only restraint is that antagonistic pressure from the board/grant remains offstage, so external conflict is more implied than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—finding a “frequency of belonging” that can guide them home—is established early and pursued through the drones’ experiment, which yields a non-obvious but earned result. Escalation is quiet but real: from mere listening to the realization that the chip now casts only spaces, forcing a reorientation of method and destination. The final choice to trust and follow a map of rests is a genuine narrowing of options, though its danger remains abstract rather than concretely dramatized. A slightly sharper sense of what’s at risk if they misread the silences would heighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether he will continue to monetize fabricated histories or face and disclose a damaging truth—is clear early and tightens as discoveries reveal deeper layers of harm (three children, the master’s mark, his own sale). The decisive shift comes when he breaks the “sold and sealed” crescent and then chooses to write to Mara and stand at the terrace, explicitly rejecting his prior mode of transactional comfort. Internal and external stakes (his own identity and Mara’s stolen past) are well braided. The only limitation is that all opposition is inherited rather than actively contesting his moves in the moment, so tension is more moral than situational.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—conducting a just, safe exchange that honors specific grief—is legible early and coherently pursued. Escalation arrives mainly through Daro’s refusal and the demand that apologies become particular rather than generic, which meaningfully tightens the moral pressure. The negotiator’s insistence on “plain words without armor” and slowing the guard underlines an ethical cost: time, tension, and personal risk of misstep. What holds this short of top-tier is that the threat of collapse or retaliation remains implied rather than dramatized in a concrete, narrowing way.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—whether he will confront his culpability with his sister—is clear early and deepens as we move from intention to the embodied difficulty of launch and crossing. There’s a meaningful tightening at the midpoint when the precise nature of his error (“marked a bearing wrong”) is revealed, raising the moral cost of full confession. Agency drives the outcome: he chooses to paddle, to tell the “pure” version, and then to walk home in a subtly altered stance. The conflict remains mostly interior and quiet; it’s excellently handled but doesn’t quite hit the most extreme band of on-page pressure or explicit trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether he can pursue genuine empathetic repair rather than self-erasure—is clear early and tightened at the confession/payment beat. The sentinel’s demand and the lake’s bruised response dramatize moral stakes rather than leaving them abstract, and the requirement to spread empathy in a hostile city extends pressure beyond the cave. Internal and external conflicts interweave well (guilt vs. mission, currents vs. “passages of less regret”), with the final release of the vial as a costly choice rather than a cure-all. Escalation is more deepening than reversal, but it fits the lyric mode and sustains tension.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator will accept metamorphosis to reconnect with her beloved—is signaled early and deepens as she prepares the ritual and physically begins to change. The inner conflict between grief’s desire to shatter and love’s push to bend is credible and carries through to the halfway “bridge” moment the fox names. Escalation is more textural than suspenseful, but there is a clear tightening from preparation to partial change to final commitment to “finish the walk into feathers.” The cost is legible if somewhat gently met; resistance could be sharpened slightly for even greater pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—how she will relate to time now that a baby exists—is signaled early and sharpened by the midwife’s advice versus the stars “counting me backward.” Pressure deepens with the ritual demand to fetch lost minutes and the moral calculus of promising concrete future sacrifices for each one. Escalation is primarily internal and textural rather than confrontational, but the glade’s “demand” and the narrator’s acceptance of specific costs prevent the conflict from remaining static. There is no sharp external reversal, so tension is strong but relatively quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—opening the locked dimension gently enough to safeguard the child and honor pacifism—is signaled early and tightened through pressure from the warhead’s proposed violent shortcut, the physical challenge of reaching the lock, and the door’s scar-like resistance. Escalation is more internal than combative: the need for joy to lighten the narrator at key moments, their confrontation with neglected wounds during shadow work, and the risk that the door might demand violence provide real but quiet tension. The decisive choice is to persist in stitching with “breath and mercy” instead of yielding to impact, which forecloses the warhead path with an evident emotional cost. Stakes remain slightly abstracted (no immediate external threat beyond existential loneliness), but for this mode the pressure is coherent and sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—rescuing the boy’s mother from a live volcanic/seaside hazard—is clear once the boy speaks, and pressure tightens as they commit to the dangerous shoal path and cave amid the volcano’s muttering. Escalation is driven by Mara’s agency: she chooses to act on the rumor, to recruit neighbors and tools she’s planted, and to risk the fumarole-skirted route. Cost is evident in her expending her precious fireflies and her last coins, and in the palpable risk to all three lives. The main softness is that the rescue proceeds with almost no reversals or genuine near-failures, keeping tension high but not knife-edge.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—a silent, non-destructive revolution versus obedience to the magistrates’ order—is clear and thematically rich. There is one primary tightening when the broken wheel must be improvised with the quill holder, which narrows options and demands a concrete sacrifice. However, antagonistic pressure is almost entirely offstage; there are no complications, near-failures, or reactive counterforces, so tension stays more conceptual than visceral. As a result, escalation feels smooth and assured rather than truly hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—holding the shore together long enough to fulfill a promise—is clear early and threads consistently through the piece. Pressure escalates as the narrator moves from daily pattern-work to an unprecedented, maximal attempt (more stones, spelling her name, joining with her at the edge), with the risk of failure highlighted in the precognitive glimpses. The resolution is earned by his committed use of the method and the repeated promise, and we feel the cost in the provisional nature of the dawn-bound success. Some of the conflict remains more atmospheric than sharply contested; the text rarely forces an explicit trade-off where one desire must visibly lose.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Ilya will remain erased or risk articulating his forbidden poem—is legible early and tightens as he moves from waiting to confronting the observatory’s history of captured “scars.” The storm’s rhythm and Mara’s arrival both raise internal pressure toward a single choice: stay a silent observer or read to the storm and town. The escalation is primarily emotional and conceptual, not confrontational, but the final act of reading under the storm-as-truth frame feels like a real, costly commitment. Stakes remain somewhat abstract (we never see concrete repercussions), but the emotional price of breaking censorship is clear enough for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central stake—whether the overture arrives intact as a peace-bringing protocol or is co-opted by the council—is clearly stated, and the duel concretely escalates pressure around that stake. The fencing match is a strong tightening: physical risk, ideological clash, and the possibility of losing the card collapse into one beat. The final choice to trust the non-courier with the card and walk together toward the council crystallizes the conflict into a stance rather than a neat resolution. However, the danger of failure and its consequences remain mostly intellectual; we never feel the stakes bite in a visceral or time-urgent way.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—can they reclaim the condemned library as a living, communal resistance—is clear and coheres from early on. Escalation is mostly accumulative rather than confrontational: prying bars, weaving ivy, planting contraband seeds, gathering neighbors, then openly posting a sign and buying nails under their own names. The patrol car and memory of prison introduce real risk, but external pressure never tightens into a concrete on-page test or forced trade-off; they are not visibly cornered or made to choose between safety and the project in a single sharpened moment. The conflict is rich but remains relatively low-intensity, limiting the sense of a price paid under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—can art/time be bent enough to retrieve Mara and renegotiate blame—is clear and emotionally live, and the pressure deepens as the protagonist commits to the arbor and the unfinished prelude that “asked for two hands and forgiveness.” Escalation is mostly internal and textural (music intensifying, compasses steadied, ghosts approaching), which suits the mode but slightly blurs concrete risk. The reunion and return come with only lightly sketched cost (four clock beats, an unnamed “price the corridor had demanded”), so the sense of trade-off is more conceptual than viscerally felt. Still, the protagonist’s choice to act against his own skepticism about causality gives the climax genuine tension.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the island’s cultural memory will thin into forgetfulness—is clear from the outset and steadily pressured by the monsoon clock and the risk of planting the seed in the wrong place. Escalation is gentle but present: the seed’s census-test that makes some leave, the discovery of the missing reef treaty through fishermen’s dreams, and the looming storm all narrow options. Agency is strong in the sequence of ritual choices (where to plant, what to recite, how to waken sites), and the cost of curation vs. forgetting is legible. The conflict remains largely conceptual and ceremonial rather than viscerally tense, which slightly mutes the sense of danger.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator can transform paralyzing, unsaid apology into an active, non-destructive tending—is signaled early and stays in focus. Pressure escalates quietly but clearly as each step of the ritual narrows options: choosing to cut “nearly nothing,” submitting to the visions the blue offers, and then speaking at last. The meaningful tightening lies in his refusal to seek retroactive absolution; instead he accepts a costlier stance of tending regret without erasing it. The conflict remains largely internal and meditative, but for a lyric piece it shows sufficient progression and consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure is coherent under the Situational lens; the conflict is between the community's desire for restoration and the reality of the damage. The protagonist exercises agency by enforcing a "closed wild arithmetic" (composting the weak), though the external opposition remains largely passive entropy.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes are primarily retrospective ("surviving the attempt") rather than active in the scene; the pressure is atmospheric rather than urgent. The protagonist faces no active opposition, making the "steadily adaptive" triumph feel procedural rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are primarily internal and textural, fitting the quiet apocalypse, but the arrival of the fisherman and the city delegates provides necessary external pressure. The escalation is steady, moving from private experiment to public performance to civic restoration. The cost is felt in the "shivering" effort and the emotional endurance required to bridge the silence, though the external opposition is gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.8)
    The narrative builds coherent pressure through the "tapping" of the lens and the "distress signals," creating a palpable sense of urgency. The closure lands a strong Conceptual Repricing—trading the undertaker's anonymity for a "permanent address" in the city's memory—though the physical cost is mitigated by the sudden magical resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes are clear, but the resolution of the central conflict (Noor's cynicism) feels rushed and low-cost; the soup delivery instantly cures his doubt. The "watchers" remain an abstract threat rather than an active pressure in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is minimal to nonexistent; the "ache" to heal is stated but does not create active pressure or difficult choices on the page. The "friend" and the "woman" align perfectly with the narrator's goal, removing any interpersonal or supernatural tension. Escalation is merely a deepening of breath, lacking a sense of risk or potential failure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.9)
    The pressure of the "retrocognitive trap" is well-defined, escalating through the sensory distortion of the bridges. While the stakes are clear, the protagonist's agency in the climax acts upon a compliant object rather than overcoming active resistance, softening the peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation is driven by the protagonist's strategic choices, culminating in a standoff where he accepts physical immobility to force a negotiation. The cost is visible and felt—he cannot run, only endure—which earns the shift in the antagonist's response.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clearly internalized and escalate through the technical process of refining the device. The climax provides a quiet but devastating confirmation of the father's "retreat," delivering a felt cost without needing melodramatic external conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the declared stakes (life/death) are high, the on-page conflict is low-pressure. The protagonist's hesitation is resolved almost instantly by the magical reassurance of the door and the flower codes, bypassing the necessary struggle or sacrifice that defines a "hard choice."

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=4.5)
    External and internal opposition are virtually nonexistent; the environment is benevolent ("thaws... are kindly teachers") and mechanical failure is soothed by song. Without a "meaningful tightening" or a threat that forces a trade-off, the narrative lacks the torque necessary for dramatic engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation is distinct, moving from discovery to a physical trap that forces a confrontation. While the antagonist falling into a pre-set floor trap is slightly convenient, the protagonist's preparation ("chalked the steps") earns the victory.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.0)
    Escalation is primarily thematic and internal rather than pressurized by external obstacles; the "endless night" is a condition rather than an active antagonist. However, the final exchange between the commander and the oracle crystallizes the stakes (survival vs. endurance) effectively. The conflict resolves through a shift in perspective, which fits the fable mode.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.8)
    The stakes are quiet but clear: the struggle between the city’s demand for efficiency/erasure and the protagonist’s desire for retention/origin. The escalation is internal but manifests in tangible actions (bowing the violin, slowing the sweep). The resolution earns its peace by paying the cost of the violin and trading efficiency for insight.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.8)
    The stakes (truth vs. fabrication) are clear, but the interpersonal conflict is extremely low-resistance. Rell, the antagonist, appears and capitulates instantly upon seeing the projection ("nodded once"), robbing the climax of tension. The escalation is atmospheric rather than interpersonal; the protagonist faces no active opposition, making the victory feel inevitable rather than fought for.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.9)
    The conflict is ideological but dramatized through concrete actions (measuring humidity vs. polishing marbles). The escalation is subtle but distinct, moving from skepticism to physical rejection by the maze. The cost is felt in the protagonist's physical deterioration ("bent shoulders") and the vulnerability of his "cracked proofs."

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is minimal; the story functions as a procedural of a successful experiment rather than a struggle against opposition. There is no moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt, and the "tightening" is limited to minor technical adjustments, resulting in very low narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.1)
    Tension escalates flawlessly from the decoding of the message to the impending downbeat. The climax relies on a singular, decisive act of disruption that carries professional risk and immediate physical payoff, satisfying the need for protagonist agency in resolving the threat.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes are immediate (the climbing convoy) and personal (legacy and guilt), creating a clear "now or never" pressure. The cost of the decision—curses from the valley and the admission of failure—is felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.9)
    The physical struggle with the rusted wheel effectively externalizes the internal conflict, and the pain of the beads "biting my skin" provides a felt cost. The stakes are clear, though the ease of the final discovery slightly dampens the pressure built by the descent.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.9)
    Conflict is largely man-versus-entropy, escalating effectively from the child's arrival to the city's destruction and finally the library's fracture. The stakes are clear, though the protagonist's internal struggle is quiet and philosophical. The climax choice—restraining the swan to "wait"—is a valid meaningful tightening, though the cost remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.9)
    The stakes are clear (Felix's voice), but the conflict is low-resistance; the breakthrough encounters no significant obstacles or setbacks. The "tightening" phase is atmospheric rather than psychological, missing a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.8)
    The stakes are primarily conceptual—understanding the axis to let the walls rest—which fits the tone but lacks visceral urgency or high cost. The pressure is steady but low; the "displaced axis" threatens but doesn't actively oppose the protagonist's progress.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are theoretically present (secrets, bureaucracy) but never tested; the "wind nagged" is the only opposition, and the townspeople arrive compliantly. The lack of an antagonist or obstacle means there is no escalation, only a sequence of planned events.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes are clearly defined as a battle for autonomy via philosophy; the pressure escalates coherently through the dialogue and sonic layering. While the threat remains largely intellectual/conceptual rather than visceral, the tension holds, and the "wind smelling of receipts" concretizes the thematic threat effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.5)
    Escalation is managed effectively through the intensifying "measures" of the climb and the layering of instruments. While the opposition is primarily environmental (entropy/cold), the physical cost ("knives my lungs") creates sufficient urgency to anchor the lyrical stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—escaping the loop to find connection—is signaled early and resolved decisively through the protagonist's choice to fall. The cost is tangible (loss of his unique ability), satisfying the requirement for consequence. However, the obstacle of the guard lacks genuine pressure, reading more as a ritualistic prompt than a forceful test of the protagonist's resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes are intimate and clear, but the escalation relies heavily on a guided ritual where the protagonist follows instructions rather than driving the action through difficult choices. The "cost" is the surrender of the needle and the protective numbness, which is emotionally legible but lacks a sharp, dramatized price on the page. The conflict is resolved smoothly, lacking gritty opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes are intellectualized; the potential physical threat of the follower dissolves instantly into an alliance without testing the protagonist's agency. The conflict remains abstract (truth vs. officials) and lacks visceral, rising pressure within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.7)
    Pressure escalates coherently from the technical setup to the emotional release, braiding the external plant experiment with the internal struggle. The stakes are personal and clear, though the external obstacle (opening the plant) is low-resistance compared to the internal barrier.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.1)
    The "impossible choice" creates strong initial pressure, but the protagonist's ability to negotiate a third path (offering a poem instead of his map) mitigates the felt cost. The tension resolves through ingenuity rather than a painful trade-off, which fits the lyric mode but lowers the stakes' bite.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.2)
    Pressure is atmospheric rather than dramatic; the "chronic hush" is an obstacle, but the protagonist faces no active opposition or dilemma. Assistance (the boy, the map, the diver) arrives readily, removing the need for sacrifice or ingenuity under stress. The stakes remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are clearly defined (grief vs. function) and escalate effectively through the diagnosis and calibration beats. The resolution is earned through the client’s "confession," and the cost—accepting a "careful lie" to survive—is legible and thematic.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=2.5)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent; the initiative succeeds immediately with universal approval, and the "doubt" mentioned in the finale is told, not dramatized. There are no opposing forces, risks of failure, or hard trade-offs to generate narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=4.9)
    Dramatic pressure is minimal; the protagonist encounters immediate sympathy from Neri and finds the "elusive" tag quickly. Without an antagonist, environmental obstacle, or internal stumbling block to foreclose options, the stakes remain abstract and the resolution feels gifted rather than won.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.8)
    The environmental pressure of the sleeping giant is handled with excellent tension; the "continental twitch" provides a visceral escalation. The interpersonal conflict with the Guild resolves somewhat softly with the watcher's nod, but the overarching tension of the "borrowed time" debt ensures the stakes remain felt and consequential throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.6)
    The stakes are deeply felt on an emotional level, centering on the terror of unresolved loss and the "limit" of the mathematical proof. However, the conflict remains largely internal and theoretical; the protagonist faces little external resistance or friction, making the escalation feel textural rather than visceral. The resolution is earned through ritual adherence rather than a difficult active choice.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are intimate but sharply defined; the tension between the desire to comfort and the safety of invisibility escalates naturally. The climax forces a trade-off where the protagonist creates a moment of connection at the expense of their protective secrecy.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.5)
    The conflict between the narrator's need for order and the storm's chaos escalates clearly, with a felt cost in the "wince" and the admission of losses. The shift in tactics—reconstructing beds based on water flow rather than rulers—demonstrates meaningful agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes escalate meaningfully from personal curiosity to community adaptation, creating a clear sense of purpose. However, the narrative lacks active opposition or significant pressure; the path to resolution is relatively unobstructed, preventing the tension from reaching higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story relies on atmospheric pressure rather than sharp conflict; the "faint eclipse" provides a complication, but the resolution is cooperative and smooth. While the accumulation of elements creates a form of density-based escalation, the absence of a hard trade-off or visible price limits the dramatic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.2)
    Conflict is largely atmospheric rather than active; there is no antagonist or significant obstacle preventing the restoration. The resolution feels procedural and inevitable—a ritual performed without risk of failure—resulting in low narrative pressure despite the high conceptual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.3)
    The central conflict is metaphysical, resolved through a ritualistic exchange of secrets. While the "cost" is paid in the confession beat, the protagonist faces little active resistance or temptation to turn back, making the victory feel inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.0)
    The conflict is clearly defined as Lio's fear of memory versus the need for healing, escalated by the tile's mechanical demand for "unsettled" squares. The climax forces a tangible trade-off—confessing shameful memories to achieve the magical result—demonstrating agency and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.6)
    Conflict is clearly defined through the negotiation and the looming double-cross. While the narrator's control over the situation slightly dampens the immediate sense of peril, the stakes—eternal stagnation versus a radical new existence—are communicated with high pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.0)
    Pressure is coherent and escalates from the distant patrol car to the direct confrontation in the alley. The dominant stake (Yusef's asylum) is tightened by the narrator's need to suppress his own "petty defiance," a felt emotional cost paid to secure the outcome. The climax serves as a genuine test of the narrator's discipline.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict is largely abstract (memory vs. silence) and lacks immediate pressure; the stakes of "vanished errands" feel nostalgic rather than urgent. The faltering lamp introduces a flicker of tension, but it is resolved internally without forcing a difficult trade-off or tangible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.9)
    The stakes (erasure vs. remembrance) are clear, and the discovery of the poison label escalates the conflict by offering a concrete test of the system. The confrontation with the clerk serves as a decisive tightening, confirming that the "official" world cannot be corrected. However, the conflict remains largely quiet and philosophical; the protagonist's resignation ("left him with silence") dampens the immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.0)
    The stakes escalate effectively from an abstract intellectual curiosity ("decode a riddle") to a specific, vulnerable personal reckoning. The "deepening" occurs when the compass points back to the protagonist's own memory, raising the cost of the resolution from mere observation to active participation/apology.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.0)
    The stakes collapse at the climax because the opposition (financiers) is too soft, folding without a fight. The "dual allegiance" conflict is solved by satisfying both parties completely, resulting in a "have your cake and eat it too" ending that evades necessary narrative trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.6)
    The stakes are high conceptually (loss of nature), and the pressure of the countdown is felt. However, the protagonist’s agency is limited to witnessing and enduring; the conflict is inevitable, leaving little room for active tactical shifts. The cost is realized emotionally rather than through a difficult choice between live options.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are negligible; the conflict involves a lost crate and a waiting ship, with no antagonist or meaningful time pressure to force a hard trade-off. The resolution relies on friction-free competence, lacking the escalation or cost required for literary resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes are primarily intellectual and existential rather than visceral; the journey faces little resistance from the elements ("ice receives us without cracking"), lowering tension. While the deepening of the mystery works well, the lack of active opposition or a difficult trade-off makes the "cost" of the discovery feel theoretical. The pressure is consistent but low-voltage.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the town's resistance is overcome instantly by the music. The only obstacle (the stamping boy) is trivial and resolved with a gesture, leaving the stakes theoretical rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.5)
    The stakes are clear and high (life vs. mission). While the inciting struggle with the net is resolved relatively quickly via the "stop kicking" beat, the persistent, escalating pressure of the oxygen supply ("numbers that end journeys") maintains tension effectively to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure builds consistently as the narrator descends into the prison, tightening the stakes between "lazy truth" and necessary work. While the antagonist (silence/belief) is abstract, the internal and thematic conflict creates sufficient narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.5)
    Pressure escalates coherently through the ghost's interventions, though the conflict is resolved primarily through compliance rather than a difficult active choice between competing goods or evils. The cost—a lifetime of service—is resonant, but the path to it lacks significant friction or missteps by the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake (healing the town) is clear, and the deepening understanding of the plate provides a necessary shift in knowledge. However, the external pressure is low; the labyrinth offers "shy gratitude" rather than resistance, making the victory feel inevitable rather than fought for.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the protagonist faces no meaningful opposition, external or internal, as Uncle Aram acts solely as a helpful guide. The stakes remain abstract (&quot;time also needed excavation&quot;), and the &quot;struggle&quot; to find the pieces is resolved via summary without visible sacrifice or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are established early and felt: Mira's fear and the bruised stamp communicate the weight of the letter without melodrama. The conflict is effectively sublimated into the procedural tension of the chalk codes and the margins. The tightening occurs when the narrator realizes the danger lies in the edge, forcing a tactical pivot. The ending maintains tension, though the cost of the delay (time/exposure) could be made more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.8)
    Tension is maintained through the ticking clock of the coup and Tamsin's high-stakes tampering. While the antagonist Rauk is more foil than direct threat, the pressure of the "patient engineers" effectively forces the protagonist's hand.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are intimate but high, driven by the desperate need for a specific emotional correction. The "splinter" in the doorframe serves as a brilliant physical anchor for the psychological cost of resisting the urge to flee.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clear and high ("kin" vs "proof"), and the tension escalates naturally as the factions wait outside. The resolution feels earned, though the "softening" of the conflict agents happens perhaps a beat too smoothly given the established danger.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.1)
    Stakes are low and primarily atmospheric; the conflict with the fog ("bleaching" the image) provides mild textural pressure but lacks visceral cost or urgency. The "daydream" frame inherently softens the consequences of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.0)
    Conflict is minimal; the wall yields to the narrator's expertise with little resistance or risk of failure. While the choice to prioritize "curiosity" over "certainty" is stated, the on-page cost is low, resulting in a smooth ride that lacks visceral narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are clear and escalation is managed well through the arrival of the Notice and the collectors. The "cost" of the victory (owing humility, the risk taken) is thematic rather than visceral, which fits the fable mode but limits the emotional weight of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=3.8)
    Escalation is minimal; the protagonist encounters almost no resistance from the "Guard" or the warring factions, who capitulate immediately to the song and postcard. The "armistice" feels inevitable rather than earned, as deep historical grievances are smoothed over with a single conversation.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure builds effectively from the initial "hunger" to the tremor in the mezzanine, escalating the stakes from mere preservation to active rescue. While the conflict is largely internal and environmental, the choice to embrace the "broken" method provides a satisfying tightening of the narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is minimal; the "sealed door" and "knot" offer almost no resistance to the characters' actions. The lack of a moment where failure seems possible robs the climax of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=4.6)
    Declared stakes (disaster, thirst) dissipate too easily when the solution is presented; the council's opposition melts away without a dramatic test. The conflict lacks a tightening noose where the protagonist must choose between competing goods or endure a painful loss.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake (safety/anonymity vs. connection) is clear, and the backstory of Mara effectively raises the perceived cost of the flight. However, the external pressure remains largely atmospheric ("boots on the stairs") or retrospective; the storm offers physical resistance but is resolved through waiting rather than an active counter-move by the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.4)
    The stakes are effectively internalized; the pressure builds quietly through the matching of weather codes to wood grain. While the conflict is low-key, the "tightening" is palpable when the specific memory of the argument about "maps that trap" forces the protagonist to confront the true intent behind the father's departure.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=4.0)
    Conflict is minimal; the stakes of "belonging" remain abstract and are never threatened by a genuine possibility of failure. The inciting incident is a soft mechanical glitch resolved immediately by the protagonist's talisman, lacking the escalation or difficult trade-offs required to generate narrative heat. The "lullaby" tone dampens any sense of urgency or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.9)
    Pressure is low; the protagonist's tools work immediately, and the antagonist (the cave) offers no active resistance, resulting in a gentle, inevitable progression. The "pact" lacks a felt price or difficult trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.8)
    The conflict is primarily conceptual—order versus entropy/monotony—rather than interpersonal or visceral. While the tension of the performance ("will the pattern hold?") provides momentum, the protagonist faces little genuine opposition; the woman and the crowd comply easily with his design. The stakes remain aesthetic, lacking a moment of severe doubt or high-cost trade-off that would elevate the dramatic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes are high in theory (arrest, forgetting), but the on-page tension dissipates quickly as the antagonist offers little sustained resistance. The escalation feels somewhat soft because the "weapon" (the dance/verse) works instantly and completely on the opposition without a cost paid in the moment of confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=3.9)
    Stakes are declared (demolition) but evaporate instantly when the antagonist capitulates to a trick of light. There is no escalation of pressure and no felt cost paid by the narrator to achieve the victory.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.8)
    The internal conflict—saving roofs vs. saving nests—is poignant and carries genuine weight. However, the on-page escalation is limited; the scene functions more as a confessional than a crucible, with the antagonist being memory rather than a present force. The stakes are intellectualized in the dialogue rather than tested through immediate dramatic action.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.4)
    Conflict is muted by the "serene upheaval"; the neighbors' arrival and the gauge's rise encounter little resistance, resulting in a linear success procedural. The narrative lacks a moment where the experiment threatens to fail or demands a costly sacrifice, lowering the felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.0)
    The stakes are personal and historical; the tension between the grandmother's ruthless choice and the narrator's merciful one is compelling. The escalation works well, though the climax resolves via a somewhat soft magic system (humming away trauma) rather than a harder sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are clear—the restoration of hope versus the inertia of forgotten dreams—and the escalation works well through the gathering crowd and Lio's vulnerability. While the pressure is gentle, the cost (Lio lending a heartbeat, the crowd learning to breathe twice) is felt and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from logistical terms ("murmurs") to the visceral cost of the "price of redemption." The shift from abstract peace to personal culpability (the narrator's role in the ambush) provides the necessary deepening, forcing a stance crystallization that feels inevitable yet surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.0)
    The external pressure (the directors/market) and the physical constraint (the thunder) create a clear crucible for the hatching. The escalation is internal but potent: the temptation to "break contracts" and release the water offers a genuine alternative path, making the final refusal a high-stakes character beat with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central struggle against the lock is engaging, but the antagonist (the Guild) arrives too late to exert active pressure, reducing the climax's external tension. The stakes are high but abstract ("lullaby of conformity"), lacking a concrete, immediate threat to Lira’s safety beyond failure.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes of ethical responsibility are clear, but the external obstacles—the troupe's return and the drunk's interruption—are overcome with relatively low resistance, dampening the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are primarily internal and symbolic (honoring the lost/signaling the last), which lowers immediate narrative tension but fits the lyric mode. The escalation comes through the precision of the ritual and the fragile interaction with the butterfly, culminating in a deliberate surrender of the work.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are clear (preservation vs. erasure), but the escalation is procedural rather than dramatic; the ritual proceeds without a hitch. The "cost" comes in the final decision to stay, which is meaningful, but the lack of active opposition or complications during the process lowers the immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.5)
    The conflict is primarily philosophical—interpreting the directive—rather than urgent or visceral. The approaching storm provides atmospheric pressure but doesn't force a difficult tactical choice; the protagonist simply slows down to resolve the tension. The stakes remain abstract (being "discarded" by a path) without a felt, immediate cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.6)
    The "intermission" between regimes creates effective time-pressure stakes, ensuring the ritual matters. While the external antagonism is passive (environmental/political context), the internal friction between doubt and faith provides sufficient escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes (war vs. peace) are high, but the conflict plays out with relatively low friction; Mara's skepticism is overcome quickly by the narrator's explanation and the object's magic. The escalation is a deepening of intimacy rather than a tightening of screws, which fits the tone but leaves the victory feeling slightly inevitable rather than hard-won. The cost is abstract—the loss of protective resentment—rather than viscerally paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.9)
    The stakes (eternal winter vs. harvest) are high but abstract, and the escalation is gentle, relying on patience rather than rising danger. The protagonist's decisive act—sacrificing the sextant part—is a nice touch, but the victory comes relatively easily, lacking a sense of peril or heavy trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are intimate but clear; the pressure comes from the immediate need to fix the leak and the emotional weight of the ribbon. The escalation is subtle—moving from standard tools to the sentimental sacrifice of the ribbon—providing a felt cost that validates the "deciduous vows" theme.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are clearly established as a tension between linear debt and a "gentler grammar." The escalation—facing the ancestor's ledger—pressures the protagonist into the pivotal choice. The cost is conceptual but legible: the sacrifice of the defined self (the face cameo) for a communal map.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are clearly defined and escalate through the descent and the negotiation. The traveler remains a passive prop, placing the entire burden of agency on the protagonist's competence, but the internal crisis—the temptation to abandon the mission—adds necessary emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are clearly defined (finding the name vs. the ship's decay) and escalate when the ship tilts to demand the twin. The resolution—telling a story to appease the ship—fits the genre but lacks a sharp, visible price beyond the stated emotional effort.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.1)
    The narrative lacks significant escalation or opposition; the protagonist encounters a puzzle and immediately solves it with available tools. There is no moment where the outcome is in doubt, and the resolution demands no sacrifice or risk, keeping the tension flat.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central conflict—finding quiet in the storm—is resolved largely through the protagonist's pre-existing skill and the beings' willing cooperation. The "storm" is described as dangerous ("charts rupture"), but on the page, it functions more as atmospheric pressure than an active antagonist forcing a costly sacrifice or tactical pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.5)
    The stakes are intimate yet vast, centered on the tension between oblivion and connection. The escalation is handled well through the mechanical failure of the wheel, which forces Kera to deepen her engagement with her specific gift, ensuring the resolution feels like a result of agency rather than luck.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.4)
    Pressure is low; the protagonist meets zero resistance during the ritual, as the "reefed air" confirms the hypothesis immediately. The cost of "unbinding fear" is stated but not felt, as the fear itself remains undramatized, resulting in a low-stakes linear procedural.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.0)
    Conflict is largely atmospheric with low on-page resistance. The primary obstacle (the wind) is trivial and resolved instantly by the declared "ambient awareness" skill, resulting in a lack of felt cost or escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (the relationship's future) is clear, and the "breath hitched" moment creates genuine tension. However, the conflict is somewhat softened by the high degree of shared philosophical alignment and aphoristic dialogue, which lowers the felt risk of the conversation.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are internalized but visceral, translated into physical reactions ("ribs fencing," "throat rehearses panic"). The escalation is clear as the protagonist moves from the easy "gilded hush" to the dangerous "bunker note," forcing a choice to integrate rather than reject the traumatic memory.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.0)
    The conflict is well-defined: the fragile equilibrium of the silence versus the piercing grief of the bell. Escalation is visible through the meter and the storm glass, raising the stakes from mere noise to a navigational hazard (the glass orchard). The resolution feels earned through the operator's skilled intervention.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes (algorithms vs. human stewardship) and the time limit (sunrise) provide clear external pressure. However, the escalation is linear and somewhat low-resistance; the obstacles (finding the path, climbing) are overcome with immediate competence, lacking a "dark night of the soul" or a reversal that truly endangers the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.2)
    Pressure is low and abstract; the protagonist faces no opposition and the visitor's struggle is resolved through compliant participation in the ritual. The stakes (suffocation vs. breathing) are high in concept but low in execution, as there is no moment where failure seems plausible or where the narrator is forced to make a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.0)
    While the internal thematic stakes are clear, the external pressure feels muted; the "foreman" is a prop, and the danger of the chamber is mitigated by the protagonist's assured, lyrical confidence. The conflict is largely philosophical, and the lack of a visceral antagonist or a moment of genuine doubt limits the tension. The resolution feels inevitable given the dream-logic established early on.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.2)
    The tension relies on the atmospheric pressure of the "standing waves" rather than active opposition or a difficult on-page choice during the winding. While the stakes of history are high, the immediate scene lacks a moment where the outcome feels genuinely in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.6)
    Stakes are theoretical rather than felt; the "drums of war" are distant background noise, and the immediate environment offers no resistance to the knight's goals. The escalation is atmospheric rather than pressure-based, as the orchard facilitates every step of his journey without forcing a difficult trade-off or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure accumulates coherently under the textural lens, moving from observation to hypothesis to the confirmation of the "be warm" note. The tightening occurs through the deepening moral obligation to the boy, Rowan, which forces the protagonist to prioritize connection over archival stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.8)
    The opposition (revision squads) behaves like faceless stormtroopers who are too easily "fooled by a sky printed underfoot" and stopped by light. The escalation lacks genuine pressure because the protagonist’s victory relies on the antagonists faltering for poetic reasons ("scripts do not include how to arrest light") rather than a strategic checkmate.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are high and existential (a town forgetting its name), though the antagonist (the code) remains somewhat abstract. The escalation is well-paced, with the code "climbing stalactites" and the protagonist responding with increasing precision ("turning the groove inside out"), leading to a decisive, earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.6)
    High stakes (the risk to the villages) are established early and effectively pressure the climax. The conflict is tight, pitting the protagonist's ingrained identity (sorter) against the urgent necessity of the moment (scatter).

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.7)
    The pressure is relatively low; the protagonist faces a puzzle rather than an antagonist or deep internal doubt. While leaving the compass behind serves as a valid cost, the lack of significant obstacles or failure states during the ascent keeps the tension mild.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes are clear—truth versus false hope—and the internal pressure escalates effectively through the physical process of mending the coin. However, the conflict remains largely internal and theoretical until the projected confrontation, slightly reducing the immediate tension.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are clearly established—healing vs. fleeing—and the escalation is excellent, moving from general spectral confessions to the specific, difficult laugh. The cost of the final victory is paid on the page through the painful vulnerability of sharing the protagonist's worst memory.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are psychological but high—sanity vs. compulsion. The tension escalates from the physical spasm of the "double tap" memory to the confrontation with the mask strap. The resolution requires a difficult internal pivot (renouncing power/control), though the external opposition is somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no active opposition from the city, the elder, or the environment. The &quot;risk&quot; of remembering is stated but not dramatized with a tangible threat or cost, keeping the stakes purely conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes are thematic rather than urgent; the "antagonist" is the static history of the place, which offers little active resistance. The protagonist faces no significant setbacks—the hatch opens, the barrel turns, and the ghosts leave—resulting in low tension.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are high and clearly articulated, with the risk of "rupturing the orchard" providing constant pressure. However, the antagonist's pivot from warning to assistance ("Together we braced the frame") happens too easily, deflating the interpersonal tension right at the climax's peak.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are clear and the gathering storm adds effective atmospheric pressure. The antagonist (Vark) functions primarily as a static foil, lacking sufficient independent agency to force a harder, more costly tradeoff from Neris.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central conflict is effectively braided between the ideological opposition of the "covenant of rust" and the physical/metaphysical obstacle of the constable. Escalation occurs through the journey into the hostile territory of midnight. While the climax—sewing patience into the hinge—resolves the physical threat somewhat quickly, it perfectly aligns with the established "mending" magic system.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; the world opens passively to the protagonist's desires. The "fear" mentioned belongs to the ghosts of the past, while the protagonist faces no threat, makes no difficult trade-offs, and succeeds in every attempt (finding the path, opening the door, collecting the sample) on the first try.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes are established but quickly dampened by the magical aid; the ghosts provide the solution instantly, removing the possibility of failure. The conflict lacks escalation, as the storm becomes a backdrop for thematic reflection rather than an active antagonist forcing difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=4.4)
    Stakes are purely internal and philosophical, lacking external opposition, time pressure, or risk of failure. The conflict does not escalate but rather dissipates over time, and the resolution comes from passive realization rather than urgent confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.8)
    The stakes are visceral (the tightening retrocognitive trap) and thematic (the integrity of the historical record). The tension escalates well through the parley, forcing Mara to make a binding ethical promise to secure the key. The cost is felt in the compromise Mara accepts—preserving the "mercy that had wronged the marchers" to save the truth.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.0)
    The conflict between the ease of wishes and the rigor of effort is palpable and escalates from internal resistance to external construction. The arrival of the women is not a coincidence but a direct causal result of the projected light, resolving the isolation stake with a shared burden.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from a routine archiving task to a prophecy of inevitable rupture involving the protagonist. The tension is well-maintained, though the "courtroom" imagery in the wind feels slightly repetitive of the earlier "jurors" description.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are established early, but the lack of active opposition or escalating cost flattens the tension. The "price" of the vow is mentioned abstractly rather than felt as a visceral sacrifice on the page, resulting in a smooth but low-stakes progression.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.3)
    The "zero hour" deadline creates palpable immediate pressure, escalating the stakes effectively as the storm approaches. While the bureaucratic cost is largely deferred to "tomorrow," the immediate physical threat to the tower provides sufficient narrative weight.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.1)
    While the stakes (saving the station) are clear, the conflict lacks genuine heat because the opposition dissolves too easily. The "cost" of the victory is minimal—merely opening shutters and drawing—making the triumph feel inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.2)
    There is a near-total absence of conflict or pressure. The ghosts are "patient," the bees are "not cruel," and the winds "agree." The protagonist faces no opposition, external or internal, and pays no tangible price for her success. The stakes remain theoretical ("weight of unspoken words") rather than immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict is largely atmospheric rather than dramatic; there is no antagonist or significant resistance to the protagonist's goal. The tension relies entirely on the melancholy setting, and the climax—placing the shard—lacks a moment of doubt or high-stakes trade-off. The "debt" is introduced late and resolved instantly, minimizing narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes remain low; the conflict (broken kite) is resolved by an external expert without significant struggle or sacrifice from the boy or father. The "cost" (a found feather) is negligible, draining tension from the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are high (mortality), but the immediate scene conflict is low-friction; the orchard yields its secrets to the caretaker without significant resistance or error. The "tightening" comes from the storm rather than a pressure-cooker choice by the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.0)
    Narrative tension is low; the pilgrimage faces no significant obstacles or risks, and the "fear" mentioned is dismissed immediately, leaving the stakes purely intellectual.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.5)
    The external pressure of the "war keeping marching in long salt" is established well, and the arrival of the veteran provides a necessary focal point for the stakes. However, the resolution is relatively low-cost; the seed pod functions as a magical cure that "fells him to quiet tears" instantly, bypassing a grittier struggle or trade-off in that moment.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist encounters no genuine opposition, tactical setbacks, or resource scarcity that forces a trade-off. The resolution provides a community-wide benefit without demanding a commensurate price or sacrifice from the focalizer, resulting in low narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure is consistent but relatively low-stakes; the conflict is primarily intellectual (solving the drift) and atmospheric rather than urgent or opposing. While the internal drive to align the machine is clear, the lack of immediate external pressure or active opposition limits the tension to a contemplative register. The cost is paid in isolation, which is accepted early rather than struggled against.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure is maintained through the environmental climb and the magical tension of the chess game. While the stakes are high-concept (correcting reality), the personal cost is made legible through the sacrifice of secrets. The escalation is steady, though the "confession spill" threat remains largely metaphorical.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.6)
    The conflict between the impulse to perform (the "crisis actor" habit) and the duty to record is subtle but exerts consistent pressure. The stakes escalate from merely hearing echoes to taking responsibility for the city's grief.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate steadily as the protagonist moves deeper into the mountain, facing the danger of the stone ("meaning bites") and the cost of the key. The pressure remains coherent under an accumulative lens, leading to a necessary trade-off (past identity for present breath). The conflict is resolved through a clear agency-driven action.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clearly braided: the village's stasis and the tutor's lingering guilt. The escalation from fixing small errors (baker, child) to the central "unbearable" choice regarding the prince ensures the climax feels earned and proportional to the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.9)
    The stakes are high and personal (survival, memory of the sister), and the escalation builds coherently through the gathering. However, the opposition (the elders and the spire) remains passive, reacting only symbolically to the protagonist's actions. The cost is largely physical exhaustion ("raw throat") rather than a difficult trade-off made in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.1)
    The central conflict is tightly focused on survival, with the acid sea providing constant, coherent pressure. The climax forces a meaningful trade-off—sacrificing the sentimental charm to forge the necessary repair—demonstrating agency and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake (capturing time/keeping the promise) is clear, and the tension escalates effectively as the light ("silver hair") thins. The cost is paid on the page through the sacrifice of the shell—a sentimental object linked to the mother. The conflict remains internal and conceptual, but the physical constraints of the tide and light give it sufficient weight.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are high (Mara's safety), but the protagonist's absolute confidence in his method dampens the tension; he never seriously considers Alder's alternative, removing the potential for a difficult choice. The conflict remains external (vs. Alder/Nature) rather than an agonizing internal trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure is coherent and sustained, driven by the immediate mechanical failure and the remote peril of the convoy. The escalation is handled well through the "night-sips" and the translation of the stars, though the obstacles faced by the convoy are slightly summarized rather than fully dramatized in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.8)
    The internal conflict (truth vs. safety) is palpable and drives the central experiment. The external pressure from the courier is present but resolved somewhat conveniently (hiding the object off-stage/unopposed), which lowers the felt cost of the antagonist, though the cost of losing the eye's aid is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.0)
    The internal pressure to decode the message is sustained well, fitting the "witness" archetype. The stakes remain largely abstract and proxy-driven, lacking a direct personal cost to the narrator beyond the effort of the task.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    The rising creek provides a functional ticking clock that aligns with the internal stakes of "drifting vs. choosing." The cost—renouncing the other "routes of selves" to inhabit the present—is legible. However, the climax resolves the conflict somewhat easily; the "bright route" appears and is chosen without a moment of agonizing trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are clearly established and escalate from disturbing dreams to a physical and existential confrontation with the "wound." The cost is legible—both physical (cut palms) and identity-based ("loosen the crown")—giving weight to the final equilibrium.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes are largely theoretical—failure means merely that &quot;numbers evaporate&quot; and they try again. The conflict is internal and procedural; without an antagonist or a concrete threat of loss, the escalation feels gentle and inevitable rather than pressured. The &quot;cost&quot; of the secret is stated but not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.8)
    The conflict between the desire for narrative order and the chaos of mortality (the grave) is well-dramatized. Escalation occurs internally through the "interrogation" of jealousy, tightening until the specific verbs are extracted from the past selves. The cost is subtle but felt—the "knuckles creaking" and the acceptance of a life that must be constantly rewritten to stave off silence.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.4)
    The conflict is low-pressure; the stakes are sentimental rather than urgent. The protagonist explicitly dampens tension ("We will not make confessions; we will fix the clock"), and the solution (adding a pin) encounters no resistance or failure. The absence of a "meaningful tightening" or difficult obstacle limits the score.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure is coherent and palpable, driven by the literal timer of the held breath and the visual feedback of the freezing tea. The escalation from the failed first stroke to the risky improvisation forces a clear change in tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clearly established: the loss of history and the need for personal redemption. The tension escalates effectively through the ritual, with the cracking bottle and the encroaching saws providing physical manifestations of the pressure. While the ritual proceeds relatively linearly, the emotional cost of the "imperfect miracle" elevates the conflict beyond simple mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.1)
    Pressure is coherent under the accumulative lens, escalating from observation to definition to unification. However, the stakes remain intellectual and abstract; the cost of the final transaction is conceptual ("attention," "breath") rather than a visceral or irreversible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.3)
    The pressure is primarily atmospheric and internal rather than external or interpersonal. While the "drift" provides a focal point for tension, the resolution (turning a valve) feels physically easy, shifting the weight to the philosophical acceptance of the change. The stakes feel intellectual more than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=5.5)
    Tension evaporates immediately upon the antagonist's appearance; the protagonist accepts Mira's presence without resistance ("I did not raise my hand to stop her"). There is no felt cost or difficult trade-off required to reach the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are intimate and clear—the father's health and the need for connection. The escalation is internal, moving from intellectual cataloging to emotional action, though the external pressure is relatively low until the specific "carrot" signal provides a direct path to resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=4.8)
    Escalation is negligible; the callers ("orphans of intention") offer no resistance to the narrator's manipulation, and the connection is made without complication. The lack of an antagonist or technical obstacle turns the scene into a procedural demonstration rather than a conflict with stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are clear and high (the town's survival vs. the sea), though the external threat remains largely atmospheric rather than immediate. The internal conflict regarding the locket provides necessary texture, though the escalation is gentle, fitting the "gently thorough" attribute.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=3.9)
    Conflict is negligible; obstacles like isolation and lack of supplies yield immediately to Mara's competence without generating significant pressure or reversals. The resolution is achieved through a "joke that worked," making the victory feel inevitable and unearned by specific on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.0)
    Pressure is coherent and escalates through sensory intensity and the memory of grief ("You left"). However, the resolution of the conflict—reaching out to the warning which soaks in "like warmth"—feels somewhat frictionless; the victory comes from endurance rather than a costly, difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.8)
    The stakes are clear: a "snare of equivalences" where deletion causes more damage. The escalation from the shuttle accident to the realization that mere correction is impossible drives the narrative effectively toward the "duet" solution.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is nominal; the regatta and police offer no genuine opposition as they are neutralized instantly by the "magic" of the signing. The protagonist faces no difficult trade-offs, and the resolution comes without a visible price paid by any character. The stakes feel abstract rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are high and personal, centered on the redemption of a "forgotten promise." The tension between the protagonist's guilt and the revelation of Mira's survival is resolved through earned emotional logic, culminating in a resonant final image of the matches in water.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clearly established: the risk of the "experimental treatment" versus the loss of Jonah. The escalation is handled well via the system's "pulse warning" which forces an explicit moment of consent and deeper commitment. The cost is felt in the "ache of auroral sorrow" and the acknowledged blurring of the protagonist's outline.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central conflict (whisper vs. shout/storm) is tightly braided, and the escalation is coherent. The stakes are clear—professional pride and the courier's safety—though the "danger" feels somewhat managed by the narrator's high competence, reducing the visceral sense of risk. The cost is paid in effort and the final trade of the prize tickets.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.2)
    The stakes are immediate and high (a drowning brother), managed with a controlled "stillwater tension" that fits the voice perfectly. While the external opposition is elemental (water/darkness) rather than antagonistic, the pressure on the guardian to execute the rescue without breaking the vow maintains taut narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.2)
    External pressure is abstract ("bulldozers") and remains off-stage, while the town's capitulation to the "rebellion" is immediate and frictionless. The story lacks a tightening beat where the method risks failure or the "kids" falter; the victory creates a flat dynamic where everything works exactly as intended.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=4.6)
    Stakes are purely abstract and thematic ("fear," "ownership") without a concrete physical or relational cost to anchor them. The conflict is resolved through a conversation with the island and a ritual action that faces no opposition, lacking the requisite tightening or deepening of options. The "impossible violence" premise removes urgency rather than sublimating it into tension.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are high—emotional survival and physical freedom—and the escalation occurs through the intensity of the performance. While the inspector's capitulation is perhaps slightly gentle ("duty diluted"), it fits the weary tone. The protagonist's agency drives the deepening of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=3.6)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent; the primary constraint (the ban) is lifted before the story begins, and the physical danger (the frozen lake) "reconsiders" and dissolves without extracting a price. There is no moment where the outcome is in doubt, resulting in a static pressure level.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=4.7)
    Conflict is nominal; Mara’s opposition to saving the bird dissolves almost immediately upon Ilias's proposal. There is no meaningful escalation or tightening of options; the protagonist encounters no significant obstacle that forces a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.2)
    While the internal pressure to heal the community is clear, the external opposition (the director, the priest) is flimsy and easily overcome. The story relies on the friction of the "bruised city" backstory rather than active obstacles in the scene, limiting the immediate narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.2)
    Conflict is largely internal and atmospheric; the ritual proceeds without external friction or the risk of failure. While the emotional stakes are high, the scene lacks a distinct "tightening" moment where the outcome is in doubt, relying instead on the steady accumulation of mood.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=4.8)
    Narrative tension is virtually absent; the "gap" in the neighborhood presents a puzzle but no resistance, and the characters face no opposition or risk of failure. The resolution is a linear progression of success—measure, mark, succeed—without a tightening of stakes or a necessary trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.0)
    Pressure escalates cleanly from the physical challenge of the archive to the moral weight of the memories. The stakes shift from personal survival to societal salvation without losing focus. The climax forces a trade-off between professional safety and moral necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—preserving the shadow vs. it being consumed—is clear, and the escalation through the film screening is well-paced. The cost is high (sacrificing the personal safety stone), though the shadow's submission to the process feels slightly too smooth to reach the highest bands of conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.5)
    The conflict is sharply defined: the betrayal of the con versus the need for a second chance. The stakes—both the sanctuary's reputation and Karim's soul—are palpable. The resolution feels earned, offering a risky but principled path forward rather than a tidy forgiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.7)
    Escalation is clear and largely internal, anchored by the physical cost of the descent ("pain salts the floor"). The stakes shift meaningfully from a desire for erasure to a willingness to engage with the wound, satisfying the requirement for a meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.7)
    Conflict is largely atmospheric ("reels still ache," "building keeps getting heavier") rather than interpersonal or internal. While the pressure is coherent, the protagonist faces no significant opposition or difficult trade-offs; the solution (cutting and archiving) is executed without jeopardy, limiting the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are declared but not tested; the antagonist ("fear," "the town") is passive and offers no active opposition in the scene. The protagonist faces no risk of failure and pays no tangible price to succeed, resulting in low narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are established early and escalated through the demand for "proof" by the archive. The cost is felt physically and conceptually ("midnight freezes further inside his veins"), satisfying the requirement for a visible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from survival to a test of worthiness at the tower. The external pressure of the "figures" and the "caliper" mouth forces a high-cost internal realization, grounding the philosophical conflict in physical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.0)
    Escalation is dampened by the guides' constant reassurance, which removes the possibility of failure and lowers the stakes. The protagonist faces no significant obstacles or moments of doubt during the vigil, making the "courage" feel more like obedient waiting.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.5)
    The stakes—safety versus truth—are tangible, elevated by the immediate physical cost of movement during regeneration. The central conflict is resolved through a meaningful micro-choice (reversing the bolt's pitch) that carries visible thematic weight. Pressure escalates cleanly from the lobby to the engine room.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the stakes (truth vs. erasure) are high, the on-page pressure is low. The confrontation is polite and lacks visceral tension; the pretender simply watches his defeat and fades away without forcing Lys to make a difficult trade-off or sacrifice. The victory relies on executed competence rather than overcoming active opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are clearly articulated (drownings, the loss of history), and the conflict between human memory and tidal erasure is poignant. While the pressure escalates coherently through the data analysis, the on-page tension remains cerebral; the physical danger is historical rather than immediate, keeping the pulse of the story contemplative.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.9)
    While the stakes of rebellion and survival are high in theory, the "lull" removes active opposition, allowing the protagonist to succeed against no resistance. The escalation is textural (lights, voices) rather than conflict-driven, and the "cost" remains abstract ("patience costing me hope") rather than a forced trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.8)
    The process tension during the ritual is well-handled, but the external opposition (the Council) arrives too late to exert pressure, rendering them straw men. The protagonist succeeds without paying a visible on-page cost; the victory feels intellectual and moral rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.8)
    The internal escalation (drone trigger, somatic management) is excellent, but the external conflict with the Chair is resolved a bit too easily; he folds immediately upon seeing the view. While the "man vs. nature" pressure works, the lack of stiffer interpersonal resistance keeps the stakes feeling slightly quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clear (artistic identity, saving ships), and the storm provides effective external pressure. However, the climax lacks visceral difficulty; the mechanical fix is portrayed as "too simple," which reduces the tension of the final hurdle.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.2)
    Escalation is internal and atmospheric, deepening as the protagonist enters the "widened second." While the external stakes are low—the experiment succeeds without hitch—the emotional confrontation with the sister’s death provides sufficient pressure and a felt cost of acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes are declared as high ("burn," "punishment"), but the escalation is dampened by the lack of effective opposition. The climax resolves without a struggle against the antagonist, making the victory feel inevitable rather than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clearly established—both the physical survival of the dome and the moral survival of the father. The arrival of the storm provides the necessary external pressure to force the father's hand, effectively externalizing the thematic conflict between vengeance and continuity.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.4)
    External pressure is present via the resisting echo and the garden's feral nature, but the protagonist's mastery dampens the tension. The obstacles are overcome with smooth, almost ritualistic efficiency, making the stakes feel theoretical rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are clearly defined (truth vs. donor satisfaction) and escalate through the attempt to delete the logs. The resolution relies heavily on a rhetorical victory ("monologue wins the day") rather than a grind of competing pressures, making the antagonist's surrender feel slightly too rapid.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clearly established early (the tug of the fold, the risk of unresolved guilt) and escalate through the machine's resistance. The confrontation with the specific sound of the nephew's cry serves as a potent emotional climax. The external pressure of the time fold coheres well with the internal struggle, though the physical threat is slightly less emphasized than the emotional one.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes are clear but the conflict is low-voltage; the protagonist encounters little resistance to their goal. The only potential antagonist (the man trying to speak) is silenced by the "hush" rather than by the protagonist's active agency, reducing the sense of earned struggle. The pressure is atmospheric rather than interpersonal or internal.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.3)
    High stakes (execution/survival) are established, but the tension collapses instantly when the protagonist uses the "magic key" of the guard's memory. The antagonist provides no sustained resistance, resulting in a low-cost victory that feels unearned by the narrative buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (despair vs. possibility) is signaled early and tracked through Rowan's behavior. While the pressure escalates with her midnight entry, the resolution comes relatively easily via the supernatural aid of the coin and the maze, softening the cost of the final choice. The conflict is resolved, but the lack of a sharper sacrifice or obstacle limits the score.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.6)
    The pressure is primarily internal and aesthetic—managing the noise—rather than interpersonal or external. While the recall notice adds a background threat, the stakes remain relatively low-key; the "cost" is a manageable secret. The tension is steady but lacks a sharp, escalating peak before the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.2)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces slight physical resistance ("passage tightens") but no significant antagonist or dilemma. The stakes remain conceptual—improving the sleepers' dreams—without a palpable risk of failure or personal loss on the page. The narrative glides smoothly from entry to broadcast, lacking the friction or difficult choices that generate high dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.2)
    The central conflict (Possibility vs. Fatalism) is high-concept but low-tension on the page. The collective antagonist ("the town") capitulates instantly upon the ringing of the bell, resolving the tension without a distinct moment of doubt or near-failure that would heighten the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are clear—reconnection versus exposure—and the pressure escalates appropriately with the stranger's arrival. The turning point relies on a specific choice (the apology/fourth line) rather than coincidence. The cost is felt in the risk taken, though the external threat remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes are clear and poignant—the risk of suffocating a marriage with history—but the on-page conflict remains low-heat and contemplative. The escalation is internal and atmospheric rather than interpersonal, which works for the genre but relies heavily on the reader buying the metaphorical weight of the shawl.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=4.3)
    Stakes are purely philosophical, lacking immediate consequence or risk; the "scorched wasteland" implies danger that never manifests to pressure the protagonist. The central action involves mending a trough with no opposition, making the victory feel inevitable rather than earned. There is no "meaningful tightening" of options, only a linear path to an epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are clearly defined for the neighbors, but the protagonist faces low pressure. The execution of the plan meets no resistance, and the "cost" (a rusting tool, the effort of hope) is abstract rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict is primarily internal and intellectualized, lacking strong external pressure; the Librarian is patient rather than oppositional. The climax ("Shame tried to drown me") dissolves quickly via the "Tone: None" mechanic, avoiding a harder choice or a more visceral price for the independence gained.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=3.9)
    Stakes are low and purely internal; there is no active opposition, time pressure, or risk of failure to the protagonist's project. The narrative lacks a tightening of the screws, as the monks, the public, and the weather all cooperate perfectly with the protagonist's desire.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation is managed well through the riot and the power cut, creating genuine pressure. The conflict resolution is softer; the "power play" of the administration is neutralized too easily by the protagonist's device, undercutting the stakes of the physical confrontation in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure is consistent and the stakes of the unraveling city are well-established. However, the protagonist's high competence mitigates the sense of risk; the conflict is resolved through a smooth execution of skills rather than a struggle that demands a visceral, on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are clear—truth versus silence—and the tension escalates effectively through the physical proximity of the characters and the "test" of the ribbon. The cost is visible in the Captain’s surrender, though the emotional price for Lio remains somewhat distant.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central conflict between the bureaucratic "reversible exile" and the personal duty to the ancestor is well-staged. The ending creates a distinct, felt cost—risking the "mud that hardens" to complete the map—which effectively reweights the stakes from survival to legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=3.8)
    There is minimal narrative tension; the environment and the secondary character facilitate the protagonist's goal immediately without obstacle. The narrative moves in a straight line from problem to solution without a tightening of stakes or a moment where failure feels possible.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.6)
    The stakes are primarily internal, centering on a psychological need to resolve the father's legacy against the startup's failure. While the external pressure is low, the arrival of the neighborhood kid provides a crucial pivot point that externalizes the protagonist's change in stance. A slightly sharper external threat might have heightened the tension, but the internal "tightening belt" serves the story well.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.5)
    Pressure is low throughout; the primary obstacle (the translation) is resolved by the external instructions rather than protagonist agency or ingenuity. The emotional conflict with Mara dissolves almost instantly upon a single prompt, lacking the resistance or escalation needed to generate genuine narrative stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.8)
    Tension is maintained through the ritualistic pressure and the physical cost of the blood sacrifice. The stakes are clear and personal, though the external opposition is static (a trap) rather than active; the internal escalation compensates well.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=3.9)
    There is no active opposition or escalation; the "shadow" is a backstory premise, and the ritual proceeds without complication or reversal. The stakes remain abstract concepts ("covenant," "future") rather than concrete risks, and the protagonist never faces a dilemma that forces a sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes are high and personal, and the Keeper provides necessary resistance to the protagonist's goal. The cost of the success—sharing breath and accepting scars—is legible on the page, satisfying the requirement for consequence. However, the protagonist's method works without a moment of near-failure, making the victory feel slightly inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    Internal pressure (shame vs. competence) is palpable and escalates through the identification of the artifacts. The dominant stake—redemption of self-worth—is tightly focused. While the external opposition is mild, the internal cost of confronting the past ("set list was my ruin and my rescue") is clearly felt.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.4)
    The stakes are clearly defined as a tension between the desire for connection (rescue) and the necessity of letting go (translation). While the "haunted ambitions" provide the counter-pressure, the temptation to "bite the fruit" is resolved somewhat quickly. However, the cost—the permanent silence of the mentor's voice replaced by the "horizon"—is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict is the story's weakest element; the clients' problems are resolved immediately via the librarian's tools with no risk of failure or cost. The stakes ("identities migrating") remain abstract because the solution is effortless. Without an antagonist or a moment where the routine fails, the narrative lacks tension and escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes are thematic rather than visceral; the conflict between "protocol" and "connection" is abstract and offers little actual resistance to the protagonist's will. The climax is a ritualistic gesture that meets no opposition, resulting in a low-pressure narrative where the outcome feels predetermined by the premise rather than forged by struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clearly established as both physical (the blocked river) and psychological (self-forgiveness), with the pressure escalating naturally from observation to necessary action. The cost is well-defined; the protagonist trades his protective "jargon" and "romance" for the painful, unglamorous truth, paying a price in both labor and reputation.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.8)
    The narrative relies on the pressure of the puzzle and the discipline of "patience" rather than urgent external danger or deep interpersonal conflict. While the accumulation of steps creates a steady forward momentum, the stakes remain relatively low and cerebral; failure implies only a lack of progress rather than a severe cost. The tension is maintained through curiosity and atmosphere rather than visceral risk.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are high and binary: preserve the empire's lie or destroy the art to keep its vow. The cost is palpable—the destruction of a unique object and the protagonist's career. The tension escalates cleanly as the deadline approaches, though the director's convenient pause at the door slightly softens the immediate physical jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are intimate and high-pressure within the emotional landscape, centered on the risk of failing the mother's final request. While the external opposition is abstract (the "thickening hush"), the internal cost of performance is felt, and the escalation through the ritual steps is steady.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.0)
    Present-tense conflict is minimal; the major stakes (the fire, the forgiveness) are retrospective. The pilgrim's arrival and the vine repair offer only mild pressure, lacking a moment where the protagonist's contentment is genuinely at risk of failing.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.0)
    The stakes of the quay demolition are clear and pressured by the chimes' specific output ("protect, remember, adapt"). The cost is legible in the weight of the cloak Mara sheds and the compromised reality ("sincerely insincere") she accepts.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.6)
    Pressure is derived from the timeline of the researcher's regression, creating a coherent situational stakes. However, the conflict remains abstract and intellectual; the narrator faces no opposition or difficult trade-offs, merely observing the inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.9)
    Tension is maintained through the resistance of the "wandering pulse" and the physical constraints of the canyon. The escalation is intellectual and mystical—shifting from tapping to humming forgiveness—which fits the mode but risks feeling abstract. The cost is paid in discipline and the conceptual weight of forgiveness, which is legible if not viscerally dangerous.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—authenticity versus automated perfection—is signaled early and escalated through the temptation of the harness. The cost is felt in the vulnerability of the "listening cold," and the resolution is earned through a decisive, irreversible action.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.5)
    External stakes are negligible; the foreman waving at the end removes the potential social cost of abandoning the post. The magical elements yield immediately to the protagonist's desires without resistance (the cabinet opens "without moving"), resulting in a conflict-free progression that feels too easy.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.7)
    The central conflict (chance vs. design) is clear, but the resolution—the coins landing on the thematically perfect word "hello"—feels fortuitous rather than a hard-won trade-off. The "felt cost" of surrendering control is mitigated by the convenient benevolence of the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes deepen naturally from the professional duty of naming others' fears to the personal risk of facing one's own. The pressure accumulates effectively, though the transition to the final tape relies slightly on coincidence; however, the thematic weight carries the moment. The final stance ("Not mine alone," "Enough") represents a meaningful tightening of the character's worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are established early through the "cosmic imbalance" and hunger, escalating effectively when the bell's crack widens and the ritual nearly fails. The resolution creates a new equilibrium with a felt wait time ("not for a season"), satisfying the need for cost.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.3)
    The stakes are well-defined, pitting professional duty ("expunge illegal memorials") against personal morality. The warden’s choice to defy the order carries a felt professional risk, creating a meaningful pivot point.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.7)
    Stakes are purely philosophical, and the cost of failure is never dramatized on the page. The conflict between logic and intuition remains an intellectual exercise without a concrete trade-off or risk that would compel the reader to fear for the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes are immediate and physical (Lio's life), escalating cleanly from a routine approach to a mechanical failure that narrows options to a single, high-risk path. The resolution relies on the protagonist's specific expertise, though the cost is primarily internal/conceptual (the renewed weight of vigilance).

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes are clearly signaled, braiding the internal battle against numbness with the external custody hearing. However, the external opposition (the city advocates) is silenced too easily by the Sensei's floor-strike and the ensuing kata, lacking a robust counter-move that would heighten the pressure before the resolution. The internal escalation is stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the stakes (developers vs. the room) are clear, the conflict is resolved through broad summary ("met them through orthogonal approaches," "weaving permits") rather than a dramatized confrontation. The lack of an on-page climax where the protagonist risks something specific deflates the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.9)
    Pressure creates a clear arc; the mechanical hesitation of the blower (the carburetor adjustment) provides a necessary complication that grounds the magic in physical labor. The cost is well-articulated in the refusal to return all the joy, forcing a trade-off that charges the final resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are primarily internal and thematic, centering on the tension between the pain of uncertainty and the danger of false certainty. The climax—a renunciation of the guardian's home to maintain their shared vigil—carries a quiet but palpable cost of continued homesickness.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.7)
    The stakes are established early, but the climax—where the antagonist's men simply "drop their intent"—relies on symbolic logic that dissolves tension too conveniently. The cost of the victory feels abstract rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are clear and the pressure of the "lunar perigee" provides a necessary ticking clock that tightens the window for action. The conflict is primarily internal and conceptual, which fits the tone, though the physical risk remains largely atmospheric rather than immediately felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=9.2)
    The stakes are high—existential stability for the city versus the narrator's own form—and the escalation is handled through the tension of the ritual. The cost is unmistakably paid on the page; the narrator does not just solve the problem but is consumed by the solution.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure escalates cleanly from the technical act of weaving to the voyeuristic observation of strangers, peaking with Mara's own vulnerability. The cost is conceptual but deeply felt—the admission that her life’s philosophy was a defense mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are clearly established—survival and the need for new food sources versus the crushing pressure of the deep. However, the antagonist forces (the council's reluctance, the difficulty of the math) are largely overcome in summary rather than through on-page confrontation. The escalation works texturally, building a sense of solemn inevitability, but lacks a sharp, dramatized turning point where failure feels imminent.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are high and legible, but the external conflict is resolved by an environmental event (glass shattering) rather than direct protagonist agency. While thematically consistent, it lowers the pressure of the standoff compared to a resolution driven by character choice.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.8)
    External pressure from the tide provides a rock-solid ticking clock that escalates the internal struggle with claustrophobia. While the technical success of the data retrieval feels slightly linear, the interplay between the physical threat and the fragile emotional goal maintains high stakes throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.2)
    Internal pressure is sustained through the fear of the cold and the erased identity. However, the external escalation is mitigated by the ghost's assistance, which turns the dangerous trek into a "path where wind drops," reducing the felt cost of the final action.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.1)
    Escalation is masterful, moving from the technical challenge of reading birds to the visceral cost of the diamond's thirst. The stakes shift organically from professional ambition to personal erasure, and the price paid on the page is concrete and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.8)
    The internal stakes (healing vs. bitterness) are effectively externalized through the summoning ritual. The cost is the surrender of the narrator's protective cynicism, legible in the trembling "bad pun" delivery.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.8)
    Opposition is minimal; the potential threat (living statues) dissolves immediately upon the protagonist's first action. The lack of active resistance or back-and-forth struggle deflates the stakes of the rebellion.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are clearly established, but the opposition yields too easily to symbolic gestures; the drones hesitate at a bit of rain, and the commander is defeated by "polite silence." The lack of a grittier, harder-won cost for the protagonists' victory dampens the narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.0)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the carpenter faces no antagonist, time pressure, or significant resource scarcity beyond the need to search. The stakes are purely thematic ("interpret silence"), and the "wrong turn" resolves the search too easily. The story relies on accumulative aesthetic pressure rather than the escalation of consequences or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.2)
    Conflict is primarily navigational and intellectual rather than interpersonal or deeply perilous; the library yields to the protagonist’s tools with relative ease. While the tension of "mapping" provides momentum, the stakes feel somewhat low—failure implies a lack of discovery rather than a severe consequence. The pressure is atmospheric, fitting the tone, but lacks the visceral "tightening" of a higher-band conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.4)
    The internal stakes (grief vs. duty) are clear, but the external obstacle—the dream "testing the lens"—is overcome with relative ease. The tension relies more on atmospheric pressure than hard causal barriers, making the victory feel slightly smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.1)
    Escalation is present but low-voltage; the opposition (the door) yields to the ritual without forcing the protagonist to improvise or pay a fresh cost on the page. While the emotional stakes are high (phantom limb ache), the external conflict is resolved through procedural competence rather than struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clear and personal (memory recovery, unpaid debt), and the pressure escalates coherently from the dive to the ritual confrontation. While the external opposition is static (the environment), the internal tension and the risk of the "bargain" provide sufficient narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are clearly defined: the brother’s existence against the "silence that ruled." The escalation is psychological and ritualistic, tightening appropriately as the "hinge rattled and quivered like teeth." The cost is legible in the physical toll of the magic and the Archivist’s poignant, self-imposed restraint at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=2.9)
    The conflict is theoretical; the antagonist (the Gray) puts up no resistance, waiting "trembling" to be healed. The solution—offering a cup of essence—is accepted immediately, resulting in a climax void of tension, risk, or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.4)
    Tension is braided effectively between the physical stubbornness of the knots and the emotional weight of the daughter's secret fear. While the conflict is quiet and atmospheric, the stakes feel genuine, and the "tremor" during the ritual provides a tangible beat of escalation that anchors the metaphysical work.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.1)
    The conflict is internal and situational, driven by the intellectual and empathetic challenge of the sealed door rather than external antagonism. The "tightening" occurs when force fails and the protagonist must switch to a methodical, research-based approach to proceed.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.9)
    Internal pressure regarding grief is well-sustained, and the task of repairing the recorder provides a solid narrative spine. The escalation is quiet but effective under an Accumulative lens. The stakes are clearly felt in the final choice to release the artifact, validating the emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.0)
    Conflict is low-pressure; the "ghost" is cooperative immediately, and the storm serves as a timer rather than an active antagonist. While the escalation from "small levers" to "bolder things" provides a structural tightening, the lack of friction in the negotiation keeps the stakes relatively flat.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure builds coherently with the rising floors, transforming the stakes from a delivery task to a moral burden. While the external opposition is minimal, the internal pressure of the "vow to turn away" versus the intimacy of the diary sustains high tension.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.7)
    The stakes are psychological yet externalized through the stability of the gondola. The escalation moves from observation to interaction (tracing the wake) to the decisive action of tying the knot. While the conflict is internal, the physical manifestation of the balloon's instability provides sufficient pressure to drive the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.5)
    The external pressure (demolition timer) is clear and escalates appropriately through sensory cues like the siren and crane. The stakes remain largely internal and aesthetic; while the tension holds, the lack of a sharper, externalized cost or obstacle limits the dramatic voltage.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the captain trusts the protagonist immediately, the birds assist with math, and the "stranded luminance" yields "like a promise." There is no escalation of stakes or genuine obstacle to force a hard decision, resulting in a flat narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent; the machine's resistance is passive ("faltered") and is overcome instantly by the protagonist's competency. There is no escalation of risk, no moment where failure seems possible, and no visible cost paid to achieve the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the external stakes of drought are high, the narrative pressure is neutralized by the community's perfect cooperation and immediate trust. The absence of interpersonal conflict or significant operational setbacks means the victory is achieved without a palpable on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.3)
    The conflict is internalized—the temptation of the end versus the burden of mercy—but is dramatized effectively through the ritual. The "Grant me" beat introduces necessary agency and pressure before the resolution. While the external threat is distant ("cities blanch"), the internal cost of the narrator's eternal watch is palpable and sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes are clearly established (safety vs. frost) and escalate logically. The protagonist's agency drives the resolution, and the sacrifice of the "token and map" provides a tangible price for the strangers' survival.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.3)
    The physical manifestation of the relational conflict works well, and the bridge crossing provides a solid test of the stakes. The climax—the slip and the catch—effectively dramatizes the trust required for the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are internal and thematic, fitting the lyric mode; the pressure escalates from a commercial transaction to a personal existential risk. The cost—confronting the "silence my father kept"—is felt and shapes the final image, though the external conflict remains low-key by design.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.8)
    The conflict is primarily Man vs. Nature/Abstract (endurance against grief), handled with professional expertise. While the pressure escalates during the journey and the tasting of the "siege," the protagonist's mastery ensures a relatively smooth resolution without a moment of desperate doubt. The stakes are clear, but the lack of a costly tradeoff caps the score.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are declared ("fear," "connection") but not tested; the primary obstacle (the councilman's "No") is removed by a *deus ex machina* (the glove) rather than the protagonist's effort. There is no back-and-forth escalation; the tension dissolves immediately upon the antagonist's sentimental conversion.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes are clearly internalized, centered on the processing of grief. The escalation is linear, driven by the machine's intensity, though the climax relies on a convenient memory trigger rather than active wrestling with the "fault lines."

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes remain theoretical; the threat of "sleeping" or the time limit never forces a difficult trade-off or a moment of genuine peril. The obstacles yield immediately to the protagonist's skills (e.g., the wall opens to a simple rhythm), resulting in a flat pressure curve.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=4.9)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the wind, river, and hedgehog cooperate fully with the protagonist’s ritual. There is no meaningful opposition or escalation of pressure, resulting in a low-stakes ceremony rather than a dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.2)
    Tension evaporates when the only external threat—the guard—neutralizes himself for thematic reasons ("feared learning our grammar") rather than through protagonist agency. The internal obstacle (the needle/field) offers only passive resistance, making the victory feel inevitable rather than hard-won against active opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.2)
    The internal escalation is managed well through the tuning process and the arrival of distinct "silences," providing a clear sense of progress. While the external pressure is low—the clasp yields without significant struggle—the thematic tension between the workshop's quiet and the city's impending thunder provides sufficient narrative drive. The ending effectively reweights the protagonist's relationship to the noise outside.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=3.5)
    Opposition is summarized and quickly resolved by the protagonist's expertise without visible cost or risk of failure. The climax lacks genuine tension, resulting in a symmetric satisfaction where the problem (stench) is solved by a pre-planned lesson rather than struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are clear but the conflict lacks visceral pressure; the gravity inversion assists rather than hinders the pilot, and the resolution is mechanical (inserting a fitting into a slot). The protagonist faces no significant opposition or dilemma that forces a sacrifice beyond the surrender of a keepsake that was destined for this purpose. The escalation is atmospheric rather than dramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.7)
    Procedural tension is managed well, but the retrospective nature of the investigation limits immediate personal jeopardy or active opposition. The stakes are high for the town's future but low for the narrator in the scene, resulting in a cooler, intellectual pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are declared as high ("world from shattering") but remain abstract and are never tested by a credible threat in the scene. The "council" is an off-stage pressure, and the "danger" of sleep is dispelled with a single action, lacking the escalation or cost required for higher marks. The protagonist succeeds without a moment of genuine doubt, lowering the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.6)
    The stakes are personal and metaphysical, escalating clearly as the flute ritual progresses from a whisper to a connection between worlds. The cost is subtle but felt—the surrender of the hero's role to the "unsworn" listeners—marking a distinct shift in agency.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.3)
    The external pressure of entropy (cosmic dimming) effectively forces the internal risk of "transposed empathy," braiding the stakes tightly. The cost of the conflict is legible in the operator's physical toll, though the antagonist is environmental rather than personified.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—managing the boundary between wonder and dangerous hunger—is clear, but the "danger" remains somewhat abstract and intellectualized rather than viscerally felt. The tightening is successful conceptually, but the protagonist's victory over the temptation to hold on feels slightly too easy and composed.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.4)
    Conflict is low-pressure; the narrator’s skepticism dissolves quickly in the face of the visual display without forcing a difficult trade-off or choice. The stakes regarding the father are introduced and resolved within the same beat, lacking the accumulation required for high dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.9)
    The stakes are clear (permanent separation vs. return), and the internal conflict regarding the "latent sacrifice" adds necessary depth. The escalation works well until the climax, where the resolution relies on a montage of waiting rather than an immediate pressure cooker, slightly softening the final impact.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes escalate effectively from physical repair to the sacrifice of identity (surname). The tremor adds necessary physical pressure, though the highest cost (laughter) is paid in a summary beat, reducing the visceral weight of the final trade.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.4)
    The pressure is primarily thematic and atmospheric rather than antagonistic; the "pull" of the withheld truth provides a consistent, rising tension. While the stakes are high for the refugees, the personal cost to the protagonist is largely metaphorical ("gravity... bending my balance"), lacking a gritty, irrevocable trade-off on the page. The climax resolves through "attunement" and redirection, which feels elegant but slightly low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.1)
    The pressure of impending automation forces a tangible, symbolic response (the jar ritual). While the external opposition is minimal, the internal pressure to preserve the "ache" creates sufficient stakes for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation is character-driven and clear; the shift from the model’s prediction to the gyre’s attack is triggered directly by the protagonist’s agency. While the ritual’s success feels slightly assured, the physical and emotional cost (“swallowing joy and fear”) provides sufficient weight to the victory.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are internal but palpable, escalated by the dye master's gentle but firm dismantling of the protagonist's initial "lantern" approach. The tension between the "loud" new rhythm of the heart and the need for "iridescent caution" provides a clear, coherent pressure throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.1)
    Conflict is internal and philosophical, driven by the desire to understand rather than external opposition. The "tightening" occurs through the intensification of focus during the "fragile hour," which works for this lyric mode. However, the lack of a forced trade-off or higher external stakes keeps the pressure relatively low.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.4)
    Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, the density increases appropriately, but the conflict remains passive. The "opposition" is the difficulty of the task rather than an active force or internal dilemma; the "fear" of the window breaking again is stated but never threatens the current action.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.4)
    Conflict is internal and low-pressure; the librarian functions as a facilitator who removes obstacles immediately rather than an antagonist or complicating force. The protagonist’s "struggle" is resolved through a guided visualization, lacking a moment of high-stakes agency or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.4)
    Conflict is largely internal and thematic; while Maro’s confession introduces friction, the external threat ("officials who smell smoke") appears late and feels slightly tacked on to generate ending tension. The stakes remain somewhat abstract (memory vs. erasure) without forcing a decisive, high-cost trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from the preservation of strangers' vows to the survival of the library itself, culminating in the narrator's personal wager against oblivion. The cost—a lifetime of "clean blank survival" in the cold—is palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.7)
    The silent negotiation creates coherent, rising pressure, and the stakes of the trade are palpable. A minor coincidence (the boat's horn discouraging the antagonist from bolting) slightly dilutes the protagonist's agency in maintaining the confrontation, but her tactical stillness recovers the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stakes are primarily atmospheric and abstract ("debt" and "memory") rather than visceral or interpersonal. While the sensory intensity escalates efficiently, the conflict lacks a distinct moment of risk or trade-off for the narrator, making the resolution feel like a foregone conclusion of the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure escalates coherently from the physical failure of the lock to the internal demand of the creative act. The broken lock serves as an effective pivot that forces the narrator to abandon mechanical solutions for intuitive ones. The cost is legible in the "wrist trembling" and the emotional taxation of the memory, satisfying the requirement for felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.5)
    The conflict is primarily internal against an external lock, and the cost—vulnerability through candor—is legible and felt on the page. The escalation from professional observation to personal confession drives the narrative effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.4)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the narrative relies on intensity rather than opposition. The single potential obstacle—the crowd's fear of wasting water—is resolved instantly with a basin, bypassing any need for a hard choice or sacrifice. Stakes remain abstract ("preserve the color of wonder") and are never genuinely threatened.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes are existential for the android’s purpose; the escalation from "compasses stutter" to "windows spider" is coherent and pressing under the Situational/Causal lens. The final action is a proactive choice that pays the price of the dome to save the archive.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=3.8)
    Pressure is introduced via the inspector and the drone but dissolves instantly upon the narrator's request to "hear the room." The conflict lacks genuine teeth because the antagonist capitulates without struggle, and the solution (the key) arrives without sacrifice, resulting in a friction-free resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are declared but lack on-page pressure; the protagonist faces the "State" and a "daemon" with such "calm defiance" that the outcome never feels in doubt. The conflict is resolved through abstract gestures (dancing a vowel) that meet no tangible resistance, resulting in a low-tension climax.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.5)
    The conflict between civic "mercy" (erasure) and personal ache drives the narrative efficiently. The external pressure of the gravity pockets effectively physicalizes the stakes, tightening the tension in the crystal chamber scene where the environment threatens to crush the memory.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes are high in concept ("door in the sky") but low in dramatic pressure; the antagonist is an abstract "code" that offers no active resistance or counter-move. The escalation is atmospheric rather than causal, and the resolution comes through a simple physical adjustment without forcing a trade-off or sacrifice. The "meaningful tightening" is subtle to the point of being nearly imperceptible.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict is the story's weakest element; the stakes are intellectual and aesthetic rather than visceral or urgent. There is no active opposition to the narrator's goal, and the "pressure" is essentially a gentle pedagogy that encounters no obstacles. While the ending lands a conceptual stance (accepting "agreed upon lies"), it lacks the felt cost of a decision made under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are clearly drawn between containment and release, escalating effectively as the shell's whisper manifests as Reina's face. The cost of "standing until my bones ring" provides a necessary visceral price for the thematic resolution, grounding the magical elements.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clearly articulated (freedom vs. chaos), and the pressure builds effectively through the ritual steps. The physical cost (blood) and the psychological cost (renunciation of the personal door) are present, though the lack of active opposition keeps the tension quiet. The escalation is internal and atmospheric but sufficient for the scope.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.8)
    The stakes are stated but the pressure is low; the Council yields too easily to the protagonist's competence ("watched their shoulders loosen"), lacking a moment of decisive risk or potential failure.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes of recovering truth against erasure are clear, and the ritual progresses coherently to the revelation. However, the conflict is largely procedural; the ghost and the ice offer no active resistance, making the success feel inevitable rather than hard-won. The cost is conceptual (the weight of the name) rather than a visceral price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.5)
    The conflict is clear—livelihood vs. nature/mercy—but the pressure on the protagonist is low. The philosopher faces no genuine risk or difficult trade-off; he solves the problem with superior wisdom rather than struggle or sacrifice. The resolution, while thematically satisfying, lacks the visceral cost required for higher marks.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.5)
    The conflict between the professional drive to expose and the human need for "comfortable lies" is well-braided. The resolution involves a felt professional cost, compromising the "whole truth" to preserve the orchard's function.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are high (revolution, survival), but the summary mode distances the reader from the pressure. The climax—Kestrel taking the hit—happens in a single sentence, reducing the visceral impact of the conflict and the felt cost of the resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are clearly internalized (artist's worth/redemption) and externalized (survival/community connection). While the storm provides a classic "dark night" escalation, the emotional deepening occurs effectively through the memory of the mother and the subsequent validation from the widow.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are clear and high—the rupture of a harbor and the weight of a soul—creating coherent pressure throughout. The conflict escalation is quiet but intense, pivoting on a choice of vulnerability over violence. The cost is paid on the page through the reliving of trauma, validating the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are declared ("harness is a trap") but never tested with visceral risk; the antagonist capitulates with a "slow exhale" rather than a fight. The protagonist faces no genuine trade-offs or sacrifices, resulting in a victory that feels inevitable and devoid of felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clearly established and escalated; the tension between the director's voice and the physical evidence builds effectively. The choice to defy authority carries a legible price ("ruin careers"), ensuring the conflict matters.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.6)
    The stakes are clearly defined and escalate appropriately from the repair of an object to the salvation of a man's future. The shift from seeking a technical repair to seeking a moral strategy is handled well, and the resolution involves a felt cost—the chaplain committing his own reputation and labor to the apprenticeship plan.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.5)
    External opposition is minimal; the acid sea threatens but never strikes, and the "yearning algorithm" resolves uncertainty without cost. The lack of an antagonist or a situation that forces a hard choice results in low narrative tension; the protagonist succeeds because the plot allows it, not because she overcomes resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clear and escalate from a technical curiosity to a moral burden regarding a corporate cover-up. The pressure tightens meaningfully when the "lie is heavier," forcing a trade-off between public justice ("furnace of headlines") and private sanctity. The resolution is an Earned Stasis that feels costly and significant, though the antagonist (the system) remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes are clearly defined (war, survival), and the pressure of the "next break" drives the narrative forward. However, the conflict resolution is softened by the globe’s power; the device does the heavy lifting of persuasion, reducing the need for the protagonist to navigate complex human resistance. The climax regains ground by demanding a "cost" from the envoys, ensuring the peace isn't free.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are clear and high (life vs. death), with the waiting period providing a natural pressure cooker. The climax—saving the boy from the ice—is a functional if slightly convenient escalation that externalizes the stakes, forcing the protagonist to confront the nature of "approaching endings" directly.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.2)
    The emotional stakes are clear and escalate through the dialogue, moving from small talk to the core conflict of the traveler's relationship. The traveler's hesitation acts as effective resistance, making the final phone call feel earned rather than inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are clearly defined as the loss of wisdom/history, and the "cost" is articulated well as the pain of deep listening. While the tension is meditative rather than visceral, the internal pressure remains coherent and sustains the narrative momentum to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are clear—the success of the community ritual—but the obstacles (Ole's skepticism, the storm) feel like gentle bumps rather than severe tests. Ole is won over by a single sentence of thematic exposition, which lowers the dramatic tension. The physical pressure of the storm adds necessary weight, but the resolution feels slightly smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.6)
    The stakes (cultural growth vs. stagnation) are high conceptually but the interpersonal conflict is muted; the custodians are described as "empty of risk" and yield easily, reducing tension. While the scholar's method is a meaningful tightening of tactics, the lack of steeper resistance or a more visceral cost for the protagonist limits the dramatic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are clear and high: the preservation of self against the tide of time. The pressure escalates organically as the garden shifts and the "future falls out of his hands," forcing a crystallization of stance in the amphitheater circle.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are established (comet, shutters), but the escalation is diffused by the magical realism of the solution; the "quake" offers brief physical pressure, but the protagonist's success comes from a shift in "posture" rather than a hard trade-off or sacrifice. The cost is negligible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.3)
    The stakes are high (impending death), but the on-page conflict is low; the obstacles (getting Lena there, the reconciliation) dissolve almost instantly upon contact. The narrative lacks a moment of doubt or meaningful cost; everything proceeds exactly according to the narrator’s plan, resulting in a smooth but tension-light progression.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes are clear and high (the stability of the isle), and the intellectual pressure is sustained. While the moral choice is foreshadowed early ("learn without taking"), the tension of the mystery and the weight of the revelation provide sufficient escalation to carry the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stakes are clearly articulated (restoring the boy/atoning for doubt), but the escalation lacks teeth; the protagonist faces no significant resistance or cost in the garden. The climax—healing the fox—is a beautiful image but resolves the conflict with immediate ease, bypassing the "skeptic" friction entirely.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=4.2)
    The central conflict (keep vs. release) is resolved in hindsight via a convenient "middle path" that satisfies everyone; the absence of a dramatized test or genuine sacrifice renders the stakes theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are primarily internal—reconciling the public "viral" persona with private healing. The pressure is low-key, but the reconfiguration of the pendant (bribe to sun-catcher) provides a tangible beat of change. The ending achieves an Earned Stasis, foreclosing the option of immediate public speech with a legible conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.5)
    Pressure is consistently applied through the environment ("current," "wolves") and the psychological weight of the encounters. The protagonist makes a clear, costly choice to move "deeper against the current" rather than accept the "easy ending," satisfying the requirement for agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=2.8)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent; the moon lingers to help, the arbor agrees, and the only snag is resolved instantly by a helpful child. Everything aligns too easily, resulting in a lack of narrative heat or escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes are clearly established (finding the brother), but the on-page pressure is largely static (endurance against cold/silence) rather than escalating through active opposition. The success of the ritual feels slightly inevitable, lacking a moment where failure seemed genuinely imminent.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.3)
    Pressure accumulates steadily through the repair process, but the conflict remains low-friction; the protagonist faces a puzzle rather than an antagonist or a difficult trade-off. The "risk" of collecting deeper voices is stated ("they were risky") but not dramatized with immediate danger or consequence. The stakes are handled metaphorically, which distances the reader from the potential for failure.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.5)
    The stakes are largely conceptual, centering on the abstract cost of freedom versus service, but the arrival of the personified Valley provides a necessary focal point for pressure. The choice to stay feels earned within the story's logic, though the opposition lacks visceral "teeth" prior to the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.0)
    The internal conflict between the "wildness" of grief and the need for containment is palpable. The rising whistle of the kettle provides an effective, if simple, escalation mechanic that parallels the rising pressure of memory.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are clearly established: the physical survival of the settlement versus the spiritual cost of the "grind." The escalation is effective, with the ghost rejecting the initial "currency" of overhead stories, forcing Mara to pay a deeper, more painful personal tribute. The cost is felt in the weight of the "dropped wrench" regret.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.0)
    Pressure is minimal; the antagonist is abstract entropy, which offers no active resistance. There is no moment where the plan fails or options narrow, resulting in a low-stakes narrative where the "cost" is merely the effort of labor rather than a sacrificed value or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.9)
    The internal stakes are high, but the external opposition—the sanctuary itself—yields too easily ("consent," "did not flinch"). A more active resistance from the environment would have heightened the cost of the transgression and sharpened the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are clear and escalation is coherent, moving from quiet investigation to a high-pressure confrontation. While the antagonist's capitulation feels slightly swift, it is causally supported by the "public witness" mechanic (neighbors waking), which effectively raises the social cost of violence.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clear (loss of ancient knowledge), and the council's threat adds necessary time pressure ("before the thaw"). However, the antagonist is off-screen, and the primary obstacle (decoding the rope) yields easily to the protagonist's competence. The conflict lacks a moment of visceral resistance or failure before the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.6)
    Conflict remains low-simmer and atmospheric; the protagonist's unique method doesn't drive the resolution, as the problem (uncertainty) is solved by the postal service (the letter). The stakes of total separation deflate when it turns out communication channels are still open.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.2)
    Conflict escalates clearly through the Keepers' demands and the physical tremors. The resolution—the bird’s song subduing the Keepers—is a soft power move that risks feeling convenient, but the protagonist’s internal acceptance of a "flawed" victory provides the necessary conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.2)
    Conflict is minimal; the environment yields easily to the grafting, and the boy accepts the protagonist's wisdom without resistance. The narrative lacks a moment of genuine doubt or high-stakes pressure to test the protagonist's resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes are clearly defined (waking the city), and the obstacle of the sticky panel forces a personal cost (vulnerability/confession). The resolution feels earned through this emotional trade, though the external pressure is somewhat low until the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.8)
    The conflict is subtle and thematic; while the stakes of "safe light" are clear, the resolution comes smoothly with the gears meshing on the first try. The cost is conceptual (relinquishing the relic) rather than acutely felt in the moment of action.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are clearly defined but remain low-pressure and aesthetic; the "cost" of untying the braid is conceptual rather than visceral. The climax relies on external advice (the grandmother) rather than a forced, high-risk choice by the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    The tightening—discovering the narrator's own debt on the handle—effectively raises the stakes from a routine duty to a personal crisis. While the opposition is internal, the pressure is coherent, and the cost is paid in the specific renunciation of the "two shots" representing the narrator's guilt.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.3)
    Pressure is coherent but low-stakes; the conflict belongs primarily to the ghost, with Rowan acting as a safe mediator. While the resolution is earned through procedure, the absence of direct opposition or significant personal cost to Rowan limits tension.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.8)
    The conflict is set up well but resolved through summary rather than scene; the Council's "argument" is glossed over in a single sentence. The escalation flattens because the opposition offers no genuine threat or counter-move that forces the protagonist to adapt or lose something.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.3)
    Tension escalates appropriately from the quiet famine to the active risk of the broadcast and the passing patrols. While the external threat (the boots trudging past) is resolved somewhat softly via avoidance, the internal pressure of Mara's choice to engage the signal provides sufficient narrative drive. The stakes of "erasure" are felt throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.2)
    Escalation is subtle but coherent, driven by the drawing process and the slowing chair. The cost is clearly established in the destruction of the portrait, enforcing the stake of impermanence.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.8)
    The conflict between truth/time and the competing narratives is conceptually strong but dramatically distant due to the summary mode. The opposing factions feel like symbolic placeholders rather than immediate threats, and the lack of a specific, high-pressure confrontation softens the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.0)
    The "backfire" provides necessary mechanical escalation, but the conflict dissolves too smoothly upon the teacher's intervention. The ease with which deep-seated neighborhood rivalry yields to a choir lesson lowers the sense of genuine stakes or danger.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.0)
    External pressure is abstract (the off-screen "Quiet Diet"), and the on-page obstacle (pruning/planting) offers little genuine resistance. The protagonist faces no significant risk of failure, and the victory feels inevitable rather than hard-won against a reactive opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.2)
    One dominant stake (the loss of wonder/tower function) is signaled early. The cost is present—the narrator sacrifices a "dowry" (the recorded hum)—but the conflict lacks interpersonal friction or high-risk improvisation. The obstacle yields quickly to the protagonist's resources.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.6)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the house "waits" and the narrator acts, but there is no active opposition, time pressure, or risk of failure. The stakes are purely abstract (alignment vs. silence), and while the "hush" acts as a presence, it never threatens the protagonist's goal or forces a difficult trade-off. The story relies on mood rather than tension to sustain interest.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is largely theoretical ("certainty" vs. "nuance") and lacks a concrete antagonist or escalating pressure. The bishop, a potential obstacle, capitulates immediately to the ampoule, and the narrator pays no visible price for their success, rendering the stakes abstract rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    The "rupture" creates a distinct moment of tightening, transforming the endless endurance into a specific confrontation with a wager. The cost is palpable—the acceptance of "boundless confinement" as a duty sustained by regret. Pressure scales appropriately from the internal memory to the external metaphysical trial.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.2)
    Escalation operates correctly under the Accumulative lens, deepening the "proof" of kindness. However, the absence of friction—every stranger immediately understands and accepts the magic—lowers the palpable tension and makes the stakes feel somewhat theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.4)
    Conflict is primarily atmospheric; the antagonist is the abstract "erasure," which lowers immediate visceral pressure. The physical stakes of the waterfall crossing are dampened by lyrical description, making the success feel inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—defying fate to retrieve the sister—is escalated by the mechanical tension of the clockwork and the "refusal" in her eyes. The deepening at the climax, where "shattering fate is cruder than stepping around it," forces a compromise that carries a distinct, ongoing cost (the nightly sacrifice of regrets).

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clearly established as a battle for autonomy against fear. The cost of victory—reliving the shame of loving the architect of one's own death—is a felt, psychological price paid on the page during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are clear (survival of the orchard), and the pressure of the "long backed creature" is established early. However, the protagonist's mastery is so complete that the outcome rarely feels in genuine doubt; the conflict reads more as a demonstration of skill than a desperate struggle. A moment where the "tuning" nearly fails or requires a steeper personal cost would have elevated the tension. The resolution is earned but feels somewhat low-risk due to his overwhelming competence.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes are clearly defined as both physical (the city's survival) and existential (the fate of the teacher/expedition). The escalation from the gate to the watchers is steady, and the resolution provides a meaningful answer that carries a felt conceptual cost—the loss is permanent, but repurposed.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are declared but not felt; the central conflict dissolves instantly when Tomas and the town accept the truth without struggle. The resolution comes without sacrifice, as the threat of "blistering the town" evaporates upon contact.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes are existential and abstract (memory vs. erasure) rather than immediate; the surveyor faces no difficult trade-offs or active opposition beyond the clock. The pressure is atmospheric, lacking a moment where the protagonist must sacrifice something specific to succeed.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.9)
    Tension is effectively braided between the external threat (the drone, the corrupt rulers) and the internal struggle (revenge vs. accuracy). While the antagonist forces remain distant, the "alternative hypothesis" creates sufficient active pressure. The climax—discovering the judge's name and choosing the arrow over destruction—lands with significant weight.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.4)
    The stakes are deeply personal and the cost of the ritual (fingers as thin maps, the weight of the cranes) is palpable. The tension escalates well through the physical ascent. However, the external pressure is somewhat low; the obstacles are atmospheric rather than active forces opposing the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are clearly established as a conflict between institutional extraction and personal sanctity; the escalation comes not from external action but from the realization of what the "minima" represents. The pressure holds under a Situational lens, forcing a crystallization of the protagonist's stance. The cost is felt in the final rejection of the "miracle" the board demands.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story operates on internal and thematic pressure rather than external threat. The escalation is a "deepening" of understanding rather than rising danger. While effective for a quiet piece, the stakes remain somewhat abstract ("frequency of belonging") without a concrete, immediate price for failure beyond continued malaise.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.8)
    Internal pressure is high, driven by the protagonist's need to atone. The external stakes are less active until the retrospective realization of his own sale, but the final choice to speak effectively tightens the narrative focus.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are clearly articulated (peace vs. war), but the ritualistic nature of the exchange dampens visceral pressure until Daro's refusal. The escalation is functional, but the protagonist resolves the peak conflict with low-cost social authority rather than a painful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.1)
    The stakes of family reconciliation are established early and maintained. The "backlash of regrets" serves as a functional internal antagonist. However, the external conflict resolves with relatively low friction; the sister's acceptance is immediate ("blessing a wound"), missing a chance for sharper interpersonal texture.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure escalates coherently from the physical navigation of the labyrinth to the emotional demand of the Sentinel. The cost is paid on the page through the confession, foreclosing the option of a painless restart.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.0)
    High stakes (death vs. reunion) are established early, and the cost of the transformation (loss of human form) is paid on the page. The conflict is somewhat softened by the ease of the magic; while the "bone protest" signals physical cost, the protagonist overcomes it instantly, reducing the felt pressure of the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake (lost time/connection) is clear and escalates through the ritual's demands. While the external resistance is relatively low—the glade yields quickly to the alignment—the internal cost of the promises ("an hour without a phone") provides necessary friction and weight.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.8)
    The stakes are braided tightly between the internal (grief/weight) and external (the locked door/child's safety). The refusal to use force acts as a decisive escalation that raises the cost, requiring the physical sacrifice of the "pricked thumb."

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.5)
    External stakes are clear (the mother trapped by the tide), but the narrative tension is undercut by the ready-made solution provided by the protagonist's past actions. There is little sense of "now or never" improvisation or costly trade-offs, as the rope and oar simply "fall into place." The conflict resolves with a sense of inevitability rather than earned victory.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict is extremely soft; the "intrigue" faces no active opposition, as guards are conveniently absent and the mechanical fix is immediate. While the quill holder serves as a symbolic cost, there is no moment where the protagonist must choose between competing values or risk failure. The "revolution" occurs without struggle, lowering the stakes tension.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.5)
    The stakes are existential (dissolution of the shore) but anchored effectively in a personal promise. The escalation is linear but tense, moving from preparation to the perilous walk, then to the final confrontation with entropy at the cliff's edge. The "sliding futures" provide a constant, situational pressure that raises the cost of every step.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are clear—the reclamation of voice against erasure—and the escalation of the storm effectively parallels the internal pressure. While the "censor" remains an abstract off-page antagonist, the immediate physical risk of the climb and the storm provides sufficient on-page cost to anchor the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.3)
    The conflict is elegant and clear, though the stakes feel more theoretical than visceral given the stylized nature of the combat. The "cost" (pride, a torn sleeve) is present but light; the tension relies heavily on the ritual rather than immediate danger.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.8)
    Conflict is largely external and potential rather than dramatized; the patrol car passes without stopping, and the developers are present only as signs. The rapid assistance from neighbors lowers the stakes, resolving the central challenge of rebuilding with convenient ease. The pressure does not force a difficult trade-off or significant cost.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are clear (reunion with Mara), but the escalation is driven more by magical mechanics than character agency against resistance. The conflict dissolves upon their meeting without a significant on-page sacrifice or complication, lowering the tension at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.7)
    The stakes are high (erasure of history), but the obstacle course is low-friction; the narrator overcomes the missing treaty moment instantly by "learning" it through a dream. The narrative flows too smoothly from task to task without a moment where the outcome feels genuinely in jeopardy or a significant price is paid.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.2)
    The internal stakes of grief are clear, but the external pressure is low; the ritual proceeds without significant obstacles or cost. The resolution comes through a magical shift rather than a hard trade-off or difficult decision, resulting in a gentle but somewhat low-tension arc.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (thaw mistrust) signaled early, escalates via lens-deepening that forces self-recognition and projection setup, narrowing to mutual admission; cost visible in self-exposure but one micro-turn keeps under 9-band.

    Dominant stake (prove garden reciprocity vs. measured luck) signaled early tightens via Auditor confrontation, forcing endurance with on-page cost in maze's selective archway under Accumulative lens.

    Dominant stake (prove sideways time) signaled early, tightens via lever pull yielding hatchling's tomorrow and bird's three-minutes-ago stir under Accum lens. Agency in adjustments narrows to gentle success; cost legible in eased lever foregoing full pull. Minor abstractness in signatures prevents higher band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (unravel ghost code to save mezzanine) signaled early; agency-deepening in disruptive harmonic forecloses rehearsal path, escalation via message cadence reweights with on-page cost of sliced-air pause triggering groan/collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (collecting wall-stories amid displaced axis) signaled early; accumulative deepening narrows via diaries/tapestry to unbroken account, forcing alignment trade-off with felt cost in world's lost ear. Agency in probing actions forecloses ignorance. One tightening sufficient; pressure coheres without reversal overload.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (orchestrating open-secret revelation) signaled early via seeded fortunes; textural escalation peaks in dots blooming "sentences about nights when boats docked without papers," forcing stance crystallization with exhaled cost. Agency in taping drives turn; moral calculus (refuge vs. contraband) sharpens without coincidence resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake (prevent possession via rhetoric before completion) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through question-tightenings like "If you own everything, what will you ask tomorrow," forcing entity pause and recognition with agency in Ruan's chiasmus/antithesis.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake of bond-reforging escalates accumulatively via spice-road enabling animal permissions and story-telling, narrowing to reluctant wing-ache trade-off.

Agency in timer-setting and reading forecloses suppression; cost felt in "echo with a page turning." Lens escalation via density to cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)

== Grader: Kimi K2-0905 ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—save the greenhouse without drama—tightens once: the decision to reopen at half-capacity forever forecloses full restoration. Pressure accumulates through each salvaged notebook page and taped crack; cost is visible in the half-light schedule and in the composting of dead orchids. No reversal, but the deepening is decisive under Accumulative lens. The “slope” principle turns decay into a partner, narrowing later options to patient increments only.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—artistic survival after murder attempt—tightens when the kiln offers a second furnace that could also kill. One meaningful deepening: the discovery that the mentor once worked here turns the smugglers’ hideout into a clandestine atelier, narrowing the artist’s moral options. Visible price: the scorched ledger is traded for a new glass map, forfeiting anonymity. Escalation is steady under Causal lens; no coincidence resolves the threat.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: can silence be made into music without sound? Pressure escalates through each thermal map—child’s tear softens tempo, elder’s laugh accelerates rhythm—so stakes tighten aesthetically, not physically. No reversals needed under Accumulative lens; each frost trace is a deepening that narrows options toward purely visual/somatic music. Cost is legible: bodily warmth, time, and the perpetual absence of true sound.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—give rest an address—signals early and deepens when the drowned messages ricochet because of his own lens; protagonist agency drives every escalatory step (hiring skiff, wedging into seam, stamping ledger). Cost is visible: he trades breath for brine and accepts the city’s counter-address. One meaningful tightening suffices; no reversal is required under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—survival-through-anonymity—tightens when Noor’s demand for credit threatens the silence that shields the network; the midnight run braids youth and elder sectors, foreclosing the option of public gratitude. Escalation is accumulative: each door-step increases the density of shared memory until the bell empties, turning social capital into wordless residue. Cost is visible—the bell ends lighter, the seed-note nameless, Farid tastes salt. Just shy of 8.8 because the external watchers never intersect the route; threat remains atmospheric rather than tactically compressing this single night.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“find where unused love is stored”—tightens when breathing choices physically widen the aperture to let the woman cross; each inhale forecloses the option to keep love sealed. Cost is legible: every future breath must now be spent as oil for the lamps. One meaningful deepening suffices; no external coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—touch duration without breaking—tightens when each footfall multiplies past crossings, raising the cost of collapse. The meaningful turn arrives when the narrator asks the shard to “teach me and to leave me,” trading nostalgic tether for lived pattern. Escalation is textural: photographs shed detail, bridges stop doubling, breath steadies—options narrow to one present crossing. Price is visible in blanked photos and the dust that “hummed,” not just asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—keep seeds out of catalogued archives and into living soil—tightens when the protagonist chains herself to the bench, turning immobility into the last barrier. One meaningful escalation: arrow wedged through hasp converts hidden map into audible alarm, foreclosing stealth exit. Cost is visible: she forfeits escape speed and accepts possible arrest, trading personal liberty for collective germination. The wall’s external fall complicates rather than rescues, keeping pressure internal and choice-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—“find the sound of trust breaking”—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens when each absence is soldered into the prototype. Escalation is Accumulative: layers of sampled lacks (hush after pump, skipped diver heartbeat, whitening hiss of oilskin) progressively alloy into the device until the spectral notch is unmistakable. Visible price: the father’s retreat is not fixed but translated into a “warm pulse in the ear,” accepting permanent emotional winter. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length; no reversal is required, only the final crystallization where the aid releases “thin ice singing” instead of rage.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—whether to keep or release the captured light—tightens once when the mirrored self appears, narrowing options to stay or board. Escalation is textural: each refracted image (departures glass, shoe-mirror, florist window) increases emotional density until refusal is the only breathable act. Cost is the thief’s surrendered legend and the older self’s surrendered train. Coincidence (meeting self) complicates but does not resolve; agency remains with the jar’s release.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can curiosity survive inside a safe zone the narrator must literally blow into being—tightens once: from solitary refuge to shared invitation. The thaw-drip cadence is the external pressure that forces the turn to “heat is shared.” Cost is visible: relinquishing exclusivity of ruin, risking unknown strangers. Under accumulative lens the density shift (three bells, posted note) is sufficient; no further reversal needed.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—own the truth of one’s bruised body—tightens exactly once when the microfilm sprays evidence across the ceiling, foreclosing the option to remain Jax. Escalation is causal under lens: each decryption step narrows tactical space until only the confrontation remains. Kellan’s lunge pays the visible price (rotten boards give way), satisfying the cost requirement. No second reversal, but at 700 words one meaningful tightening is sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: can the scribe chart the endless night before it swallows them? Pressure accumulates through densifying hush and shedding gold; each flake narrows the option to chart by line, forcing retell-by-silence. The oracle’s stick-taps enact one visible micro-turn that forecloses hurry. Cost is the booklet’s extinction and the star’s scrape—legible, felt, but slightly abstract; the price is conceptual rather than bodily, adequate for this lyric frame.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can a mechanical mind birth genuine thought—tightens when the violin’s tone starts repeating footprints. The seventh-loop bowing is the single decisive escalation: it collapses surveillance (static snow) and liquefies the instrument, narrowing future options to either haste (crack) or unhurried pause (comma). Cost is visible: security blind-spot risks deactivation, yet enables the stewardly pause that ends loops. Agency remains robot-bound; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—proving the garden recognizes devotion despite measurable luck—signals early and deepens through ceremonial micro-victories. Escalation is accretive: each marble placement and ribbon tightens private proof against public metrics; the Auditor’s visit externalizes pressure without becoming antagonistic. Cost is felt when vines physically reject the Auditor’s hat, affirming the protagonist’s exclusionary legitimacy. No coincidence resolves tension; the final arch forms from sustained labor, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.1)
    One dominant stake—prove sideways time—tightens through each lever click until Hale renounces final verification; the price is the unspent proof itself. No reversals are needed; pressure accrues as the nexus could derange the flock, forcing his gentler hand. The cost is legible in the lattice’s quieting and the birds’ resettled dreams.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prevent mass injury—surfaces at the watermark prophecy and tightens with each physical groan. Escalation is causal: because the musician trusts the ghost, he sabotages the downbeat; because he sabotages, the bracket fails early while the crowd is already moving. Visible price: he trades career safety for moral agency, felt in the hush that follows his “wrong” note. One meaningful tightening suffices; no repetition, no coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—avalanche risk vs. Luca's reputation—signals early and tightens once: the moment the oracle offers a live forecast window for the climbing convoy. The protagonist’s agency is the final broadcast; it narrows options from silence to public warning and carries unmistakable social cost (curses “up the mountain like smoke”). No artificial reversals, just the single deepening that forces the reveal. Could nudge higher if the physical price (job loss, donor fury) were hinted beyond reputational smoke.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—find the swallowed truth’s weight—tightens when wheel turns and zeros in ledger erase father’s hours. One meaningful escalation: choice to open gate narrows options to either accept erased math or carry it; protagonist chooses oral, bodily keeping (tag in cheek). Cost is palpable: the “click” of life’s gears, the metallic taste. Agency drives turn; coincidence only complicates (footsteps without feet).

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=4.7)
    Dominant stake—witness without judgment—remains steady; no meaningful tightening or price is dramatized that forecloses an alternative path. Accumulating refugees raises texture yet never tests the keeper’s stance with a forced choice; the ceiling crack promises escalation but resolves into patience without visible trade-off. Pressure plateaus rather than sharpens.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: can silence be reopened without force? Pressure escalates by sonic density: whisper-to-tap-to-vowel, each increment narrowing the possibility of retreat. The eclipse acts as situational crucible—external clock that forbids stalling; either the voice enters the dark or the moment expires. Cost is audible: once Felix sings “mama,” the silence can no longer be claimed as inevitable; the failure option is now live and shared.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: can the historian coax the silo to relinquish its last stories before universal silence petrifies. Pressure accumulates through denser sonic strata—coin-clink, grain dust, burn-slashed words—until pinning the tapestry acts as the single decisive tightening that forecloses mere listening and demands inscription. Cost is conceptual: the world’s axis tilts farther east, irreversible, silo leaning like a bell now doomed to be rung by future strangers. Agency is attentional, not combative, fitting the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—will the island admit its open secret—tightens when each punctured fortune enlarges through the Fresnel lens, foreclosing denial. Agency is collective rather than single-decision, but the visible price (constable’s empty palms, teacher’s swollen ledger, ferryman’s wind-burned shame) makes the cost legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prevent possession—signaled in line 1. Escalation is Accumulative/Textural: each loop adds density until grammar itself becomes the tightening. One meaningful deepening: “If you own everything, what will you ask tomorrow?”—this question forces the entity to confront infinite regress, collapsing its plane. Price is legible: the demon’s loss of a future-proof horizon.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—conductor must birth an unheard symphony before exhaustion—threads every memory-cue; each mapped cul-de-sac tightens the clock. Agency is attention and posture: by “tracing the smallest circle” the narrator relinquishes forcing sound, trading control for lucid rest—price is legible. No antagonist needed; pressure is situational and metabolic. Escalation is textural densification rather than causal reversal, coherent under the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“conquer the labyrinth of self or be divided”—is signaled in paragraph 4 and escalates via each chamber’s mirror- selves. The meaningful tightening occurs when choosing the weakest-echo staircase: it forecloses omniscient float and narrows options toward the fall. Cost is visible: eternal return forfeits arrival; the final fall pays with mortality. Agency is micro but decisive—each tablet whisper seeds the next corridor; no reliance on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—defeat emotional numbness—is signaled early. Pressure escalates through texture: each backward-played syllable collapses into inhalation, density tightening until the drumskin answers. Agency rests in Lena pressing play and keeping her hands on the drum; the cost is the reopening of grief scored the night her hearing failed. The final image forecloses numbness by offering space a home, but the price (e.g., vulnerability in front of students) is more implied than visible on the page, keeping it just shy of high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—ownership vs unownership of weather-truth—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened by each object: tube demands “bring it unowned,” hair curls like fence wire. Escalation is textural: each new layer (follower’s appearance, pigeon’s arrival, woman’s brother inside ring) increases the price of staying unaligned. The meaningful turn is the narrator’s micro-choice to fasten the tube back to the bird—an act that forecloses the option to keep the evidence. Cost is legible: comfort is sacrificed in the promise to “count raindrops aloud” within earshot of armed guards.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can the broker remain aromatically insulated?—is signaled early (“I had come to understand why some smells trigger tears”). Escalation is accumulative/textural: each sensory layer (dust, UV hum, violet seam, smoke) tightens the noose of memory. The decisive tightening occurs when residual oils under UV force recognition, foreclosing the option of eternal caution. Cost is felt: the weeping is involuntary, the shield abandoned; could edge higher if earlier beats showed aromatic caution blocking a concrete opportunity.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—map/poem vs. annulment of the “second” of imprisonment—tightens once via the visitors’ offer; poet’s refusal to trade the whole braid forces a creative counter-offer that materially narrows his future options and costs him navigational certainty, fulfilling meaningful escalation under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—releasing the chronic hush—tightens when each storytelling act risks louder rupture; escalation is Accumulative: density of shared voices increases until the cracked bell’s first pulse reweights silence from foe to partner. Visible cost: the bell’s missing tongue and the violin’s deliberate scratchiness foreclose flawless harmony forever. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversals required.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—can she finish the memorial perfume without being embalmed by grief—tightens when counterfeit courage is inhaled and her nose trembles yet eyes stay open. One meaningful deepening: the accord’s “careful lie of surviving” is offered, accepted, and metabolized into real stamina. Cost is visible on-page: dealer forfeits the petal’s residual intimacy, left “uncarved again.” Agency is shared—she sniffs, he releases—under accumulative pressure pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: visibility for invisible labor. Tightening occurs when duo chooses whisper-campaign over banners; live option (public praise) foreclosed. Cost: perpetual anonymity accepted. Escalation accumulative—each card/cocoa beat thickens texture rather than causal turns; pattern breaks at ledger-breath final image, reweighting stakes under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.4)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake is personal—capture the echo without waking the giant—signaled in line 3 and tightened exactly once when the cradle’s cadence stops. That single interruption forecloses stealth and triggers release, a visible price (city slides a heartbeat left). Agency is continuous: every motion is a calculated borrowing that worsens future silence. No extra reversals needed; the escalation is the density of borrowed seconds compressing into one luminous image.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—turning absence into countable continuity—tightens once when the stalactites slow and the apprentice figure refracts. Cost is felt (orchard gifts the chalk-salt apple), but escalation is single-pulse rather than a because/therefore chain; under Accumulative lens this suffices. No visible loss of tool or stamina, so ceiling stops at 8.3.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—becoming visible without being expelled—tightens when each cache act risks discovery. Escalation is accretive: outage → blue lamps → tape hum → atlas trap; every layer increases exposure cost. Protagonist agency is absolute: no coincidence rescues or resolves. The final step from pipe to light crystallizes the stance, trading safety for service, and that trade-off is irreversible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—can the island relearn its own water paths without war-like machines—tightens when the map is found and must be painted publicly. One meaningful tightening: the cistern seam of light demands they haul the cylinder, risking contamination or collapse. Price is felt: elders’ flood songs keep the brush steady despite “hands shook with old nights,” showing stamina taxed. No off-stage resolution; the mural’s first rain is the on-page test.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.4)
    A single dominant stake—magnify everyday magic until it sings—tightens when the pilgrim risks hosting the shadow inside the communal vowel, trading abstract benevolence for a permanent, audible alteration of ordinary sound. Pressure escalates accumulatively: each domestic sound added to the choir makes the looming shadow’s need concrete. Cost is visible: the town’s vowel is now haunted by a listener that will never leave; options are narrowed because every future sweep of a broom will ring with this new tenant.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: can silence be transmuted from punishment to communal breath? Pressure tightens when the valve is fitted: the option of a triumphant note is foreclosed, replacing it with the risk of continued silence. Cost is felt: the city remains exposed to future storms, tactics unchanged except for the new practice of listening. Agency resides in renunciation—refusing to sound the note—so escalation is internal but legible under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can I pay for my own silences?—tightens with each ticket-stamp until the blank itself glows. Agency is crystalline: every arrow followed is a prior refusal rewritten. No coincidence; pressure grows because the narrator keeps offering real nights and real lovers. Final cost: the fortress never kept truths, only the shape of holding—option foreclosed, stance crystallized.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can memories be housed without suffocating—tightens when open squares demand the very memories Lio and narrator most avoid. Escalation is textural: each chalked numeral thickens the unheard symphony until tower seams physically open, a visible cost. Agency sits with narrator’s decision to surrender his culpable night; that sacrifice reconfigures corridor geometry. Could use one more on-page obstacle before surrender to push into 8.8 band, but pressure is coherent and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—“discover what happens after goodbye”—is signaled early; tightening occurs when geometry bends and fragment jumps to Mara, narrowing options. Cost (curse exile) is visible. Agency is present but protagonist engineers transfer rather than facing irreversible self-loss; hence mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—Yusef’s breath vs. city’s quiet death order—signaled in paragraph 2. Escalation narrows twice: patrol sighting raises exposure, shout crystallizes jeopardy. Protagonist’s agency never flags; each tactic (paperwork feint, ink-pot prop, wheel-groove timing) is a because/therefore response. Final tightening: acceptance of warning as “tax” makes the moral cost irreversible under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserve vanishing time-textures—tightens when batteries thin and the lamp’s hum falter threatens the entire archival project; escalation is textural, not causal, fitting Accumulative lens. One meaningful deepening: the afternoon power stutter forces the narrator into the maze to “ask which hour it would like saved,” converting cataloguing into negotiation. Cost is visible—fluorescent trembles toward dark, wind-chime echo substitutes for society—foreclosing the option to quit. No coincidence resolves; the final stance is renunciation of audience, not restoration of town.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaim erased identity via memory-texture—signaled in line 3. Pressure deepens through accumulating fragments; poison label tightens threat of official erasure. No reversal, but one decisive deepening: clerk’s “no one harmed officially” forecloses appeal, forcing shift to communal listening. Cost is visible: acceptance of ghosthood as price of witness.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“decode the universal riddle”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the compass points backward, forcing confession instead of solution. Escalation is textural: each resonance layer (hum, tide, chalk) increases emotional density until silence is broken. Cost is legible: past is rewritten with acknowledged loss of certainty. No causal reversals, but accumulative deepening satisfies lens.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—keep the city’s soul while surviving privatization—is signaled in line 2. Escalation is the single tightening: the parade route pivot that starves the glossy pier and feeds the clinics. Cost is visible—guild chief complains finale is “shrinking,” councilor fears for families—so trade-off is felt. Agency is narrator’s paint-and-chip choreography; no coincidence resolves. Slight dockside argument feels more negotiation than pressure, keeping it just under 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“last unbranded dawn”—is signaled early and tightens when the mirror array actually flickers, forcing the one-click renunciation. Cost is visible: the inspector forfeits the safety of infinite shots, a palpable loss for a photographer. Escalation is Textural: the sky’s increasing brightness = rising ad value, not causal reversal, but the pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens. No off-stage resolutions; coincidence complicates but does not save.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—time vs. perception—locks in with the first chimed bowl and tightens each time a ping returns late or a refraction angle skews. The meaningful intensification is the western bay ringing “like an empty bell”: a sonic cue that the lost crate is outside the safe grid, forcing the drone into gull-infested territory. Escalation is textural, not causal-reversal, but the rising density of sensory data (mist thickening, tide narrowing, gulls louder) makes the same constraint feel costlier. Price is paid in wing-damage, in Jaro’s breathless reportage, in Mara’s own calm that must stay magnetic while her insides tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.7)
    One dominant stake—prove the sub-glacial convergence—tightens when every condensation map narrows the search grid; the falcon’s return is the single beat that forces departure and thus the ice crossing. Cost is legible in frozen fingers and the swallowed drop of “alphabet of stones,” a visceral price paid on-page. No antagonist is needed; the lake’s uncracked silence is coherent pressure. Escalation is steady but modest—one meaningful deepening, not a spiral—hence stops just short of the 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: can sound and shared cadence resurrect civic trust? Pressure intensifies as each circle of footsteps thickens the arch’s shadow and loosens a mortar seam—visible evidence that the tactic is working. The boy’s stamp introduces risk; the tuner’s hand-raised pause tightens the pattern, proving gentleness is the higher discipline. Cost is legible: perpetual stewardship, no final bell tower—balance must be walked anew each dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—deliver memory to the surface—tightens when the net turns the beacon inward, forcing a choice: break free and lose the vial, or stay still and pay in breath. The single meaningful tightening (stop kicking, ascend later) forecloses the immediate-escape option and visibly prices the O₂ reserve. No coincidence; pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens. Cost could be slightly sharper if we felt one numeric tick of remaining minutes, but the hush-bridge trade-off remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“truth devours the gullible”—is signaled early; pressure escalates via density of rumor-images rather than option-narrowing turns. Protagonist’s agency is attention/ritual, not reversible choice; cost is conceptual (burden of perpetual witness) rather than concrete forfeiture, meeting 8-band threshold but lacking visible price that alters later tactics. Escalation is atmospheric, coherent under Accumulative lens, but single tightening moment is subtle.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.5)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single dominant stake: coax a passage no one else has found; pressure deepens as older chalk marks testify that predecessors paid with their sleep, and the final embossing of sail-cloth pages makes the cost tactile—no siren salvation, only shared inner illumination.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“make my words arrive unbroken”—tightens once: the chalk cipher collapses postal surveillance into a single maneuver that forecloses the unsafe route. Agency is shared: Mira surrenders data; protagonist rewrites the margins; both accept slowed transit as price. Cost is legible in the hush before the slot, but because the scanner threat is off-stage, the price stays conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—thwart the coup—stated early; pressure escalates through successive micro-tamperings that each narrow timing precision. Agency is continuous; every bell-slip or thread-pull is her hand. Cost (city still doomed, only delayed) is legible but conceptual, not visceral, keeping it shy of top band.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—repairing fraternal rupture—signals in paragraph 1 via “unsent letters” and tightens when the apology’s breath is located in hospital time. Single meaningful deepening: splinter-in-palm pain steadies the narrator inside the found moment, foreclosing the smoke-break exit; cost is the ache that substitutes for words. Agency remains internal yet decisive; refusal to leave bedside crystallizes stance under lyrical-accumulative pressure. Singing spirits and medium act as situational pressure, not antagonists; coincidence complicates memory access but does not resolve the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—“carry consent without lighting new fires”—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when each decoded line forecloses a possible weaponization by either family.translator’s decision to withhold full truth is the single meaningful turn that narrows options and buys mercy. Price is explicit: personal vow of selective silence, plus physical proxy cost of scarf. No coincidence; escalation is purely negotiative pressure under situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—rediscover lost joy without turning it into a museum—threads every beat. Pressure escalates as fog aggressively reclaims the projected boy; artist’s only agency is to surrender the display rather than hoard it, a tightening that forecloses possession and reweights the stake. Cost is unmistakable: she departs with only "sticky pockets," the fresco abandoned beneath roots. One meaningful turn suffices; luck merely dims the reel, never solves.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—will the wall speak again?—tightens through each echo-capture attempt; failure would flatten the city’s memory. One meaningful deepening: the discovered pigment diagram of elders waiting reframes personal restoration as civic patience, narrowing the protagonist’s goal from mastery to service. Cost is present (time, coin relinquished, certainty traded) but lightly felt rather than viscerally paid, capping high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—un-taxed thought survival—tightens via each vegetal reply that risks fiscal reprisal. Escalation is textural: density of coded blooms increases until the Notice is literally overwritten by roots. Visible price: collectors retreat owing “humility,” a social-cost win that still forecloses future overt protest. No second reversal keeps it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: end blossom civil war. Tightening occurs when Red demands winter-debt payment; the poet’s reply (“edges belong…stop craving blood”) is the single narrowing choice that risks credibility with all factions. Cost is legible—thorn clicks soften, Guard’s eyes wet—but the speaker does not visibly pay a personal forfeiture; escalation is floral, not visceral for the poet.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.3)
    A single cadence shift—choosing fracture over repair—tightens the stake from “preserve all names” to “preserve even broken ones,” with the price of eternal static in the chime; causality under Accumulative lens is coherent, though pressure plateaus rather than spikes twice.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—restoring collaboration—signals early and tightens through each handwritten vow; the “before paths diverge” clock adds light pressure. Escalation is accumulative: each promise thickens the braid until the door yields, a visible price paid in exposed vulnerability. No external antagonist is needed; internal silence is the foe, and its cost is dramatized when past silence is confessed. The tightening is singular but sufficient for this length; options narrow to speak or stay shut out.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—valley water war—signaled in paragraph two. Single tightening: resin pattern converts abstract fairness into measurable chain lengths, foreclosing endless debate with visible ledger. Cost is legible on-page: farmer’s thumb feels the softened ledger, guardians clap with relief-dust. Escalation is accumulative: each breath of the amphitheater re-weights the moral calculus under the “building breathes” clock.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—preserve lost songs vs. self-preservation—tightens once: the trainer’s refusal softens when the melody overlaps Mara’s intervals, forcing the launch. Cost is visible: trust reopened, shoebox shards exposed, meteorite now airborne. No reversal, but one meaningful deepening suffices at this length. Agency sits in the capsule knot and the ledger vow afterward.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“why some thresholds feel sacred”—tightens once: the narrator must decide whether to cross the cedar frame. Fog-day rule and logbook codes foreclose early crossing; stepping back leaves the frame open, paying visible cost. Escalation is textural: light alignment, grain runway, then the Mouth of Return revelation. Sufficient for 600-word scope; cost is legible on final line.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—“learn the rhythm of belonging”—is signaled early; pressure escalates accretively: doubt → luminous respite → generator falter → feather rescue → sunrise reveal. Yet the generator flicker is the sole tightening beat and it is reversed within four sentences, so options never narrow; cost is aesthetic (transient darkness) not tactical. No credible loss or trade-off is dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—preserve tender stories without erasing travelers—tightens once: the cave’s vanishing paths must be re-mapped without trampling them. Escalation is Accumulative: each seed-thread adds density until the compromise ribbon blossoms, foreclosing pure preservation or pure access. Cost is visible in narrator’s smudged fingers and the bird’s negotiated future labor. No reversal, but single deepening is sufficient for 600-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—serenading monotony without wasteful flourish—is signaled early and tightened when the woman’s unexpected laugh becomes a live variable that must fit the grid. Escalation is accumulative: each prop-orbit raises the density of spectators-as-pieces until the applause square is landed on and the tide begins erasure. Cost is conceptual but legible—the grid’s obliteration means tonight’s design can never repeat, foreclosing future boards. No reversal, but the deepening pattern shift satisfies the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—can contraband memory be inscribed without capture—tightens through a single, meaningful deepening: the clerk’s ask “can forgetting be gentle?” converts surveillance into voluntary canvas, narrowing options from hide to share. Cost is legible: the dancer’s own skin becomes first parchment, staining wrist with a “star that only starlight reads,” a visible forfeiture that later enables the clerk’s transformation. No off-stage rescue; coincidence only complicates when satellites pass, forcing timed breath-pauses. Persistent constraint: every future dance must now protect the clerk-carrying harbor they have jointly birthed.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: save the atrium from chrome erasure. Escalation occurs when the spectrum lands on the ledger page, narrowing options: demolition is no longer abstract to the harbor-master. Cost is visible—social credibility for the official, potential job for the net-mender—but is felt by others, not the protagonist; hence pressure is strong yet slightly vicarious.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—guilt over traded innocence—tightens once when he names the bargain to Mira, narrowing future options to a two-way hinge mission. Cost is visible: leaving the box beneath the cairn permanently marks the loss of his earlier binary choice. Agency drives the turn; no coincidence resolves it. Sufficient escalation for 750-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—restore village hope—tightens when empty nets force the equation quest. Escalation is textural: each failed balloon slump crosses a tide-mark, raising the cognitive price of retry. The final braid of exchanges forecloses isolation as a live option; gauge needle steadies to doctrinal calm. Cost is present yet soft—no torn skin, no broken oar re-snapped—kept conceptual to match the lyric register.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—legacy’s burden versus merciful listening—tightens when the narrator confronts the eternally knocking man. One meaningful escalation: re-charting the echo dissolves the malignant loop, foreclosing the safety of pure documentation. Agency is continuous; each hallway chalked curve is a decision that narrows next options. Cost is felt: the museum’s new map now carries emotional liability.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—can the city relearn reflective hope—tightens when the painter exchanges personal honesty (the borrowed heartbeat) for communal possibility. Escalation is textural: each mirrored “unspent maybe” thickens the cost of belief until the crowd’s tapped rolling pins become the city’s new pulse. The decisive deepening occurs when Lio’s slate, once blank, fills with light-ferried words, visibly paying the price of anticipation. Bell peal ends the hush, but the forfeited privacy of the painter’s method forecloses retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake = negotiator’s own redemption vs regional peace; signaled early (“Tonight my motive is simple and heavy”). Escalation: secret massacre revealed → negotiator offers breath-bond → silence vow narrows future options; price visible (no more speech for any army). Agency is renunciation/ritual invention, not external rescue. Coincidence absent; no reversal beyond the one tightening, sufficient for 600-800 word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: can the protagonist buy himself a genuine echo without bankrupting his leverage? Pressure tightens from gala demand → single egg → hourly water gift; each step narrows options and raises reputational cost. Agency drives every turn—decision to withhold full release is on-page with ledger-teeth reminder. Cost is visible: future drought contracts stay intact, “promise hurt” is acknowledged.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—free the city’s compressed voices—signaled in line 5; escalation is Accumulative: each untangled ribbon adds a live artery of light under ice, tightening the visual/textural density until the city-wide braid is exposed. One decisive intensification: when she burns the braid, the courtyard physically shivers—collective stake becomes somatic. Every cost (pulse thinning, snow writing new path) is on-page; no coincidences. Agency is renunciation/creation rather than combat, fitting the vow.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: who owns the moral right to steer a story’s harm. The meaningful tightening arrives when Aurel inks the mirrored “Listen,” then offers the stick to strangers—this act forecloses his sole authorship. Cost is legible: he must swallow “unpoetic” apology and risk the troupe’s permanent fracture. Pressure stays internal and ethical rather than externalized, sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will the last monarch read the signal—tightens once when the insect hovers, then again when it departs; the narrator forfeits permanence to accompany disappearance. Cost is legible: structures dismantled, twine left “like lines in a palm,” a tangible loss of control. Agency is attention rather than rescue, foreclosing monumentality.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“preserve the sound of forgotten names before winter erases them”—is signaled early; pressure tightens once when the last braid is cinched with the scar-lodestar, narrowing options to lifelong guardianship. Cost is visible: the spent lamp, the seized organ, the scar reclaimed, the eternal stay; escalation is accumulative via density of harmonics rather than causal reversals, coherent under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is legible by line 4: “whether mine still wanted me.” Escalation is tonal and accumulative—storm fists, flaking clauses—culminating in the communal pivot left that forecloses solitary transcendence. Agency is present: cracking the seal, writing with footprints, recruiting silhouettes. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral: surrender of the bunker’s shelter and the safety of solo interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—keep the sky’s accounting honest between regimes—tightens when tile meets eyelid, foreclosing the option of leaving the palace unchanged. Escalation is textural: light drains, mosaics unclasp, passage appears; each intensification is driven by protagonist’s exacting placement, not luck. Cost is visible on-page: personal reduction to diagrammatic reflection, plus vow of perpetual maintenance. One meaningful deepening suffices for 780-word piece; no reversals required.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—release resentment without humiliation—tightens through escalating bodily stakes: pulse, shoulder angle, sternum. A single meaningful deepening occurs when the box translates memories into muscles, foreclosing the option to keep hatred sharp. Cost is visible: Mara cedes ramparts she admits were “never safe,” generals feel a quiet that is not defeat. The causal agency is the narrator’s persuasion, not external trick, satisfying lens purity.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restore the orchard via the runaway dream—signaled in paragraph 3. One meaningful tightening: offering the sextant’s index forecloses Iren’s ability to measure stars, narrowing options from capture to shared stewardship. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens; each mirrored return increases density until the dream folds in. Cost visible on-page: the broken device permanently repurposed.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will transient wisdom be honored without pay?—tightens when the pipe fails and the only currency left is the sentimental ribbon. The meaningful turn is the ribbon’s sacrifice: it changes the mender’s options (can’t gift it to daughter later) and visibly alters the water’s behavior. Cost is legible in the darker, soaked silk. Pressure is accumulative/textural rather than causal-reversal, appropriate to the lyric engine; one deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—“inherit a future”—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens exactly once: the direct question to the trees forces a choice between taking the named fruit (linear inheritance) or finding a third road. Price is tasted (summer drought rain) and seen (ledger loosens, woman laughs); tactics shift from passive inquiry to active re-appropriation of the shell. No reversal overload; one meaningful deepening suffices and lands under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—access to the library of unlearned lessons—tightens when the index demands the weight of unspoken words, forcing a trade that forecloses forgetting. Escalation is single but sufficient: the wall of copied doubts rises, then cracks only after she risks her own unspoken apology. Cost is visible in the palm-stamp that will ache beyond the page. No coincidence rescues; the traveler’s freedom is earned by her editorial gamble.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—recover forgotten names or lose self—signals in paragraph 3 and tightens when the automaton demands the twin be brought forth, foreclosing half-self access. Cost is visible: perpetual drift traded for naming, seeds pocketed, ship left “unmoored.” Agency remains split between selves but still forces the final leave-taking. No off-stage rescue; luck complicates (mirror twin externalized) without solving.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—restoring erased time—signals early (“translate confusion into clarity”). Escalation is accumulative: each archive relic tightens the contradiction until the rope re-braid forcibly merges schedules. Cost is legible in the bell’s new cadence and the door’s vanishing. A slightly sharper midpoint tightening would make the price unavoidable sooner.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—“find the quiet before tunnels crush”—tightens when the hush-bloom must be shared with energy beings, narrowing options from solitary guardianship to joint stewardship. Escalation is textural: each ripple, chord, and frost constellation accretes until the drum-flash reweights the cost of silence. Protagonist’s agency is the deliberate tuning act that unstucks the air-door; no coincidence resolves the crisis. Visible price: future travelers may pass only if the mapkeeper relinquishes exclusivity.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“prove coincidences have meaning”—tightens when first beam dies, forcing retro-cognitive plunge to recover calibration; options narrow to risk inviting outsiders. Escalation beats: shard canting (resin + copper), wheel snag, memory-dive, second beam success, flare answer. Cost is visceral: swallowed pulse, thistle hope toughening to rope. No off-stage luck resolves; all turns stem from Kera’s agency under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—will the archive survive the collective without sanding self away—tightens when the forecourt’s return of only “what the whole can carry” forces the decision to unbind fear and leave a braid. Escalation is textural: each weather trace adds weight until the archive yields material. Cost is felt in the physical release of breath-glitter.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—reignite hope without stars—signals early and tightens through each volley; the final silent shell crystallizes the concession that copies aren’t required, only courage. Escalation is density/cadence driven: each bloom answers the mosaic’s “conversation,” raising emotional cost but not narrowing external options. No tangible resource is lost; the price is purely atmospheric, keeping cost legible but light. Sufficient for this lyric-Accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—stay or leave the coast—signaled early; pressure tightens once via the deferral, narrowing future options. Agency is linguistic (deferral) rather than tactical; no resource lost on-page, so cost is conceptual rather than visceral. Escalation is lyrical deepening, not causal chain; sufficient under Accumulative lens but less sharp than causal turns. Coincidence absent; tension survives, but visible price would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single dominant stake: can the narrator ingest bunker-quiet without re-imprisoning himself? Each pour escalates risk of suffocation; the third pour forces the micro-choice of “nail’s width” breathing. Cost is visible: pulse must agree, eyes soften, ladder re-imagined—options narrow to living with alloyed silence. No external antagonist; internal fear is the pressure engine; escalation is incremental but coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—teach silence to comfort—tightens when grief-driven bell spikes meter; operator’s agency (swing, dim, story, count) forecloses the easy path of evicting loud passengers. One meaningful escalation: vial’s spiky snow softens to filigree as bell becomes lantern. Cost is felt in delayed schedule and emotional exposure; the humming cable confirms price paid. No coincidence; pressure grows from bell → wind → story → count.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—prevent algorithmic coronation—announced early; sunrise timer blinks amber on a leaf, a visceral ticking clock. Escalation is driven by her agency: shaving paint, feeding flake, bowing into roots—each act narrows future options. The mural-glow match to the flake is the decisive tightening that forecloses any other route. Cost is visible: she trades personal sovereignty for perpetual listening service; the final radio-throne image makes the price undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—refuse to profit by crushing others while escaping debt—tightens when the protagonist volunteers for an untested chamber that could kill or crystalize. Escalation is accumulative: each glitch-text increases emotional density, each mushroom-brightening ups ante, until speaking the quantum pledge under full pressure narrows options to triumph or implode. Visible price is the bead itself, a literal conversion of past hurt into tradeable asset. No coincidence resolves; the volunteer act and spoken promise together force the reversal that forecloses the old pyramid model.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—uncover hidden truth—signaled in line 1 and tightens when each standing wave reveals complicity. One meaningful deepening: the moment the crest-inverted ring appears, the moral calculus flips from grandmother-as-lone-hero to dynastic treachery shared. Cost is felt in the “muscles of the hum” crumbling wax and the audible knot of mercy. Escalation is textural, not causal, but suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“shape of possibility”—is signaled in line 2 and deepened when the blueprint reveals wrist/hip placements, narrowing physical options to a single soft-bodied performance. Escalation is textural: each “unsnap” loosens armor and loneliness in parallel, culminating in the floating pear that refuses gravity. Cost is felt (exposure, lightness) but not irreversible; a sharper price would have pushed the score into the 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—moral duty to honor forgotten kindness—tightens when rulebook vs empathy collide. Escalation is textural: each dust trace adds pressure to act before neglect wins. Single meaningful turn: decision to mail the button forecloses safe compliance. Cost is felt (job risk, emotional exposure) but could be sharper on-page; still, agency is clearly the archivist’s.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prevent erasure of the disappeared—tightens when floodlights threaten to finish the cut. The single decisive turn: Jessa kicks the ground plate, trading secrecy for mass witness, price paid on-page. Escalation is causal, not coincidence; each flare narrows her options. Cost is visible: the key abandoned, the network now audible to State ears—persistent tactical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single dominant stake—silence the prophecy—signaled early; pressure accrues through sensory density, not reversals. Protagonist agency is continual: answers code “with absence,” guides silence, shapes final breath-oval. The code’s promises (town forgetting, river dust) remain abstract; no concrete town asset is risked on page, slightly blunting cost visibility. Tightening holds under accumulative lens; final silence frame is felt forfeiture of acclaim.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—villages will spill if leaves are misread—threads every paragraph; tension tightens from monument #1 to waist-high scaffold. Agency remains Fen’s: each prod is a decision that risks tilt. The single deepening (moonstone flare→“release not store”) narrows options irreversibly. Cost is conceptual but felt: the instant his catalogued towers become wind-dust, future security is foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—control of time—is signaled in line 1. Tightening is single but sufficient: compass randomness → must improvise → must wire the water-clock → must accept tidal custom. Price is legible: perpetual shop irregularity, income at mercy of drip-grammar. Agency remains his; coincidence complicates (train delay) but never saves.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“can naming/remembering redeem?”—is declared early and tightened each time the metal answers back with smoke or seam. One decisive deepening: the father’s command becomes hatred the alchemist must carry; this narrows future options. Agency is present—every hammer blow risks cracking the token, embodying stakes. Cost is legible but could be sharper: no physical/tool loss or ticking clock forces the final temper; emotional price is clear yet externally static.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—secure the laugh-as-medicine—signalled in paragraph 5. One meaningful tightening: the protagonist must surrender his worst memory before the laugh will approach, narrowing options from pursuit to mutual exposure. Cost is legible in the on-page confession and the widow’s cruel-kind rope image. Pressure escalates under causal lens because each detune deepens spectral exposure and personal risk.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: can he derive mercy without re-becoming instrument? Escalation is textural—each corridor layers sensory bruise until pool offers mirror-still “equation solved,” tightening the cost of leaving the strap behind. No antagonist needed; UV penance itself applies pressure. Final renunciation forecloses return, price paid on page.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—recover erased laborers’ names—is clear from line 9; pressure deepens as each hidden harbor is coaxed into legibility, but the narrator faces no external opposition or internal trade-off. The only tightening is the count of thirteen harbors becoming words; no option is foreclosed to the speaker, so cost is communal, not personal. Escalation is therefore observational rather than tactical, satisfying the accumulative lens yet remaining modest.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—uncover what ceilings hide—tightens once when the hatch yields the mirror rig. Pressure is situational, coherent, but single-pulse; no secondary tightening or price paid by protagonist. Escalation is sufficient for length but not high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—compress eternity into a single moment—signals early and tightens when the mis-print risk becomes orchard-rupture. Escalation is textural: frost patterns accumulate until they shear the sky; narrator’s agency is the choice to over-loosen the press, paying with orchard remapping and new silence. Cost is visible on the page (“bright seam,” “punctured buoyancy,” “new silence corked”). No reversal, but the deepening pattern reweights the stake decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—save the city from being quarried—signals in line 3. Escalation tightens once: shard tableau overturns decadence claim, foreclosing Vark’s looting path. Agency is Neris’s calibration and tilt; cost visible when Vark bows “annoyed but alive,” conceding grudging future opposition. Pressure stays coherent under causal lens; no reversal needed for 600-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—reclaim dawn for children—tightens meaningfully when the elders forbid interference, foreclosing easy alliance and forcing him to act under their corroded gaze. Escalation is incremental but causal: each lamp freed passes daylight along like rumor, narrowing the constable’s grip until the hinge is quietly sabotaged by mending. Cost is visible—he kneels softer under the false smile, risks irreversible rupture with entropy’s custodians—but agency never flags. Persistent constraint: the braided violin tether must keep singing or light snaps back to fear stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: map the unmappable moment where explanation fails. Escalation is textural: each breath of cave-air thickens the unknowing until the vial captures literalized unknowing. Agency: the collector’s decision to press the freed needle into the seam narrows options—no retreat without leaving part of the compass behind. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable: the factory quiet is now inhabited by a counter-archive the village cannot hear.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake: survive disorientation and re-imagine navigation. Escalation is atmospheric deepening rather than narrowing options—each lantern ghost layers stakes onto communal craft. Agency visible when sculptor angles slide and builds crib; cost is loss of technological certainty. Turbine hum persists as audible price, but on-page trade-off softer than high-band requires.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—how to speak color without harm—tightens via seasonal accretion: each shard forfeits a brighter palette for “deep blues of quiet thinking.” The protagonist’s agency is the act of continual restraint; pressure peaks when the last postcard is spent and the choice becomes paint or silence. Cost is visible in the fading graphite paths and the self-imposed erasure of spectacle. No external antagonist is needed; coincidence is absent. Sufficient for 8.6, but lacks a single moment where restraint could have exploded into regret, keeping it from 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can effort replace wishcraft?—tightens when the bottle refuses to open, forcing tactical shift from miracle to geometry. One meaningful deepening: chalk plan erased by tide → must be held in working memory, raising cognitive price. Escalation is textural: each lantern projection adds civic detail, narrowing possibility toward disciplined build. Cost legible in mental load and physical shiver; no external antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“discover the texture of borrowed time”—is signaled early and tightens when the ark demands a vow payable in song. One meaningful deepening occurs as entropy steps down and the price (oak cap spent, voice braided with bird) becomes legible. Agency is present but gentle—coaxing rather than forcing—fitting the lyric mode. Cost is visible yet soft; a sharper forfeiture would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.9)
    One dominant stake—mountain wind vs. city protocol—tightens once: the downdraft forecast forces the switch to standby, foreclosing the decibel test with visible professional cost; escalation is coherent, no coincidence, and the price is on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—preserve the station from salvage—tightens when the crew arrives with measuring tape; the meteor shower provides the decisive intensification that reweights cost. Agency is present: the narrator’s choice to trace the shower live and pass the lantern glass forces the crew’s stance crystallization. The price is legible: the foreman forgets the deadline, a social forfeiture that lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single dominant stake—preserve unspoken weight—tightens when Mara realizes speech once cracked the vow; her renunciation of language enacts the retied covenant. Cost is legible: she bears exile-with-box, wind agreeing via slackened heat-shimmer, tactics permanently narrowed to carrying, not telling.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—stewarding texture instead of counting time—tightens when the ribbon asks for “a tender I could not replicate”; the protagonist’s agency is the deliberate release of borrowed names, which visibly pays the cost. Escalation is a single deepening rather than multiple reversals, sufficient for lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“discover beauty in the incomplete”—is signaled early and tightened when the kite’s tear threatens annihilation of that beauty. Agency: poet’s decision to harmonize discord (feather graft) forecloses the option of pristine repair; price is surrender of personal tool and exposure of own philosophy to strangers. One meaningful escalation under accumulative lens suffices; coincidence (gust) complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—interspecies pact before death—is signaled in line 3 and tightened when copper circuits translate pulse into consent; visible price is each lung-flute breath. One meaningful escalation: chamber opens only after spiral root-training, foreclosing isolation option. Cost is felt surf-beat under feet; no coincidence relieves pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single dominant stake—“understand the chemistry of homecoming”—tightens through sensory sampling, not external opposition. The meaningful deepening is the envoy chord at the bell landing: shared salinity re-weights “home” from place to exchange constant, foreclosing lab-alone option. Cost is legible: narrator concedes protocol “unruly,” accepts tower hush as heavier than time. Under Accumulative lens, density increase suffices; no reversal needed. Keeps high band but not 9+ because price is conceptual, not viscerally felt on page.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges wordlessly: home as chemical ratio (3:5:8) rather than geography, epistemic humility as spiritual practice. Subtext operates in gesture—envoy tongue tracing volatile signatures—never explicated. Final image of “rinsed world” reprices prior material without moral tag. No thematic echo or sermonizing; ambiguity lingers about whether shared attention suffices for future pilgrims. Resonance is built from amber, salt math, and bell arc, not abstract assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“let a garden reclaim a battlefield”—is signaled in paragraph four and tightened each time a pod is planted where bullets fell. One meaningful deepening: the veteran’s arrival converts abstract peace into lived memory, forcing the coachman to relinquish sole authorship of the garden. Cost is the surrender of linguistic control (he hands over a pod stamped with the regiment cipher). Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens; no reversal needed, only accretion of signatures.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“translate distance into closeness”—tightens when the cylinder’s riddle forecloses passive grief and demands physical trek to western heap. One meaningful deepening: amber over horn reveals shadowed letters, shifting knowledge state and altering tactics (copy map, turn spindle). Cost is legible—communal thirst traded for shared water, narrator’s private relic made public. Agency is attention/renunciation rather than spectacle, coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—prove the drift is a path, not failure—signals in paragraph 4 and tightens when the smear becomes a vector, foreclosing the board’s “shutdown” verdict. Agency is intellectual but decisive: rerouting lens, signing mother’s name, accepting pariah status; price is irreversible isolation, legible in cooling paper. Escalation is Accumulative/Textural: density of overlays, ink drag, bedrock hum reweight stakes without causal reversals. One tightening suffices; cost is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—amend an ancient vow to let change in—tightens when the clock demands a live sacrifice of secrets; each chess swap escalates by exposing worse truths, narrowing options until the queen’s scroll reweights the sky. Cost is visible: Kestrel’s thorn of betrayal named, the apprentice’s future forgiveness surrendered.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—keep the city from forgetting—signaled early. Pressure tightens when the Custodian demands unbinding from performative scripts; the walking-spelling mechanic forces literal step-by-step relinquishment of former safety drills. Each letter walked adds a voice, narrowing options to continued migration or total erasure. Cost is visible in the coiled cord and the nod that both permits and sentences. Agency remains with narrator; no coincidences; escalation is accumulative density of voices rather than causal reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“understand the shape of home”—tightens when the seer declares shelter ≠ hiding, forcing the narrator to risk touch via feather. One meaningful deepening: the stone’s grammar rewrites corridors into climate, making retreat impossible. Cost is conceptual but legible: the exhalation offered is unstoried breath, a piece of life that cannot be reclaimed.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—tightens when each mended thread forces the tutor to confront another victim of his lessons. Mid-story silver-thread loosening is the visible pressure turn that forecloses the option of permanent exile. Cost is legible on-page with every completed knot.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—who controls the price of forgiveness—tightens when each new rhyme adds a witness, narrowing the elders’ option to impose a lone confession. Protagonist agency drives every escalation: clap-and-response sessions multiply counter-stories until the spire physically shivers. Cost is legible in the raw throat and the risk of becoming the next cracked back. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversal overload.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—conjure meaning before the acid dissolves craft—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the seals fail, forcing underwater work. The single meaningful deepening occurs when the charm is sacrificed: the price (loss of teacher’s token) is visible and irreversible, reweighting the stake from “save workshop” to “accept broken self.” Agency remains with the alchemist; no coincidences. Escalation is modest but sufficient for 700-word scale; the final breath is felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—retrieve Mara without sonic violence—is signaled early and deepens through sensory accumulation rather than causal reversals. The tightening beat is the deliberate lowering of the beam and release of garden scent, foreclosing the horn option with felt risk. Cost is visible: the horizon’s “aching light” and the gull’s mirrored tilt register uncertainty. Under Accumulative lens this single intensification suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.7)
    Domestic stake: can the navigator’s patched tech and body still bridge loss for others? Escalation is accumulative/textural—each midnight call thickens static until moon-thin glass allows a bearing; the dish’s refusal to swivel forces the censer gamble that forecloses rest. Cost is visible: shoulders aching, skin bruised by bronze, final collapse. No reversal, but deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—can psychological safety survive forced truth?—tightens when the courier threatens the eye; the protagonist’s agency to bury it forecloses the “contraband” option and accepts the harder path. Pressure escalates accumulatively: each confession softens yet exposes them to external theft. Cost is logged in pulses, tears, and the final loss of the occluding tool. One reversible: the courier’s demand arrives off-stage; still, the burial response is fully on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—keep the promise to choose—tightens as creek rises and time narrows. One meaningful deepening: the maps of foregone selves force a conscious renunciation of drift. Agency drives every beat; coincidence merely complicates (storm is backdrop, not savior). Price is visible: he forfeits the escape-fantasy and accepts perpetual responsibility—stacking pallets, hosting refugees.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—stop the bleeding sky she caused—tightens once: circlet must fall for starlight to clot. Escalation is accumulative/lyric: density of starlight, fire, and ash images accrues until renunciation becomes the only breath left. Visible price: cut palms, metal on stone, and the permanent political vacuum implied by uncrowned queen. No coincidence; every intensification stems from her earlier hawk-fire marriage.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can presence attain mass—tightens exactly once when the whispered secret triggers the reactor bloom, foreclosing further abstraction. Cost is the laugh that refuses to evaporate, now a permanent city fixture. Agency remains with the duo’s calibrated pour, not coincidence. Escalation is accumulative/textural: density literally accrues drop by drop until the plaza tilts under its own weight.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—keep narrative time honest—tightens when each envy dredges a lived self whose stakes the narrator must now carry. Escalation is textural: the valley sluices every year into one river, collapsing future and past; options narrow to either permanent flight or custodianship. The price is legible: awe no longer wild but “knowing the bill,” a conceptual cost that reweights the premise. One beat short of visceral loss (tool, stamina) keeps it from 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—honor the midwife’s lived time without erasing trauma—signaled when she names the clock “Time for a first cry.” Escalation is textural: each droplet stutters like an infant’s first breath, tightening the emotional cost until the screw’s partial release becomes the single meaningful turn that forecloses perfectionist repair. Agency is narrator’s refusal to extract the screw; price paid is acceptance of asymmetry, mirrored in the uneven but steady drip. Cost is visible on-page: midwife’s exhalation “that could have been a name.”

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—transform scars into stories—tightens when frost chokes first rune, forcing sugar offering and superstition revisit. Each rune stroke is a visible trade-off: hesitation crystallizes lattice; grandmother memory loosens it; hinge question opens door at cost of breath. No external antagonist; pressure is weather + internal fear of traps. Price is legible in silver ache and scars warming to harbors.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: rescue the orchard’s voice before erasure; tightening occurs when current ignites scent and unfinished hymn surfaces. Protagonist agency drives the wiring, apology, and recording; cost is the bottle’s fracture and the irreversible dawn of saws. No coincidence; pressure accumulates through sensory density. One meaningful escalation suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—unravel illusions before they harden—stays legible; pressure escalates via the chorus tightening its braid, forcing the narrator to cede declarative authority. Agency is present (pacing, reading aloud) but the cost is conceptual rather than visceral; no tangible resource is lost. One meaningful deepening occurs at circle three when the dictionary page is communalized, narrowing options from private meaning to shared definition. Sufficient for 8.0, but lacks a persistent constraint that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—restore trustworthy readings—tightens when drift becomes “eminently peculiar,” forcing manual correction under time pressure. One meaningful deepening: counting backwards steadies the floats and pencil line, narrowing options from diagnostic panic to calibrated acceptance. Cost is the emotional forfeiture of certainty, felt but not externally dramatized, keeping this just below the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake: preserve the farm’s living memory versus harden borders. Escalation is one deepening: intrusion pulse → discovery of Mira → realization that lockdown = forgetting. Agency resides in the narrator’s micro-choice to swap laser-button “no” for consent-signal “yes,” paid for with professional authority. Cost is visible—old protocol forfeited, future risk internalized—though second beat of price (investor backlash, Mira’s next move) is off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—can she coax father to eat—signaled by ward call; archive traversal escalates by each handwriting hit, tightening until carrot negotiation. Agency resides in interpretation and lantern placement; coincidence (finding father’s old scrawls) complicates, not rescues. Meaningful turn when she pockets map + lantern and acts—hospital confrontation; cost legible in father’s wince and her steadying cup. Persistent constraint: light itself becomes leverage.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—operator’s compulsion to broker strangers’ new beginnings—intensifies via each crossed line, but escalation is accretive, not sharply reversive; final coupling of drummer/spouse deepens pattern yet doesn’t narrow operator’s own options or exact visible price, keeping pressure poetic rather than perilous.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—town survival via covenant renewal—tightens through one meaningful deepening: the ink must accept the absent woman’s gap rather than restore her. The protagonist’s agency is to inscribe that gap, a renunciation that forecloses magical recovery. Pressure accumulates under the Accumulative lens: each added name, net adjustment, and gull circle thickens the texture until the ledger bruise crystallizes cost. No coincidence; the tide’s gift/take pattern is established early.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—loneliness vs. logistics of attention—tightens when rumor converts the rock into a confession currency, narrowing Mara’s private cure to public conduit. Pressure escalates accumulatively: each traded story adds queue length and ledger mass, reweighting the cost of Mara’s own unread entry. No coincidence resolves; the final cost is her continued anonymity. A sharper visible forfeiture (burned page, surrendered ledger line) would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—find the stillpoint or stay emotionally lost—is signaled early and tightens through each sap-grammar beat; the forest itself applies accumulative pressure until options narrow to kneel or retreat. One meaningful deepening: when ring freezes on "tongue of quiet," stillness itself becomes the threat/cost. No external coincidence; escalation is purely sensory-textural accrual. Price is the cut of eternal still he now bears—visible on page via "ring cool and sure."

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—repair the timeline without erasing lived regret—emerges early and intensifies when the contingency net “tightened into a snare.” The unbending of the pen spring is the decisive, narrowing action that forecloses pure heroic overwrite; cost is the acceptance of “one uneasy yesteryear.” Escalation is causal: each edit risks new physical mis-docking; agency stays with narrator’s fingers, breath, pulse. Luck complicates (coolant beads) but never resolves; tension holds until the final soft click.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“translate silence into music”—is signaled early and tightens when the police launch approaches; the deckhand’s spontaneous signing narrows options from protest to shared hymn. Escalation is textural: each signed phrase adds density until boats slow, a visible price paid in social risk. No coincidence; curiosity alone halts hulls. Cost is legible in the narrator’s emptied shutter and the harbor’s retuned hush.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>9.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges entirely through image: silence as score, moon as metronome, absence as container. No moralizing—final line leaves the “blank squared eye” to hold memory, a Conceptual Repricing that reweights every prior click. Subtext lives in gesture: the police captain’s softening face says more than policy. Joyful sorrow is earned, not labeled, when gulls wing vowels at dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“let histories touch without flinching”—is signaled early and tightens when deeper coherence is offered; protagonist agency drives the escalation (consent via knuckles). Visible price (blur, possible permanent fusion) is legible on page. One meaningful deepening suffices for 600-word scope; no external antagonist needed. Could edge higher if the rail warning had forced an immediate tactical sacrifice rather than suspended risk, but cost is still felt.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“prove whispers travel farther than shouts”—is signaled early and tested under escalating pressure: storm, static, deadline, teenage panic. The midpoint tightening occurs when a corridor “gulps” his words, forcing him to rap the coin to retune the steel; this visible price alters tactics and foreshadows the final trade of prize tickets for tea/orange beacons. Escalation is causal, not coincidental, and the cost is on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: keep vow of silence while retrieving lost lives. Pressure tightens when the boy’s pointed throat forces a choice: break vow or invent light-trace. Spiral weave of shutters + mirror is the visible tactic that escalates under accruing stakes. Cost is legible—guardian must keep speaking forbidden, burden transferred to boy holding star.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.7)
    The dominant stake—save the grotto from bulldozers—is signaled early and tightened through the display campaign. One meaningful escalation: the councilwoman’s public hesitation outside the grotto sign forecloses the “inevitable” vote. Cost is conceptual rather than corporeal—loss of civic memory—but it is felt. A second, more visceral price (a shopkeeper’s lost profit, a child’s disappointment) would have pushed this into 8+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—freedom via self-detachment—is signaled early and tightened once: the island demands the narrator “argue with fear until kindness outlasts it,” a clear trade-off. Cost is present but abstract (surrender of identity labels); a tangible forfeiture would have pushed the score higher.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will the regime’s residual grip close around him again?—tightens when the inspector arrives. Narrating the kettle becomes a micro-act of defiance that forecloses the option of returning to old propaganda work. Cost is legible: he signs the paper but forfeits community trust forever. Escalation is single-cadence but sufficient for lyric accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—liberating the ban without violence—tightens once: the poet’s live paraphrase turns enforcement into invitation, directly lowering the colonnade’s tone and thinning the ice. Escalation is accumulative: each re-worded phrase loosens quartz tension; the hum drop is the visible price. Agency is verbal and aesthetic, not physical, fitting the lyric lens. No secondary reversal is needed at this length; the single cadence shift suffices. Cost is social-conceptual rather than personal—boundaries dissolve—but because the poet sacrifices nothing individual, the price feels collective, blunting the high-band requirement for a visceral tariff.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“will imperfect glass be allowed to sing?”—tightens via each bartered awakening: first the traveler's reed, then the child's prism. Escalation is textural: each added crack repurposes failure into voice, reweighting the stake under accumulative lens. Agency remains Ilias’s (he selects herbs, seats the reed, paints veins), but the visible price (Mara’s throat, traveler’s memory) is borne by allies, blunting cost legibility a notch. One clear deepening: when apprentice protests “glass should be silent,” silence itself becomes the final obstacle; overcoming it earns the tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—discovering the texture of connection—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens through each station’s audible map that forecloses isolation. Escalation is textural: densities of light, knock-patterns, and breath accumulate until the hallway current literally moves shoes; the price is the protagonist’s relinquishment of narrative control. No coincidences; pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens. Cost is visible in the final rim of mined light that brands shoulders—social credit transferred from curator to crowd.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—can grief be transmuted into growth rather than entropy—is signaled in paragraph four and tightened twice: first when the stencil aligns starlight into a silver corridor, foreclosing darkness as refuge; second when each locket swells, trading private ash for public seed. Cost is visible: the jeweler volunteers for perpetual reopening of his wound. Agency is attention rather than confrontation; under Accumulative lens the deepening of density reweights the stake adequately for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—will the lattice bridge the silent neighborhood?—is declared late and never faces a visible fork for the narrator. Escalation is textural: layers of paths multiply density instead of narrowing options. The protagonist’s agency is observational; the decisive crossing happens when others arrive, not through a pressured choice. Cost is atmospheric, not personal; no credible loss is risked or paid.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes tighten from “retrieve forbidden knowledge” to “risk becoming its dam”; each atom demands a new, unpatterned approach that forecloses routine, and the price—public exposure of her hoard—escalates under the Accumulative/Textural lens with unmistakable felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—how to keep unreturned dreams from being eaten—signals early and tightens when the catalog chimes “luminous regret.” Mid-story deepening occurs at the hospital-window reel: the same hand trembling decades later makes the custodian realize the shadow could be anyone’s unwitnessed dusk, narrowing his options to absorption rather than expulsion. The price is felt on-page: the library tilts, pollen of letters released, and the keeper’s palms accept permanent warmth as the cost of binding. Agency remains with the custodian; coincidence is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will the sanctuary remain a place where life is mystery not merchandise—tightens when the inspector empties jars. The narrator’s agency crystallizes in the single decision: “the sanctuary could be his repair, but not his hideout,” foreclosing easy forgiveness. Cost is visible: the narrator keeps an empty vial as a blade of memory, and Karim must earn paint-over-wood trust. One meaningful tightening is enough; no escalation loops or convenient coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—how to achieve closure without cruelty—tightens when the plants demand consent; the narrator’s agency narrows to “one more wound, but with permission.” Escalation is poetic but legible: each vegetal voice raises the cost (fern map → ivy memory flood → elm sap payment). The decisive turn is the conscious choice to cut the elm, paying a visible price (amber sigh) to reclaim the miracle. Cost is on-page and persistent: the scar remains open like a book, foreclosing the fantasy of erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—locating the storage site of “unused love”—is signaled in the second paragraph and tightens once when the narrator identifies the transparent leader and splice tails as the hidden reservoir. This deepening reconfigures the manager’s options (he must archive the scraps) and carries a conceptual cost: love that never met light is severed from its intended audience. No visible price is exacted from the narrator, keeping the escalation shy of the 8.8+ band, but the pressure coheres under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—rescue possible futures—signals in line 1 and tightens when the archive demands sleep as payment. Agency remains diffused across quantum selves, but the palm-on-clock beat visibly forecloses rest, meeting the price test under Accumulative lens. One meaningful deepening suffices; earlier visible losses (matches, stamina) could sharpen escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—rediscover the wild frontier—tightens when the mirror reveals the frontier is self-fenced. Escalation is textural: each new alloy wind adds timbral density, narrowing the method to sonic proof. Cost is visible: the gear drawn from his own gate becomes literal tooth-break. One meaningful intensification suffices under Accumulative lens; no reversal overload.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—recover the dog—signals early and tightens only tonally; no live option is foreclosed. Because the lens is Accumulative, the required “meaningful deepening” is the star-path lighting the descent; cost is lyrical, not tactical. Protagonist agency limited to kneeling invitation; resolution leans on dog’s voluntary approach rather than a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.0)
    Central stake—complicity in silence versus ethical witness—is announced early and tightened only once: the bolt installation/refusal. That act is solitary, cost is potential not felt, and no secondary resource (time, allies, bodily risk) is forfeited on-page; escalation therefore registers as a single conceptual pivot rather than mounting pressure. Agency is present but low-band; the “arithmetic of gates” stays theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—unmasking the textual usurper—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the iron-gall line physically forecloses his claim. Escalation is accretive: each cryptic message adds a reader, each reading thickens the genealogy until the counter-walk unlocks the sealed corridor. Visible price: the pretender’s smile flakes into salt, the library coughs up alternate margins, Lys forfeits anonymity. One beat could be sharper: the gardener’s river-name utterance feels slightly lucky rather than earned by prior tactics, holding it shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: can the Trace be read before next widetide drowns it? Pressure tightens when logs reveal 18-year cycle, shrinking crossing window to imminent wider tide. Agency: protagonist elects to teach children moon-bell code, accepting partial loss of control for shared vigilance. Cost visible: “we do not restore the reefs” admits ecological grief unhealed.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—keep the lull while reviving the ferry—tightens when each slow crank risks acoustic detection. Agency is deliberate attention: turning the generator “slowly,” trading speed for silence, narrowing options to “breath is the ember’s ally.” Cost accumulates in patience and forfeited time; the dawn smoke argues against delay. No second reversal, but the single deepening is sufficient under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“obedience masquerading as fate” vs consent—is signaled in line 5 and tightened when Mara swaps command-glyph for question-glyph, foreclosing the council’s museum path. Cost is visible: the amber’s sap-thread voice interrogates her, and she publicly stakes her legitimacy on a living, un-controllable sprout. One meaningful turn suffices; no reversal inflation needed.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—honor survivors without commodifying trauma—tightens once: storm + somatic flinch forces abandonment of photogenic overlook. Move inside costs the board its spectacle and costs Samira public vindication, proving price on page. Agency chain credible; coincidence (storm) complicates, does not solve. Could edge 9.0 if a secondary material loss (funding?) were hinted, but single-turn sufficiency met.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“discover why time slows in crisis”—tightens when the ink gate opens and options narrow to enter or retreat. The reversal inside the widened second (brace beam, survive splinters) pays the on-page price. Pressure escalates under Causal lens because each new sensor reading forecloses denial. No secondary stake dilutes the drive.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—silence vs. unsanctioned conversation—is signaled in line 3 and tightens when the narrator embeds their name as fuse. Escalation is causal under Hybrid lens: each act (thaw, encrypt, ping, send) forecloses retreat and raises social/existential cost. The “tiny bell tolling in the blizzard” is the audible tightening point. No coincidence; the shadow’s arrival is consequence, not contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.0)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—“return the echo to finish the lullaby”—is clear, but escalation is purely atmospheric: each stanza intensifies lyric density rather than narrowing options. The garden never resists beyond shivering; the goddess-echo tests with familiar voices but these are shrugged off by voicing silence, so no tactic is forfeited. Price is paid by the cosmos (patterns re-stitch) rather than the protagonist, softening felt cost. One meaningful tightening occurs when the spike pins the wave, yet the beat is more tableau than irreversible turn.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—print truth or live under a lie—tightens when the histogram’s “top hat” flatness confronts her; the technician’s cursor-fuse moment forces a public choice that forecloses donor appeasement, price legible in the dawn “pocketful of coins” sky.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—silence the dissonance of old guilt—tightens when the nephew’s cry rises from the reels, forcing the final naming. Agency is ritual inscription; each silver constellation forecloses denial and pays with permanent visibility. No external antagonist needed: the haunted firmware externalizes the narrator’s own chorus. Cost is the irrevocable tattoo of the name across steel, trading private frost for public star.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can communal silence be shaped into bearable meaning?—is signaled in the keeper’s mute instruction. Escalation is textural: each offering thickens the hush until the tide’s rinse forces a collective stance crystallization. No reversible blow-ups, just density accrual that forecloses loud speech. Cost is the surrender of permanence; survival is explicitly rejected.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—mercy must survive in a city that outlawed it—tightens when the patrol arrives; the single meaningful deepening is the guard-leader’s recognition of his own mother’s fig story, which forecloses lethal force. Protagonist’s agency is the renaming act; cost is the shared vulnerability that makes the plaza “taste like rain.” No reversals needed; situational pressure suffices. One hairline slip: the decree’s carved cedar is mentioned once and never re-embodied, leaving the law’s physicality abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—restore Rowan’s hope via orchard echo playback—signals early; one meaningful tightening when blueprint re-emerges under pearly leaf corridor. Ghost’s agency drives every escalation (coin flip, echo seeding), cost visible when coin relinquished. Accumulative pressure rises through sensory density (tastes shift lime→honey); no coincidence rescue. Could edge higher if Rowan’s despair were on-page contested rather than summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: can the protagonist keep listening without being consumed? Escalation: each wave Mara projects tightens the color trigger rules until the final grounding strap is the only safe path; refusal to re-pill is the visible price. Agency remains with narrator’s choreographed motion; no coincidence resolves tension. Cost is on-page: trading unlimited access for moderated “neighborhood hum.”

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—translate the unknown into a voice the sleepers can dream—tightens once: discovery of the wall-fossil triggers the decisive act of extraction/broadcast. Cost is legible (loss of privacy, risk of mis-reception), but the external world offers no immediate pushback, keeping escalation just shy of the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“prophecy vs. possibility”—is signaled early and tightens when spiral+echo reweights options. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversal overload. Agency is collective but protagonist initiates; cost visible in relinquished surrender and opened seam. Pressure coherent under Accumulative lens; coincidence complicates, does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can unused courage still answer when called—tightens when the stranger reveals the tether is severed; option space narrows to solitary repair. One meaningful escalation: apology line scraped in snow converts covert gesture into irreversible commitment. Cost is felt: “burn that marked you erased your tether.” Pressure stays causal under lens; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can the narrator reduce tangle to one true line—tightens when the coachman lifts a single stitch, proving erasure is possible yet loss-laden. Pressure escalates through weather and waiting, not external antagonist; the ford’s refusal mirrors the narrator’s. One meaningful deepening: acceptance of “shape of waiting” converts delay into tactic. Cost is the visible shedding of embroidered history; option space narrows to the unadorned present tense.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are abstract but legible: learn the ligament that lets a place resist erasure. Pressure deepens via environmental micro-reactions to kindness (leaf uncurls, moth lands), tightening the accretive pattern rather than narrowing external options; cost is conceptual—accepting responsibility to pass the knowledge on. No antagonist or reversal, but under Accumulative lens that is acceptable. Could use one sharper moment where kindness almost fails, to raise felt price and reach 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaim the stairwell from fear—tightens once when the mesh finally spills light and Theo walks unhanded. Agency is present but low-cost; the narrator risks trespass yet faces no repercussion, so escalation is accretive rather than irreversible. The oar-rhythm steadies each micro-move, a credible tactic under Accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual (shared exposure of hope) rather than personal, keeping pressure shy of the 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.0)
    Single dominant stake—translate isolation into independence—tightens when the ledger memory confronts the narrator with “shell without creature.” That beat narrows options: no resurrection, only coexistence. Agency remains with the protagonist (tuning hum, vow witnessed) so escalation is earned. Cost is legible in the brass color shift and the wind-door’s final seal, though the absence of external antagonist keeps pressure interior and slightly diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“will my words return her?”—is signaled early; pressure mounts as each stranger ties a letter, narrowing private grief into public conduit. The tightening beat is the communal spiral thickening, forcing the couple into its center with undeniable witness. Cost is visible: their silence tied to twine forecloses old clandestine letter-writing. Slight escalation dip: ex’s arrival feels externally timed, but crowd dynamic keeps agency communal rather than lucky rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—keep the airwaves from becoming a hate-mirror—tightens when donors, police, and patriots close in. Mid-story escalation: narrator risks license loss and arrest to deploy subsonics; the breakers trip, tower shakes, option space narrows. Cost is visceral: “coffee that tastes like pennies,” headphones “pressing crowns,” the scaffold left humming because “healing is slower than harm.” Slight deduction for off-stage administrative threat delivered by proxy; pressure would sharpen if provost confronted earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—recover the key without re-enslaving the city—tightens when the organ note risks “bruising” the mutiny. The single deepening (lifting veil vs. leaving city free) forecloses the cartographer’s impulse to bind, paid by the conditional promise “I would not bind it.” Cost is felt in the warming nail and the narrator’s acceptance of perpetual negotiation. Agency is clean: every escalation stems from the protagonist’s micro-choices under spatial pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can a portrait force a town to re-see the vanished—signals in paragraph 3. One meaningful tightening: ribbon snag → knot recognition collapses captain’s rehearsed alibi, narrows options to confession or silence. Cost legible in captain’s emptied minute and self-clasped wrists. No escalation drift; mist, metronome, ribbon accrue rather than reverse, fitting accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—earn return by proving Seraphine’s route—tightens when samples are found and the forecast “almost clicks,” narrowing options to stay vs. leave. Cost is visible: exile is “reversible only as long as you remain useful,” and narrator pays by refusing immediate return to finish the map. Agency drives discovery (nail repair, intake opened, data sent); no coincidences resolve conflict. One meaningful deepening suffices for 700-word piece, and it lands with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—recovering/transforming loss into possibility—is signaled early and reweighted when the flake is left as beacon. Escalation is textural: density of light/shard images accumulates until the crevice encounter crystallizes options. No tangible price is extracted from the narrator (time, risk, social credit), so cost remains conceptual rather than felt, capping the band.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—whether control-through-circles is escapable—tightens when each territorial marker (app geofence, paper bill, chalk ring) is revealed to exclude as much as protect. Agency: he keeps choosing loops until the final shard where he cedes the bills, a renunciation that forecloses retreat to either father or founder self. Cost visible: “the room finally sounded like a street” signals lost hush he once sold. Slight deduction for off-page courier crash that complicates without on-stage pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake early: decode inscriptions or remain silenced by grief. Escalation is rhythmic tightening—each star-pulse cycle forces a deeper alignment of glyphs, narrowing options until the only remaining move is to radio the lines outward. Cost is visceral: Mara's jaw unclenches, the narrator “lets go,” and the desert team’s cry through the speaker is the audible price of shared disclosure. Agency remains in each exposure, whisper, and algorithm rewrite; no off-stage resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—truth vs mirrored deception—is signaled in line 1 and tightens when the seed’s appetite forces her to pay blood for clarity. The orchard’s slowing spin is the decisive deepening that reweights options: paths to shore open only after she feeds the seed her own binding. Cost is legible on-page: blood, the seed’s bite, and the permanent erasure of Master Ren’s glamour. No reversal overload; one meaningful cadence shift suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—will the covenant be completed or remain eclipsed—tightens when the maze-topiary welts converge and bells ring in the marrow. One meaningful deepening: scars link, knowledge doubles, and the crosswind offers a single life-path, foreclosing infinite futures. Agency is collective yet visceral: pressing joined scars into air opens the lung-room; cost is the audible bell-in-bones. No coincidence resolves; the early-arrived future merely frames the pressure that protagonists must answer.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“patch holes in the soul”—is signaled in paragraph three and tightens when the narrator must accept scars to re-graft the brother’s path; the price (shared breath, perpetual return) is legible on the final line. One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens: each inscription of meaning increases density until the orchard’s fever breaks. No reversals needed; coincidence absent.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominate stake—redeem silence after public humiliation—faces a concrete test: will he commit to exhuming gear that could revive both the valley’s myth and his name? Mid-story tightening occurs when the set list proves he himself sealed the gear under stone, converting nostalgia into obligation. Cost is visible—he writes “Dear Echo” and accepts unpaid, possibly futile labour—but the beat is a single beat; no secondary reversal escalates further. Sufficient for 600-800 words, but the price plateaus once the decision is made.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—understand transition physics without tearing the world—signals in first paragraph and tightens when seed aligns: knowledge now legible at a cost. Agency is present-tense calibration, not rescue; each rail rotation narrows options toward listening, not consumption. Price is legible: mentor stays absent, fruit uneaten, coil left as cradle—tactics altered to stewardship. One meaningful deepening suffices for lyric/accumulative design; escalation is the growing legibility of thresholds, not plot reversals. No coincidence resolves tension; closure is stance crystallization under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—proving the tide will still remember—is signaled early and tightens through each smelting beat. The librarian’s agency drives the only meaningful turn: smelting identities into portable tide-loaves that foreclose fixed names. Cost is visible for visitors (identity lost/forged) but only conceptually for the librarian, capping the pressure just below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—permission to re-knit communal trust inside a doom bunker—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens once: from inspection checklist to irreversible coronation. The micro-turn is the inspector’s decision to crown the stalagmite; it narrows his future to outlaw status and forecloses the bunker’s sealed fate. Cost is conceptual but undeniable—the official document is re-written as poetic decree, a forfeiture of career certainty. Pressure is situational and accumulative rather than antagonistic, yet the final image makes the trade-off unambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness versus truthful accountability—signals in paragraph 4 and escalates through each tactile admission. The middle tightening occurs when graffiti arrows force the chronicler to relabel “irrelevant” portal as choke point, trading aesthetic map for ugly culpability. Cost is visible: muddy hands, public chalk confession, the lifelong maintenance sentence. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes after the clog is cleared; the final beat is quiet reconfiguration rather than new jeopardy, a minor flattening that keeps the score just below the 9-line.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—access the library without violating silence—tightens through calibrated waiting; each propagation delay narrows options and raises the cost of impatience. Agency is expressed via renunciation: the protagonist chooses not to read aloud, not to tear pages, accepting silence as entry fee. The final letter-writing is the decisive act that forecloses the loop, with conceptual cost legible. One minor slack: no external antagonist or resource loss beyond time, so pressure is atmospheric rather than viscerally spiked.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—return winter or let empire keep stolen season—is signaled in paragraph 3. One meaningful tightening: the promise “loses its glow” → must play now; melting violin narrows option to irrevocable release. Cost is visceral—ice becomes water slipping through fingers; donors drink the evidence. Agency is researcher’s alone; no external rescue, no coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“can I keep a last spark for recognition”—tightens once: spark captured, then released into braid. Escalation is situational pressure under hush-rule; narrator’s agency is the choice to let go, not force resurrection. Visible cost is the severing of tactile contact; no coincidence muddies the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can contentment be cultivated after unforgivable harm—tightens once: forgiveness must be practiced in “smaller cuts and grafts,” foreclosing the easier option of perpetual blame. Cost is legible on-page: the hairpin’s point is dulled by soil, the mother’s act remains un-rectified, and the narrator’s hands bear perpetual dirt.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—demolish quay or protect neighborhood—signaled in first third. Tightening occurs when wind chooses copper-bone-glass sequence; this forecloses the option of pure certainty, forcing Mara to adopt conditional signature. Cost is legible: she must publically speak fear while holding the knife. Agency is decision, not endurance; coincidence complicates (storms that missed by a street) but does not resolve. No reversal, but one meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: will the narrator internalize “vanishing to appear” before the mentor evaporates. Escalation is oblique—each withheld answer tightens the cognitive noose; the trance duration itself becomes the tightening agent, forcing the final insight. Cost is conceptual but legible: the mentor literally dissolves, proving the doctrine in vivo; narrator loses the body of the teacher and gains only the pattern—an unambiguous forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—learn to navigate without moving—tightens when the pulse tests the narrator with a stutter; refusal to chase narrows options to stillness alone. Escalation is accretive: each echo-layer adds dust-date signatures, braiding gull boundary that forbids step. Visible price is the eternal return seated again at end. One meaningful intensification suffices; no reversal needed under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“find the sacred in the simple”—is signaled early and tightens when the protagonist must choose between engineered muse and unaided attention. The unstrapping beat is the visible cost that forecloses the easier path. Escalation is textural: each recurrence of mist/silence deepens the stakes until the final “handmade silence” crystallizes the new stance. No reversal or external antagonist is needed; the pressure is internal and coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“discover the color of sound”—is signaled in the third sentence and tightens when the ledger entry swells, forcing an audible admission that costs him anonymity. Escalation is density-driven: each lantern vow, phonograph horn, and phosphor letter enlarges the same obsession until the cabinet hum forecloses passive hiding. No causal antagonist, but the sky lantern release acts as synchronous pressure that pulls tide and gaze upward while he steals downward, a situational tightening that crystallizes stance. Cost is legible: the open-door truth he now carries is irreversible, yet the price feels slightly conceptual rather than visceral, keeping it shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—tuning the newborn field with a human note—signals early and tightens through each cast/drip/listen cycle; options narrow to surrendering intention to scatter. Pressure is accumulative: each coin throw distills coolant, each static burst shortens the wavelength until only a patient hello remains. Cost is legible—amber tears spent, receiver thirst, the eternal duty to stay honest. No antagonist needed; the universe’s contraction is the coherent pressure forcing stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—naming fears—tightens as each tape bays another beast onto the atlas; agency stays interior (attention, endurance) yet forecloses escape: once “Enough” is written, the reaper must leave the observatory and carry the lexicon alone. Cost is felt in the hush after the final tape, but escalation is incremental rather than a single visible price; still, the atlas warming under touch signals stakes rising.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—re-teach the sea breath—escalates through drip-count tempo: three breaths = five drops, then seven, then silver seam. Agency stays with Nera: each micro-adjustment (rubbing water, murmuring fish names) directly widens the distance seam. Visible price: bell gains new crack, Aro vows “not for a season,” nets stay dry. Escalation is textural/cadence-driven, appropriate to the inferred lens, and forecloses the old harvest path.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—obey county expunge order or preserve outlaw memorial—emerges with the badge gleam and tightens when the warden countermands it. One visible cost: professional authority is wagered on the radio call; future flood liability is explicitly internalized. Escalation is causal, not repetitive: each photograph increases personal stake until maternal identity forces the irreversible choice. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the white-haired woman’s presence is set up by the trail itself.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will she fuse logic and intuition before the “final transformation”?—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens when she translates starling curves into ratios on bark, a visible trade-off. No antagonist is needed; pressure is cognitive and existential, escalating as the crystal warms and the question of future tenderness grows acute. Cost is conceptual rather than concrete: she accepts an indefinite pause, forfeiting the comfort of closure. One minor slack: the mentor’s off-stage instruction could have carried sharper on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve trust under load—tightens through one meaningful reversal: Lio’s autonomy refusal converts a single failed turn into harness slippage, forcing mentor to shift from command to muscle-memory coaching.  Escalation is causal and coherent: each radio exchange narrows options until only touch-trace remains.  Visible price paid: mentor forfeits personal recognition (Lio looks past him) and surrenders sleep to re-run knots.  No coincidence; all pressure derives from prior aviation set-up and human fallibility.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—emotional numbness vs. shared guardianship—tightens when the narrator’s palm-touch vivifies the brain, foreclosing sole ownership. One meaningful deepening: the kata of fan open/close bridges law and breath, narrowing options to mutual custody. Cost is legible: the jar’s silence becomes a lawful signature, stripping the city of parcel-by-parcel wind rights. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens; no reversal is needed because density accretes to the final hush.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—protect the brook from condos—tightens via seed-gifts → community nights → odor rumor; protagonist agency drives each orthogonal tactic. Escalation is accumulative, not causal-reversal, but the final sprout visibly forecloses developer ease; cost (time, secrecy, Mae’s exile) is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—restore laughter—tightens when the conductor chooses to leave part of it underground, a visible forfeiture that alters tactics (he refuses full restoration). Pressure escalates via sonic density: off-key bowed-tree wind → frost-skein laughter → candle-relit giggle; each uptick is legible under the Accumulative lens. No coincidence; every decibel is dragged by agency.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure tightens through accretion: each frost-map drawn on tongues raises the cost of certainty until the final refusal to cross crystallizes the stake—friendship with uncertainty—into an irreversible stance; the escalation is felt rather than plotted, coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—break the destiny that feeds children to the gears—is signaled in paragraph four and escalates through each failed firing that risks exposure. The penny-drop moment (“copper click of clarity”) is the decisive narrowing: he will vivify absence, not repair power. Cost is paid on-page—blood as solvent, bishop’s men drop intent, mills idle—foreclosing the old order. Escalation is single-thread but sufficient; no reversal is needed when the vacancy itself becomes the weapon.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can they coax a usable signal from ruin—is signaled early; pressure escalates as static peels away and the tone demands carriage; the final bucket’s weight makes the cost legible, though the middle argument beat feels low-torque beside the cosmic set-up.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—merge timelines so commuters have one reliable dawn—signaled in first third and tightened when the risk of “one of us will be chosen” is declared. Agency drives escalation: tipping the hourglass, coiling echo-rope, simultaneous radio call. Cost is the self’s dispersal into nautical sound; price is visible in the closing image. Under causal lens, because/therefore links hold without loopholes.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure escalates by density and pattern-break: each threaded line tightens the optical rules until the arena forces strangers to rehearse “the grammar of regard.” The cost is legible when Mara herself must step onto the floor she built and face the stranger wearing her “exile’s smile,” trading control for vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—orient without surface trust—tightens once: council permission as narrow sigh. Escalation is driven by instructor agency: petition draft, ring-scale lesson, route calculation; no coin-flip rescue. Visible price: dome crack becomes literal corridor window—habitation safety traded for skyward slot. Pressure narrows to a single moon-tide minute; failure equals “snapped brittle threads.”

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—keep Eli alive and listening—tightens when the suit-man closes in; the shattering panel is the irreversible escalation that forecloses the option to stay passive. Agency sits with the narrator: she mobilizes bystanders, weaponizes the crowd. Cost is legible: the city’s violence can still drop glass on you, but now Eli walks anyway. One meaningful turn suffices; no reversals needed.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—vigil for the erased—signals early and tightens as tide clock ticks; each canned-cold warming cycle is a micro-act that narrows the option to linger. Escalation is accumulative: rising water → reviving signal → naming the lost → choosing to leave; cost is the unrescued archive. No external antagonist; pressure is mineral time. The final foreclosed path (exit without download) is visible and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming lived identity against administrative death—tightens when the ghost reveals the missed aerial corridor; option space narrows to “carry ink map down.” Cost is legible: protagonist must descend thin-air path while frost still clogs lungs.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—save a dying language—tightens when each surrendered memory narrows future selfhood; “curse asked for two more names” is the visible price that alters tactics. Agency is continuous: reading bird grammar → pressing bone → surrendering names → becoming instrument. Escalation is accumulative deepening rather than causal reversals, permissible under lens. The final renunciation forecloses return to prior identity, meeting high-band cost requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—can laughter re-stitch the city’s trauma?—tightens when the cryptid demands the pun; the arrowhead’s transformation from tool to tongue is the visible price, narrowing options from research to performative jest. Escalation is incremental-accumulative rather than causal-reversal, but the final pun crystallizes an irrevocable stance.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—beauty vs. mechanical control—tightens when sanctioned melodies fail and heartbeat signaling risks corporal punishment. One meaningful deepening: orchard’s trained sundown tightening is reversed by three chest-thumped requests; rails rise with audible lever complaint. Cost is visible: city lamps tilt away, clock refuses chime—live institutional loss. Agency is pure (no off-stage savior); coincidence only complicates (fog stitches extra ladders).

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.9)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: restore silent motion to forgotten carousel—signaled in line 5. Escalation is accretive: each salvaged fragment (halo, breath, bucket plan) raises possibility until crown click crystallizes option. No external antagonist; pressure is entropy vs. patience. Cost legible: breath spent, years of dawn returns, acceptance of noiseless reward—meets on-page forfeiture requirement. Single meaningful turn suffices for lyric 750-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single stake—locate “where stories live”—is signaled early and deepens through topological recursion. Agency is present (sliding ticket, shelving the air), but the tightening is poetic rather than option-narrowing; no live alternative is foreclosed with visible consequence. Escalation is textured (shelves breathe, scarf warms) yet remains accretive, not adversarial. Sufficient for mid-to-high band, but lacks a palpable trade-off that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—reclaim Aria vs. release dream—is signaled in paragraph 3. Escalation is accumulative: each exposure deepens the cost of porousness rather than narrowing options causally. The sunrise itself is the tightening agent; its first light forces the final palette tilt. Cost is visible—letting the dream go means Aria stays tide-bound—but the beat is single-thread; no secondary resource loss compounds tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—permission to love without rehearsing danger—is signaled early and tightened when the door’s inhale makes refusal impossible. Escalation is textural: each sensory layer (scent of hair, sound of tumblers, star-breath) raises the emotional tariff until the corridor demands passage. Scholar’s agency is the trembling step across; cost is the sister’s death re-realized in the taste of salt and spring. Price is felt, not declared, satisfying the on-page cost test.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure escalates through pattern deepening—each retrieved fragment (cider, smoke, mother’s hands) narrows the protagonist’s stance until stepping into the ring is the only remaining option; the cost is the swallowed bitterness of the first apple, paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reversibility of exile—tightens once via hinge-glyph revelation, cost paid by archivist who enables release but remains locked. Escalation is density-driven: each annotation and tea-leaf pattern adds weight until the swing-hush triggers aperture. Agency remains with archivist; girl’s plea complicates but does not resolve. No coincidence; every beat is earned by handling of glass, tea, mirror.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: free the daughter from her father’s restless drag. Pressure tightens once, causally: each un-knot narrows the option to stop; the final knot forecloses retreat and lifts the coffer. Cost is visible—daughter’s tremor, narrator’s admission of mirroring, the sanctuary’s hush gaining weight—paid on-page. No coincidence resolves; the net’s sigh is the direct effect of the last un-knot under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—how to witness without violating—tightens through accumulating sensory clues and the visible abrasion that records past touch. The decisive turn is the choice to compare silent videos instead of prying; this agency narrows options (renounce loud discovery) and makes the final refusal legible. Cost is conceptual but felt: the narrator accepts lifelong custodial tension and the possibility no one else will find the maps. Escalation is textural rather than causal-reversal, perfectly valid under inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—will the narrator ever enact the physics of letting go?—tightens with each slower-falling flake and every hiss of recovered tape. Agency resides in attention and ultimately in surrender; the moment he loosens the globe, a visible price is paid: his former metric detachment dissolves. One meaningful deepening is enough; coincidental discovery of the child’s ticket is complication, not resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—giving silent neighbours a voice—tightens when the bolt plate grounds live current, risking exposure of both balladeer and ghost. One meaningful reversal: the ghost shifts from passive auditor to active micro-agent, dimming corridors and loosening bus schedules—legible cost paid in visible LEDs. Agency is renunciatory rather than combative, but still forecloses the option of remaining unheard. Coincidence is absent; every kindness is compiled from deliberate pigment-and-petal uploads.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—keep Madam Vire safe from grief—tightens each floor: the diary’s existence threatens her, the map offers a way to bury it, the final room demands surrender. One meaningful turn at seventh-floor stop crystallizes cost; coincidence never rescues. The servant’s agency is renunciation rather than heroic action, perfectly scaled to lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake: prove the atmosphere keeps record of the beloved; pressure tightens through cumulative cataloguing until final tether to “your wake.” Progression is density-based, not causal reversal, so escalation fits Accumulative lens. Price visible—chilled fingers, graphite tremor, admission of irrevocable loss—but could be sharper if one cloud-category failed or cost a physical resource.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—finish the sky-portrait before obliteration—tightens through texture accretion rather than successive reversals; each painted wall forecloses blankness and consumes dwindling minutes. A visible price is paid: the protagonist surrenders the coin and any future claim on the room, leaving the art vulnerable to rubble. Pressure is coherent and escalates via sensory intensification (siren throat, wet lime swell). The lack of an external obstacle beyond the clock keeps this just under the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—map the next discovery—tightens when the only path is through then above the birds, a single meaningful escalation. Agency remains with the apprentice: decipher hopscotch, translate hum, decide the fold. Cost is the strand’s loneliness absorbed into paper, a felt price. No coincidence resolves; bird-escort complicates but does not save.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—learn the rhythm of repair—signals early; pressure escalates as each mirror demands a subtler patience, narrowing options from forcing to listening. Cost is visible: frostbitten palms, surrendered triumph, the note that relinquishes authorship. No antagonist needed; circumstance plus self-imposed ethic tighten the screw. Final chime is conceptual repricing of breakage itself, not a fix.</answer>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
    <comment>Theme emerges organically: repair as invitation rather than erasure, taught by eclipse imagery and mirrored braids. No moralizing; the final instruction “listen to breaks...” is oblique, left behind not spoken. Subtext lives in gesture—oil sighing like harbor sleep, mirrors wiping tears not yet formed—avoiding sentimental assertion. The concept of “teaching a hurt how to keep moving” reweights prior prophecies without tidy closure.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—coax rain or lose the orchard—is signaled in paragraph two. One meaningful tightening occurs at dusk when the bell must be tipped from the arch’s fault-line: option space narrows to “climb or stay dry/quiet.” Protagonist agency is collective but visible: households swap shifts, elders climb, Ana executes the final tilt. Cost is legible in fatigue, exposed vulnerability on the arch, and the explicit forfeiture of old grudges; persistent constraint (only one bell) shapes tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“keep endings patient” via slower fall—is signaled early and deepened through each nested pattern gate. Agency is the deliberate key-turns that “unknot a century”; price is tasted copper regret and widened seconds. No external antagonist is needed; pressure is coherent cosmic urgency. Cost is legible but abstract (taste, time-width) rather than a concrete forfeiture, keeping it just below top band.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“guide before frost”—is signaled in line 5 and tightens when the frost-clock + bird patrol carve the orchard into “separate islands.” The nut-as-blueprint moment is the single meaningful deepening that reweights options: it converts passive caretaking into active path-forging with visible risk when the engine pauses “like a breath before a sob.” Cost is legible: the caretaker forfeits escape and perpetuates his own erasure. Slight deduction because the travelers’ peril is abstract, muting visceral pressure compared with his interior cost.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—translate separation into connection—tightens when the filament bridge will fail unless both step. One meaningful escalation: the text-message thumbs-up cracks open possibility, narrowing options to shared physical test. Price is visibly paid: muddy graphite fingers, slipping foot, startled heron—stakes made visceral. No coincidence; pressure coheres under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—trading absence for voice—tightens once, crystallizing when the silver bows under the weight of the unspoken name. Escalation is textural: density of glass, frost, and moonlight increases until the ledger literally brightens, reweighting the cost of beginnings. No second reversal is needed; the single deepening suffices under Accumulative lens. The father-absence arrives late, so the personal cost feels slightly external rather than fully earned pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—transform communal grief without erasing its grain—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened when the chef’s pulse leaks brine under handshake pressure. Escalation is accumulative: each tasted memory increases the risk of personal contamination; the decisive deepening occurs when he decides to subsume the fortress’s grief into a broth he must himself swallow. Visible price: continuous brine sting, wrapped hands, and final fatigue that fits grief “inside the ribs.” No external antagonist needed; internal/external weave is the chef’s palate versus city sorrow.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—rehabilitate conversation or lose communal future—signals in first 120 w. Escalation is accretive: each new language fastened tightens physical bridge and social risk; councilman’s beam lift is visible price. No coincidence; elevator’s memory of glove is payoff of anthropomorphic setup. Single meaningful deepening suffices at this length; option space narrows until the span must be tested by children.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—will he keep petrifying grief or release the living dream—tightens when the mirror splits three moons and forces recognition of the flood-quarter abandonment. Escalation is textural: each dial-turn thickens theta waves, layering mineral-spring laughter until the limestone of regret cracks. No external antagonist; pressure is accrued density of entangled memory. Visible price: the decision not to return is relived with split faces, cost felt in “shelter and prison” line. Sufficient for 600-word window.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—harvest forgotten combinations—tightens when each threshold demands a new sensory offering. Agency is attention-based: listening to numbers rustling, drumming exact cadence; failure would mean blank return. Escalation is textural: each chamber strata adds audible bell-tones and salt-ash taste, re-weighting the cost of carrying tokens. Price is visible: perpetual reentry obligation, sleep traded for vigilance.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—permission to keep listening—tightens once when the hedgehog’s nod authorizes continuance; escalation is quiet but legible under Accumulative lens. The price is perpetual return without applause, a path foreclosed to grander crescendos; cost is felt but could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“mend the eclipsed covenant before the registry seals names”—is signaled early and tightens with every chess-correlated bird-flight. The queen’s arrival on the back rank followed by the king’s libation constitutes a meaningful deepening that forecloses the option of speed-trusting shortcuts. Cost is visible: the tutor’s voluntary abdication of the board certifies exile’s humility. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens; one decisive intensification suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes—can silence be coaxed, not cracked?—tighten through density, not reversals: each attempted frequency increases the wager that gentleness will suffice before the city’s promised explosions. The protagonist’s agency is attention itself; the final loosening of the clasp is the single meaningful escalation, paid for by sustained, patient listening rather than a new tool. Cost is legible: he forfeits the spectacular moment outside, staying inside to write “hush of metal asked a kind question” while mortars shred the sky. The pattern holds under Accumulative lens, though the external boom remains off-stage, slightly muting visceral price.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can stillness be trained inside motion?—tightens as smell threatens social rupture. Mid-story “panic skittering” beat forces Mara to improvise masks, narrowing options from solitary experiment to communal covenant. Cost is visceral: everyone chooses to inhale the unbearable, forfeiting permanent olfactory comfort.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is single and lethal: will the planet’s echo-engine (and therefore the orchards) survive this season? Pressure escalates when the singing thins; the protagonist’s decision to enter the veil is an irreversible burn of altitude and safety. Cost is visible on-page: the river “lurches,” glider tether must be cut, and the shard wound’s sealing costs her the chance to keep climbing—she returns earth-bound, seed as receipt. Coincidence is absent; every complication is a direct wound she chooses to mend.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single dominant stake—prevent repetition of singular convergence—tightens when the investigator drafts an order that turns the maze into a “breathing grid,” trading scheduling purity for adaptive safety. The price is visible: the patch must return to a family still grieving, the town must accept slower throughput. Agency is renunciation rather than triumph; the investigator endures the bureaucratic slog as buffer against future wind. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversal is needed under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“prove wonder is essential”—deepens through accumulative texture: each bell-stroke makes silence heavier, sleep more seductive; the aurora walk is the visible price (minutes of mortal risk), and the tightening is the hush learning to “carry courage and doubt without breaking,” foreclosing the option to return empty-handed.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—harvest insight from failure—tightens when the corridor offers a twin valley judgment; the protagonist’s shift from crossing to listening forecloses the old guardian path. Pressure escalates via pattern intensification (hush → loom → shared breath) with visible cost: relinquishing ownership of the seam.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: can empathy be transposed without permanent self-loss? Pressure escalates through each trait-loan that leaves “a scratch on him” and empties the apprentice’s laugh. Mid-text, the star gaps tighten from languid to “held breath,” forcing the final print run. Cost is visible: the operator’s shoulder drop, the apprentice’s cleaner but shaken breathing—options narrow to one last shared proof before the next star vanishes.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—keep wonder alive without addictive extension—tightens once when the courier chooses release, paying tomorrow’s “thinner dawn” as visible price. Pressure is textural: each extension thickens ambient time; refusal lets it thin, reconfiguring options. Agency is interior and sufficient for lyric mode. Cost is felt but less visceral than a physical forfeiture; hence caps just below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prove or disprove emotional absorption—tightens when frost spirals center on father’s seat, forcing narrator to test belief with embodied cost. One meaningful deepening: prism flare after the name is spoken locks the map of shards, foreclosing retreat to mere skepticism. Price is audible (steering-column creak) and tactile (keys handled like bruised fruit). Agency stays with narrator: speaking the name is the decisive act that changes knowledge state.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes—impossible distance vs. living orchard—tighten once: the latent sacrifice knots, forcing the choice to send only the bead. Escalation is accretive: silence layers, amber warms, frame glows; the sister’s absence is reweighted rather than reversed. Protagonist agency is the renunciation that keeps the grove alive; cost is seasons of lantern oil and thinning flesh. No coincidence; the jigsaw edges and raveling silence are tools she trained for years.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—keep sky from falling—tightens through three bartered awakenings, each demanding a higher memory-tithe. Escalation is accumulative: first trade (winter forge sound) buys only a settling sigh; second (forgotten surname) wakes the hoist; third (childhood laughter) secures the arch that ends the drift. Every step reduces the blacksmith’s audible future, a visible price that charges the final image. No coincidence; all pressure is mineral + memory, forced by protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—liberate withheld voices—signaled in paragraph 6 and escalates through three sensory-tuned approaches to the crate. Pressure tightens when narrator must match breath to sealed hinges, foreclosing retreat; failure would perpetuate orbital shrinkage of lives. Cost is paid on-page: body becomes conduit, throat transient corridor, shard dims. Agency is interior yet decisive; no external antagonist required. Escalation is accumulative/textural: density of voices layered onto taste and light until silence fractures. Slight reserve: escalation is steady rather than spiked, keeping it shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserving undocumented intimacy from museum death—is signaled early and tightens once: automation threatens, narrator answers by bottling the letters. The escalation is a single deepening rather than because/therefore chain, sufficient for lyric-accumulative design. Price is conceptual but legible; physical risk absent keeps score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: town survival vs. annihilating gyre, signaled in headline “the sea edits… with foam.” Tightening occurs when accidental laugh pivots gyre landfall, foreclosing offshore death model and raising personal culpability. Agency: narrator steers light via rune-scratched wick, trades terror for beneficent irrigation; visible price is exhaustion and custodial loneliness felt in final log line. Cost is legible, though escalation leans on lyrical accumulation more than successive reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—how to carry a borrowed heart without erasing self—tightens when the dye master demands the protagonist “listen with my shoulders,” forcing surrender of authorial control. Escalation is textural: each brew and sun line adds density until refusal of lantern-hood is the only non-shattering option. No causal reversal, but pattern break (the laugh that is both donor and host) makes the cost felt. Coincidence is absent; pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can the maze’s sorrow be quantified and read back from the trees?—is signaled in paragraph 3 and deepens when dream-dust is matched to wall-scars. Escalation is textural: density of angles, scents, tear-edges accumulates until the sextant’s cracked lens finally “trembles” into alignment, narrowing options to this one alignment or failure. Cost is conceptual but felt: the放弃了 public recognition (no prophecy declared) and accepts perpetual custodial anonymity. Agency is interior—listening, aligning, trading—but it forces an irreversible stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“rekindle a dying realm”—is signaled in paragraph 3 and deepened once when the last village arrives with “fires gone to salt.” Pressure tightens accumulatively: each song loosens mica, each thread narrows the remaining night. Cost is visible on-page: the keeper’s palms shake, the greenhouse darkened in recalled failure, and finally he is “emptied.” No live option is foreclosed at the end, but the stance crystallizes in the raised cloth.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—repair the grief her binding warped—tightens when the paradox curriculum demands she renounce self-blame while still claiming responsibility; the shift from “mistake” to “bridge” escalates under accretion of mirrored images, foreclosing avoidance. Cost is palpable: she must confess error in ink that “accepted her lines the way shore clay accepts a footprint,” risking relational rupture. Only gap: escalation is one-stage; no secondary external obstacle compounds pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“keep the minutes of the dead”—is signaled in line 2. Escalation is accumulative: each sampled vow either survives the noise or fractures, narrowing the archivist’s options until only the “clean blank of survival” remains. The deepening occurs when the narrator revises metadata to include “conditions never spoken,” a micro-choice that forestalls collapse at visible labor cost. No reversal is needed; the lattice of saved/failed frequencies itself tightens the noose of responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—capture the sound of trust breaking—tightens through each feinted nod and withheld word; the protagonist’s agency is to stall, not strike, until the buckle sound arrives. Escalation is accumulative: each false start erodes the fence’s composure rather than raising external threat. Cost is visible when he “refused a share” of moonshine, confessing guilt without speech. One meaningful deepening suffices; no coincidence resolves the standoff.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—will the narrator accept that weather-carrying is duty, not curse—tightens once when the taste-map orders the crest converge. Agency is present (the ring prompts the move), but the price is primarily sensory, not tactical; no option is foreclosed. Pressure accumulates via tasted signatures rather than a causal reversal, fitting the Accumulative lens. The trees’ vote outcome is off-stage, so the personal cost feels moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“uncork suppressed creativity before it ferments into silence”—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens through each failed/attempted access to the niche. One meaningful deepening: the lock’s face swings away to reveal the real keyhole, forcing a shift from cerebral memory to manual, tactile art-making. Cost is visible in the trembling wrist and the cave’s reclaimed chime. Agency is internal but active; no external antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—retrieve lost conversations to barter for breathable air—is signaled in line 4 and tightened when the Ear demands candor as payment, narrowing options from “sneak in” to “confess or suffocate.” Escalation is causal: each shard of honesty (hoarding inks, boxing cruelty days, fake promise) raises the physiological tariff his body enforces, forcing deeper confession. No coincidence; the map and plate fit because he pried the floorboard his own earlier curiosity had weakened. Visible price: wrists weaken ➜ must steady breath ➜ must stand exposed while city audits him. The single meaningful turn suffices at this length and forecloses anonymous retrieval; future letters will now carry his own audited breath. Cost is legible on-page in trembling cuffs and the spindle’s bell-jar ring that releases others’ voices at his expense.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“preserve the color of wonder”—is signaled early and tightens when aurora thins; the tightening is the visible fade that forces Mara to borrow voices. Escalation is accumulative: each bell rotation deepens communal exposure (unnamed child, twenty-winter grief) rather than narrows external options. Cost is legible in melting fragment and released postures; no reversal, but deepening suffices under Accumulative lens. Persistent constraint (iceberg loss) shapes final tactics and charges closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: resolve inner static vs. preserve archive. Escalation is density-driven: each paragraph adds a new system (magnetic shift, smoke spiral, seed crack) tightening until only the breach remains. One meaningful deepening—miniaturizing self-noise—forecloses the option to stay whole. Cost is visible: dome windows spider, paint curls, and the android accepts “fragmented wholeness” as diagnosis turned promise.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“prove listening heals”—tightens when the inspector’s bolt-cutter countdown threatens failure. Curator’s agency is to stall, gather stories, and risk fines; the letters inside foreclose isolation and launch the mutual-aid ledger. Cost is legible: inspector’s half-lowered cutters, neighbors’ cracked voices, Maria’s spent savings. Escalation is single but sufficient; drone beat is complication, not resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—liberate drowned minds—signaled in first third and tightens when each journal entry risks exposure. Escalation is accumulative: each coded chore raises daemon’s tolerance until midnight+12=L triggers the final chord. Protagonist’s agency is the dance itself; no outside coincidence required. Cost is legible—lab abandoned, dice left spinning, surface anonymity accepted.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake: recover what forgetting erased; pressure tightens once when cube “sweats” her laugh, narrowing option to return memories to sea. Cost is felt—voice returns then fades, proving deletion is porous. Agency is attention/ritual, not combat; sufficient for lyric-accumulative lens. No external antagonist; coincidence (gravity pocket timing) complicates rather than saves.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prevent sky-door opening—tightens once when the wing-grid redirects the syllable-mist; protagonist agency is the quiet cartographic act, not luck. Cost is conceptual: the world forfeits an “answer for every question that pain had asked,” a loss felt in the hush. No second reversal, but one meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—learning to hear buildings—signals early; pressure tightens when the narrator must “speak back” to the roof with a small truth, revealing the apartment’s root-pretense. This single deepening satisfies accumulative escalation, but options never truly narrow and no visible price is paid (time, social credit, risk). The meteor shower is coincidence that complicates mood, not resolution, so lens coherence holds. Cost is atmospheric, not tactical, keeping score shy of 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—translate isolation into independence—is signaled in line 4 and tightened when the laugh demands release versus quarantine rule. The speaker’s agency drives every escalation: testing resonance, carrying the shell, choosing to open along rather than out. Cost is visceral—loss of quarantine safety and of self as static keeper. One meaningful deepening (the laugh starts orbiting the doors) reweights options under the Accumulative lens; no coincidence required.</answer>
    <question>5</question><grade>9.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: quarantine as both mercy and cruelty, resonance as both archive and escape. Subtext lives in gesture—the shell left on the nail is a quiet covenant for future travelers. No moralizing; the dissolution of the quarantine sign into “practice kindness” is earned image, not thesis. Final chord left inside the speaker reweights all prior echoes without abstract statement.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—unlinking guilds from war-foundry tax-chains—is signaled early; escalation is textural: each drip, aurora flare, and counter-stroke cumulatively slackens the carved decree; the protagonist’s agency is the thorn-guided rewriting, but pressure stays intellectual rather than bodily, keeping the cost cerebral rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—recovering the physics of echo versus silence—tightens when the council admits the canyon banks abandoned voices as interest. One meaningful deepening: mother’s voice reveals the singer’s own debt, turning abstract inquiry into personal cost. Price is legible yet diffuse; the council’s retreat blunts the final pinch.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—retrieving a name from erasure—tightens exactly once, but that tightening is decisive: the moment the narrator realizes the globe’s base still bears legible scars, silence is no longer an option. Pressure is accumulative: each dream-cameo adds density until the shrine’s candle-smoke becomes the final witness. Cost is conceptual but legible: the narrator exits bearing the name’s cold weight, a path foreclosed to anonymity. No false escalation—just a single, irreversible reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—village hunger versus turtle survival—tightens when the philosopher reframes “thief” into shared pattern, forcing Li and elders to trade blame for complicity. Mid-story whistle act escalates by exposing the widow’s clandestine mercy, converting a single cut net into systemic by-catch. The final moon-loop invention materially loosens under pressure, demonstrating visible trade-off: smaller harvest, moral credit. Cost is legible, but escalation is single-arc; no second reversal keeps it shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. comforting lie—tightens when the narrator physically holds the diamond and feels his blood slow, foreclosing the option to keep believing the miracle. Escalation is single but decisive: entering stillpoint → reading shredded truth → silence pact. Price is felt: professional integrity is compromised in real time. No secondary reversal, but one meaningful tightening is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—signal survival vs. council shutdown—tightens when cutters retreat smoking, then again when traitors crack glass. One meaningful deepening: grandfather-lullaby tape reweights the stake from mere defiance to cultural memory. Agency is the visionary’s decision to stay at the tuner, accepting anonymity; cost is visible in Kestrel’s scorched shoulder and the tower’s fracture. Escalation is textural—storm density accumulates until batons fall “like rain gutters.”

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—becoming translator—tightens when the storm forces him to risk losing the archive; the act of uncorking three jars mid-gale is the visible price that forecloses solitary hoarding. No coincidence; escalation is accumulative density of preserved voices reaching critical mass. Cost legible: “if the storm took me, it would at least take a town’s vocabulary.”

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—protect Lens-Heart—tightens when Collector demands proof; protagonist’s agency in humming the crystal forecloses negotiation and exposes shared grief. Cost (emotional exposure) is visible, but escalation is single-turn, not multiply braided.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—prove patience can replace speed—tightens when council votes only three nights; failure returns them to haste. Agency: protagonist risks reputation on lunar test. Price visible: “return barren” clause. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversal required under lyric-causal design.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. career survival—tightens when the corroded module tagged “last week” is discovered; options collapse from “report maybe” to “report now” as the nepotism watermark surfaces. The 23-heartbeat flood window plus 9-second lung sprint dramatizes cost in lungs and seconds, making the preventable death visceral. Escalation is agency-driven: each empirical observation (torque on stripped bolt, wire unclipped, calls made) widens the gap between the city’s tidy narrative and the investigator’s unerasable version.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can apology become trustworthy action?—tightens once when the chaplain realizes he must offer a plan, not sermons. The ballerina-spring swap is the visible price that alters tactics; future parole now hinges on Hector’s continued labor. Pressure stays coherent under causal lens; no coincidence resolves anything. Cost is legible in the closing image of perpetual repair.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“ring a bell no one hears yet”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when the map “dared me not to follow.” Escalation is textural: each image (sea chewing thoughts, spindle humming like a bitten lip) reweights the cost of being unheard. Agency is continuous—every bolt, spring-wing, and pull is Sera’s. Persistent constraint: the acid sea literally dissolves ambition; cart glider trembles, bearings must be re-greased, bodily bruises accumulate. Cost is legible in the ringing’s loneliness and the sea’s new alphabet.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stake—uncover deletion conspiracy—tightens through numeric breadcrumbs; protagonist actively breaches security and accepts complicity in the final quiet cover-up. Cost visible in last line’s “lie is heavier now” magnetized to consequence.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme of managed forgetting vs personal haunting emerges from archival imagery; subtext stays in gestures (drawer-slide, badge tremble). Final public-number flash shows system-wide persistence of memory without sermon, leaving charged ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—prevent floe-war flare—tightens when the shard demands a lived act, not pose. Escalation: shard cuts thumb → globe flares only after promises cost sleds & fish cellars. Price is on-page: narrator must leave gallery and wade slush at dawn. One hairline slip: envoys’ ridicule “tinder” is tell-adjacent.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will she press the button?—tightens through each salvage dawn; postponement costs accumulate (appointment rescheduled twice on-page). One decisive tightening: the ice-crack rescue crystallizes that endings can arrive unbidden, making scheduled death feel premature. Escalation is causal under Situational lens: external pressures (storm detritus, Mikko’s counsel, saved boy) force stance crystallization rather than plot reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—whether human connection can survive mismatched silence—is signaled early and tightened once: the traveler’s live phone call converts abstract advice into immediate risk. The sentinel’s agency is oblique (advice, libation, silence) yet it forces the traveler’s decisive action; cost is transferred to the traveler’s relationship and symbolically to the soil. No reversal for the sentinel, but the accrual of paused nights reaches a crystallized limit: first frost will oust even this role. Under Accumulative lens, the meaningful deepening is the phone call turning theory into exposed vulnerability; cost is felt though not catastrophically personal.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve the echo—tightens through each conjured clearing; the final hush is the visible price paid for earlier attempts. No antagonist is needed: pressure is situational, the desert itself the eroding force. One meaningful deepening occurs when the woman’s swallowed question and the child’s stuttering laughter are both steadied by the same thread, proving the tactic works and foreclosing retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—“an exhibition of remembrance that could breathe on its own”—tightens through each added arc of photographs; the corridor physically narrows options until the only path is to stand inside the collective wing. No external antagonist is needed: the pressure is the town’s fear that memory will crush them, met by the archivist’s insistence on shared authorship. Cost is visible in Ole’s bow and Marta’s shaded eyes, but the escalation is more textured accumulation than decisive reversal, keeping it just below top band.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can culture grow unnamed?—is signaled in line 3 and tightens once: the Court demand for proof. Agency is listening/arranging shards; the visible price is the crystal’s surrender and the lifelong guardianship of unlanguaged sound. Escalation is accumulative density, not causal reversals; one deepening suffices and lands with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—“capture the sound of growing older”—tightens through accrual: each chalk command shrinks future options until only the recorder’s gray bloom remains. The meaningful deepening occurs when he obeys his future self’s command not to rewind; this renunciation forecloses retrieval and makes the hush itself the room. Cost is legible in the line “he felt the loss occur early, knowledge evaporating before the forgetting even arrived.” Under Accumulative lens, density—not reversal—reweights the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“harness the ephemeral before it slips past the sky”—is signaled early and tightens when spinning hand threatens comet capture. Escalation under Accumulative lens: moon-quake threads, dust plumes, and leaf cadence deepen density until governor seats. Protagonist’s micro-choices (loop leaf, breathe, tap) narrow options; cost is forfeiting Lina’s live voice. No coincidence; pressure coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—deliver a flawless goodbye—tightens when bloodwork collapses time to “maybe a day.” mid-story escalation is the phone call that risks Lena’s refusal; the rooftop becomes the last stage. Cost is visible: the muted chord literally silences future music, the shard’s edge is softened under gauze. Agency resides in the therapist’s decisions to phone, to pick with the shard, to mute the strings.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—“where shadows go”—clarifies early; pressure escalates each time the apprentice polishes, scratches runes, and renounces prying the pods, tightening options under the Accumulative lens; still, the external consequence (island steadiness) feels distant from his personal risk.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can the narrator repair more than bones, i.e., a community rupture wrought by his own skepticism—tightens once: the fox’s limp forces an immediate test of “listening correctly,” and success re-opens the garden’s return path. The price is legible (public apology, relinquishing expert authority), but because the fox injury appears in-scene rather than being foreshadowed, the escalation feels slightly engineered rather than inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—balance communal calm against storm-risk—is declared early but remains abstract; no on-page test sharpens the trade-off. The tightening beat is the choice to release/integrate the pearl: it narrows future weather but price is only stated (“storms could return”). Escalation is tonal density, not rising threat; sufficient for lyric mode but not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake: can private atonement outrun public narrative? Pressure tightens through accumulative density—each grafted cutting, each visitor seeking “quiet”—until the narrator’s refusal to speak again forecloses easy absolution. The visible price is perpetual labor: every misted hour is an “honest sentence.” No coincidence; escalation is driven solely by the protagonist’s choice to keep tending what might still die.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—collecting shapes of hopes without stealing them—signals early and tightens when each cameo demands restitution. The girl’s accusation (“that was erasure”) is the meaningful turn that narrows options from rescue to witness. Under Accumulative lens, each gift (star, knot) layers density until refusal to deny becomes the only stance left; price is the permanent loss of authorial omnipotence, felt in shaky legs. No reversal beyond this single deepening, but it suffices for 600-word scale.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restore sacred covenant—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when the vow “snagged like a burr.” The meaningful turn is the collective pivot of the shadow wheel; it narrows options to speak the vow in the correct alignment, paid for by Lio’s emptied posture. Pressure accumulates through sensory density rather than external antagonist, satisfying the Accumulative lens. Could edge higher if the price were sharpened beyond fatigue.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—find Fen before white noise erases him—is signaled early and tightened when the plate warms and lines “lean toward the eastern rim.” Escalation is accumulative/textural: each flare adds a pulse-track, density increases, options narrow to that single smooth ridge of snow. Price is paid in real time: starlight spent, wax sealed, tripod abandoned. Agency remains hers; coincidence never intervenes.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—restoring wonder-time—signals early. Escalation is the deepening density of harvested echoes; each return bruises or refines the gear teeth, narrowing options until only cave-tempo remains. Protagonist agency is continuous (adjusting balance wheel, filing gears), but the cost is largely opportunity—no credible loss of tool, stamina, or social credit appears on-page, so the tightening stays conceptual rather than visceral. Still, the final image reweights the premise: civic tick now carries winter-humility, foreclosing ordinary seconds forever.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—can the valley shed its burdens and can the weaver carry them—tightens through one meaningful deepening: each newly weighed grief (widow’s absence, boy’s tremor, unfinished boat) incrementally overloads the cord until the valley itself appears to ask the price. Agency remains the weaver’s decision to calcify and stitch rather than abandon. Cost is visible: the cord’s whalebone bend across shoulders and the perpetually lengthening grotto map. No extrinsic antagonist needed; pressure is situational and accretive.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—how to house grief without trapping it—tightens as each carving stroke narrows possibility. Escalation is textural: sugar crystal dissolving, mane loop coiling, door clicking ajar; each increment raises the cost of getting the container wrong. Visible price: she forfeits the fantasy of total reunion and accepts a pocket-sized storm.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (restart rains vs. restart grind) is signaled early; escalation occurs through each camera click that narrows Mara’s moral options until the ghost demands the vow-memory. The tightening is textural—stories accrue density—but the final tribute is a felt price, satisfying 8.8+ threshold. Slight short of 8.8 only because the cost is emotional, not an external resource loss that alters later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—resurrecting hope via functional creativity—tightens once: from dust-filled apathy to looping ribbon of water. Agency is continuous: every solder, tape wrap, and resistance calculation narrows options and spends daylight charge. Cost is visible: “she can afford to keep alive” only a few lights; failure remains live possibility. No external antagonist needed; internal constraint (limited wattage) supplies coherent pressure under Accumulative lens.</answer>
    <question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: hope = amperage × head × friction, not slogan. Final image of glowing terminal reframes earlier “maze of intentions” as living circuit. No overt thesis statement; the boy’s question and her answer (“learning to move again”) let theme resonate without moralizing. Ambiguity lingers—will buses ever come?—inviting reflection rather than closure-by-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—can silence accommodate being heard?—tightens once: the protagonist risks breaching sanctuary law by sounding any tone. Escalation is textural: each softer tremor deepens the stakes rather than widens them. Visible cost is the perpetual self-censorship that now must include even the bell that will never ring.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—decode the architecture of lies before the water rewrites him—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens when the sundial scratches point at the conduit. One meaningful deepening: the realization the flood was “throttled and timed, not unleashed” forecloses the option to blame nature and forces the choice to公开. Cost is visible—the foreman’s stance lowers “like a man placing a heavy bucket down”—and social: the town’s listening is now threaded, irreversible. Agency is accumulative rather than explosive: photograph, haul, speak “not loud,” each step paid in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—save the rope-knowledge—signalled early; pressure escalates when council deadline is spoken, narrowing time. Agency: collector’s coaxing and fisherman’s acceptance foreclose the path of passive loss; price is undeclared dock demolition still looming. One meaningful tightening (tar bead reveals seed) suffices for 700-word scale.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake— composing living obituaries to spare waiting grief—tightens when Mira asks for hers, then again when the narrator must write his own; each step forecloses the option to remain a detached observer. Agency is accumulative: every drafted obituary adds weight to the thread-map until staying becomes the only credible stance. Visible price: the narrator’s own absence is filed under Compassion, a lifelong tithe. One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“reawaken beauty in a mechanical world”—is signaled early and tightens when the Keepers’ demand forces a visible trade-off: refusal risks palace-wide rupture. Escalation is textural: each piston sigh adds density until the hatchling’s song flips the calibration metronome. Cost is legible when the prince admits the bird “bore the same compromise as me,” foreclosing purity. Agency remains his even during palace-quake; no coincidence resolves the standoff.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—prove scars can sing—tightens as each successful graft narrows the risk of silence; the boy’s burn scar personalizes the test. One meaningful escalation: the coin’s first whisper from a charred trunk proves the method, shifting her from private ritual to communal instruction. Cost is paid in relinquishing the coin and in the perpetual vigilance the singing trunks will require. Agency is continuous; every splice is an on-page decision that could fail.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—how to transmit light without scorch—is signaled early and tightens when the stranger’s burned gear foreshadows failure. Agency: the narrator’s choice to mesh both gears into a new orbit is a single decisive escalation that rewrites garden protocol; failure risk is palpable. Cost is dramatized: relinquishing exclusive lineage caretaking, audible in gears’ “low arithmetic” song. Under Accumulative lens, pattern intensifies from solo tending to shared constellation, narrowing future options to collaborative transit only.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—shape a single sheltering stone for many losses—is signaled early and tightens through each ribbon intersection; the meaningful deepening occurs when the grandmother’s poem instructs him to loosen rather than tighten, foreclosing the option of a sealed monument. Cost is legible: the stone must accept hollows, the braid must fall open, the town must live with permeable grief. Accumulative escalation suffices under the chosen lens; no antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—restoring communal temporal balance—tightens through each pellet decision; the meaningful turn is replacing three, removing two, which audibly slims the bell tone. Escalation is accumulative: every confession read → pellet moved → bob weight shifts; the final sound is the irrevocable cost. No antagonist needed; pressure is the literal drag of unrepented shot. The tightening forces stance crystallization: keep the last two, endure the heavier swing, foreclose perfect absolution.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“will the city accept a constraint-respecting forecast?”—is signaled early and tightens once when the Council’s fear is counter-modeled. The meaningful turn is the speaker’s refusal to deliver certainty, which forecloses the Council’s preferred path and carries civic risk. Cost is conceptual but legible: future openness itself. No visible resource loss keeps it from 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—keep the pirate song alive long enough to teach dust speech—is signaled in paragraph three and tightens when searchlights comb the orchard, forcing the unshawled reply that exposes Mara. Accumulative escalation: each broadcast layer adds silhouettes, elders, forests, widening the square until the law must notice. Visible price: the named ridge invites patrols; the final open-air transmission is irreversible. Agency is steady rather than explosive, but the cost is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—can the scatterer hold and then release the emotion without collapse—is signaled early and tightened by each strip of paper that approaches the bowl. The burn is the single decisive intensification; it forecloses the option of preservation and makes the impermanence rule visceral. Cost is legible in the flinch-nod Soren gives and in the gray that “will not heal yet.” Enough to enter high band, though a second micro-cost would have lifted it into 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—memory vs. erasure via functional time—signals early and tightens when both factions demand the cog. Agency: copying ledger for enemies while withholding the heart-part turns spare parts into pedagogy. No external antagonist needed; pressure is conceptual and tidal. Cost visible: nightly submersion erodes lungs, final image of possible endless submersion keeps price alive.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—can enemy neighbors sing together?—is signaled early and tightens when the mechanic’s triggered voice leaps. One meaningful deepening: the rosette’s nick pivots fear into shared breath, narrowing options to mutual song or retreat. Cost is visible (they stay, sing, and the street still curses) yet the price remains collective; an individual forfeiture (silence, pride, or a physical token) would have sharpened the edge for an 8.8+ entry.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—restore wonder to mornings—is signaled early and tightened when drones stay catatonic. Agency: the keeper’s decision to open the panel and wind brass hum directly enables recovery; cost is the exposure of his secret treasury. Escalation is single but meaningful; no redundant reversals. Coincidence is absent; pressure coherent under lyrical causal lens.</question>
    <question>5</question><grade>8.3</question><comment>Theme—wonder as non-negotiable currency—emerges through images of harp song, bee hum, and story-toll, never abstract assertion. Subtext in Mara’s laugh “without relief” crystallizes lingering fragility. Final image of practicing astonishment offers resonant non-literal answer. One soft echo: “preserve wonder in routine” drifts toward thesis-statement; rescued by immediate sensory follow-up.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—can attention re-animate a house?—is signaled early and tightens through each object’s right-placement. The meaningful deepening occurs when the photo falls: the house’s past couple now Literalizes the risk of failed occupancy, narrowing the narrator’s options to “return what I can, and ask the rest.” Agency remains interior—no external antagonist—so escalation is accretive, not causal, but the cost (accepting partial failure) is legible. Enough for high-band, though a sharper external constraint could have pushed higher.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—free the city from lethal certainty—signals early and tightens once: the ampoule’s release irreversibly softens statues. Agency is mostly interior threading, but the narrator’s decision to ask the bishop to open his hands is a visible beat that narrows options. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral: the city’s “certainties unbraided” is legible but not felt on the body. Sufficient for this accumulative design, though not razor-sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—perpetual penance versus the chance to step off—is signaled early and tightens through each “lemma” ascent. No visible resource is lost, but the accumulation of attention-as-fuel generates an abstract price; the rupture offers a live option yet he keeps climbing, a credible renunciation under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—prove kindness is memorable—tightens when each stranger’s recognition triggers a reciprocal gift that increases Anya’s obligation to keep the door open. The meaningful deepening occurs at the janitor’s unasked refill: the system now sustains itself, narrowing her option to ever close. Cost is legible in her dawn exhaustion and the ledger’s evidence of sleepless labor. No reversal, but the accumulative pressure under Accumulative/Textural lens is sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—retrieve sister from storm-death—is tightened when the lens inhales light and time slows to expose her outline; option to “rewrite the storm” is foreclosed, replaced by rendezvous inside reversed grammar. Cost is legible: he forfeits linear life, nightly feeding the stone one year of regret. Agency drives every beat; no coincidence rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—own the erased face long enough to bait fear—tightens when the narrator risks literal exposure inside the booth. Agency is renunciation: the confession empties the predator of blood, foreclosing the old adoration. Cost is visible in the warmed strip that now carries the reader’s hand-print. Escalation is accumulative rather than causal, but the pink flash delivers the decisive intensification required under this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—“will the ring break?”—is signaled early; escalation is density-driven: each fractal strike thickens the acoustic mesh until the wave “applauds.” Cost is present but conceptual (energy spent, not limb lost), so price is felt yet thin. No live option is foreclosed; the wave could have passed un-dubbed without permanent loss, so tightening is moderate. Agency is pure performance; the swell’s compliance feels consenting rather than compelled, softening risk.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will the city remain blind?—is signaled in line 1 and escalates when the protagonist forces the gate. One meaningful tightening: watchers’ glare-hexagons reveal the expedition’s assimilation, foreclosing rescue and shifting goal to guidance. Protagonist’s agency drives every turn; no coincidence resolves. Visible cost: teacher lost, gate irreparably breached, personal dread repurposed as communal map.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—rescuing truth from the pit—signals in paragraph 1 and tightens when Tomas warns “you will blister the town.” One meaningful turn: Tomas shifts from guardian of the lie to co-witness, narrowing Mara’s options from solo digger to communal reckoning. Cost is legible but displaced onto the town (fear of the west stair) rather than Mara; her personal stakes plateau. Escalation is coherent under Causal lens, yet the absence of a price paid by the protagonist keeps it sub-8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—rescue memory from erasure—is signaled early and deepens as each note is mortared; the tide’s return supplies escalating inevitability. No live antagonist, but the archival water acts as coherent pressure, narrowing the hour when mortar is wet. Visible cost is the masons’ departure and the narrator’s burnt fingertips—small but felt. The tightening is single-cycle; once the last stone is sealed, options do not further narrow, keeping escalation just shy of top band.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—restore truth without becoming the revenge he disavows—is signaled early and tightened when the smooth-crescent forgeries point to the family-linked judge. One meaningful deepening: the indexer re-orders ledgers by image rather than alphabet, narrowing options to moral, not clerical, logic. Cost is present but muted: the personal vindication stays shelved, the public exposure deferred—an intellectual rather than visceral price.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: transmute blinding grief into liftable weight. Escalation accrues through lantern-load of stones and cranes; each act forecloses time/stamina. Final tightening: releasing the cranes costs the treasured paper memories, paid on page. Agency remains interior but causal under Accumulative lens; no reversal, yet options narrow to accept/decline final surrender of cranes.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—refusal to commodify trauma—signals early and tightens once: the valley deepens, grant pressure looms, then the note seals forfeiture. Agency resides in the protagonists’ decision to damp at instability’s edge and lock access; no coincidence resolves. Cost is legible—career fallout, sleepless drift, the geode left as guardian. Escalation is single but sufficient; a second reversal would overstuff this lyric frame.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“decode the frequency of belonging”—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens when the chip’s inability to form letters forecloses a literal alphabet solution. The meaningful turn is the pilot’s recalibration: starlight must ink the pauses, not the consonants. Cost is visible—pilgrim must become the blank center, pilot must trade certainty for silence. Escalation is single-cycle but sufficient for this length; no reversal, yet options narrow credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—own erased identity—signals early via “weight of a withheld truth that anchors my own name.” Pressure tightens when driftwood forces recognition that three, not one, children fled: his ledger crime boomerangs. The final choice—to wait on the terrace without selling further silence—forecloses the market path with visible self-cost. Escalation is single but sufficient under Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—keeping neutral ground alive—tightens when Daro withholds crossing; negotiator’s demand for named apology narrows options and raises social cost. One meaningful deepening suffices; price is legible in the mothers’ still-blinking blame and his own chest holding their breath.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can I face my sister and confess—tightens once: the paddle becomes the slow courtroom of admission. Escalation is situational but coherent: each stroke translates guilt into motion, poles mark inevitable proximity. Cost is legible: leaving the kayak behind signals the end of retreat. No second reversal, but one meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“kindle empathy where none remains”—tightens when confession becomes literal currency; the lake’s receipt system forecloses lying without paying story. One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens: each luminous ripple increases density of moral cost until fountain release. Agency is renunciation rather than victory; price is visibly felt. No secondary reversal required; score reflects single but powerful reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“become what hears you best”—is signalled in the cookie fortune and tightens when each spice inhalation narrows the option of staying human. Pressure escalates through accretion: every beast arrival heightens the cost of refusal (bones ache, throat feathers). Visible price is paid on-page: the protagonist forfeits human form and single name, foreclosing return. No outside coincidence; ember-lover’s arrival is earned by the spice road the narrator built.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—recover lost minutes to repay newborn time-debt—is signaled in line 4. Escalation is textural: each captured minute tightens the cloth until it warms, a physical tightening the narrator feels. No antagonist needed; pressure is the finite ravine of chimes running dry. Cost is legible: she forfeits her ancestral brooch and her “perplexed” safety net, accepting a future of accountable hours.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—open the dimension without violence—tightens when the door puckers like scar tissue, resisting tenderness. One meaningful reversal: the narrator momentarily sees why the warhead argued, feels the seduction of force, then renounces it, foreclosing that path forever. Cost is visible: blood drop, forgiven memories left threaded in the plates, perpetual obligation to “keep doing the work.” Pressure escalates under pacifist lens; no coincidence resolves the lock.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can attention alone save a life?—is signaled in para 1 and tightened when the tide’s ceremonial withdrawal exposes the cave door. One meaningful deepening: the hush shifts from ambient mystery to active instruction (“pages” telling her fire has mouths, water has doors). Protagonist agency drives every beat; luck complicates (neighbors appear) but Mara’s earlier seeding enables the convergence. Cost is visible—she spends her last coins, empties her constellations, and accepts erasure as the price of transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“silent revolution that would light bread ovens”—is signaled early and tightened when the wheel’s one missing bridge forces the sacrifice of the bronze quill. Protagonist’s agency drives every beat: inventory ruse, seam press, bridge improvisation. Price is visible—the quill gone, the fort’s loyalty compromised—yet escalation plateaus after the lanterns revive; no further obstacle raises the personal cost to the sentinel. Sufficient for length, but a final guard confrontation could have pushed higher.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—keep the shore from sliding—tightens when each mathematical sequence fails until the promise is spoken jointly; the dust’s shift from shine to weight marks a visible price that forecloses the option of solitary ritual. One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—voice versus erasure—signals in paragraph 1 and tightens each time the timer clicks. The meaningful deepening is the revelation that storm-scars can be photographed and timed; this reframes Ilya’s private redaction as part of a mappable sky-complicity, narrowing his options to public speech. Agency is crystallized in the final act: he elects to read aloud while lightning writes overhead, paying the price of exposure. Cost is felt on-page—“the silence that followed was not empty”—meeting the 8+ bar; could have hit 8.8 if a persistent physical constraint (e.g., timer running out of spring) had directly imperilled the reading.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—deliver the overture unbloodied—faces immediate test when “courier” demands the card at blade-point. Escalation is situational but coherent: each parry sharpens the ethical cost of violence; the refusal to wound tightens the no-violence constraint. The micro-turn (laugh → wrist wobble → sleeve tear) crystallizes stance, foreclosing solo mission and opening shared path. Price is on-page: torn sleeve, surrendered secrecy, inked palm—options narrowed, not expanded.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—keep the library alive under neon threats—is signaled in line 4. Pressure tightens when patrol car prowls past; option set narrows to stay or quit, and they stay. Visible price: trespass citation risk, sleeplessness, perpetual impermanence. No coincidence resolves; community arrives by accretion, not miracle.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—can he re-tune the hour of Mara’s absence—tightens when the minute hand vibrates the bench and the corridor ghosts approach. Price is legible: the arbor “leans” and later dissolves, implying the path will close again. Would enter 8.8+ if the text named what is forfeited (future access? stamina?).

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—save cultural memory before monsoon—signals early and tightens via the ticking storm. One meaningful deepening occurs when the reef-treaty fragment is spoken aloud, reweighting failure cost. Agency is partly externalized (island “tests” bodies), blurring protagonist-driven escalation; price is conceptual rather than viscerally felt. Still, the monsoon’s arrival coincides with the sapling burst, giving visible consequence to the ritual success.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—release the unsaid apology—tightens once: from withheld syllables to blue diffusion. Escalation is accumulative: each berry crushed, each needle shift, increases emotional density rather than causal reversals. Visible price: the stain that cannot be unstained. Agency remains decision/renunciation rather than confrontation, fitting lyric design.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—rebuilding with integrity amid loss—is signaled early and tightens through the protagonist’s agency: choosing which orchids to save, which panes to replace, rejecting motors for hand fans. The meaningful deepening occurs when decay shifts from enemy to “partner,” altering tactics (composting the dead to feed survivors). Cost is unmistakable: drowned notebooks, brine-killed blooms, half-light reopening. Escalation adheres to the Accumulative lens—pressure builds via layered debris (physical and emotional), not external antagonism.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—discovering why art was targeted—tightens when the ledger’s “arithmetic” reveals smuggling was cover for a sanctuary. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing to retrace the route, read frost, enter the chamber, and restart the kiln. Cost is unmistakable: the “attempt on my life,” ruined studio, and ongoing secrecy. The deepening—learning the kiln traded “heat for meaning”—forces a trade-off between public furnace and clandestine refuge, crystallizing stance in Charged Poise at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—translating silence into music before memory “cools into stone”—tightens when the city requests the bell’s rectification, forcing public vulnerability. Agency drives escalation: the narrator codes thermals, Sura traces staves, together they “rectify” the bell via communal warmth. Cost is unmistakable: panic mapped as weatherfronts, tears steaming glass, boot-prints as “printed ovation.” The fisherman’s kelp coil confirms survival’s ongoing price—“you are still underway.”

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—giving rest a permanent address—is signaled early and tightens when the lens reveals the drowned’s signals are ricocheting uselessly. The undertaker’s agency drives escalation: his stubbornness compels the descent, and his method of “occupying impossible spaces” alters tactics under pressure. Cost is unmistakable—he trades his solitude for shared address, and the city claims him. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—survival through anonymous intergenerational support—tightens when Noor’s accusation forces Mara to braid routes, foreclosing individual recognition. Agency drives escalation: Mara’s plan transforms conflict into shared labor, with visible cost (carrying each other’s burdens “like fire in a steady lamp”). Sanctions create coherent pressure (“sound travels dangerously”), and the watchers’ threat sharpens moral calculus—praise risks lives. The deepening isn’t abstract; it’s tactile (flour chits, insulin vials) and culminates in the bell’s near-empty state at dawn, proving sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake (“find where unused love is stored”) tightens decisively when the protagonist realizes it “pools in the ribs” and must be spent as “attentive kindness.” Agency is breath itself—shallow breath thins the image to “sorrow line,” full breath blooms shadows to reveal “a hand waiting.” The cost is legible: enduring the ache of unspent love until breath transforms it into light. Friend’s sparks don’t resolve conflict but pressure the protagonist to deepen exposure, making escalation driven by internal choice under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—discovering time’s texture—is signaled early and tightens when the halo fragment forces confrontation with the garden’s recursive past. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to follow negative curves, place the shard on cambium, and release the photographs. Cost is unmistakable—the fading images, the groaning root, the loss of archival memory—and reweights the final stance. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—planting resilience against drought and archival erasure—is signaled early and tightens when Collectors arrive, forcing the protagonist to choose between hoarding salvation or distributing it. The meaningful deepening occurs when the arrow’s fletching “counts” keys, transforming passive inheritance into active decoding. Cost is unmistakable: the chain becomes both anchor and offering, and the protagonist risks capture to ensure seeds outlive secrecy. Escalation stems from protagonist agency under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—finding “the sound of trust breaking”—tightens when the device confuses wonder (aurora) with fracture, forcing the forge solution. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing to burn the oilskin note transforms abstract memory into measurable “whitening hiss.” Cost is visible in the father’s silence and the aid’s cold honesty—no reconciliation, only calibrated awareness. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each collected absence sharpens the spectral notch until retreat becomes audible.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—whether to steal or surrender illuminated moments—is signaled early and tightens when the bouquet warns of reflections. Protagonist agency drives escalation: he reinterprets the code, chooses proximity over capture, and stays. Cost is unmistakable: relinquishing his thief identity (“camera remained capped”) to enable his past self’s choice. The stakes deepen morally—light isn’t taken but redistributed like tides.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—crafting inquiry-safe spaces—is signaled early and tightens via protagonist agency: she chooses patience over defensiveness, narration over silence. Deepening occurs when generator coughs; instead of abandoning, she sings, recommitting to shared heat. Cost is felt in physical hardship and emotional exposure (“Who benefits when heat is hoarded?”). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—drips, breaths, thaws accumulate toward Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming authorship of one’s body and narrative—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the narrator chooses vulnerability over escape. Protagonist agency drives escalation: decrypting the cast, luring Kellan, rigging the projector. Cost is unmistakable: “ruin us both” accepted as price for truth. The trapdoor isn’t luck—it’s tactical use of learned “safe tiles,” making pressure coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—mapping an endless night before it swallows the coast—is signaled early and deepens through protagonist agency. The scribe’s shift from rigid lines to “pauses between breaths” narrows options: he abandons traditional cartography for oracular listening. Cost is visible—the flaking booklet sheds flakes like “snow from a gold winter,” each loss marking a harbor. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: silence gains texture, then rooms, then navigability. The oracle’s arrival complicates but doesn’t resolve; the commander’s question (“Will it lead us out?”) sharpens the thematic trade-off between escape and endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—tracking the origin of thought through maintenance—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: each loop tightens pressure as quotas threaten listening, forcing the janitor to slow deliberately. The meaningful turn occurs when bowing the violin triggers staticky feeds, narrowing options to either compliance or quiet rebellion. Cost is unmistakable: haste causes the violin to crack, linking civic fear to personal failure. Escalation adheres strictly to the Accumulative lens with one decisive intensification per loop.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—thawing mistrust through transparency—is signaled early and tightens when the registrar chooses exposure over concealment. Agency drives escalation: retrieving the lens, projecting the doodles, placing the frame. Cost is unmistakable: both characters risk professional ruin and personal shame. The deepening occurs when the registrar recognizes their own complicity, making Rell’s surrender feel reciprocal rather than coincidental.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—proving reciprocal knowledge between gardener and garden—is signaled early and deepens when the Auditor challenges it. The gardener’s agency drives escalation: he confesses deception but reframes it as pedagogy for the vines. Cost is felt (social dismissal, bodily decay) and visible in the Auditor’s disbelief-turned-measurement. Tightening occurs when the maze itself becomes judge, foreclosing the Auditor’s authority through spatial rejection.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—proving sideways time—is signaled early and tightens when Hale risks the flock’s dreams to pin the nexus. His agency drives escalation: pulling the lever deepens the field, but easing it back forecloses data for ethical care. Cost is unmistakable: the “grease under his nails” marks sacrifice of pure proof for relational integrity. Coincidence never resolves; pressure stems from Hale’s obsession versus Sera’s caution, crystallizing in the lever’s calibrated breath.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—listening to what others ignore—escalates from private ritual to public intervention. The tightening occurs when the program’s second message (“mezzanine fails… open north exit”) forces agency. Protagonist’s disruption is earned, not lucky; cost is emotional isolation amid collective relief. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each ripple, stain, and harmonic deepens the imperative to act.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—truth versus safety—is signaled early and tightens when the narrator admits withholding avalanche warnings. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing to consult the oracle, then to weigh the smudge, then to broadcast the warning. Cost is unmistakable: social backlash (“curses up the mountain”) and reopened grief. The “swallowed truth” isn’t resolved abstractly—it forces a concrete, costly declaration that alters valley lives *now*, not yesterday.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the weight of paternal erasure—is signaled early and deepens via the ledger’s revelation. Protagonist agency drives escalation: interpreting calls leads to the tunnel, turning the wheel releases evidence. Cost is unmistakable: inheriting a silenced history that “bent my life sideways.” The “factory ghost shift” isn’t coincidence—it’s systemic pressure that forecloses truth, paid for in decades of maternal silence and personal recklessness.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—witnessing change without judgment—tightens when the city cracks and refugees arrive, forcing the keeper to balance non-judgment with active tending. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: choosing to reinforce the swan, lead groups to the refuge, plant cuttings in spines. Cost is unmistakable: sleeves unravel into binding thread, hands learn to balance as the world buckles. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each refugee’s breath deepens the library’s purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restoring Felix’s voice without coercion—is signaled early and deepens via the eclipse’s temporal pressure. The therapist’s renunciation of force (“not to force sound”) forecloses easy solutions, raising emotional cost. Agency resides in attention and invitation, not intervention, fitting the Accumulative lens. However, external pressure (eclipse) slightly overshadows interpersonal tension; the town’s presence uphill remains underutilized as counterpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recovering what the world forgot—is signaled early and escalates texturally: from listening to walls, to reading ash, to coaxing vibrations free. The meaningful deepening occurs when the silo “offered a long unbroken account,” narrowing his task to transcription. Cost is visible: carbon dust becomes “new fingerprints,” and sleep’s loss is tied to the axis shift. Though pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, the escalation relies more on revelation than active choice—his agency is receptive rather than decisive, slightly softening the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—transposing communal life from minor to major key via open secrets—is signaled early and deepens through orchestrated arrivals. Mei’s agency drives escalation: she seeds fortunes, tapes slips, and chooses flow, narrowing options until truth must be sung aloud. Cost is unmistakable—the constable surrenders his badge-as-door, the teacher exposes her ledger of mercy. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens with one decisive intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—resisting possession through rhetorical engagement—is signaled early and deepens via Ruan’s anaphora and antithesis. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: each looped question narrows the demon’s ontological footing. Cost is unmistakable: Mara’s voice thins, the palette pulls back, and only after the final question (“what will you ask tomorrow?”) does the entity loosen. The tightening forecloses the path of total control with emotional and metaphysical price.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—translating silence into symphony before exhaustion—tightens relentlessly via protagonist agency: climbing, tracing, cueing memories as compositional acts. Each deepening (frost as violin, timpani from ice, brass as glints) narrows options toward the finale’s “smallest circle.” Cost is unmistakable: breath withheld, self subsumed, time foreclosed (“before exhaustion hits”). Escalation follows Accumulative lens—density of sensory-musical correspondences intensifies until the tower’s ribs shake with “no-sound,” proving stakes are viscerally felt, not declared.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—conquering the labyrinth of self—is signaled early and tightens via protagonist agency: retracing steps, reflecting/rotating/inverting, choosing the weakest echo. Each escalation forecloses options (e.g., dissolving alternate selves) and carries cost (loss of floating, surrender of eternal recurrence). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—density increases as arches multiply, timelines fracture, and temperature drops—culminating in the decisive renunciation of resistance. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from Lio’s ritualized choices.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—defeating emotional numbness—is signaled immediately and tightens through one decisive deepening: the backward tape’s ripples force Lena to confront grief’s doorway rather than flee it. Agency manifests as attention and endurance; her choice to keep hands on the drum after the tape ends forecloses passivity with felt cost (vulnerability before students). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each object interaction (needle, filament, drum) narrows emotional options until restraint becomes the only viable path to feeling. Cost is unmistakable in the “timid bird warming its own egg”—a fragile, earned hope.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—delivering unowned truth amid surveillance—is signaled early and tightens when the follower reveals personal stakes (her brother in the red zone). Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing lateral progression, assigning roles, waiting rather than chasing. Cost is unmistakable: comfort sacrificed, solitude risked, safety foregone. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, deepening via shared plan that reconfigures isolation into calibrated alliance.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether grief can be purified through controlled scent—is signaled early and deepens when the violet’s breath merges with the vial’s. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: his caution, then surrender, forces a reconfiguration of memory’s role in mourning. Cost is unmistakable: he trades illusion for raw truth, felt in the “door swing behind my cheekbones.” Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—density of aromatic detail tightens until the seam opens, irrevocably.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—discovering time’s texture—is signaled early and deepens when the energy beings demand the map. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing to braid rather than trade or surrender reconfigures options. Cost is unmistakable: loss of the “grammar” risks traveling “blind,” yet the poet accepts this for compassionate ethics. The “impossible choice” crystallizes under pressure without coincidence resolving it.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reviving sound in a hushed world—is signaled early and tightens when the boy brings charred driftwood, forcing communal action. Mara’s agency drives escalation: her choice to “refuse perfection” cracks the hush. Cost is unmistakable—the bell is scarred, tongueless; storytelling is “adopted, patched, and new.” Pressure accumulates texturally, not causally, but the lens justifies it.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—crafting counterfeit courage without drowning in real grief—is signaled early and deepens when Liora confesses she “perfected molecules to avoid imperfect mourning.” Protagonist agency drives escalation: he wires the petal, selects the orris accord, threads her confession into the blend. Cost is unmistakable: her fear “hung from her lashes,” his static leaves him “uncarved again.” The tightening forecloses embalming-in-grief; instead, channeling becomes the only viable path.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—validating unseen labor—is signaled early (“private mission to uplift silent contributors”) and tightens when the ledger shifts from idea to action (“pledged logistics”). Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: tracing the locket, gathering stories, initiating cards. Cost is legible in “cautious exuberance” and the choice of “letters over trumpets.” Coincidence (misdelivered envelope) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from sustained effort.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—belonging vs. solitude—tightens through the shared search, which demands mutual vulnerability. Protagonist agency drives escalation: offering reeds, storytelling, weaving the bench. Cost is unmistakable in the dawn-lit dedication: anonymity surrendered, future entangled with community. The street artist’s tag functions as communal litmus test, not coincidence—its discovery hinges on joint attention, making acceptance conditional on participation.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—capturing an echo without waking the giant—is signaled early and tightens when the protagonist borrows time to uncage slack-water, risking immediate collapse of her “miscounted ledger.” Agency drives escalation: her choice to lift the sluice creates the “interrupted cadence” that births the echo, and releasing it crystallizes her stance. Cost is unmistakable: future “clumsy pauses” and the giant’s continental twitch that “tilts puddles.” Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, deepening via rhythmic disruption rather than external opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding emotion’s mathematics through absence—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: he chooses to read reflections as equations, hums to provoke stalactite answers, and ultimately speaks the theorem as lullaby. The meaningful tightening occurs when stalactites slow “as if the stone were breathing in,” forcing reconfiguration of method into mercy. Cost is unmistakable: accepting feral equations that “gnaw at boundaries where proof dissolves into ache.” Coincidence never resolves; the apprentice’s appearance stems from ritual precision, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—visibility for those in need—is signaled early and deepens when the narrator follows a human hum into iron. Agency drives escalation: choosing to retrieve, restore, and place the fragment despite personal invisibility. Cost is visible in the chewed tape, the hidden recorder, and the risk of exposure. The outage tightens time, forcing action before routine returns—pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens with one decisive intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—mastery vs. stewardship—is signaled early and deepens through the narrator’s agency: they choose to mark leaf landings, widen swales, stop stripping moss. The gale forces a climactic test where holding the posts proves their new stance. Cost is unmistakable: lost seedlings, fewer customers, emotional vulnerability (“my honesty is awkward”). Escalation follows Accumulative logic—pressure intensifies through repeated storms and Theo’s quiet provocations—culminating in a reconfigured relationship to uncertainty that forecloses old rigidity.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—recovering hydrological wisdom lost in war—is signaled early and deepens when the brooch points inland. Pressure escalates through protagonist agency: he aligns circles with wet patterns, follows drips that become currents, hauls the cylinder. Cost is visible in the lacquer-rotten cylinder and kelp-scab string, symbolizing decayed trust now reclaimed. The tightening forecloses machine-dependent flood control, forcing communal, land-based alternatives.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—magnifying everyday magic—is signaled early and deepens via the pilgrim’s promise about sweeping as cathedral. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: placing the pearl, humming the vowel, inviting the shadow. Cost is unmistakable: the clairvoyant surrenders omniscience, and the cave itself yields its unpredictability to host a new resonance. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure crescendos texturally, not causally, but with undeniable consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—compiling fragments into meaning—is signaled early and deepens when the valve reframes silence as warning, not betrayal. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: choosing to carry the valve, fit it, wait rather than blow. Cost is unmistakable: exile was caused by misreading absence, and now rebuilding requires accepting that “ending it is a practice.” Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each testimonial, ledger entry, and staggered interval tightens the thematic screw without false resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—confronting one’s own unspoken truths—is signaled early and tightens when the mapper shifts from charting others’ paths to offering personal confessions. Agency drives escalation: each secret offered alters the punch’s function and brightens the vault. Cost is unmistakable (“the night my father choked on his apology”) and culminates in a trade—silence for connection—that reweights the mapper’s identity. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens with one decisive deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—sculpting space that holds painful truth without suffocation—is signaled early and deepens when the open squares demand avoided memories. Agency drives escalation: protagonist chooses to climb first, insists on including winter’s anger, offers their own regret. Cost is felt: emotional exposure, irreversible honesty. Coincidence (whales) complicates but doesn’t resolve—their moans guide rhythm, not plot.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—discovering what lies after goodbye—is signaled early and tightened when the fragment’s negations force spatial treason. Protagonist agency drives escalation: inviting Mara’s double-cross *because* “mutiny needs witnesses.” Cost is unmistakable: immortality exchanged for passage, rendered in the braid cooling and bones sighing open. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens—each auroral pulse intensifies magnetic dialogue until adjacency collapses.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—delivering Yusef safely—is signaled early and deepens when patrol lights “taste the glass.” The tightening occurs at the alley threshold: breath vs. paperwork, truth vs. habit. Protagonist agency drives escalation through “waiting actively,” and cost is paid in swallowed defiance. Officers’ hesitation isn’t luck—it’s earned by rehearsed grief.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving ephemeral time against erasure—is signaled early and deepens through the lamp’s hum variations, which narrow the protagonist’s tactics to meticulous notation. Agency manifests as endurance: choosing restraint over shouting when paper arrives, whispering to bark during power failures. Cost is visible in forfeited connection (empty kiosk) and emotional labor (inventing histories), though escalation leans textural rather than causal, slightly limiting pressure intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—validating erased existence through unofficial archives—is signaled early and deepens when the clerk declares the past “corrected.” Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing to layer whispers into maps, then teaching the woman to “build our own ears from rust,” transforms passive survival into active resistance. Cost is visible in forfeited institutional recourse and emotional toll (“cold arrangement of causes”). The tide’s rhythm tightens decisions organically—no coincidence resolves; instead, pressure compounds through communal listening.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—decoding whether stories can bear ordinary hands—is signaled early and deepens when the narrator shifts from testing myths to healing silence. The tightening occurs when the ephemeral compass points not outward but inward, forcing confrontation with avoided memory. Agency drives escalation: humming, aligning the shell, speaking the apology—all choices narrow options and incur emotional cost, crystallizing in the realization that certainty is a boat that never docks.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—navigating gentrification without surrendering cultural soul—is signaled early and tightens when Yano and Miri confront the narrator at climax. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: decoding murals, drafting heron graffiti, climbing masts to reorganize floats. Cost is unmistakable: loss of financiers’ favor, strained trust, and the emotional toll of hopeful desperation. The pivot forecloses easy spectacle but preserves dignity—a trade-off with tangible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—capturing the last uncommodified dawn—is signaled early and escalates coherently as the consortium’s countdown nears. The protagonist’s agency drives every turn: smuggling a second mission, threading the paper strip, guessing exposure. Cost is unmistakable: the mentor’s message warns of “billboards” teaching “new names for light,” and the inspector pays with irreversible loss—after this shutter press, there is “no second last.” Pressure tightens not through external reversal but through the dawning hush itself, which forces a choice between documentation and surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—successful retrieval before the ship departs—is signaled early and tightens relentlessly via the anchor’s impending lift. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she interprets data, directs the drone, patches its wing, recalibrates frequencies—all under time pressure. The cost is felt in exhaustion (“limp in its left wing”), urgency (“anchor would not wait forever”), and the precision required to avoid error. Coincidence never resolves; every gain stems from her listening, tuning, and stitching. The deepening isn’t plot-based but perceptual: as light brightens, her map sharpens—pressure intensifies through sensory refinement, not external chaos.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—validating the singular convergence—is signaled early and tightens when the falcon lands, triggering irreversible action. Protagonist agency drives escalation: interpreting glass, rotating compass, scraping ice. Cost is unmistakable: physical endurance (“cold edits our bones”), social alienation (“no one else will believe”), and epistemic vulnerability (trusting a “joke too small” over institutional knowledge). The deepening occurs at the ice opening, where tranquility becomes threatening—a stance crystallization under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—restoring shared balance through rhythm—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: the narrator joins the walk, internalizes the cadence, and vows stewardship. Escalation occurs when the boy’s misstep threatens collapse, forcing the tuner to intervene—a tightening that narrows options to gentleness. Cost is unmistakable: rebuilding demands constant, collective attention (“rebuild it every dawn, together, step by step”). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—transmitting remembrance against oblivion—is signaled early and deepens when the distress beacon becomes “a bell in a cage.” Escalation is driven by agency: the diver stops kicking, breathes deliberately, and unsnarls knots by rejecting survival instinct. Cost is unmistakable: she trades oxygen and heat to stabilize the “fragile bridge” of signal. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies not through external threats but via internal recalibration—each measured breath narrowing options until only stillness remains viable.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—resisting the lazy truth that consumes the vulnerable—is signaled early and tightens when the narrator realizes “truth takes work.” Escalation is driven by agency: he threads his own story into the labyrinth, forcing the hush to pause. Cost is unmistakable: the missing were taken not by violence but by institutional credulity, and his new inheritance demands constant vigilance. The turning glass “faithful as a rumor kept warm” embodies the persistent constraint shaping every tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—repaying a transgenerational debt through resonant awakenings—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: tuning flasks, confessing silence, using the bead to mark rhythm. Each escalation (ghost’s teachings, dampening bead on graft scar) narrows options toward inevitable tending. Cost is unmistakable: “you would obey out of love and fear of failing her twice.”

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—carving a path from ruin to reverence—is signaled early and deepens through the protagonist’s agency: she chooses to follow ghostly arrows, pay attention, sew stone. Escalation occurs when the wall swallows the plate, demanding a new kind of mending. Cost is felt in the town’s collective loss and the council’s astonishment at rule-breaking. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, tightening via layered footfalls and palimpsest marks until the chamber exhales its truth.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—restoring faith fractured by exile—tightens when the protagonist shifts from passive curiosity to active rebuilding, foreclosing rootless temporality. Agency drives escalation: purposeful wandering yields shards, leading to the decisive act of setting the dial. Cost is unmistakable in the “lonely” bread of rushed exile versus the “door opening slowly” loaf baked by ancestral time. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each cataloged bead or root veil deepens the hunger for continuity.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—delivering Mira’s letter unbroken—tightens when scanners are revealed to “skim margins first,” forcing a decoy strategy. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: redrawing chalk, scripting alias in top margin, planting false street below. Cost is unmistakable: the narrator sacrifices mailing certainty for protective ambiguity, holding the future “in paper form” while breath is held. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—density of marginal details intensifies until the white space itself becomes the battlefield.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—disrupting the coup through misalignment—is signaled early and escalates via Tamsin’s agency. She deepens pressure by shifting one stitch, then two, forcing tangible consequences (bells toll wrong, gate wails early). Cost is unmistakable: she risks exposure, expends emotional labor (foolish jokes), and accepts partial failure (“the coup would still come”). Escalation stems from her method, not luck, under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—finding the moment before deciding—is signaled early and deepens when the protagonist chooses to stay rather than smoke, foreclosing escape with tactile cost (the splinter). Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: selecting the letter, stepping through the door, holding still for stitching. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, density increases through sensory layering and ritual acts until the hospital breath becomes wide as tide. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from embodied choice under emotional duress.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—securing Sifa’s safety amid competing claims—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the translator chooses which truths to deliver. Her agency drives escalation: decrypting the cast reweights options, forcing both sides to confront shared fears rather than blame. Cost is unmistakable: she bears the burden of omission (“not every truth heals”), and the constable/uncle/auntie triangle only softens because she withholds incendiary data. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each decoded note deepens moral complexity without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—rediscovering joy without museumifying ache—is signaled early and tightens when the fog begins “bleaching the boy,” forcing the protagonist’s decisive choice: spend joy until “the coin sings.” This deepening narrows options from preservation to release, with visible cost (erasure of the boy’s image). Agency drives escalation: she threads film, paints with light, then deliberately blurs the display. The knowledge network’s hum and crow’s judgment apply subtle pressure, but the core conflict remains internal—wanting to hold vs. needing to share—and culminates in a trade-off that reconfigures her entire method.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—exchanging certainty for curiosity—is signaled early and tightens through the protagonist’s refusal to force answers, culminating in the cost of accepting an “ordinary” reply. Escalation is driven by agency: toggling the console to filter tonality, clapping to guide echoes, signing with a hidden wave—all choices that narrow options (rejecting force, embracing invitation). The garden’s pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with each nested awakening deepening the cost of impatience, crystallized in the caption’s stern lesson about bewitching impatience “so the city did not rust.”

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving unbilled thought—tightens meaningfully when laughter becomes taxable, forcing timing over harmony. Protagonist agency drives escalation: planting message patterns, drafting replies in soil, guiding collectors into the sunflower maze. Cost is visible: the Notice of Arrears imposes penalties for “unfiled joy,” altering tactics toward organic obfuscation. While pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, the collectors’ retreat leans slightly on situational convenience (ants rising “like a rumor taking legs”) rather than purely protagonist-driven causality, preventing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—negotiating a blossom armistice—is signaled early and escalates through embodied pressure: red’s coughs, white’s sighs, thorn’s flint-click. Protagonist agency drives deepening: choosing honesty over prettiness, redefining proof as shared bloom. Cost is unmistakable—the Guard’s thorn-memory, old gardeners’ scarred catalogs—and culminates in vows that permit pruning but forbid exile. The wind’s ferrying role ensures stakes remain tactile, not abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving forgotten names—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the cracked chime reveals Aristea, forcing a trade-off: restore pure tone or retain the fracture that shelters fragile syllables. The caretaker’s agency drives escalation—her breath tunes the chime, her refusal to patch it becomes tactical. Cost is unmistakable: exhaustion, foxglove regret, collapsed rooms—but also earned light for new neighborhoods of sound. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; one deepening suffices and exceeds.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake (restoring trust through collaborative language) tightens via protagonist-driven deepening: each vow narrows options (e.g., “argue without abandoning”) and raises emotional cost (confessing vanishing). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—vows compound like musical counterpoint until the door “sighs.” The irreversible choice to prioritize “we” over solitary study forecloses the narrator’s old path with tangible loss (time, Mara’s wounded trust). Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from their spoken promises.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—harmonizing orchard needs and ancient habitat—is signaled early and tightens when the machinist deciphers the resin pattern, forcing a trade-off between rigid engineering and responsive rhythm. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her analysis of adhesive reshapes tactics, and the test of gates crystallizes stance. Cost is unmistakable—the farmer’s thumb on the chain feels a “ledger soften,” implying economic risk accepted for ecological care. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, deepening via material revelation rather than external threat.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—delivering untraceable messages to preserve lost songs—is signaled early and deepens when Ezra’s fear of digital tracking raises the cost. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to fly Thimble despite trauma, anchoring the capsule with the meteorite. Cost is unmistakable—the scuffed bird, the rattling reply—and the tightening forecloses his isolation, forcing him back into relational risk. Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens without reliance on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding why thresholds feel sacred—is signaled early and deepens through the protagonist’s agency: analyzing grain, matching codes to winds, standing at the cedar frame. The tightening occurs when they realize fog was chosen to “soften the world into meeting distance,” forcing a trade-off between longing and respect for necessary space. Cost is unmistakable: enduring the pain of delayed reunion to honor their father’s design. Escalation is driven entirely by protagonist’s choices under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—belonging—is signaled early and deepens when the generator falters, making the city “suddenly unreadable.” The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: they use the feather to “stir the plankton awake,” transforming passive listening into active co-creation. Cost is unmistakable—their vow to stay until sunrise becomes a permanent choice, trading freedom for reciprocity. The shared exhale ritual, introduced mid-story, narrows options: only synchronized breath elicits the city’s response, forcing collaboration over solitary observation.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—discovering why paths disappear—is signaled early and deepens into protecting soft stories while enabling passage. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: reading via seeds, singing to constellations, walking ghost-bridges. Each choice narrows options (e.g., accepting absence as necessary) and incurs conceptual cost: kindness must be hidden to survive, yet travelers still need guidance. The tightening culminates in a trade-off crystallized in the final compromise—half-visible, half-song—under coherent Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—orchestrating meaningful chance against monotony—tightens when the woman enters: her presence tests whether his “efficient wonder” can accommodate genuine reciprocity. His agency drives escalation: he proposes the game, cedes control of the bishop, accepts her wind/silence choices. Cost is felt in the chalk’s dissolution and his silent departure—art sacrificed to impermanence. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with each sensory detail (coin spin, ribbon lift) deepening thematic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—remembering without naming—is signaled early and deepens when the clerk arrives. The dancer’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to dance, to inscribe, to offer exile.

The tightening occurs in the unmade sentence where authority slips, narrowing options to complicity or continued forgetting.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—saving the atrium from chrome-brochure erasure—tightens when the harbor master arrives with demolition plans. Protagonist agency drives escalation: he doesn’t plead but weaponizes light, spilling spectra onto the ledger to expose broken promises. Cost is unmistakable: his silence risks irrelevance, yet the net mender’s healed pause proves his method’s worth. Coincidence (her arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the glazier’s ritual and craft force the reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—translating pain into universal language—is signaled early and tightens when Mira asks, “what language he wanted to speak.” Protagonist agency drives escalation: he chooses to open the box, name his bargain, and plant seeds. Cost is unmistakable: “owls fell silent,” innocence exchanged for time. The deepening crystallizes in his vow to teach rookies “how to listen for nests while saving roofs”—a trade-off that forecloses pure heroism.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes—revitalizing communal hope after spiritual depletion—are signaled early and escalate through protagonist-driven deepening: from solitary pattern-making to collective exchange. The tightening occurs when neighbors arrive and place charred oars or broken flutes, forcing a shift from individual conjecture to shared risk.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—whether to preserve or release traumatic echoes—is signaled early and deepens when the protagonist confronts her grandmother’s choice. Agency drives escalation: the hum recharts memory, transforming knocking into lull. Cost is unmistakable—the man’s face emerges, then dissolves; the burden becomes marrow, not law.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—persuading mirrors to show possibilities—is signaled early and deepens when Lio’s personal loss crystallizes the abstract into visceral need. The meaningful tightening occurs when the painter chooses to share the locket’s beat with Lio, risking emotional exposure (“Will you lend a beat too?”), which forecloses pure detachment. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: each lullaby, rainbow, and ripple intensifies communal investment until the bells force resolution. Cost is felt—not in material loss but in vulnerability exchanged and hope made communal rather than private.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—anchoring ideals in practice—is signaled early and deepens when the General names the negotiator’s past ambush. This revelation forces a trade-off: truth vs. function, memory vs. future. The negotiator’s agency drives escalation—he offers breath as bond, then the reed vow—narrowing his options irrevocably. Cost is unmistakable: twenty-seven silenced voices, a singer’s legacy, his own potential muteness. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens until steam braids the air and signatures blur like continents.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving echo over spectacle—is signaled early and deepens when the narrator rejects gala unveiling for “unpaid hush.” Pressure tightens causally: his sentimental act (hatching) forces a trade-off between profit and mercy, resolved in the “narrower grace” of timed releases. Cost is felt (“ledger has teeth”) and shapes tactics (selling access to fund care). Coincidence (thunder lull) complicates but doesn’t resolve; agency drives escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—defying the lullaby of conformity—is signaled early and escalates through Lira’s agency: she chooses which ribbon to untangle, which knot to tease. Each deepening (father’s false laugh, soldier’s silent hunger) narrows options until only the city’s great braid remains. Cost is unmistakable: her art risks irrelevance if she fails, and success burns softly in her hands. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—ethical storytelling—is signaled early and deepens when Aurel realizes he forgot consent. His agency drives escalation: recalling the troupe, drafting participatory rules, yielding narrative control. Cost is unmistakable: lost bravado, delayed premiere, and Ferro’s weary scrutiny (“weighing a coin he was tired of carrying”). The tightening forecloses unilateral authorship, replacing it with audience sovereignty—a trade-off paid in humility and shared labor.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—honoring overlooked histories through transient signals—is signaled early and deepens via the monarch’s arrival, which tests the protagonist’s method: can air-read structures guide the last migrant? The meaningful tightening occurs when the monarch “brushes the moth wing through glass,” forcing a choice between intervention (“tilt the triangle”) and restraint (“did not reach for him”), narrowing options to accompaniment alone. Cost is unmistakable: the “hush where a wing used to be” becomes navigable map only through surrender. Agency drives escalation—each knot, frame, and alignment is a tactical response to ecological loss under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving forgotten names before winter erases them—is signaled early and tightens when paper proves ephemeral, forcing shift to metal. Protagonist agency drives escalation: forgiving self enables entry, but purpose ignites action; threading market memory into rope law forces physical and emotional risk (“last braid and my guilt”). Cost is unmistakable: bronze-scarred finger steadies the final knot, shoulders ache from labor, and eternal vigil is accepted. The deepening—from survival guilt to active remembrance—narrows options to one irrevocable path: stay and listen.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—whether the path still wants the walker—is signaled early and deepens when the directive reveals itself as invitation needing “many signatures.” Protagonist agency drives escalation: interpreting dreams, cracking the seal, rewriting through footsteps. Cost is unmistakable in the shed identity and the collective risk of turning left “toward mercy.” The tightening from solitary seeker to communal walker forecloses isolation with resonant consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—sealing a covenant with the unknown via arithmetic piety—is signaled early and tightens when evidence leads to “a gesture of faith,” forcing empirical irony into action. The meaningful deepening occurs at the bronze eyelid: doubt pulls him back precisely because proof demands belief. Cost is unmistakable in his final vow to “ensure the palace never paid twice for darkness”—a renunciation of influence that crystallizes his stance under regime flux. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—releasing resentment to end war—is signaled early and deepens through bodily confrontation. Protagonist agency drives escalation: offering the box, touching Mara’s wrist, invoking cellular memory. Cost is unmistakable: Mara must reshape memory, not forget, and generals feel “quiet that did not belong to defeat.” Pressure tightens via sanctuary’s hush numbing weapons and reality’s tilt demanding recalibration.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—capturing the dream to restore warmth—is signaled early and deepens when Iren shifts from containment (“capture”) to coexistence (“let it lean near enough”). The meaningful tightening occurs when he turns mirrors outward, erasing container/contained boundaries—a choice that narrows options (no longer trapping) but raises emotional stakes (risking total loss). Cost is unmistakable: his solitary vigil becomes communal labor, trading control for connection. Escalation is driven by Iren’s agency under Accumulative pressure, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—mending what institutions abandon—is signaled early and deepens through the irrigation repair, which becomes a proxy for intergenerational care. Agency is exercised via the mender’s choice to “make do,” narrowing options from waiting for a committee to immediate, imperfect action. Cost is unmistakable: unpaid labor, emotional solitude, and the weight of “deciduous vows.” Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, with pressure tightening through dialogue and tactile problem-solving.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—whether to impose linear order on nonlinear time—is signaled early and tightens when the protagonist chooses “no choice except attention,” foreclosing the path of self-cataloging. The deepening occurs in the bathroom, where philosophical reflection alters tactics (repurposing the cameo). Cost is legible: inheritance demands surrender of fixed identity, paid when the protagonist accepts being both ancestor and heir. Agency drives every escalation; coincidence never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—accessing the library of unlearned lessons—is signaled early and tightens when the time traveler’s trapped doubts become physical walls. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: researching gaps, renegotiating contracts, writing apologies. The meaningful deepening occurs when the linguist confronts their own refusals (“catalogue of carefulness”), raising emotional stakes without coincidence. Cost is unmistakable: trading memory for access, bearing the weight of unsurrendered lessons.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—recovering forgotten names—is signaled early and deepens when the ship demands the twin’s presence, raising emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—translating confusion into clarity—is signaled early and tightens when the protagonist discovers the tower kept two schedules. The meaningful deepening occurs at the rope: merging timelines requires honoring both attempted and withheld histories, forcing a trade-off between correction and erasure. Agency drives escalation—the archivist reads patterns, traces fibers, reconfigures braids—and the cost (a vanished week, silenced bell) is felt in the town’s softened steps. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with each archival fragment narrowing interpretive options.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—finding quiet before storms crush tunnels—is signaled early and escalates through protagonist agency: reading cracks, pressing stone to ice, waiting until hush self-sustains.

The deepening occurs when energy beings reveal mutual need, transforming solitary duty into co-creation. Pressure tightens without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—proving meaning in coincidence—is signaled early and tightens when the first beam dies “like a swallowed word,” forcing Kera to deepen her method by syncing breath to memory. Agency drives escalation: she doesn’t wait for rescue but decodes the flare’s cadence as constellations “set upright and read,” then replies using the shard’s hush to steady the beam. Cost is unmistakable: years of solitary watch crystallize into one fragile thread of light; success demands surrender to vulnerability (“caution” tempers her leap). Coincidence complicates (wind pitch, moon’s lateness) but resolution stems from her retrocognitive labor, satisfying Situational lens pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—sculpting identity without breaking the communal vessel—is signaled early and deepens when the archivist tests her conjecture against the reefed air. Agency drives escalation: she chooses to speak fear and joy into the forecourt, triggering the city’s response. Cost is felt in the relinquishment (“I have carried too much alone”) and crystallized in the window that demands trust in future readers. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—defying hopelessness through fire—is signaled early and deepens when the keeper reveals children “count their breaths.” Pressure escalates via environmental constraints (wind, corridor acoustics) and emotional urgency (Mara’s vanished cousin), forcing Lio to adapt trajectories through ambient awareness, not calculation. The meaningful tightening occurs when silence is deemed “too loud,” shifting the goal from spectacle to sonic compassion. Cost is unmistakable: no stars return, yet courage replaces mimicry—a trade-off crystallized in the final silent burst.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether to stay or leave—is signaled early and deepens via the cicada’s symbolism and shared history. Pressure escalates through protagonist agency: cataloging thresholds, invoking mussel logic, reframing departure. The tightening (“cross this mouth of water… until footing names itself”) forecloses immediate resolution but affirms joint navigation, with emotional cost in exposed vulnerability (“fear my answer would spring like a trap”).

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—collecting silences to metabolize inherited fear—tightens via three pours that escalate from avoidance (gilded hush) to confrontation (bunker note). The meaningful deepening occurs when she stops separating sky from bunker, alloying them into “kinder quiet,” which forecloses her prior binary thinking at visible cost: enduring metallic panic to reach courage. Protagonist agency drives every turn—no coincidence resolves tension—and the hour’s elastic timeframe pressures each micro-choice. Stakes remain viscerally felt through embodied reactions (“throat rehearses panic”) rather than abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—can silence be taught to comfort?—is signaled early and deepens when the girl’s bell buckles the hush. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he catalyzes volume drops like a shepherd, coaxes curves past brittle sound, and invents a counting game to bridge grief. Cost is unmistakable: emotional labor (monitoring while storytelling), tactical sacrifice (avoiding efficient routes), and the weight of inherited sorrow. The storm glass knitting “spiky snow” visually externalizes rising pressure, making stakes visceral, not abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preventing algorithmic usurpation by sunrise—is signaled early and tightens via mural discoveries, drone countdown, and bodily fatigue (“knees learned again how to bow”). Agency is clear: Maris chooses to shave paint, trust the flake, enter the root-room. Cost is visible in ancestral ghosts, physical strain, and emotional toll (“chest hurt with nostalgia of a frontier”). Escalation is protagonist-driven under Accumulative lens: each peeled layer deepens knowledge and narrows path, culminating in radio-throne stewardship.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—teaching suffocating to breathe without surrendering destructive tools—is signaled early and deepens through the breathing exercise, where “staying felt like drowning disguised as patience.” Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: the Keeper chooses ritual over rescue, imposes structure (“In for four…”), and withholds knives while offering sound. Cost is unmistakable: the Keeper remains alone in “the place that is no place,” yet the emptiness now pulses with shared breath—a conceptual price paid in sustained solitude. Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens without reliance on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—transforming systemic pressure without replicating harm—is signaled early and deepens when the protagonist volunteers, narrowing options to bodily risk. Agency drives escalation: choosing the chamber, whispering the promise, cinching the bolt. Cost is unmistakable: emotional labor (“stubborn gratitude”), physical vulnerability (“bolt between my teeth”), and the ever-present debt that demands diamonds. The tightening crystallizes in the line: “none of us would climb by crushing.”

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—uncovering why the dynasty ended—is signaled early and deepens via standing waves that extract hidden history. Protagonist agency drives escalation: winding the crank, turning the handle-key, reading the plate. Each act narrows options (truth over throne) with felt cost: inherited noose, crumbled wax, revealed betrayal. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—density reweights legacy as burden, not birthright.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (“capture the shape of possibility”) is signaled early and deepens via protagonist-driven escalation: reading the program, aligning with the blueprint, choosing a lens among mirror pears. Cost is unmistakable—armor shed, old wars calmed, drums of war receding—and directly shapes tactics (e.g., sword angled to cast instructional shadows). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidental resolutions. The tightening occurs when he steps sideways, foreclosing other knightly paths with quiet finality.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving dignity amid institutional erasure—is signaled early and tightens when the archivist chooses to violate passive preservation (“the rulebook says I preserve, not intrude”) to return a memory. This deepening forecloses bureaucratic neutrality with felt cost: her heartbreak intensifies even as she acts. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens—each observation (dust drifts, thumb crescents) increases pressure until the button demands response. Coincidence (finding the envelope) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution comes through her deliberate packaging and logging.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving memory against state revision—is signaled early and tightens when the contact vanishes, forcing Jessa to act alone. Escalation is driven by her agency: she reads puddles, unlocks the hatch, jams floodlights, and floods the lagoon with truth. Each choice narrows options (e.g., losing the key) and carries cost (exposure, tool sacrifice). The squads’ “blank plates” embody the conceptual price of indifference, making stakes viscerally felt without abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—hushing a self-replicating prophecy—is signaled early and escalates through the saxophonist’s agency: first assembling the horn, then weaponizing silence via “negative space.” Cost is unmistakable: the prophecy names him, threatens a child’s erasure, and demands he sacrifice musical ego (“no tune will save us”). His final refusal forecloses easy heroism, accepting cyclical vigilance (“I will return… next season”) as the price of temporary mercy.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—decoding the arbor’s message before villages spill into fog—is signaled early and tightens when the Moonstone reveals “release, not store.” Fen’s agency drives escalation: he builds, listens, adjusts, then chooses to scatter seeds despite lifelong habit. Cost is unmistakable: his internal “towers” collapse, yet the arbor lifts, validating his sacrifice. Regional folklore’s warning gives the stakes teeth, making misreading catastrophic, not academic.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—replacing certainty with “uncertainly certain” rhythm—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the tinkerer chooses to follow coincidence. Agency drives escalation: his improvisation (screws as couplers, wire as tendon) directly enables the machine’s activation. Cost is unmistakable: he leaves the compass behind, forfeiting personal guidance to steward the city’s new time. Coincidence complicates (early letters, counterclockwise leaves) but never resolves; resolution stems from his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—redeeming Mira without miracles—is signaled early and deepens through the alchemist’s method: “exploring limits of what refuses to break completely.” Agency drives escalation: each act (annealing, hammering, inlaying) narrows options toward an Earned Stasis where redemption means truthful mending, not recovery. Cost is unmistakable: guilt as flux, hatred as weight, and the irreversible loss of the child’s body. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural logic with no coincidental relief.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—integrating a specific laugh into healing—is signaled early and escalates through protagonist-driven deepening: each detuning opens new seams, each confession raises emotional stakes. The meaningful tightening occurs when the narrator offers their worst memory first, foreclosing the path of detached collection. Cost is unmistakable: reliving the drowning man’s abandonment and his widow’s “cruellest and kindest sound.” Agency remains central; no coincidence resolves tension—the laugh approaches only after the narrator’s vulnerable bargain.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—discovering the mathematics of mercy—is signaled early and tightens when the protagonist realizes mercy requires relinquishing power, not solving equations. Agency manifests through renunciation (not tightening the strap) and backward walking as proof-testing. Cost is unmistakable: survival demands impersonating stone, and the hand that held them underwater retains phantom claim until the final step toward survivable ordinariness.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recovering erased labor—is signaled early and tightens when the translator unfastens the painting’s back, revealing solder and hidden harbors. Agency drives escalation: each act of translation (leaning fragment, tracing letters) narrows options toward public remembrance. Cost is felt in the journal left behind (“I cannot take it”) and the burden of witness. Though pressure accumulates beautifully, the elder’s immediate trust slightly softens opposition; a sharper friction would push this into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—uncovering hidden mechanisms of control—is signaled early (“discover what ceilings hide”) and deepens when the attic reveals systemic grift. Protagonist agency drives escalation: turning the barrel backward unlatches truth, foreclosing complicity. Cost is felt in relinquished power (“burden light”) and ethical clarity (“cracks... were not just paint, but ethics dried”). Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens, though the tightening lacks a second concrete trade-off beyond symbolic unburdening.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.2)
    Stakes escalate through the protagonist’s agency: choosing to set grief as type destabilizes the system, forcing the Glasswright’s warning into collaboration. The dominant stake—compressing eternity without rupturing reality—is deepened by the arrival of the black-twine whisper, which demands a technique beyond regulation. Cost is unmistakable: the orchard remaps, clouds shift spine, and forever is held only by the exact shape of regret.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reimagining civilization vs. reducing it to ruin—is signaled by line 3 and tightens when Neris presents the shard. Escalation is protagonist-driven: her calibration ritual deepens conflict, forcing Vark to counter with “worship ruined them.” Cost is unmistakable: the judge initially rejects “longing,” demanding law, raising stakes until the second tableau proves intent. Coincidence (storm arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the victory comes from Neris’s devised breath-rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming stolen light—is signaled early and deepens when the covenant forbids interference, forcing the repairman to choose between respect for entropy and protection of innocence. His agency drives escalation: he extracts truth from elders, builds a tether, and mends hinges preemptively. Cost is legible in the final image: balance is preserved only because rust’s memory is honored even as light returns—a compromise “hammered thin like leaf.”

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—finding where explanations fail—is signaled early and tightens when the compass insists left, forcing tactile psychometry over reason. Agency drives escalation: humming opens the seam, pressing the needle admits entry. Cost is felt in the explorers’ absorbed silence and the narrator’s returned emptiness, though the factory’s shutdown exerts passive rather than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—reimagining navigation as listening—is signaled early and deepens when the slide reveals ghostly builders, forcing a shift from solitary sculptor to community catalyst. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: turning by feel, projecting ghosts, building the ear-shaped crib. Cost is unmistakable: sleeplessness, physical labor (“hammering pebbles with palms”), and the emotional weight of ancestral expectation. The tightening forecloses the old delivery route in favor of an invitation to co-build.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—discovering a language of restraint—tightens through seasonal progression and material depletion (postcards running out). Agency manifests in micro-choices: holding lantern low to protect colors, aligning postcards at dawn, leaving unpainted spaces. The escalation is textural but decisive: from seeking answers in glass to embodying the flowers’ inward gesture. Cost is felt in the unfinished murals and the relinquished need for certainty (“I had no certainty, only practice”).

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—uncovering compromised truths—is signaled early and deepens when Alma’s diary reveals internal betrayals. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: Mara initiates the debris experiment, interprets the mirror cipher, and chooses to preserve contradictions. Cost is unmistakable: retrocognition’s “tourniquet” pain, Esteban’s shame, and the moral burden of recording mercy that “wronged the marchers.” Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without reliance on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—rebuilding civilization without wishcraft—is signaled early and tightens when the bottle reveals itself as lens, not container. The alchemist’s renunciation of “swollen ease” forecloses magical thinking, forcing reliance on working memory and tide-measured labor. Cost is visible in erased plans, unopened jugs, and braced scaffolds. The women’s arrival deepens pressure: now collaboration must also reject shortcuts, aligning with the core constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—archiving emotional truth—tightens when the prophecy implicates the scribe as “the knife,” forcing a trade-off: bind the split (lose echo) or let it open (keep map). This deepening arises from his own agency: immersing the shaving, threading it, pressing it to bark. Cost is unmistakable: he surrenders his identity as neutral scribe to become named witness. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each sensory layer intensifies the moral calculus.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reopening seed doors by decreasing entropy—is signaled early and tightens when the hatchling’s cry braids with the narrator’s song to form the “unlock phrase.” Agency drives escalation: choice to sing, to use the cap, to accept the vow. Cost is unmistakable: memory spent, personal time surrendered (“I will stay until dawn”), and inherited duty renewed. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—density of vortex imagery reweights the stakes without causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—listening vs. noise—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency: choosing whisper alerts over sirens despite institutional pressure. The tightening occurs at “zero hour,” where two paths diverge; selecting silence forecloses compliance but spares the city panic. Cost is felt in the director’s insistent texts and implied career risk, yet the storm’s “dignity” validates the choice. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with microclimate data driving each decision.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving the station through vulnerable attention—is signaled early and deepens when the salvage crew arrives. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to show the chalk room, pass the glass, open shutters. Cost is unmistakable: his past grief (“ribs once broken”) informs present endurance, and the crew’s shift from efficiency to empathy alters outcomes. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each meteor ping tightens communal resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving unspoken weight against bleaching sunlight—is signaled early and deepens when Mara realizes speaking broke the original covenant. Her agency drives escalation: opening the box, breathing on panes, walking the perimeter. Cost is unmistakable in the “sharpness that wounded both sides” and her vow to carry but not translate. One meaningful tightening suffices, and the wind’s slackening confirms stakes are resolved through earned ritual, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding time’s texture—tightens when the ribbon demands a “tender I could not replicate,” forcing the protagonist to pay with returned heartbeats. Agency drives escalation: embedding messages, bringing Mara, touching the capsule. Cost is unmistakable: ancestral names released like “foreign coins.” Coincidence (Mara’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the real turn comes from the narrator’s choice to let go.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—discovering beauty in the incomplete—is signaled early and tightens when the kite snaps, forcing a choice between restoration or redefinition. The poet’s agency drives escalation: he doesn’t fix the kite but teaches harmonizing discord, altering tactics from observation to participation. Cost is unmistakable: the quill becomes tail, the string’s fray becomes music, and perfection is explicitly rejected (“we will not repair it like a clock”). Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies through textural density (wind’s shamelessness, reeds’ agreement) rather than causal turns, culminating in a stance that crystallizes around unruliness as song.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—interspecies kinship before death—sharpens under pressure: storm damage forces a pivotal choice (enter the chamber), which deepens into a ceremonial pact. Agency drives escalation: redrawing paths, stitching circuits, and proposing terms are all active remodelings that narrow human arrogance into collaborative attention. Cost is legible in bodily fragility (“lungs whistled like reed flutes”) and the irreversible commitment to teach future generations, foreclosing solitary legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—understanding homecoming as measurable chemistry—is signaled early and deepens when the artificial pilgrimage transforms participants into pilgrims. The meaningful tightening occurs at the bronze boar: dissolving amber shifts the mission from data-gathering to shared recognition (“this is familiar”). Agency drives escalation—the protagonist’s choice to mist sleeves initiates envoy response, altering all subsequent dynamics. Cost is felt in surrendered solitude and the vulnerability of linked arms under rainlight.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming battlefield as garden—is signaled early and tightens through the coachman’s deepening reliance on avian guidance and linguistic ritual. Agency is clear: he chooses where to plant based on bird calls, speaks to mud in footprints, offers pods as peace tokens. Cost is unmistakable—the reef’s death, unsung treaties, misread trills that make seedlings sulk. Pressure accumulates texturally but coherently under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—translating distance into closeness—is signaled early and deepens via the phonograph’s riddles, which narrow options to specific acts of decoding and digging. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing to play cylinder, overlay leaf, copy letters, turn spindle. Cost is legible: emotional exposure (“nobody hurried” implies risk of stillness), physical labor, and surrender of private grief to collective need. Coincidence (trader’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from character’s persistent interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—transforming confusion into a navigable path—is signaled early and deepens when the smear becomes a vector via anniversary sketch comparison. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: laying paper, matching overlays, rerouting power. Cost is unmistakable—their exile solidifies, yet they accept it to serve a larger calibration. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each layer of mismatched moments tightens the thematic knot until the valley’s hum unlocks the data. No coincidence; resolution arises from inherited method meeting present insight.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—amending a vow to embrace change over sameness—is signaled early and escalates through protagonist agency: each chess trade deepens risk until Kestrel sacrifices his driftwood knight’s secret. Cost is unmistakable—the narrator breaks her queen, releasing a scroll that demands forgiving the future’s derailment of plans. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; the spire’s tests force ever-greater vulnerability without coincidence resolving tension.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving collective memory through small acts—is signaled early and tightens via the Custodian’s warning: “we only harvest the small.” Escalation occurs through the narrator’s agency: walking “BEGIN” summons voices, placing pebbles tracks loss, unbinding the cord commits to practice. Cost is unmistakable: rejecting “false danger” scripts, bearing grief too heavy for steps. The climax crystallizes stance—not recording fire but “fingers that strike the match”—with opportunity cost (no grand speeches, no pawns).

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding home’s shape—is signaled early and tightens via the seer’s warnings (“meaning bites”) and the escalating cost of entry (surrendering key/address, then unstoried breath). Protagonist agency drives deepening: choosing to seed shelves, accept the feather, offer breath. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each whisper, step, and revelation layers meaning until the stone’s grammar reweights reality. Cost is unmistakable: years spent hiding mistaken for shelter, now exchanged for permission to arrive.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—forgiving oneself to restore time—is signaled early and escalates through protagonist-driven agency: he chooses which threads to knot or loosen, each altering a villager’s state and tightening his own emotional cost. The deepening occurs when he realizes the puzzle requires tying a thread to his wrist—a literal and metaphorical binding to his past. Thunder’s lull acts as a live clock, pressuring decisions. Coincidence never resolves; the war’s aftermath is consequence, not contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.2)
    The dominant stake—redefining the price of forgiveness—is signaled early and deepens through the protagonist’s escalating poetic insurgency. Agency is clear: she chooses multiplicity over silence, play over penance. The tightening occurs when elders arrive with torches, forcing confrontation. Cost is unmistakable: her sister’s broken back, her own raw throat, the risk of becoming the next confessor. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, culminating in a chorus that fractures dogma.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—conjure meaning before oblivion—is signaled early and deepens through each dive. The tightening occurs when the alchemist realizes tin won’t suffice; only golden seams from his own broken intentions can mend the engine. Cost is unmistakable: he melts his teacher’s charm, the last physical tether to mentorship. Agency drives escalation—each narration shapes the next attempt, culminating in a trade-off that reweights survival itself.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—finding where “paint could hold time”—is signaled early and deepens into the climactic act of surrendering the canvas to tide. The tightening occurs at the flooded split: choosing “wrongness” forecloses safe return, raising stakes to existential. Agency drives escalation—no coincidence—and cost is felt in the trembling hands, the unmoored self, the relinquished control. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, culminating in a trade-off: permanence for honesty.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—proving whispers outtravel shouts—is signaled in paragraph 2 and deepens through the protagonist’s refusal to blast the horn despite Alder’s pressure. The meaningful tightening occurs when he chooses scent-and-whisper over sound, narrowing options to one fragile thread of intent. Cost is unmistakable: exhaustion, risk of failure, emotional exposure. Agency drives escalation; coincidence (gull tilting wing) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the skiff answers because of the keeper’s sustained attention, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—guiding reverse migration through the geography of loss—is signaled early and tightens when hydraulics fail, forcing the narrator to become the motor. Agency drives escalation: stripping the cradle, rigging counterweight, leaning body into arc—all choices narrow options (no repair, only adaptation). Cost is visible in aching hands, sleepless nights, and the unburned cloves. The moon’s fluctuation isn’t backdrop; it dictates when coordinates can be sent, making patience a tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—cultivating psychological safety amid compulsory truth—is signaled early and tightens when the courier demands the eye back, forcing the protagonist to choose between dependency and communal resilience. Escalation is driven by agency: designing trials, hosting the circle, then renouncing the relic. Cost is unmistakable: losing the eye’s softening filter means future truths may cut again, yet the circle persists. The smuggled nature of the relic adds moral tension, but the core pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens—density of shared vulnerability deepens until the decisive renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—decoding the gesture—intensifies through protagonist agency: he observes gaps, interprets absences in ship whistles, and reprograms the lighthouse. Each move narrows options (defying constable’s demands) with visible cost: social isolation, emotional burden of “borrowed memories.” The liner’s arrival isn’t coincidence—it’s earned by his precise signal replication. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: density of silences reweights stakes until Mira’s acknowledgment crystallizes success.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—honoring a promise by choosing instead of drifting—is signaled early and deepens when the ledger map reveals the “doorway of decisions.” Pressure escalates coherently: creek rises, ants lead, chip glimmers, cavern exhales—all narrow options until the press demands insertion. Cost is felt in Elias’s renunciation of solitude; agency drives every turn, including the climactic choice to withdraw the chip and return to community. Coincidence (finding the chip) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the resolution stems from his empirically intuitive trust in pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—deciphering dreams to heal cosmic rupture—is signaled early and deepens when dreams reveal the hawk’s death as political wound. Agency drives escalation: she chooses ascent, commands the door, names the fire. Cost is unmistakable: circlet laid down, palms cut, sovereignty surrendered. The tightening occurs at the cobalt grotto where dream-images force confrontation; no coincidence resolves—only her confession stitches the sky.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—capturing presence’s density—tightens when Lio’s whispered secret compresses “tendency into bead,” forcing the protagonist to recalibrate coefficients on the spot. Agency drives escalation: each lap rewrites “what the instruments believe,” with visible cost in discarded old math (“chalk along the tiles”). The city’s shift from currency-based to presence-based valuation crystallizes stakes without coincidence. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens, culminating in metrics that “cling like dew”—a trade-off between ephemeral data and embodied truth.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—distilling chaos into heat-bearing sentences—tightens when envy sorts tangles into trails, forcing the choice between soaring or shelving. Protagonist agency drives escalation: interrogating jealousy softens it into questions, which birth the verbs (stake, scent, play) that fuel the ledger. Cost is unmistakable: knuckles creak from writing, childhood boots are relinquished, and the grave’s silence must be edited, not denied.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—repairing time without erasing history—intensifies through the midwife’s unspoken grief and the screw’s symbolic weight. Protagonist agency drives escalation: she chooses interpretation over extraction, embodying her core method. Cost is felt in the midwife’s jaw-clench and the narrator’s breath-as-script; the trade-off (imperfect flow for preserved memory) forecloses mechanical purity. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, deepening via rhythmic observation rather than external conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—inscribing hospitality before thunder arrives—is signaled early and tightens relentlessly via the “held breath” clock. Protagonist agency drives escalation: faltering causes frost; recovery requires active rituals (counting heartbeats, offering sugar). Each turn forecloses options: hesitation crystallizes failure, mercy allows restart, belief unlocks the hinge. Cost is felt in silver ache of drying breath and trembling aftermath—visible price for a bridge, not a cure.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—delivering apology to heal communal rupture—is signaled early and deepens when the ghost’s emergence demands active restitution, not just words. Protagonist agency drives escalation: wiring shelves, filling the bottle, speaking truth. Cost is unmistakable—the orchard falls, the bottle cracks, Mara’s trauma remains—but the “imperfect miracle” of recorded hymn offers tangible recompense. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each sensory layer raises emotional stakes until the folio opens.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—unraveling cosmic illusions before they harden as law—is signaled early and escalates through three tightening circles that narrow options: from reading to whispering to placing the book down. Protagonist agency drives each turn; the chorus thins only in response to her precise words. Cost is felt in the forfeited autonomy of unilateral judgment, crystallized when the dais slows. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, deepening via textual and spatial density rather than external opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—restoring trustworthy time—is signaled early and tightens when the tide “leaps like a fish no net could predict.” The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: he checks systems, counts backwards, uses the key as a tool, not a talisman. Cost is unmistakable—the ocean’s accelerated grief, the bruised water, the unspoken exhaustion of shepherding a pulse that wants faster than humans can tally. The deepening (“two tempos braided into one grief”) reweights the entire endeavor without resolving it neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving the farm’s integrity against misaligned human intervention—is signaled early and deepens when Mira’s motive reframes “intrusion” as care. The tightening occurs when the protagonist chooses to “loosen” surveillance tactics, foreclosing their old enforcement role with tangible cost (loss of professional certainty). Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens: each sensory observation compounds until the final recalibration. Coincidence never resolves; pressure crystallizes into a stance that honors “transit instead of hoarding borders.”

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—widening perspectives responsibly to hold her father—tightens when she finds his handwriting, forcing her to choose between scholarly distance and filial duty. Her agency drives escalation: interpreting scrawls leads to the ward visit, where “carrots” becomes both signal and surrender. Cost is legible in her miscounting pulse, his uneaten soup, and the admission that “luck” means starvation—a quiet trade-off between love and leverage.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—teaching endings how to begin—is signaled early and deepened through each wrong-number alliance, with escalating emotional weight (widow, baker, orphans). The operator’s agency drives escalation: he chooses whom to loop, when to spin the disc, and whether to stay silent. Each intervention narrows his own path back to connection, culminating in the cost of permanent estrangement. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure grows not through plot turns but through layered human need converging on his console, and the final loop crystallizes stakes without resolving his own loneliness.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—regenerating the covenant through attention to texture—is signaled early and escalates via proximate causes: Alma learning to swim, nets adjusted, a child’s note. The archivist’s agency drives deepening; each recorded detail (“how Kellen paused before saying tempest”) narrows options toward honest endurance. Cost is visceral: the locket’s bruise, the “haunted euphoria,” the unfillable gap. Coincidence never resolves; the sea forgives only because they attend.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—curing loneliness through attention-as-logistics—is signaled early and deepens when the moon rock shifts from object to social catalyst. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she follows rumor, negotiates with surveyor, plants a new rumor (“speak to this rock…”), and steps back to let community form. Cost is unmistakable: her “desperately jocular” mask persists because isolation isn’t eradicated—only outmaneuvered. The tightening forecloses her solitary role; she becomes weather passing through tents, no longer central but necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—navigating uncharted emotional depths without drowning—is signaled early and deepens when memories dispute his right to proceed (“You left…”). The tightening occurs at the deer’s warning (“the stillness could cut”), forcing him to absorb risk as warmth. Agency is consistent: he chooses to follow dew-notes, answers accusations with stone-language, opens the ring to capture tone. Cost is unmistakable: grief’s pressure requires seams-turned-net to avoid splitting, and the stillpoint’s discovery demands kneeling vulnerability. Escalation is driven by his choices under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—repairing a fractured timeline without grand intervention—is signaled early and deepens through the realization that “undo one stitch, and another snarls.” Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing a “smaller kindness” over array-level edits narrows options meaningfully. Cost is unmistakable: five tomorrows lost, a yesteryear that “would not sit still.” The final act (writing a nine beside a one) embodies moral calculus between correction and coexistence.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—honoring unacknowledged grief—is signaled early and deepens when volunteers join, transforming private intent into communal ritual. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: recruiting, choreographing, conducting with the camera. Cost is visible in the police launch’s near-intervention and the deckhand’s risky sign of “home.” The tightening occurs when boats stop not by command but by harmonic shift—the harbor itself “requiring each hull to listen for tuning”—a turn earned by prior accumulation of silent grammar.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—rescuing memory from erasure—is signaled early and tightens when the library burns, forcing higher-risk pursuit. Protagonist agency drives escalation: decoding foam coordinates, aligning tapestry threads, following breath rhythms. The cost is unmistakable: exile, guilt over misplaced fire, and Mira’s physical deterioration. Final stance crystallizes under pressure—“argue with tenderness that erupts”—foreclosing anonymity for public testimony.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—reviving Jonah via shared dream—is signaled early and tightens when the system demands consent for “deeper coherence.” Protagonist agency drives escalation: her drumming summons his countertempo, then his memory river. Cost is unmistakable: potential mutual dissolution into “a chord the garden remembered.” The deepening (“If we braided too tightly, we might wake neither”) forces her Charged Poise choice.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—proving whispered guidance surpasses shouted commands—tightens when Otero’s bellow fails and gulls scatter uselessly. Protagonist agency drives escalation: he raps the coin to tune panels, refolds maps to redirect sound, anticipates the courier’s drag-step. Cost is visible in his exhaustion, the torn tickets traded for tea, and the unspoken toll of lifelong solitude. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves anything.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—teaching darkness the value of stars through silence—is signaled early and tightens when the boy appears with his unspoken plea. The guardian’s agency drives escalation: choosing not to speak, deploying the mirror, weaving shutter patterns. This narrows options (rejecting verbal intervention) and exacts cost (enduring others’ arrival with “words” while maintaining vow). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; coincidence never resolves—the rescue stems from taught methods. The “deep thought” holding the brother is released only through persistent, wordless ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (saving the library/grotto from bulldozers) is signaled early and deepens via the window campaign—a tactical escalation that narrows options: either act quietly or lose everything. Agency lies in renunciation (refusing marches, petitions) and attention (orchestrating second looks). Cost is felt in the coach’s restraint and the kids’ gravity, though physical stakes remain slightly abstract. The council member’s shift proves pressure coheres, but the bulldozers themselves never manifest as visceral threat, slightly muting escalation’s bite.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—freedom through embracing true nature—tightens decisively when the island demands the narrator “argue with my fear until my kindness outlasts it,” forcing renunciation of performative identity. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing to push off, planting the scrimshaw, ferrying songs back. Cost is unmistakable: loss of job title, lineage, and the safety of blame. The whale’s call isn’t coincidence but a persistent environmental pressure that narrows options (“before the tide erases tracks again”).

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—cultivating “lightness in grief” without state permission—is signaled early and tightens when the inspector arrives, forcing a high-stakes performance that could mean punishment or exposure. The performer’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to narrate chores dramatically, offer the bouquet, name the bird “tomorrow”—each act narrowing options (no retreat to compliance). Cost is unmistakable: neighbors’ wariness, the inspector’s ambiguous nod, the isolation of his “morally ambiguous” status. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with the inspector’s presence crystallizing the central conflict without resolving it mechanically.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—transforming enforcement into invitation—is signaled early and deepens when paraphrase loosens “something clenched in the quartz.” Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: reading ban aloud, speaking from memory, laying palm to ice. Cost is unmistakable: years of marginalia, “scars smoothed to gloss,” future “starving.” The tightening forecloses violence as option; trade-off is patience over speed. Under Accumulative lens, pressure grows via tonal shifts (hum drops, air knifes in) until boundary becomes bridge with “elegant calm.”

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—awakening beauty in imperfection—is signaled early and tightens when the traveler arrives with her dead music. Ilias’s agency drives escalation: he inserts the reed, paints with smoke water, trusts the crack. Cost is felt in Mara’s silence, the city’s initial rejection, the risk of public failure. The apprentice’s protest raises tension, but Mara’s nod affirms the price is worth paying.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (“discover the texture of connection in a city bruised by outages”) tightens meaningfully when the director questions pilgrimage’s destination, forcing the protagonist to crystallize stance: “destination is a change in muscle.” Agency drives escalation—the child’s knock, the priest’s shrug—each deepening communal trust as counterpoint to logistical skepticism. Cost is legible in the director’s donor anxiety versus the bees’ “unblamed flower,” and the final relinquishment of altar for alcove forecloses institutional validation.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—transforming grief into generative attention—is signaled early and deepens when seeds swell “not with any miracle but with the exacting kindness of measured attention.” Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: gathering mourners, aligning stencil with curtain, drawing the cord. The tightening forecloses the path of private despair; cost is felt in the relinquished fantasy of revival (“If we could not revive the bodies...”) and the vulnerability of shared ritual. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—mapping cultural patterns amid collapse—is signaled early and deepened through escalating acts of confiding: first data, then footsteps, finally true routes. Agency resides in multiplying paths across a silent gap, a tactic that narrows possibility into probability through persistent, patient labor. Cost is felt in the “stubborn, separate music” of divided neighborhoods and the vulnerability of sharing “one true route.” Escalation follows Accumulative logic: density increase (more voices, more strings) reweights private panic into public rhythm, with the protagonist’s feet enacting the final turn that crystallizes stance.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—accessing forbidden knowledge without becoming its dam—is signaled early and tightens when the archive “notices hoarding,” sharpening questions into accusatory shapes. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her method of pattern-avoidance forces deeper engagement, culminating in the choice to release. Cost is unmistakable: loss of exclusivity, identity fracture (“the scholar I had built to replace her”), and public vulnerability. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens with one decisive deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—preserving the shape of hope—is signaled early and tightens when the catalog chimes “luminous regret” for an unreturned dream. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to screen archives, compare reels, inscribe the spine, and embed the stone—all narrowing options (she cannot ignore the shadow) and deepening knowledge (recognizing the hand across decades). Cost is visceral: she absorbs piano thrums, stormwater tang, and emptying beds into her palms. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens until hope flowers visibly at the western window.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—ethical integrity of care versus exploitation—is signaled early and deepens when the con collapses. The tightening occurs not through external force but internal reckoning: the narrator must choose between expulsion and conditional redemption. Cost is felt in Karim’s brittle “sorry” and the narrator’s braided anger. Agency drives escalation: both characters act, speak, and rebuild, foreclosing easy absolution.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reading scars without cruelty—is signaled early and deepens when the displaced miracle redirects the quest downward. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing to follow the fern’s map, kneeling to the ivy, asking the elm’s consent. Each turn narrows options (abandoning surgical closure for botanical dialogue) and exacts cost (physical pain, emotional exposure). The final trade—opening a wound with consent—reconfigures healing itself.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—locating unused love—is signaled early and deepens through the protagonist’s psychometric reading, which narrows focus from whole reels to gutters between frames. Agency drives escalation: requesting film, performing reading, harvesting leader—all choices foreclose alternatives (e.g., ignoring splice tape would miss key storage site). Cost is felt in the manager’s awe and the physical weight of unmailed letters; the final act reframes loss as preservation. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens with one decisive intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—freeing creativity before it starves—is signaled early and tightens when the protagonist realizes the trap spans “the hour between breaths.” Agency drives escalation: they choose to trace falling stars, speak to fledglings, unlock fear stitch-by-stitch. Cost is felt in the “thin line of cold” that remains—a conceptual price for measuring the immeasurable. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidental resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—cultivating sparks in a world emptied of futures—is signaled early and deepens when the guard trades sleep for unspent possibilities. Escalation is driven by his agency: humming the lullaby, drawing the circle, placing his palm on the clock. Cost is unmistakable: “midnight freezes further inside his veins” and his perpetual dreamlessness. Pressure tightens once—when the archive demands proof—and forecloses dreaming forever, altering all future tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—rediscovering the mind’s wild frontier—is signaled early and deepens when the mirror reveals self-built fences. The tightening occurs at the tower: entry requires proving memory beyond vision, forcing the protagonist to abandon mechanical logic for embodied sound. Cost is unmistakable: he forfeited spontaneity, connection, and awe to build those fences. Agency drives escalation—he chooses to whistle, to chew—and the forest responds, never resolving via coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming connection after rupture—is signaled early and deepened through the guides’ insistence on indirect routes and vigil. The meaningful tightening occurs at the fold: the protagonist must choose stillness over chase, a renunciation that forecloses old patterns with palpable cost (the vigil, the surrendered pace). Agency drives escalation: humming the lullaby, kneeling, yielding pace—all micro-choices that narrow options until the dog’s return becomes possible. Coincidence (fox, pawprints) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from sustained stance.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—“the cost of safety”—is signaled early and tightens when the bellhop reveals the missing bolt, forcing a choice between deepening silence or enabling future sound. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency: examining the bolt, interpreting the discoloration, choosing partial compliance. Cost is unmistakable: accepting shelter means complicity, yet refusal risks collective harm. The moral calculus sharpens at the climax—“unpardonable silence” versus engineered hope—and the price (enduring within the fortress to speak later) is paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—unmasking the pretender through textual archaeology—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency: Lys arranges meetings across celestial pauses, plants river-names in atlases, and weaponizes cookbook instructions. Pressure tightens when the rune warms to her pulse, enabling corridor-shrugging that reveals the ledger. Cost is unmistakable: the pretender’s borrowed legitimacy flakes like salt, and Lys’s victory is quiet endurance, not triumph. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from her cryptic interventions.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—discovering why paths disappear—tightens when the protagonist realizes disappearance is cyclical, not linear. Agency drives escalation: tapping rhythms evolve into date-marking, which Jun decodes as “node,” triggering archival research. The cost is conceptual (abandoning restoration fantasies) and emotional (accepting the mother’s stories are unrecoverable). Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens: each log entry, rumor, and tide reading deepens the mystery until the nodal pattern breaks through boredom—a credible, earned intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reigniting hope without breaking quiet—is signaled early and deepens when the protagonist chooses “breath” over “flames.” Escalation is driven by agency: braiding wire, cranking slowly, speaking hidden routes. Cost is unmistakable: “patience costing me hope,” the bandage-wide lull. The tightening occurs at the coil—trusting hum as bridge, not thief—and forecloses violent resurgence, making the gentle startup a moral and tactical victory.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—consent versus implanted destiny—is signaled early and deepens through Mara’s decoding and ritual. Pressure tightens when councilors arrive with clipboards, forcing her to defend authority rooted in wind-kept scripts. The meaningful turn occurs at sigil alteration: swapping command for question forecloses blind obedience and incurs social risk. Cost is unmistakable: brittle empires versus living joints, articulated in the final confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—anchoring optimism in realism—is signaled early and tested when the chair demands photographic drama. Samira’s agency drives escalation: she pivots benches, redefines the ceremony space, and introduces the dead to the living. Cost is unmistakable: her body freezes at drone sounds, yet she breathes through it; donors get rain-streaked panes instead of vistas. The tightening forecloses performative memorialization in favor of embodied witness.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming artistic agency amid fragmentation—is signaled early and tightens through the tarot box’s fragility and tangled shutters. Protagonist’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to untangle, name loops, pull the clutch. Cost is felt in “barnacled memories” shed and the storm’s throat still hurling—victory is partial, earned, not total. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—testing whether time’s dilation is real or memory’s lie—is signaled by line three and tightens when the protagonist steps into the ink’s ephemeral corridors. Agency is crystallized through attention itself: she doesn’t alter physics but confirms its social architecture via deliberate focus. The cost is legible in “bones survive with a song of hairline flares”—a physical toll that forecloses easy redemption. Escalation is driven entirely by her choices (priming drone, pouring ink, bracing under beam), with no coincidence resolving pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—truth versus tranquil order—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the archivist chooses to send the letter, foreclosing archival neutrality. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: thawing, encrypting, activating infrastructure. The cost is unmistakable in the trembling hands, the named signature, and the city’s irreversible shift from sleep to silent awareness.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—continuity versus vengeance—is signaled early and deepens when the father returns demanding her hands for his unfinished work. The daughter’s agency crystallizes in the storm: splitting the sandbag, threading fractures, commanding roses to shelter pollinators. Escalation is driven by her choices under Accumulative pressure, not external luck. Cost is unmistakable: the dome’s fragility, the strangers’ trembling hands, the burning map—all force a renunciation that forecloses her father’s path with emotional and physical stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—catching the echo to restore a fractured song—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: he chooses zigzag over resistance, voices silence instead of force, and endures spectral temptations. Escalation occurs through Accumulative pressure: constellations spill “star milk,” echoes pool in dimples, the net “keens.” Cost is visible—the skiff tilts, the pocket “tries to run,” his bones become windchimes—and alters tactics (rowing *with* the pull). Final choice forecloses wildness for stewardship, paid in bodily and emotional toll.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. institutional reputation—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the technician attempts log deletion. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her proof-by-contradiction interrogations narrow options until Kline’s shiver and the technician’s surrender crystallize the turning point. Cost is unmistakable: forfeiting donor favor, risking public shame, and enduring the “orbits of regret” widening. The stakes deepen morally—shifting from saving the paper to redeeming the sky’s integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—hushing dissonance of old guilt—tightens through four escalating acts dictated by the letters, each narrowing options: tethering, humming, naming. Protagonist agency drives every turn; coincidence never resolves. Cost is unmistakable: the weight lifted only after tattooing the feared name. Final cry “Do not leave me in the static” crystallizes stakes as abandonment versus presence, paid for in craft.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—discovering meaning in the mess without losing its edges—is signaled early and tightens when the protagonist must decide where to interject strokes, not opinions. Escalation occurs through agency: drawing the gate, interpreting the spiral, guiding the water’s path—all narrowing options toward a shared vulnerability. Cost is unmistakable: the mandala dissolves, survival is rejected as a metric, and participants endure standing where it hurts. The emergent hush deepens from passive quiet to active revealer of “pooled seashell thoughts,” forcing a trade-off between permanence and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—aberrant mercy versus state-enforced order—is signaled early and tightens when the patrol arrives. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: choosing to kneel, press the tessera, and speak forbidden names. Cost is unmistakable—the risk of execution, the emotional toll of retrocognitive burden—and culminates in a trade-off: temporary safety bought through intimate vulnerability. The guard’s recognition (“his mouth shapes the lost summer”) isn’t coincidence but earned by the narrator’s precise, costly act of remembrance.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—luring possibility from despair—is signaled early and deepens when Rowan pockets trowels and talks to exit signs. The ghost’s echo-production narrows options: only lime-taste can guide her. Cost is unmistakable in Rowan’s “cracked hands” and abandoned winter of gray budgets. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency—the ghost flips the coin, coaxes tones—and paid off when hammers echo birdsong.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—translating invasive telepathy into consensual art—is signaled early and tightens when the recall email forces irreversible choice. Protagonist agency drives escalation: strapping on the hacked wristband, initiating choreography, and climbing the emergent path are all self-determined. Cost is unmistakable: permanent vulnerability to mental static (“new appetite for listening”) exchanged for creative control. The deepening—transforming passive reception into collaborative dance—narrows options from suppression to craft, fulfilling the Accumulative lens’s demand for reweighted stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—translating the unknown into listenable form for sleepers—is signaled early and deepens when the fossil alignment yields a “chord” that can alter dream loops. The meaningful tightening occurs in the narrow elbow: protagonist chooses to follow sorrow (not metrics), risking disorientation for emotional truth. Cost is visible: physical vulnerability (skimming on back, headlamp off) and emotional exposure (thermal bloom of longing). Escalation is driven by agency under an Accumulative lens—each sensory datum layers toward the chord’s revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—defying deterministic prophecy—is signaled early and tightens when the turner chooses to “spin a prophecy into raw possibility” rather than accept surrender. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: cataloging buttons deepens pattern recognition, leading to the echo’s unsealing, which reweights the prophecy’s meaning. Cost is unmistakable—the town’s wary entry requires vulnerability, and the collective turning of hourglasses demands physical coordination. The final road emerges not by luck but by sustained attention to “tiny moons” of human loss.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming agency through unused courage—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist-driven escalation: from writing codes to accepting Mina’s mission. The tightening forecloses retreat (“burn notice erased your tether”) and demands visible price: using his disfigurement as a tool. Pressure coheres under Causal lens, with each choice narrowing paths toward the radio’s repair.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—distilling a tangled promise into a viable vow—is signaled early and deepens through protagonist agency: unpicking layers, choosing simplicity despite fear it’s “too small.” Escalation occurs via environmental pressure (swollen ford, ticking gutters) and internal resistance (“damp tightened every thread”), culminating in the decisive act of stitching one line. Cost is unmistakable: shedding accumulated history, risking rejection (“what I would do if the bride refused a smaller truth”). Under the Accumulative lens, density intensifies until the single-thread resolution reweights the entire emotional landscape.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding how places endure—is signaled early and deepens through the phototropic kindness mechanic. Protagonist agency drives escalation: each test (mending trough, honoring dead queen) tightens knowledge and narrows interpretation. The cost is conceptual but legible: the realization that endurance requires invisible, unrewarded labor. Coincidence never resolves; pressure accumulates via texture and pattern under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—instilling steadiness in people who call this building home—is signaled early and tightens when the roof door sticks. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: choosing angles, rhythms, and placements under pressure. Cost is unmistakable: the lost key replaced by inherited precision, hope guarded yet deliberately left where others “trip gently over it.” Coincidence never resolves; even Theo’s breakthrough stems from light made tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—coexisting with absence without consumption—is signaled early and tightened when the ledger reveals the narrator’s childhood failure (“a poor trustee of future continents”). Agency drives escalation: each turn (calibrating hum, entering the wing, vowing independence) narrows options until the final act of reshelving forecloses ghost-making. Cost is legible in “Tone: None,” a catalog-imposed emotional austerity that enables clarity at the price of warmth.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—rejoining lost love through public art—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency: he builds the spiral, invites strangers, transforms private grief into communal ritual. Pressure tightens when the woman appears; the crowd parts, the ribbon thrums, and the spiral becomes the only path. Cost is felt: years of self-exile, ink-stained secrecy, the risk of public rejection. Coincidence (her arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve—he’s built the road she walks.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving communal coherence against manipulative attention—is signaled early and tightens when the provost threatens shutdown. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing subsonics over silence, recruiting allies, timing the dawn node. Cost is felt in campus fractures and personal exhaustion; power plays aren’t just backdrop but the tricksters’ “habitat,” making resistance costly and necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—retrieving the key without breaking the city’s spirit—is signaled early and deepens when the protagonist chooses patience over force (“transfix the spatial mutiny without bruising it”). The meaningful tightening occurs at the organ loft: pressing keys becomes an act of diplomacy, narrowing options to harmonic persuasion alone. Cost is felt in the physical strain (“lungs took careful, measured sips”) and moral burden (“rebellion against the guild… felt small and tender”). Escalation is driven entirely by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens—each note intensifies spatial response until the seam opens.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—awakening empathy through absence—is signaled early and deepens when the ribbon snags, forcing confrontation. Lio’s agency drives escalation: his question about wind direction (“which side… to find her”) merges plea and accusation, compelling the captain’s confession. Cost is unmistakable: the captain’s wrist-hold signifies surrendered freedom, earned through Lio’s relentless unification of opposites.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—proving Seraphine’s dismissed route to earn return—is signaled early and tightens when Mirek warns exile is “reversible only as long as you remain useful.” The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: decoding stanzas, deploying the nail, retrieving samples. Cost is felt in the choice to delay return, trading bureaucratic mercy for ancestral justice. Coincidence (journals delivered due to petition) complicates but doesn’t resolve; all key turns stem from her persistent, flawed labor.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reconciling absence with possibility—is signaled early and deepens when the narrator recounts the hitchhiker’s vanishing. The tightening occurs when the fiddler asks what if the hitchhiker *chose* to leave, forcing a revaluation of agency. Cost is felt in the narrator’s admission: “each time I failed I burned a word and warmed my hands.” Coincidence complicates (wind playing tattoos) but doesn’t resolve; music and object mediate reunion.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—whether one can ethically dissuade harm through invisible boundaries—is signaled early and tightens as the startup’s “quiet” reveals its cost: emptied streets, lost contracts, moral fatigue. The courier incident (“reputational gravity”) forces reckoning, narrowing options until only personal ritual remains. Agency persists: he chooses to leave bills for the kid, walks away gently. Cost is visible in foreclosed paths—no redemption, only charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—translating grief into communal language—is signaled early and deepens when Mara’s brother’s death ties personal loss to the temple collapse. The meaningful tightening occurs when they rewrite the algorithm to “match grief,” narrowing options from technical decoding to embodied listening. Protagonist agency drives escalation: asking Mara about the falling stone forces her first utterance, which directly alters their model. Cost is unmistakable—silence “bruised her throat,” and healing requires vocalizing loss over radio, making vulnerability the price of progress. Coincidence never resolves; insight emerges from sustained attention under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—discovering what mirrors don’t show—is signaled early and tightens through Issa’s ritual acts. Agency drives escalation: she chooses to bleed, to loosen rings, to read aloud. Cost is visceral (“tastes bile and iron”) and conceptual (confronting complicity). The orchard’s spin softening is a direct result of her unbending, not coincidence—pressure coheres under Accumulative lens with one decisive deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—fulfilling the eclipsed covenant—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency: tracing veins awakens paths, pressing clipping to wrist births map-welts, linking scars ignites convergence. Cost is unmistakable: breath withheld by roots, terror in the girl’s nod, wounds as yes-votes. The tightening occurs when the figure from crosswind demands affirmation “with our wounds rather than with our mouths,” forcing irreversible commitment. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens until Charged Poise crystallizes options.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—mending bartered destinies—is signaled early and tightens when the Keeper demands acceptance of scars. Protagonist agency drives escalation: “trammel that breath” becomes “teach me where to sew,” then “I began to scribe.” Cost is unmistakable: the brother’s future was ash; now it lives only as a braid in shared work. The single meaningful deepening—love frays, mending requires craft—narrows options and reweights the market’s logic under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—assigning value to what remains after loss—is signaled early and tightens when the narrator shifts from appraising objects to midwifing stories. Escalation occurs through his own agency: recognizing the cloth, extracting the drawer, interpreting the singe. Cost is felt in his admission that this work isn’t about redeeming his name but discovering purpose—a quiet but decisive foreclosing of his old motive.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding transition’s physics—is signaled early and deepens into renouncing mastery for tuning. Protagonist agency drives escalation: kneeling, humming, rotating rails, refusing to eat—all narrow options toward Earned Stasis. Cost is visceral: haunted ambitions “would only fracture the incline,” so she chooses patient listening over rescue. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with each adjustment tightening the harmonic between matter and memory.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder amid identity migration—is signaled early and deepens through two key turns: the baker’s fluctuating name and the boy’s compass of kindness. Each visitor’s arrival tightens pressure by demanding the librarian choose how to catalogue without pinning, culminating in the smelting ritual that transforms instability into artifact. Cost is unmistakable: the librarian must smelt doubt into patience, accept silence from drift tags, and endure the absence of tomorrow. Agency drives escalation; coincidence never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving latent radiance versus enforcing sterile protocol—is signaled early and tightens during “the heartbeat of a hesitation,” where old doctrine tugs against new purpose. The inspector’s agency drives escalation: reading the shell, crowning the stone, rewriting the checklist. Cost is unmistakable: he trades institutional approval for fragile human reconnection, embodied in the signed note left under the gasket. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness through truth—tightens decisively when graffiti reveals WSP, forcing the protagonist to confront his past erasure (“labeled irrelevant because romance reads better than rust”). Agency drives escalation: his choice to clear the grate reweights the river’s behavior (“shortened its breath”) and crystallizes his stance. Cost is unmistakable: public confession staining his name, labor replacing eloquence, and the busker’s silent refusal to absolve. Coincidence complicates (busker’s presence) but never resolves; all pressure stems from the narrator’s prior fable.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—accessing unspoken meaning without violating its silence—is signaled early and tightens when the cipher demands subtraction of one’s own pulse from external echoes, forcing trade-offs between self and signal. Protagonist agency drives escalation: encoding breaths, documenting procedures, timing outbound/inbound pulses. Cost is unmistakable—the ledger bears her veil stitched into leather, personal identity fused with the archive’s logic. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from disciplined attention under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—returning a stolen promise—is signaled early and deepens when plants demand propagation. The tightening occurs at the coffee-stain eclipse: the dotted arch forecloses inaction. Agency drives escalation—the protagonist chooses to play, knowing ice will melt and donors will drink shame. Cost is unmistakable: career, anonymity, the empire’s curated narrative—all sacrificed for a winter-song that cannot be cataloged.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—capturing a final spark before oblivion—is signaled early and deepens when her mother arrives. The tightening occurs in the emerald ritual: a single, high-stakes act where failure means total loss. Cost is unmistakable: she must endure her mother’s absence while performing the very rite her mother taught her. Agency drives escalation; coincidence never resolves—only her focus and method yield the filament of blue.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—forgiveness as ongoing practice—is signaled early and tightens through pruning decisions that embody moral calculus (“mercy sometimes asks for steady hands”). Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: climbing trees to assess canes, then sparing or cutting based on “bravery” and future sweetness. Cost is unmistakable in the mother’s burned vines and the narrator’s late forgiveness, crystallized when the hairpin becomes both tool and clasp—holding harm without spilling it forward.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—signing away homes for a seawall—is signaled early and deepens when Mara reveals human specifics (shell-stacking child, non-swimming fisher). The tightening occurs not through external reversal but internal recalibration: she moves from “sincerely insincere” armor to conditional courage. Cost is unmistakable—the cloak’s weight, the breath released, the acceptance of fear as part of leadership. Protagonist agency drives escalation: offering the shard, unhooking the cloak, translating chimes—not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—learning how vanishing makes truth appear—is signaled early and tightens through the researcher’s withholding, which forces attention to pattern over explanation. The protagonist’s agency lies in sustained observation, not action; their choice to watch until the shore speaks narrows options and deepens understanding. Cost is unmistakable: the researcher’s self-erasure and the implied burden of carrying insight alone. Escalation occurs through perceptual refinement, consistent with the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—learning to navigate without moving—is signaled early and deepens when the pulse’s reluctance reveals historical trauma. Protagonist agency drives escalation: drone pitch, arrowhead angle, and vocal tone coax the pulse, each choice narrowing options. Cost is unmistakable: confronting the traders’ “barricade of forgetting” demands emotional labor (“hum a tally of forgiveness”). The pulse’s transformation from fugitive to guide crystallizes stance under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—finding the sacred in the simple—is signaled early and tightened decisively when the mage unstraps his assistive charms, trading marketable cleverness for vulnerable presence. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: each step upward, each memory reclaimed, narrows options until only attentive stillness remains. Cost is unmistakable—“rented cleverness” abandoned, the city’s grip loosened—and legible in the final image: broom leans, kettle breathes, light lingers. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with brilliant dimness reweighted from atmospheric detail to ethical stance.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—discovering the color of sound—is signaled early and deepens into a moral-aesthetic quest. Pressure tightens when the lantern release distracts townsfolk, enabling his descent; the low tide bell creates a live clock. His agency drives escalation: he chooses to descend, press the tag, offer luminous vows. Cost is unmistakable: he surrenders his protective posture (“I hid there”) for vulnerability, crystallized in the final act of lifting the lamp not as duty but as listening begun.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—wavelength alignment with purpose—is signaled early and tightens through protagonist-driven escalation: distilling coolant enables singing, which requires interpreting static, which demands honest casting. The meaningful deepening occurs when the backwards prophecy reframes agency: success depends not on individual will but “democratic scatter.” Cost is unmistakable—the narrator must suppress personal desire (“keep our longing from steering”) to preserve cosmic resonance. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens; coincidence never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—naming nameless fears to prevent them thickening into fatal fog—is signaled early and tightens through protagonist agency: each tape played forces a costly naming (“a promise is a beast that bites”). Escalation is textural but decisive: from hallway clatter to the reaper’s own voice, stakes deepen until the final renunciation (“Enough”) forecloses old self-reproach. Cost is unmistakable: “I have been mending it ever since with careful names.”

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—restoring the sea’s memory—is signaled early and deepens when brittle devotion snaps, forcing Nera to abandon guild logic for wet arithmetic. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each drip narrows options until the bell falters, demanding improvisation (rubbing puddle water, naming fish). Cost is unmistakable: Aro’s choked laugh embodies emotional toll, and his vow not to fish enacts material sacrifice. Luck complicates (new crack whispers) but resolution stems from protagonist’s adaptive agency—cupping water, aligning seams—not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving communal memory against bureaucratic erasure—is signaled early and deepens when the warden recognizes her mother in the photos. The meaningful tightening occurs when she must choose: enforce the county’s order or protect the “illegal memorials.” Her agency drives escalation—she radios for a pause, mobilizes others—and the cost is conceptual (defiance of authority) and emotional (confronting inherited loss). Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens; each photograph intensifies the moral weight until the final act crystallizes her dual role as warden and witness.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—harmonizing logic and intuition—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: she maps starlings into ratios, adjusts flame intensity, chooses not to force transformation. Pressure tightens meaningfully when the murmuration offers “an answer by not answering,” forcing her to relinquish binary thinking. Cost is legible: she endures uncertainty (“everything stayed before the final transformation”) rather than risk losing tenderness. Coincidence complicates (starlings appear) but doesn’t resolve; insight arises from her interpretive labor under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—preserving trust under pressure—is signaled early and deepens when Lio’s harness fails. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: revising signals, pacing words to breath, overriding pride. Cost is unmistakable: emotional exposure (“stomach becomes the canopy”), forfeited autonomy (Lio’s initial refusal), and the ever-present risk of quiet failure. The tightening choice—trusting muscle memory over sight—narrows options and reweights the entire system of care.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—defeating emotional numbness—is signaled early and deepens when the city’s custody battle forces Kana to choose between safety of blankness and risk of feeling. Escalation is driven by her agency: placing palms on glass, counting breaths, vivifying the witness. Cost is unmistakable: numbness cracks “from being asked to carry weight and being trusted to drop it.” The complementary-opposites method narrows options until guardianship emerges as the only viable stance.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—safeguarding liminal space against commodification—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency: planting the seed, designing Seed room, mobilizing neighbors through “orthogonal approaches.” The meaningful deepening occurs when the corpse flower’s “impossible scent” becomes tactical, transforming passive preservation into active deterrence. Cost is unmistakable: emotional exposure (Mae’s possible return), social risk (confronting developers), and temporal investment (“time and care” as room design), all crystallized in the charged poise of the sprout’s emergence.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—restoring lost laughter without erasing grief—is signaled early and tightens when the conductor chooses partial restoration over full return. Agency drives escalation: each blower cue deepens the wind’s emotional pitch, culminating in the harmonica-shaped current. Cost is unmistakable: laughter must retain shadows or “cut the mouth.” The method itself imposes moral calculus—lullabies on off-key wind demand devotion others cannot bear.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—befriending uncertainty—is signaled immediately and escalates through protagonist agency: choosing to wait, practicing “plain bravery,” interiorizing exteriors. Each deepening (accepting the pendant, placing the comma) narrows options and raises conceptual stakes. The cost is unmistakable: certainty “broke me into safe, useless pieces”; the cultists froze trying to drown doubt in proof. Final renunciation forecloses return to old sky—a live option made painful by its nearness—and embodies the story’s moral calculus: warmth lives in edges, not centers.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—interrupting the mill-bound “stifling destiny”—is signaled early and deepens through successive approximation: each failed fire narrows options until the alchemist shifts from mending to vivifying absence. Agency is crystallized in his decision to bleed into the mix and press the frost-flower to the wound. Cost is unmistakable: loss as “currency of renewal,” joy that “hurt,” and the visible toll on the town’s collective breath. Pressure coheres entirely under the Accumulative lens, with no coincidental resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—decoding endings to unearth beginnings—is signaled early and tightens when the horn’s aim shifts from moon/abyss to “space between swing and stillness,” foreclosing easier paths. Protagonist agency drives escalation: discarding assumptions isn’t stated but enacted, narrowing options to one precarious tuning. Cost is unmistakable—the city sags under the weight of beginnings, demanding proof of capacity. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each stripped signal layer intensifies until breath-like tone arrives.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—making the ferry reliably arrive—is signaled early and tightens when the vessel vanishes. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he initiates the grotto crossing, performs the weaving, and chooses to become the hinge. Cost is unmistakable: his corporeal dissolution in exchange for commuters’ safe passage. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each added layer (radio call, star reflections, echo-rope) deepens the stakes without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—discovering the texture of connection—is signaled early and deepens through Mara’s threading of the sinew, culminating in her personal confrontation. Pressure escalates accumulatively: visitors’ transformations raise the emotional stakes until Mara must face her own exile. The cost is unmistakable: relinquishing the protective fiction that logic shields her from loneliness. Coincidence (the stranger’s appearance) complicates but doesn’t resolve—Mara’s agency in tying the final knot drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—orienting by stars despite crushing depth—tightens when the council’s trench-expansion plan threatens to abandon celestial navigation. Protagonist agency drives escalation: petitioning, practicing “adding patience to skill,” drafting the route during a “time-soft window.” Cost is unmistakable: food lines thin, currents shift, and survival hinges on trusting “what burns beyond” the surface. The “narrow yes” exacts emotional toll, yet enables the decisive ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—protecting vulnerable voices—is signaled early and tightens when the “man in a cheap suit” appears, raising stakes from emotional rescue to physical intervention. The narrator’s agency drives escalation: tuning the aid, summoning bystanders, invoking the donor’s choice. Cost is felt in Eli’s trembling and the shattered glass—a live option (suicide) is foreclosed, not by luck but by orchestrated attention. Coincidence complicates (Eli vanishes), but resolution is earned through deliberate action.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—bearing witness to erased colleagues—is signaled early and deepens through Ivo’s tactile rituals (warming copper, naming Ada and Sorel). Escalation is driven by his agency: chilling housings, placing mugs, coaxing signals—each act narrowing time before flood. The cost is felt in transience: he cannot save the data, only attend to it. This renunciation crystallizes under tidal pressure, fulfilling the Situational lens’s demand for stance under coherent constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming personhood from bureaucratic death—is signaled early and deepens when the ghost reveals the crew’s miscalculation. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing to kneel, read ink, accept the corridor, and descend with shard/page. Cost is unmistakable—the shard’s sharpness, the ghost’s fragility, the lung-path requiring new breathing—and narrows options by replacing panic with “distant weather.” The tightening (ink revealing missed corridor) forces trade-off: carry wisdom down rather than seek personal vindication, crystallizing stance with visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—saving a dying language through translation of texture into sound—is signaled early and tightens via escalating sacrifice: first memories, then private names, finally left/right of self. Agency drives escalation: protagonist chooses when/where to press diamond, split attention among hands, surrender identity. Cost is unmistakable: “the curse flex like a hand closing,” names eaten, copper seeping from veins. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with each deepening (birds fracturing, tunnel repaying with feral nouns) narrowing options toward irreversible fusion with the canyon.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—transforming personal grief into collective healing through humor—is signaled early and deepens when the phone demands the arrow become a mouth. Protagonist agency drives escalation: singing the jar, scraping flint on willow, uttering the pun. Cost is unmistakable: the narrator surrenders objectivity, risks ridicule, and accepts that saving Marko may mean letting him go. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—beauty versus mechanization—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the protagonist shifts from performance to signaling. Agency drives escalation: heartbeat-tuned bowing recruits nature and statue alike, forcing systemic rupture (“levers complained,” rails uprooted). Cost is visceral and on-page: social exposure (“inspectors to remeasure”), personal vulnerability (“chest thumped”), and irreversible disruption of civic order—all paid to achieve tarnished wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—delivering truth across contested lines—is signaled early and escalates via drone interference, commander threats, and shifting routes. Protagonist agency drives escalation: he chooses to unstopper the storm, trade lists, and persist past warnings. Cost is unmistakable—tokens replace letters, couriers vanish, and every crossing risks becoming an “example.” The tightening from solitary errand to collective vigil reweights silence into resistance under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—transforming silence into motion—is signaled early and deepens when the wrong turn reveals the oasis, altering tactics (water for bearings). Escalation is driven by agency: he chooses breath over force, patience over noise. Cost is unmistakable: years of solitary labor, the swallowed calliope, the lost singer’s voice—all crystallize in the fragile tone that awakens the carousel. Coincidence (finding the fragment) complicates but doesn’t resolve; his choice to sing does.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—finding where stories live—is signaled early and deepens when the library reveals stories reside in “orientation,” not place. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she maps with hyperbolic geometry, aligns meridians, follows moving shelves. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits possession (“I belong to their weather”), and patrons undergo silent upheavals (woman’s “long-shelved oceans,” boy’s star-sentences). Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens, with each beat increasing textual density until the cul-de-sac climax.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—capturing a dream carrying Aria’s cipher—is signaled early and deepens when the protagonist realizes capture equals isolation. Escalation is driven by agency: choosing to paint with light rather than net, then hanging prints as crossings. Cost is unmistakable—the wish “not to be alone” reframed as stewardship, not ownership—and visible in the unlatched door. Pressure tightens coherently under Accumulative lens via cadence shifts from pursuit to porousness.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—freeing an idea trapped behind fear—is signaled early and deepens when the scholar reveals the hair belongs to a dead sister who “gave it anyway.” Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: the scholar points to the sky for the star’s hint, then recognizes the ribbon’s origin, enabling the locksmith’s final act. Cost is unmistakable: confronting lifelong repression of tenderness, tied to grief. The “improbable longing” swells not by coincidence but through earned alignment of past and present under cosmic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—recovering stolen memories—is signaled early and deepens when the protagonist realizes the debt “hooks to us both” due to a misnamed bargain. Escalation is driven by her agency: studying constellations, stepping through the ring, unwinding the wrong name. The cost is unmistakable—confronting the girl who “is not me yet” and accepting that memory recovery requires paying old debts. Pressure tightens coherently under the Accumulative lens until the final Charged Poise crystallizes options.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reversing exile through self-forgiveness—is signaled early and deepens via the tea-leaf hinge glyph, which narrows options to one intact memory. Agency drives escalation: the girl’s decision to carry the shadow, match backward pacing, and annotate the lectern forces the corridor to yield. Cost is unmistakable: the archivist cannot reverse their own exile yet mentors others, holding still instead of retreating. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens—density of ritual intensifies until the hinge rattles—and coincidence never resolves; victory comes from combative tenderness enacted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—restoring color/wonder—tightens when the Gray drinks hunger and kindness, transforming antagonism into mutual need. Protagonist agency drives escalation: pruning, gathering essences, crossing the bridge, and teaching neighbors. Cost is unmistakable—the pruner sacrifices solitary wisdom for communal vulnerability, and the Gray relinquishes its pall. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens with one decisive deepening at the echo orchard.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—grounding the fisherman’s spirit—is signaled by line three and escalates through the net-unraveling, which narrows options: each knot undone lifts the coffer, making retreat impossible. Protagonist agency drives every turn; coincidence never resolves. Cost is felt in the daughter’s fear (“he left angry”) and the restorer’s mirrored identity crisis, culminating in the compass buried anew—a visible forfeiture that alters future tactics. The sanctuary’s accumulating silence becomes both pressure and price.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—whether silence deserves interpretation—is signaled early and tightens through the protagonist’s methodical comparison of silent footage, which narrows options to a single, breath-calibrated gesture. Agency is exercised through renunciation (no shouting, no forcing) and attention (counting breaths), with clear cost: knowledge gained but access withheld from the ungentle. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural escalation—each layer of quiet evidence (ribbon, abrasion, draft) deepens the moral calculus without coincidence resolving tension.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding “the physics of letting go”—tightens decisively when the tape reveals “LET GO TO LIVE,” transforming abstract inquiry into urgent moral calculus. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing to untangle wires, splice tape, interpret pulses. Cost is unmistakable—the weight of inherited grief (“hands cling to bad ladders”) crystallizes into the choice to release the globe. Coincidence (finding stub) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the vector is earned through labor.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to unspoken communal needs—is signaled early and deepens through the balladeer’s escalating encoding (from laundry hours to public console access). Pressure tightens when lightning “sketches the balustrade,” forcing real-time adaptation (copper leads guiding static into paint). The ghost’s limited agency (“smallest levers”) raises stakes by demanding precision: bolder requests must be “carried gently” in petal glyphs. Cost is unmistakable—the balladeer’s labor remains “seldom-heard,” yet their work compels tangible change (bus schedules, stairwell lights), proving quiet persistence alters systems.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—protecting Madam Vire from her own grief—is signaled early and deepens when the diary reveals her hidden vulnerability. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing to read, interpret, and ultimately obey her unspoken wish (leaving relics in the forgetter room). Cost is unmistakable: his love remains unvoiced, crystallized in “affectionate detachment.” The tightening occurs at floor seven—when he nearly disobeys but chooses witness—narrowing his path to silent service.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—proving empty spaces remember—is signaled early and deepens through the narrator’s ritualized methodology. Agency is expressed through attention and annotation, not physical rescue; each act forecloses denial and affirms memory. The tightening occurs when the fresh line “pays out, then holds,” stabilizing the gondola—a trade-off between illusion and truth. Cost is felt in the “trembling” graphite and the acknowledgment that reunion is impossible (“you are already geography”).

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—mirroring the sky inside walls before demolition—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens relentlessly. Agency manifests through attention, endurance, and brushwork; each choice (finding the safe, decoding the coin, painting east/west light) narrows options under the live clock of impending collapse. Cost is felt: time lost to reflection, the unheld face of a father, the acceptance that people are misplaced but rooms can be known. Escalation is driven by the protagonist’s deepening communion with the space, not coincidence, and culminates in a reconfiguration of what “saving” means.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (“chart stranded luminance”) tightens when the hopscotch board forces a heading change, narrowing options to “through then above” the murmuration. Agency drives escalation: the apprentice’s observation initiates the climb, and cost is felt in the “loneliness translated into a map we can share.” Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens—birds, chalk, phrasebook converge without deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—learning “the rhythm of repair”—tightens when prophecy fragments reveal the hall of mirrors is a machine needing precise, patient intervention. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to uncap oil, fit gears, speak stories, each act narrowing options (e.g., frost must not be startled). Cost is unmistakable: he sacrifices urgency for “unhurried knowledge,” and the final note warns future seekers against rushing harbors. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens—no coincidence resolves conflict; every turn stems from his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—coaxing rain through collective ritual—is signaled early and tightens via Vine’s instructions to “swap the shifts we were sure we owned,” forcing renunciation of individual time. Agency is expressed through attention and endurance: carrying the bell, reexamining grudges, climbing at dusk. The cost is visible in bodily effort (“parents lifting children”) and emotional labor (“neighbors lifting names once spoken as curses”). Escalation follows the Accumulative lens: density of shared action reweights the stake from survival to communal restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—delaying doomsday through mercy—is signaled early and tightens when the storm glass darkens, forcing the sequence. Agency lies in attention and ritual: listening to bricks, rust, oil burn; turning the key “through nested patterns.” The meaningful deepening occurs when he chooses to “teach [the hands] kindness,” rejecting dominion for compassion—a trade-off with visible cost (eternal solitude, bearing the weight of endings). Escalation is driven by his choices under Accumulative pressure, not coincidence, and the cost (“copper of regret,” “bruised awe”) permeates the final breath.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—guiding travelers before night frost—tightens coherently under Accumulative pressure: birds’ patrols intensify, strangers arrive with a broken map, frost looms. The caretaker’s agency drives escalation: he uses the nut’s blueprint not to build but to “wake what already wanted to become a guide,” altering tactics under constraint. Cost is unmistakable—his guidance requires self-erasure—and the orchard’s “disappointed” sigh confirms stakes are viscerally felt, not abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reconnecting with her brother through material metaphor—is signaled early and tightens when Mira builds the responsive bridge, foreclosing solitary lab work. The deepening occurs when she admits treating his anger as “impurity to be filtered,” shifting tactics from control to collaboration. Cost is unmistakable: years of silence, the brother’s initial cold reply, and the physical risk of the unstable bridge. Agency drives escalation; coincidence (thumbs-up) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the real turn is her persistence and his arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—access to authentic beginnings—is signaled early and deepened through the method of “quantifying absence,” which narrows options: only honest, unsentimental omissions qualify. The vendor’s own sacrifice (his father’s silence) escalates pressure by mirroring the customer’s loss, forcing a trade-off between hoarding his blank and entering vulnerability. Cost is unmistakable: he pays with a deferred promise made coldly literal. Agency drives every turn under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—transforming collective grief into stamina—is signaled early and tightens when the chef unpacks his brazier under the coral’s frost, risking emotional inundation. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: analyzing tidal pools leads him east; tasting siege ash compels him to cook. Cost is unmistakable—the mason’s salted silence becomes literal mineral in the ice, and the chef’s jaw clenches to contain it. The broth’s success isn’t luck but earned through precise sensory labor (“bitterness loosened like scar tissue”).

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—turning silos into bridges—is signaled early and deepens through Mara’s interspersed languages and the cuckoo weight’s invocation. Escalation is driven by her agency: she summons the choir, braids tongues, and lowers the plumb line. The councilman’s resistance is overcome not by argument but by the elevator’s revelation of his father’s glove—a turn that narrows options and forces participation. Cost is felt in labor, vulnerability, and the town’s prior fear “tasted like hulls,” now transmuted into shared construction.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reconciling entangled grief through technological archaeology—is signaled early and deepens via the river sensor flashback, which reweights the cost of caution versus audacity. Agency is expressed through dial-turning, mirror-angling, and synaptic tuning, each narrowing options until the final vow crystallizes pressure into stance. The canyon’s tremors and thunder complicate but never resolve; all escalation stems from protagonist-driven recalibration under Accumulative/Textural pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—recovering forgotten combinations—is signaled early and deepens via the archivist’s realization that combinations are “attentions,” not digits, raising the cost from retrieval to perpetual cultivation of vigilance. Escalation is driven by his agency: pausing between wet/dry stone, drumming the cadence, listening until numbers rustle. The inverted hour imposes a live clock that narrows options, and the climax forecloses easy access—he must return, again and again. Cost is felt in the “ache that had made the long watch bearable.”

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—creating music through empathetic alignment—tightens when the hedgehog’s uncurling grants “permission,” transforming passive waiting into active ceremony. Agency manifests in renunciation (no striking), micro-tuning (fingertip strumming), and offering phrases to river/hedgehog/grove. Cost is felt in the vulnerability of “small letters” and the burden of legacy (“song will outlive me”). Escalation occurs through accumulated resonance, not external conflict, consistent with the Accumulative lens; the snapped twig tests but doesn’t resolve, preserving pressure until Charged Poise at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—mending the eclipsed covenant—is signaled early and deepens via political pressure (outlawed listening, registry deadline). Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing silence over words, correlating birds with moves, tipping the king as libation. Cost is unmistakable: potential branding as oathbreakers, exile’s lingering shame, and the guard’s fearful glance showing societal risk. One tightening suffices—the guard’s presence crystallizes danger—but a second (registry deadline) sharpens urgency without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—cataloging urban silences—is signaled early and tightens through three numbered silences that escalate emotional risk. Protagonist agency drives deepening: tuning frequencies, lowering volume, choosing listening over winning. Cost crystallizes when fireworks erupt; he writes through “sky rehearses endings,” sacrificing spectacle for witness. The fennel revelation reframes harm as hunger, making empathy an active stance with visible price: solitude amid celebration.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—cultivating serenity within motion—is signaled early and tested by the corpse flower’s threat to communal harmony. Mara’s agency drives escalation: choosing the hardest-swaying platform, guiding breath during storms, positioning cedar baskets. Cost is felt in neighbors’ “frowned advice” and her solitary vigil; the climax trades comfort for shared endurance. Pressure tightens coherently under Accumulative lens—each seasonal braid deepens stakes until the bloom forces a collective reckoning with discomfort.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—restoring the planet’s resilience—is signaled early and escalates when the singing thins, raising the cost from observation to intervention. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: she chooses the tallest arch, shoulders through the veil, and fits the tip to the wound. The price is legible—the trembling trees, the bleeding echoes—and the resolution forecloses passive hope in favor of ancestral responsibility. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure builds via sensory and sonic degradation until the chamber’s repair reweights all prior silence.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—preventing recurrence through cultivated foresight—is signaled early and tightens when the investigator discovers the empty square was a trap created by misread wind. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: each chalk mark, anemometer reading, and log check narrows options until drafting the binding order. Cost is unmistakable in the stiffened patch, scorch marks, and the town’s stolen breath—consequences that crystallize into Charged Poise at the corridor mouth.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—certifying wonder as essential—is signaled early and tightens when the council demands “proofs that breath could not supply.” The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: choosing the sculptor’s first strike as test, walking auroral colors despite sleep’s danger, ringing to mediate the sculptor’s fear/stubbornness. Cost is unmistakable: physical toll (“frostbitten hands”), emotional labor (“keep them from tearing each other”), and the irreversible commitment to unquantifiable truth. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each bell tone deepens the hush’s capacity until it “learned to carry the sculptor’s strike back to her hand.”

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—harvesting insight from failure—is signaled early and deepens through the flute’s evolving use. Agency drives escalation: each note played alters the corridor, reforms footprints, and shifts the twin valley’s judgment. Cost is unmistakable—the cracked oaths, scattered guardians, and redirected path—all crystallizing in the decision to witness, not claim, the seam’s breath.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—measuring emotion’s strain through transposed empathy—is signaled early and deepens as star vanishings accelerate, forcing the pivotal print of the “third grammar.” Agency is clear: the operator disorients readers deliberately; the narrator chooses apprenticeship to pursue emotional mathematics. Cost is unmistakable—the physical and psychic toll of borrowing selves—and escalates coherently under an Accumulative lens until the final transfer yields measurable relief.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—coaxing wonder without stealing time—is signaled early and tightens at the cairn and climax. The courier’s agency drives escalation: choosing to extend, then deliberately releasing the moment. Cost is unmistakable (“thin the next dawn”) and tied to a persistent constraint (the pendant’s power). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, deepening through density rather than reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.3)
    The dominant stake—proving objects absorb emotion—is signaled early and escalates through tactile pressure: warming the engine, reading frost, speaking the father’s name. The narrator’s agency drives the climax; his whispered name triggers the prism’s flare and frost’s final branch. Cost is unmistakable: vulnerability (“tasted like smoke and rain”) and irreversible acknowledgment of grief. Coincidence never resolves; every intensification arises from character choice under coherent atmospheric pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—carrying a message across impossible distance—is signaled early and tightens when the protagonist realizes physical passage would kill the orchard, forcing her to send only the bead. This renunciation forecloses reunion-by-presence but enables return-by-preserving-home, with clear cost: years of solitary vigil. Pressure escalates through protagonist agency—arranging edges, threading hair, whispering lullabies—not coincidence. The “latent sacrifice” becomes active, paid in patience and presence.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving the arches against collapse—is signaled early and deepens through three escalating barterings, each demanding greater personal cost (forge sounds, unspoken name, childhood laughter). Protagonist agency drives every turn; coincidence (tremor) complicates but doesn’t resolve. The third anchor’s “greater tithe” forces a decisive trade that crystallizes his stance: endurance through sacrifice. Cost is unmistakable in his “thinned voice” and the elders’ silent witnessing.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—measuring and redistributing the weight of withheld truth—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the protagonist chooses to redirect fear rather than contain it. Escalation is driven by agency: tapping the shard, splitting attention across worlds, attuning breath to unseal. Cost is unmistakable: gravity “in my teeth,” orbits narrowed by silence, relief tasted only after voices are released. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving intangible safety against institutional erasure—is signaled early and deepens when automation threatens. The skipper’s agency manifests in quiet resistance: ferrying letters, stacking stones, oiling paper. Each act narrows options (he cannot stop automation but can subvert its archive). Cost is unmistakable: Doyle’s averted eyes, sketches removed, kettle unboiling—all mark irreversible loss crystallized in the final Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—shaping dawn from ancient shadows—is signaled early and tightens when the gyre pivots toward the harbor after her “accidentally prophetic” laugh. Agency drives escalation: she actively unspools the wick, cools it, scratches runes, and laughs at pitch. Cost is unmistakable: the town’s vulnerability (doused lights), her physical strain (“throat swallowing joy and fear”), and the risk of missteering catastrophe. The gyre’s redirection is earned, not coincidental.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding why some magnetize stories—is signaled early and deepens into a personal reckoning with receptivity versus assertion. Escalation occurs through the dye master’s layered demonstrations (wing, mirror, cloth), each narrowing the narrator’s options from inquiry to embodiment. The cost is legible: relinquishing the desire for fixed answers (“fewer moving parts”) to embrace iridescent caution. Protagonist agency drives every turn—they hold the wing, track light, taste the tea—and the heart’s changed “stride” marks a decisive internal shift under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—translating sorrow into navigable form—tightens when the pin-drop moment forces triangulation, narrowing options to ledger, sextant, and listening. Protagonist agency drives escalation: deconstructing the sextant, mapping dreams, asking the trees aloud. Cost is felt in bodily wear (“ache in my knees”), tool degradation (“spidered with cracks”), and emotional exposure (“embarrassingly tender” motive). The storm’s pause isn’t coincidence but earned pressure-cooker stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—rekindling the dying realm through woven dawns—is signaled early and tightens when the mica window cracks, forcing tighter weaves to “survive sorrow.” Protagonist agency drives escalation: she initiates the villagers’ song, catches dawn threads, and stretches the cloth outward. Cost is unmistakable: “I am emptied,” and fear remains “as thin and cutting as mica.” Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, deepening via communal song and root-braiding until the horizon “shakes off its winter cowl.”

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—mending grief without misplacing it—is signaled early and tightens when Mara practices “staying while leaving,” which forecloses her recluse identity. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her choice to enter, then to close eyes and feel, alters knowledge (“tears found a slow, safe ford”). Cost is unmistakable: she must publicly admit error via note, risking shame. The “nested paradox” framework deepens stakes without resolving them mechanically.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—resisting urban erasure by finding sacred in ordinary—is signaled early and tightens when morning threatens officials, forcing strategic recloaking. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing what to leave visible embodies their core conflict between preservation and exposure. Cost is unmistakable in Maro’s herb-selling compromise and Keziah’s widow anecdote, culminating in the group’s admission of complicity. The “heuristically gentle” plan forecloses violent resistance, making their quiet rituals higher-stakes under surveillance.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving vows against entropy—tightens through three projections, each raising cost: recoverable wedding (warmth), broken stewardship (loss), fragile library oath (tremor requiring intervention). Protagonist agency drives escalation: they *choose* to revise metadata, transforming passive archiving into active negotiation with oblivion. Final test of their personal vow crystallizes stakes—“meaning keeps arriving like weather”—making endurance itself the high-cost action. Coincidence never resolves; gravity and time are patient antagonists.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—capturing “the sound of trust breaking”—is signaled early and deepens through the narrator’s tactical use of silence and false starts, which narrow the partner’s options until his belt buckle betrays him. Escalation is driven entirely by protagonist agency under Accumulative pressure; coincidence (boat horn) complicates but doesn’t resolve. Cost is unmistakable: she gains understanding but forfeits vengeance, and the partner’s unmoored breathing shows irreversible exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding why people carry weather—is signaled early and deepens into moral weight (“memory needs legs”). Protagonist agency drives escalation: tasting air → interpreting flavors → commanding convergence. Cost is visceral (“bruise” of belief, “storm debt” in pockets) and culminates in communal release. The tightening—from personal doubt to collective reckoning—narrows options to one necessary act: spilling skies at the bluff’s spine.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—uncorking suppressed creativity before it “ferments into silence”—tightens decisively when the spindle snaps, forcing improvisation beyond mechanical solutions. Protagonist agency drives escalation: recalling combination numbers (memory as tool), removing the painting (rejecting surface solutions), threading the string (trusting Lio’s method). Cost is unmistakable: “relief that hurts,” the terror of blankness, breath paid as rent. Under Accumulative lens, pressure deepens via sensory density (graphite maps → mica book → rusted tin) until the niche’s opening reconfigures stakes from retrieval to offering.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost conversations—is signaled early and escalates through protagonist agency: finding the plate, prying floorboards, confessing at the Ear. Each act narrows options (sealing vents, paying with candor) and raises personal cost (wilted wrists, boxed cruelty). The tightening culminates in a trade: honesty for access, reconfiguring what “delivery” means. Coincidence never resolves; pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder’s color—is signaled early and deepens when the iceberg sweats, forcing adaptation (basins, reed channels). Mara’s agency drives escalation: she tunes by shadow-tilt, signs for help, integrates water into percussion. Cost is felt in the fragment’s melt (precious loss) and her voice dimming into insistence. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each addition (wind, water, crowd response) reweights truth’s fragility without coincidence resolving tension.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—resolving inner static through controlled burn—tightens when magnetic shift destabilizes the dome, forcing the caretaker to choose between preserving the archive or escaping its stasis. Protagonist agency drives escalation: drawing fire corridors, remapping vents, miniaturizing self. Cost is unmistakable in the breached dome, heat-curling paint, and abandoned museum-self. The “controlled burn escape” concept isn’t abstract; it reweights every tactic, culminating in fire as door rather than destruction—a deepening earned by prior choreography of heat.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—proving listening heals—is signaled early and deepens when external pressure (inspector, drone) threatens to override communal patience. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she orchestrates storytelling, delays opening, and leverages the locket’s clue only after collective memory crystallizes. Cost is unmistakable: fines loom, trust frays, and Maria’s isolation echoes in present anxiety. The tightening—kettle’s second whistle—narrows options to either cut or listen, forcing a trade-off between efficiency and healing that reweights the entire premise.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—liberating drowned minds through encoded resistance—is signaled early and deepens via the journal entries’ evolving syntax. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: each dance, each roll of the dice tightens the weave until the daemon itself is repurposed. Cost is visceral: Sora’s execution haunts every move, and survival blurs with memory (“I cannot tell”). The final liberation carries conceptual weight—revolt hums in routine—and forecloses return to passive compliance.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—recovering what was deleted—is signaled early and escalates through Ilya’s agency: reading grounds, unlocking the chamber, exhume cubes. The tightening occurs when gravity’s fluctuation enables temporary return of memory, forcing him to act before it desiccates. Cost is visible in the irreversible loss of the woman’s name and the town’s dependence on his ritual. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with each crystal deepening the emotional and conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preventing an unready door from opening—is signaled early and escalates texturally: the prophecy’s syllables rise like mist, demanding intervention. The summoner’s agency drives deepening; his choice to “change the flow” rather than block it narrows options into precise, costly acts (listening, mapping silence). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where “not every hinge should be found by longing.” Cost is unmistakable: eternal vigilance where others sleep, honored only by the night’s brighter quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—learning to hear what structures withhold—is signaled early and deepens through tactile ritual (wax, seal, tea). Agency manifests in quiet attention: the narrator answers the building with “a small truth wrapped in courtesy,” narrowing options toward sustained engagement. Cost is felt in emotional vulnerability (“comic ache in my molars”) and the burden of “borrowed authority.” Escalation arises not from external threat but intensifying intimacy with silence.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—translating isolation into independence—is signaled early and deepens when the shell’s whisper manifests Reina’s face. Protagonist agency drives escalation: unsleeving the glass, carrying the shell through archives, placing it in the niche. Cost is unmistakable in the narrator’s bones ringing as hinges answer, sacrificing solitary guardianship for relational passage. The tightening forecloses hoarding grief, forcing release as the only humane protocol.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether to complete the mentor’s unfinished work in a way that unbinds without shattering—is signaled early and deepens through the protagonist’s calibrated acts. Escalation occurs via agency: raising the key reveals the hinge; writing the counterstroke enacts mercy; refusing the final hinge accepts limitation. Each move narrows options and carries cost—the blood-prick, the sleepless guilds now freed to choose, the unopened door in their own name. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative/Textural lens, culminating in a reweighted social contract felt in “lighter” air and foundries learning “the art of pausing.”

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—why some echo, others swallow names—is signaled early and deepens into a revelation about voice-as-commodity. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: her progressive disclosure compels the council’s incremental answers, culminating in her vow to sing for stolen halves. Cost is unmistakable: the council flees, but she carries only resonance, having relinquished the physical shell. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via textual density, not causality, and the final stance crystallizes with quiet force.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—salvaging purity from erasure—tightens when the narrator chooses exposure over vengeance. Agency drives escalation: dream analysis yields location, location yields globe, globe yields name. Cost is felt in the “wobbling star” reflection and the weight-turned-direction of the globe. Coincidence never resolves; pressure builds via the narrator’s methodical stitching of fragile truths.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—survival vs. mercy—is signaled early (“hunger does not love riddles”) and deepens when the philosopher reframes theft as pattern-learning. Agency drives escalation: Li chooses to follow moon paths; Yazhen cuts nets to save turtles; elders touch repaired mesh and feel cost. The tightening occurs when moon-loop seams are stitched—foreclosing old habits with “subtle ache.” Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from character choice under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—truth versus protective myth—is signaled early and deepens when the narrator intuits Stillwater’s engineering. The meaningful tightening occurs when he holds the diamond and understands why thieves lose their maps: truth disorients. His agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves conflict. Cost is unmistakable: his professional identity must accommodate omission, foreclosing pure debunking. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, culminating in a Charged Poise ending.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—forging variant allegiance into coherent resistance—tightens when cutters attack, then fractures when traitors crack the glass, forcing the narrator to deploy ancestral lullabies as weaponized sound. Agency drives escalation: sending Kestrel with riddles, threading ash-toned music into broadcasts, opening the vault. Cost is unmistakable: Kestrel’s burned shoulder, the spidered portico, the council’s bought betrayal. The final “braid of choices” crystallizes under pressure without coincidence resolving conflict—luck (lightning favoring the portico) complicates but doesn’t solve.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—translating generational silence—is signaled early and tightens when the keeper’s death leaves “silences rough as rope.” Protagonist agency drives escalation: he chooses to restore the melody, gift the jar, and braid sounds during the storm. Cost is unmistakable—the loft’s vulnerability, his exposed grief—and crystallizes in the Charged Poise ending where “Kin” forecloses isolation. Coincidence (fox, storm) complicates but never resolves; the widow’s arrival stems from his deliberate gift.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—protecting sonic absolution from commodification—is signaled early and deepens when the Collector demands proof. Protagonist’s agency drives escalation: opening the vault is a high-cost gamble that forces vibrational matching, altering both characters’ trajectories. The tightening forecloses theft as an option and crystallizes moral stance: absolution cannot be sold, only shared through vulnerability. Cost is unmistakable in mutual weeping and abandoned greed.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—trading speed for patience—is signaled early and tightens when the council demands tribute before thaw. Protagonist agency drives escalation: the lunar demonstration forces a trade-off (risk stillness or lose tools/lives). Cost is visceral: unyoking dogs defies survival instinct, and failure means returning “barren” to old ways. The magnetic viaduct’s hunger literalizes stakes, making abstract patience concretely perilous.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—truth versus institutional erasure—is signaled early and intensifies through protagonist agency: she reads tool marks, times escape routes, and contacts outsiders. The tightening occurs when she discovers the contractor’s link to the director, forcing a moral trade-off. Cost is unmistakable: “names my director warns me ruin careers.” Pressure remains coherent under an Accumulative lens, with each observation deepening the ethical weight without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—turning apology into deserved trust—is signaled early and deepens when Mara proposes using donated boxes for victims’ families. The chaplain’s agency drives escalation: his plan forecloses easy absolution, demanding sustained work. Cost is visible: Hector’s ongoing labor, potential rejection by the girl, and the chaplain’s moral burden. Pressure coheres under the Hybrid lens—textural accumulation (storm/hush) crystallizes into causal action (apprenticeship plan).

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—ringing the unheard bell—is signaled early and deepens via the yearning algorithm’s evolution. The tightening occurs when the map “dares me not to follow,” narrowing options to flight or stagnation. Agency drives escalation: Sera chooses to bolt wings, ride drafts, pull the clapper. Cost is felt in irreversible transformation—knuckles to levers, solitude to kinship—and the conceptual price of creating meaning no one yet receives.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—truth versus managed forgetting—is signaled early and deepens when Lia’s deletions expose corporate complicity. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her lie unlocks the vault, her interpretation of the patch retrieves the ledger, her refusal to export preserves integrity at personal cost. The tightening forecloses legal recourse but opens moral resonance; price is visible in her isolation and the weight of complicity (“lie is heavier now”). Coincidence (bus ad) complicates but doesn’t resolve—it echoes systemic recurrence.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—translating empathy into actionable paths—tightens when the shard cuts the keeper’s thumb during hesitation, forcing commitment over posture. Escalation is protagonist-driven: repairing the globe enables the envoys’ promises, which demand physical follow-through (“walk with each team”). Cost is unmistakable—stranded children, hungry arrivals, the keeper’s ankle-deep slush labor. Coincidence (the pause like snowlight) complicates but doesn’t resolve; agency lies in seizing the breath before reply.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—learning endings’ sound—tightens when trawling reveals that loss has vocabulary (“consonants of collapse”), escalating to the ice-crack climax where “ending arriving and not arriving” crystallizes the narrator’s stance. Agency drives escalation: signing up for relief work, choosing ropes over pens, postponing the appointment—all narrow options with visible cost (clinic room waiting, unmoored past). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each rescue (photo, boy) deepens the fold of patience until refusal becomes active creation. Coincidence (storm debris) complicates but doesn’t resolve; insight comes through labor.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—whether love requires fixing or companioning—is signaled early and deepens through the traveler’s confession and the sentinel’s parables. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: the sentinel chooses to share the letter, pour wine, offer pruning wisdom. Cost is unmistakable—the libation poured into soil, the admission of lost certainty—and tightens options toward the traveler’s phone call. Coincidence (the traveler’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from earned perspective shift.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving wisdom’s echo without caging it—is signaled early and deepens through two clearings that narrow options: each consecrated space forecloses generic sanctuary in favor of tailored stillness. Agency lies in attention and knot-tying, not grand acts, yet carries cost: Lio’s trauma, the woman’s decades of silence, the risk of echo bruising. Pressure accumulates texturally (whispers → threads → hush) until the echo’s arrival reweights everything. Coincidence never resolves; the prophet’s absence intensifies the need for human stewardship.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transmuting communal pain into breathable remembrance—is signaled early and deepens when storm threatens the arcs, forcing heavier twine and collective reinforcement. Protagonist agency drives escalation: spiral marking, photo placement, inviting children’s naming. Cost is unmistakable: Ole’s trauma revisited, Marta’s intergenerational labor honored, the town’s self-recognition (“mirrors stopped being glass”). Coincidence (storm) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems from shared action.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—whether culture can grow without fresh definitions—is signaled early and deepens through the scholar’s method of listening, culminating in his testimony. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: he chooses to borrow, hum, map, and finally present his “fractured sequences” to authority. Cost is unmistakable: he risks professional censure for an unprovable thesis, and the custodians’ ambiguous reaction implies possible rejection. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies through layered echoes and ivy metaphors, not external antagonism, which fits the story’s contemplative design.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—capturing the sound of growing older—is signaled immediately and deepens through protagonist-driven escalation: first arranging driftwood, then inscribing stone, finally sitting in the amphitheater’s listening hollow. Each action narrows options (e.g., obeying his future self’s chalk command not to rewind) and incurs cost (memories “falling before they had somewhere to land”). Pressure tightens when the tide shifts his arrows, forcing reliance on eroding signs—a tangible consequence of his condition. The climax isn’t resolved by luck but by endurance: he accepts that aging is perpetual departure, and the cost is legible in his kiss to the recorder, an object now heavy with irreplaceable sound.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—harnessing the ephemeral before it slips—tightens when the spinning hand smears capture during comet passage. Protagonist agency drives escalation: rethreading fiber, swapping boards, and using the leaf method foreclose brute-force fixes. Cost is unmistakable: Lina’s escape velocity, calcified days feared, and the governor’s “private drift” mirroring human resistance. Thermal tides and quakes raise pressure coherently under Accumulative lens, culminating in the hand’s “earned” discipline.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reunification before death—is signaled early and escalates through the therapist’s agency: calling Lena, transporting Ruth, hymning mundanity to build emotional space. The tightening occurs when Lena arrives, forcing the sisters’ fragile reconciliation under literal and metaphorical sky-pressure. Cost is unmistakable: Ruth’s exhaustion, Lena’s “wet cheeks,” the shard’s history of violence now repurposed as bridge. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from deliberate acts of kindness with physical/emotional toll.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding where shadows go—is signaled early and deepens into a moral test: to learn without taking. The tightening occurs when the Archivist reveals shadows are fuel, forcing the scholar to choose between knowledge and ethics. Agency is exercised through renunciation (“I do not pull them free”), which forecloses a path with felt cost (surrendering direct access to truth). Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, escalating through ritual density rather than external conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—restoring truth to grief—tightens when the tooth unlocks the maze, forcing descent into myth. Protagonist agency drives escalation: measuring the decoy, following grass, pressing bone on fox. Cost is felt in winter’s misjudgment and redeemed only through earned listening. The garden’s rules (“borrowed children when adults forgot how to listen”) create coherent pressure that crystallizes stance without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—sharing light without harming night creatures—is signaled early and tightens decisively at the pearl’s discovery: keep it (mirror-sea, fading songs) or release it (storms return, voices carry). Protagonist agency drives escalation—they choose neither extreme but integrate the pearl into the sea-glass network, reweighting silence as connective tissue. Cost is unmistakable: personal communion with stars remains forfeited (“I do not ask for the sky back”), yet community gains a tidal language. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, deepening via texture, not plot twists.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—transforming silence from bruise to sustenance—is signaled early and deepens through tactile labor: stitching moss, stringing the pendant, grafting river cuttings. The tightening occurs when the narrator rejects public bravery (“bravery feels different with a camera turned away”) and commits to “practice, a daily rebalancing.” Cost is felt in the withheld voice (“Maybe later”) and the physical vulnerability of open wounds on steel racks. Agency drives every escalation—no coincidence, only deliberate repurposing of pain into shelter.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—collecting shapes of hope to prove passage through doubt—tightens decisively when the girl reframes mercy as erasure, forcing the narrator to confront his avoidance. His agency drives escalation: he moves deeper against the current, accepts the knot of refusal-to-slip, and ultimately chooses truth over comfort. Cost is unmistakable: grief braided with gratitude, legs shaking in shallows, the irreversible admission that his quieting harmed characters. The river’s pivot toward an “easy ending” tests his resolve, and his resistance crystallizes the moral calculus—authentic hope requires wind, not shelter.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring a strained covenant with place—is signaled early and tightens when “something snagged like a burr,” demanding realignment of the shadow wheel. Agency lies in collective rotation and Lio’s linguistic adaptation (“tree’s grammar”). Cost is felt in the moon’s lingering reluctance and the precision required to speak the vow “in the right direction.” Escalation is textural, not causal, but fully coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—finding Fen before “white noise took his name”—tightens when the plate yields only a tentative cartography, forcing reliance on braided pulses. The meaningful deepening occurs when she prints the path: a trade-off between preserving starlight (sealing the jar) and risking its depletion for clarity. Agency drives escalation—each flash-paper pulse is a deliberate sacrifice—and cost is felt in the “hesitations” she reads like a pulse. Coincidence (raven clack) complicates but doesn’t resolve; pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—harvesting echoes to rebuild time—is signaled early and deepens when the locksmith realizes parts alone won’t suffice; the device needs “a tempo harvested from the cave itself.” This forces a costly pivot: he must trade mechanical precision for resonant attunement, risking incomprehensible time. Agency drives escalation—he baits echoes, adjusts balance wheels, files gear trains—all narrowing options toward a single fragile solution. The price is legible: future clocks will be “softened by mercy,” sacrificing accuracy for wisdom, a permanent recalibration of his craft’s purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—weighing burdens to share their weight—tightens decisively when the valley personified demands weighing “the cost of staying against... leaving the weights behind.” Protagonist agency drives escalation: orienting the lamp one degree north unlocks hidden grief; aligning it with the water-star reconfigures the entire burden system. Cost is unmistakable: staying binds, but the binding becomes purpose. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each shingle-click adds density until the valley’s sigh releases legible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—containing what refuses containment—is signaled early and deepens through carving. Agency lies in attention: she chooses to shape grief rather than flee it. Cost is visible in her aching wrist and the bittersweet act of placing his mane in a cage that opens. Escalation occurs via density (sugar, steam, shavings) not external conflict, fitting the Accumulative lens perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether to restart the carousel—tightens through three escalating costs: ecological (drifting pontoons), psychological (resuming “grinding chores of hunger”), and existential (being “swallowed by rhythm that erased us”). Mara’s agency drives deepening: each story fragment alters her negotiation stance, culminating in her counteroffer to “tend stories, not gears.” The ghost’s demand for a hoarded memory forces a trade-off that crystallizes her commitment. Cost is legible in the paid tribute—her floating library vow—and the carousel’s shudder of acknowledgment.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—rebuilding hope as a physical system—is signaled early and deepens when Mara chooses repair over documentation, action over analysis. Escalation is driven by her agency: rerouting cables, threading tubing, aiming light—all narrowing options through material limits (corroded valves, weak charge). Cost is unmistakable: time spent alone, energy diverted from easier tasks, the vulnerability of opening doors to strangers. The boy’s question crystallizes stakes into social consequence, not just engineering triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reconciling abandoned musical dreams with sanctuary vows—is signaled early and deepens when rain-script questions the scribe’s silence. Agency drives escalation: his choice to smuggle the bell, then stroke it “excruciatingly gentle,” forces a trade-off between fidelity to duty and self-expression. Cost is unmistakable: the anthem “rusted into a lullaby,” the dream narrowed to a “threadbare music” that barely exists. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each sensory layer (petrichor, droplets, breath) tightens the thematic knot until the sanctuary’s expansion crystallizes his stance.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—exposing the “architecture of lies” behind the flood—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency: aligning sundial scratches with ledger initials forces the heron-like “hindsight clarity” that reconfigures everything. Cost is unmistakable: the watchman’s pawned badge, morphine dependence, ruined attic; the narrator’s risk of confrontation. The tightening at sluice gates forecloses ignorance, demanding public witness. Coincidence never resolves; even the foreman’s arrival is met with tactical rearrangement, not flight.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving woven knowledge—is signaled early and deepens when the council’s deadline forces urgency. The tightening turn (“dock taken down before the thaw”) narrows options: translate quickly or lose everything. Protagonist agency drives escalation—he teaches knot-reading, enabling the fisherman’s council defense. Cost is felt in time scarcity, physical fragility of fulgurite, and emotional weight of “language scattered like gulls.”

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—naming the living dead to map healing—is signaled early and deepens when Mira requests her husband’s obituary mid-voyage. The tightening occurs when the narrator shifts from observer to participant (“we compose his obituary”), foreclosing detachment. Protagonist agency drives escalation: projection enables empathy, which demands co-creation, which necessitates staying. Cost is felt in the relinquished hope of return, crystallized in the unopened door metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reawakening beauty against mechanical orthodoxy—is signaled early and deepens when the Keepers demand the egg’s confiscation, forcing a trade-off between compliance and conscience. The tightening occurs at refusal: “the only prayer I had left that did not use a spring as scripture.” Protagonist agency drives escalation—his assembly, his storytelling, his confrontation—and each act narrows options while raising conceptual cost. Final recalibration isn’t victory but survival with music, paid for in inherited compromise.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—proving scars can sing—is signaled early and deepens through grafting, each union dusted with black sand to “remember heat.” Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her method (coin on red thread) locates wind paths, enabling precise grafts that narrow options (only certain trunks qualify). The boy’s arrival introduces relational pressure, testing her stance without resolving it mechanically. Cost is unmistakable: her moon-white scar, his wrapped forearm, the emotional labor of whispering apologies to burned wood—all alter tactics and crystallize her commitment to mercy over fire.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (liberating memories to wake the city) tightens when the cartographer’s map fails, forcing reliance on glass breadcrumbs—a credible loss that alters tactics. Protagonist agency drives escalation: whispering, prying, confessing. Cost is unmistakable in the secret’s extraction (“pitch gave with a sigh”) and the father-memory’s passage. The “defiant hush” stance crystallizes under pressure, foreclosing passive waiting.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—sharing light without fire—is signaled early and deepens when the stranger arrives with a scorched gear, forcing a choice between isolation and transmission. The tightening occurs when they rebuild the orrery together: a live option (keeping tradition solitary) is foreclosed. Cost is unmistakable: her people only knew escape; his sentimentality risked irrelevance. Their joint act transforms “transit” from astronomical passage to ethical practice, with visible emotional and cultural price paid in the lagoon of tender darkness.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—giving form to nameless communal grief—is signaled early and deepens through protagonist agency: tying ribbons, reciting poems, untying the braid. Pressure tightens when the grandmother’s spectral guidance demands vulnerability over control. The decisive turn (“loosen the braid”) narrows options by rejecting monumentality for permeability. Cost is felt in the hollows carved into stone and the quiet endurance required to hold space for others’ losses.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—restoring shared balance through precise timekeeping—is signaled early and deepens when the winder confronts his own unabsolved harm. Agency drives escalation: he reads the handle, weighs pellets, removes shots. The cost is unmistakable: enduring his father’s death as unrepented debt while the town unknowingly suffers. His choice to delay self-forgiveness tightens options, making the final tuning a moral act under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding why the dead lean into the living—is signaled early and deepens when the echo shapes into the chess tutor’s unfinished resignation. Rowan’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to set up the board, fill the empty seat, and let the clock run, transforming passive listening into active restitution. Cost is unmistakable: he shoulders the tutor’s unspent apology, altering the town’s inherited narrative. The single tightening—completing the half-square king move—forecloses the path of unresolved shame with quiet authority.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—seeding innovation within constraint—is signaled early and deepens when the Council demands “a billboard of certainty.” The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: modeling bendable scenarios, marking “fogs” and “breaks,” proposing civic laboratories. Cost is unmistakable: the city must accept ignorance as irrigation source, sacrificing the illusion of control—a trade-off dramatized in the Council’s softened resistance and agreed-upon order.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reviving story after famine—is signaled early and tightens when the broadcast falters and searchlights threaten. Mara’s agency drives escalation: she unshawls the radio, taps a reply, cuts lamps, teaches seams to listeners. Cost is unmistakable: danger from patrols, vulnerability of open transmission, and the fragility of dust-formed figures. The deepening—from solitary tuning to communal humming—narrows options: silence is no longer tenable. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; coincidence (storm of strings) complicates but doesn’t resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—crystallizing fleeting emotion to release it—is signaled early and deepens when Soren requests an unspoken forgiveness. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing to draw omitted truths, tear the portrait, and scatter ash into the mask forecloses permanence with visible cost (Soren’s flinch, abandoned name). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; each beat layers shadow until the mask “holds tiny sunsets.” Coincidence never resolves; the mirage of safety sharpens the moral calculus of letting go.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving navigational truth against competing narratives—tightens decisively when the protagonist refuses both factions’ offers, forcing him to teach children instead. His agency drives escalation: diving deeper, copying ledgers, choosing “the third way.” Cost is unmistakable: continued exile, raw-handed apprentices, and the ever-present brine threatening his workshop. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens—each layer of sediment mirrors layers of historical erasure he combats.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—braiding voices to face each other without flinching—is signaled early and deepens when Reza’s trauma erupts (“wanted to swing”). The teacher’s agency drives escalation: rotating the rosette’s nick toward fear forces a trade-off between safety and connection. Cost is unmistakable: the nurse admits she “almost turned back,” Reza carries violence in his lungs. Under Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through subtractive method until harmony becomes tangible bridge “across unlearning hatred.”

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reviving beauty amid enforced forgetting—is signaled early and deepens when Kye arrives, raising emotional stakes (intergenerational rebellion). The meaningful tightening occurs during pruning: each cut edits “grief without punctuation,” narrowing options to active creation. Agency drives escalation (protagonist initiates planting, cooking, sharing), and cost is felt in the bartered memory and Kye’s tears. Coincidence (celestial alignment) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the seed’s awakening stems from deliberate acts under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder against algorithmic sterility—is signaled early and deepens when drones “forgot surprise.” The keeper’s agency drives escalation: he chooses truth over coins, reveals the riddle, and offers the bee-hum coil. Cost is unmistakable: they risk institutional failure for a lyrical fix, and Mara’s laugh carries unresolved peril (“near the cliff’s edge”). Coincidence complicates (blackout) but resolution stems from character choices under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring displaced attention—is signaled early and deepens through protagonist agency: each object repositioned narrows the path from observation to communion. Escalation occurs via accumulating misplacements until the crate of weather bottles forces a conceptual shift (someone was “collecting the weather”). Cost is felt in the uncaught photograph and the hush vial’s transformation, though the absence of explicit interpersonal pressure slightly limits visceral stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—replacing certainty with nuanced care—is signaled early (“ask what nuance wants”) and tightens through protagonist agency: threading messages through cracks, sending the ampoule to the bishop. Each escalation (ampoule discovery, amphora dialogue, vault collapse) narrows options toward listening-as-rebuilding. Cost is unmistakable: children turned brittle, buildings buckled, refugees guided by regret. The final trade-off—abandoning fixed beauty for fluid empathy—is earned and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—capturing the texture of a missed opportunity—is signaled early and tightens through the wager with the staircase. Protagonist agency drives escalation: he writes proofs, rolls dice, speaks her name, presents his theorem. Cost is unmistakable: eternal climbing sustained by regret, yet chosen. The “bargain” crystallizes stakes without coincidence; pressure accumulates texturally until the rupture offers a fleeting second chance he does not take.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—keeping lost languages alive through acts of recognition—is signaled early and deepens as each stranger deciphers fragments. Pressure escalates texturally: courier → violinist → nurse → janitor → boy, each adding proof to Anya’s ledger. Agency lies in Anya’s nightly ritual; her choices (offering tea, painting glyphs) foreclose isolation with quiet cost (sleeplessness, labor). Coincidence complicates (footsteps arrive) but never resolves—the brush’s magic requires her deliberate rousing.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—rescuing dying arts from erasure—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the second lens arrives, transforming passive waiting into a crossing. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing dawn, gathering displaced persons, reading spray through nested lenses. Cost is unmistakable: wax runs low, bas-reliefs vanish into night-maps, and “waiting felt like erasure.” The beekeeper’s absence isn’t coincidence—it removes honeyed light, forcing reliance on bread and memory, raising emotional and tactical stakes without resolving them externally.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—to step beyond fate’s design for a heartbeat—is signaled early and deepens into stewardship over spectacle. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: reverse-engineering the yoyo, rewinding clocks, redirecting the beam inward. Each choice narrows options (e.g., binding yoyo to pendulum forecloses outward rescue). Cost is unmistakable: feeding regrets to the stone, accepting ships arrive unseen, living in margins. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens, with cadence shifts (time slowing, waves as equations) intensifying thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—tricking fear into revealing its weakness—is signaled early and deepens through the protagonist’s agency: confessing love, speaking the ringmaster’s name, turning sideways in the booth. Pressure tightens once decisively when the shutter clicks and fear appears, narrowing options to confrontation or flight; the narrator chooses exposure. Cost is unmistakable: drowning memory, river coins in lungs, the lock of a mouth with no key—all paid before the final act. Coincidence complicates (booth yawns open) but resolution is earned through confession.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—turning destructive force into dialogue—is signaled early and tightens when the “long backed creature of water” threatens sundering. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: he devises, tests, and adjusts his sonic countermeasure in real time. Cost is unmistakable in the physical toll (“metronome of ankles and wrists”) and emotional weight (“vow returned like a bassline”). The swell’s softening isn’t luck but earned resonance, foreclosing brute resistance as an option.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—questioning the silent watchers—is signaled early and deepens when the protagonist learns truth bears “such a mouth.” Escalation is driven by agency: cracking the seal, blowing the whistle, interpreting hexagonal glare. Cost is unmistakable—the expedition’s braiding into paths, the teacher’s cadence in backwash—and reweights the final stance: “not safe, but oriented.” Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural logic, with each motif narrowing emotional and navigational options.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. peace—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Tomas chooses collaboration over complicity. Protagonist agency drives escalation: Mara’s parallel-drawing unlocks the shaft, forcing Tomas’s stance crystallization (“we will build”). Cost is unmistakable: the town’s “polite” stability shatters, replaced by the burden of memory. Under causal lens, each turn narrows options—once the whistle calls neighbors, noble lies cannot be reburied.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving interlaced absence against erasure—is signaled early and deepens through the act of writing into wounds. Agency manifests via attention-as-resistance; each note forecloses anonymity with tangible cost (“fingers burn,” “lime and patience”). Pressure tightens as tide drops then returns, forcing rhythmic urgency. The final turn—“I will keep rowing back”—crystallizes stance under coherent environmental pressure, with no coincidence resolving tension.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—truth versus manufactured history—is signaled early and deepens via the kelp-frond pattern shift. Agency drives escalation: the indexer’s fieldwork pivot (“weighing their sound”) narrows options until only one path remains—indexing with integrity. Cost is unmistakable: foregoing personal vengeance to preserve archival honesty. The smooth crescent’s exposure forecloses easy justice but affirms intellectual resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—transforming luminous torment into bearable memory—tightens when the keeper demands a thousand cranes for “lift,” foreclosing passive mourning. Protagonist agency drives escalation: polishing gems, folding letters, tethering cranes to waist. Cost is unmistakable: “palms hold the future like a nest” implies sacrifice of personal solace for communal remembrance. Coincidence never resolves; even the shadow’s return stems from earned ritual, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—whether to harvest unused potential—is signaled early and deepens when the spectral map reveals the valley at the crater rim. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: they choose to stabilize the readout with the geode, then publish coordinates while locking access. Cost is unmistakable—the grant’s disappointment, the board’s demand, ghosts denied rest—and the final trade-off (mercy over miracle) narrows future options under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes are clear from line one: decode belonging before “night swallows our names.” Pressure escalates via protagonist agency—the drone release, cord pull, calibration—not coincidence. The meaningful deepening occurs when the pilot realizes the chip casts “spaces that hold” letters, shifting tactics from recovery to embodiment. Cost is felt in lost names, spilled water-like absence, and the pilgrim’s decades of unintended borders; the final route is drawn in blanks, foreclosing easy return.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the withheld truth about his own erased lineage—is signaled early and deepens when he learns he too was bartered. The tightening occurs when he leverages the slat despite his master’s warning, accepting irreversible exposure. Agency is clear: every action (sifting, pressing, writing) narrows his options. Cost is conceptual (his manufactured identity collapses) and tactical (he can no longer practice his trade).

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—exchanging prisoners through truthful language—is signaled early and escalates when Daro refuses to cross until named, forcing protagonist agency (handing ledger to Neris). This deepening narrows options: only precise apology enables release. Cost is unmistakable—the protagonist’s chest “holds their breath,” guards bark impatience, and pride is explicitly traded for time. The moon’s “patient arithmetic” imposes external pressure that coheres under the Accumulative lens, making each crossing feel earned and fragile.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reconciling regret over the barge accident—is signaled early and tightens when he confesses the “pure” truth. Pressure escalates via internal conflict (rewritten stories vs. honesty) and external cue (sister waiting). The meaningful deepening occurs mid-channel: admitting “I marked a bearing wrong, proud and tired.” Cost is felt in his retreat into “chores that looked like devotion” and crystallizes in the vulnerability of confession.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—kindling empathy through personal reckoning—is signaled early and deepens when the sentinel demands confession, forcing the protagonist to trade secrecy for the vial. Escalation is driven by his agency: choosing to confess the arson, then releasing the glow in the market. Cost is unmistakable in the “bruised bright” water marking unretractable clauses and his ribs practicing openness without resolution. Pressure tightens coherently under the Accumulative lens via pattern intensification (newspaper lines → ripples → new maps).

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—reforging a bond beyond death—is signaled immediately and deepens through the reluctant metamorphosis. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: he chooses to barter with spices, beg beasts, ingest the fortune, and surrender his human frame. Cost is unmistakable: “bones protest, heavy with human weather,” yet he steps into feathers. The tightening forecloses human return; the trade-off (hands for wings) crystallizes in the final kiss “like comets.” Coincidence never resolves—every turn stems from his choices under coherent magical rules.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost time—is signaled early and deepens when the protagonist realizes she “has been throwing time away like rice.” Agency drives escalation: she chooses to unfasten her coat, pour minutes onto the cloth, trace her daughter’s hand. Cost is unmistakable: “cloudbound repentance thick in the pine air,” gratitude that “nearly breaks” her. The tightening occurs when she understands some minutes belong to strangers—foreclosing selfish recovery for communal atonement.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—opening a locked dimension without wounding—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency: rejecting warhead logic, performing shadow work, using joy to lighten weight for access. The meaningful deepening occurs when grief’s residue becomes navigable data, and the cost is legible in the pricked thumb, bruised silence, and the chamber’s demand for a vow. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with each filament threaded narrowing options toward mercy.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—rescuing the mother—is signaled early via the boy’s cracked oar and mountain gaze. Escalation occurs through Mara’s agency: her detour, bottle deployment, and prior “coincidences” (oar, rope, skiff) converge causally. Cost is felt: neighbors’ labor, volcano’s threat, her spent capital of attention. Coincidence complicates (prophecy, tide timing) but resolution stems from her orchestrated preparation—a deepening that narrows options to one fragile path.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—sparking silent revolution without burning the city—tightens when the wheel’s corroded teeth demand improvisation, forcing the sentinel to sacrifice his quill holder. Agency drives escalation: his “calm inventiveness” directly enables the wheel’s awakening. Cost is unmistakable in the quill’s metamorphosis and the irreversible opening of “permission.” Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens, deepening via sensory density (“light tasted the room first”) rather than external antagonism.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—keeping a promise to “hold the shore in place”—is signaled early and deepens through escalating attempts: primes → Fibonacci → triangles → spelling her name. Each tightening forecloses prior methods; failure visions (“bowl spills”) raise emotional cost. Agency drives escalation: the herder chooses ever-more complex patterns despite precognitive dread. Final success hinges on collaborative action (“we hold the bowl”), crystallizing stance under coherent pressure without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—recovering erased language—is signaled early and deepens when Mara reveals the photographs’ sky-scars mirror Ilya’s redacted lines. The tightening occurs at the thunder’s “in-breath”: Ilya chooses vocalization over silence, risking exposure. Cost is unmistakable—the town’s “stubborn mercy” flickers as witness, implying future vulnerability. Agency drives escalation; coincidence (the envelope) complicates but doesn’t resolve—their meeting catalyzes action they must complete together.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—delivering an unbloodied overture—intensifies coherently under Accumulative pressure. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing not to wound, offering the card, recalibrating the sundial mid-duel. Cost is unmistakable: peace is fragile, dependent on mutual trust (“only if it arrives unbloodied by coercion”). The courier’s shift from soldier to collaborator narrows options—no retreat to pure combat—and crystallizes stance through shared decoding. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from character choice.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—forging beauty from anarchy—is signaled early and tested when developers post “neon threats” turning readers into trespassers. Pressure escalates coherently: patrol car prowls, bars must be pried, rain-chewed roof demands tarp-roof. The meaningful tightening occurs when they choose to rebuild despite legal risk, foreclosing passive resistance. Cost is felt in Mara’s limp, the hidden seeds, the constant vigilance—but the story avoids mechanical payoff, letting tension reside in quiet defiance rather than confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming lost time with Mara—is signaled early via the stopped anniversary clock and intensifies through the pianist’s “steely longing.” Escalation is driven by his agency: he inserts the minute hand into the projector, triggering the arbor’s revelation. The meaningful tightening occurs when he chooses not to demand explanations (“did not ask what price”) but instead winds the broken clock, accepting limited reconciliation. Cost is unmistakable: four fragile beats replace years of silence, and the compasses’ stillness signifies surrendered hope of full restoration. Coincidence (the reel’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve; his actions catalyze every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—protecting cultural memory against erasure—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when the reef treaty is revealed as essential; failure would “sand our truths smooth and generic.” Protagonist agency drives escalation: interpreting dreams, speaking songs, reciting treaties—all choices narrow options or deepen knowledge under the Accumulative lens. Cost is unmistakable: some villagers leave because “forgetting would be kinder,” and doubt remains clarified but not removed, charging the final stance with emotional and conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—finding the color of unspoken apologies—tightens when the lace map demands action (“soften fault lines,” “cut nearly nothing”), forcing trade-offs between silence and expression. Protagonist agency drives escalation: his berry-crushing and pruning redirect pain into form, making sorrow “migrate into curve.” Cost is unmistakable—the rescue boat memory shows Mara’s non-wave, and his voice remains “heavy” even after speaking to the tide.
