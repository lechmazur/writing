  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: dust patterns self-organizing into cosmic symmetry, culminating in the logarithmic spiral that forces Elira's weeping recognition of universal patience. The dominant stake—finding meaning in gradual change versus dramatic cataclysm—tightens through each observation until she must choose between careers.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—finding purpose after catastrophic loss—deepens through the frost-ledger synchrony that reveals the smugglers' mercy. This discovery forecloses her path as commercial artist, visible in her choice to gift rather than sell. The escalation is textural rather than causal, appropriate to the lens, with cost manifest in her acceptance of isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (translating silence into music through thermal mapping) deepens effectively as each fork activation builds toward the symphony of warmth. The cost is felt through the protagonist's emotional response and the implicit loss of her crew/voice. However, the conflict lacks external pressure or meaningful resistance - the method works perfectly on first try.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal curiosity to collective soul-release through the undertaker's agency, with each prism placement building pressure toward the culminating "amber radiance." The cost is legible—he trades any return to the surface for this deeper calling. Minor deduction as the middle section's soul appearances could have shown more resistance or complication before resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (maintaining anonymous solidarity under sanctions) deepens through others joining the practice, with meaningful tightening as resources dwindle yet distribution expands. Cost is legible in "heavier baskets," rationed fuel, vanished imports. The bell-ringing marks stance crystallization with visible price, though agency could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—finding where unused love is stored—deepens through the breathing-based pursuit system. Escalation occurs through narrowing perception: from general twilight to specific "lower left quadrant" to the tear's trajectory traced "not with her eyes, but with her lungs." The final cost of surrender ("curiosity becomes surrender") forecloses the path of active seeking.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (discovering time's texture) escalates through the photographs' disintegration, forcing Elira to accept the garden's parasitic nature. The cost is legible when she loses her memory anchors but gains direct sensory access to time. One meaningful deepening occurs when the halo reveals itself as a wound rather than tool.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes center on breaching the seed vault before the wall falls tomorrow, with clear time pressure. The protagonist's agency drives the decoding sequence and seed scattering despite her chains. The escalation from solving the cipher to filling every available space with seeds shows meaningful deepening, though the raiders' threat remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake (capturing trust's breaking sound before others suffer) is signaled early and deepens through the forge work culminating in success. The cellular countdown adds time pressure ("every division a narrowing window"). The cost is visible in her physical state and the irreversible departure, though the middle lacks a sharp reversal or tightening moment.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes center on whether the thief can successfully reveal hidden connections without being seen, with meaningful deepening as each flower code triggers a reunion. The piece shows two clear instances of her interventions creating transformative moments (man with sunflowers, Arthur reunion). Cost is visible in the emotional weight of connections made, though agency reads more as facilitation than active choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—creating spaces for inquiry versus maintaining control—deepens through her ritual narration and placement of spheres. Escalation reads through accumulation: each sphere placed raises the commitment to abandonment. The cost manifests in leaving her work incomplete, trusting others to find meaning. Pressure could tighten more explicitly in middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from personal identity crisis through betrayal revelation to the confrontation with evidence, with the dominant stake of reclaiming agency after betrayal signaled early and maintained throughout. The tightening occurs when decrypting the cast reveals the mentor's complicity, forcing the choice to burn rather than expose. Cost is legible in the transformation from victim to "someone firmly adaptive," though the resolution's ease (film burns "instantly") slightly reduces tension.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (mapping the endless night) established early and deepens through accumulated silence-summaries. The storm's external pressure contrasts with internal stillness, creating tension. Her final descent forecloses the option of remaining safe, though escalation relies more on accumulation than decisive turns.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake (discovering where thoughts originate) tightens through recursive loops that reveal new layers - from external echoes to internal recognition. The cost is visible when the violin melts and the robot accepts its nature. Escalation through accumulation works, though some loops feel repetitive rather than deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: from Elira's solitary placement of tickets, to keepers emerging, to tactile connection (Tannis tracing, Vorr grounding), culminating in collective humming. The lens's warmth absorbing "withheld truths" provides tangible cost, though the transformation feels slightly too smooth given seven seasons of isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes center on proving reciprocity versus algorithmic control, with the intern's interruption providing concrete external pressure. Her choice to stay and trust intensifies through the "Sector 7 compliance" threat. While the conflict deepens meaningfully, the resolution lacks a sharper trade-off—she wins without visible sacrifice beyond existing isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—proving time moves sideways—escalates from theoretical obsession to embodied encounter when Elira sees her adjacent self, forcing immediate tactical adjustment (the 2.7-degree recalibration). Cost is legible in the other self's terror and warning, though the resolution comes perhaps too easily without lasting consequence beyond the lingering scent.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes intensify through deepening connection with the ghost—from discovering the program to interpreting gestures to synchronized performance. The water's rise and warming provides tactile escalation. Cost is visible in physical exhaustion and emotional saturation, though the conflict lacks external opposition beyond the environment itself.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether to release or carry the swallowed truth—deepens through the oracle's reframing from mass to consequence to endurance. The external gesture of pinning the smudged illustration to let elements revise it represents meaningful agency, though the internal nature of the conflict limits dramatic escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen through textural accumulation: from seeking ghosts to validate truth, to discovering she's the caller, to accepting she must carry guilt without supernatural excuse. The cost crystallizes when she realizes "The ghost shift wasn't spectral labor" but her own mind's machinery—forecloses the path of external absolution.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: from physical descent to temporal dissolution to the keeper's final acceptance. The cost manifests as the keeper being "altered—not broken, not healed, but softened," though the stakes could sharpen through more concrete opposition to the witnessing stance.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving wonder in an increasingly cynical world—establishes early and deepens through the eclipse sequence. Escalation occurs through accumulation as more villagers join the circle, building from one girl to a gathering community. The cost manifests when Elara releases her daughter's curl, a tangible sacrifice of personal memory for collective renewal, though the eclipse's coincidental timing reduces agency in the central turn.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from collecting stories to understanding the displaced axis to actively mending reality's wound. The discovery sequence (diaries→tapestry connection→wall memories) creates meaningful deepening. However, the conflict lacks immediate opposition or cost—the historian faces no obstacles or trade-offs in her discoveries, making the escalation feel frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake of transforming lives through fortunes escalates from individual impacts (fisherman, widow, teenager) to systemic recognition when the analyst arrives with documented patterns. The tension tightens when Elias must choose between maintaining mystery or accepting partnership, with visible cost in relinquishing sole authorship. One meaningful deepening through accumulated evidence of impact.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clear dominant stake: preventing possession through illumination rather than exorcism. Escalation follows the Accumulative lens as each rhetorical question warps the chamber's geometry and confuses the possession. The turning point—realizing the possession mistakes deconstructions for invitations—narrows options to the final question trap. Cost is visible when the chamber transforms and the priest sits alone in a deeper silence, having dispersed rather than destroyed the entity.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake of conducting memory-symphonies before exhaustion creates clear pressure that builds through accumulation of specific memories (mother's kitchen, oak tree, father whistling). The exhaustion constraint genuinely limits her time and forces the final push. Cost is visible in the glass spire vibrating and lake cracking, though the resolution could show more immediate physical/emotional price beyond just smiling at remembering "how to try."

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on self-integration versus fragmentation, with meaningful tightening as each confession dissolves an echo-self and reality "resisted her honesty." The protagonist's agency drives escalation through chosen confessions rather than external force. Cost accumulates visibly through the viaduct cracking and echo-selves merging, though the precise consequences of failure could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from Elara's personal numbness to collective healing through the backward music experiment. The reversal technique forces genuine risk—she could lose her students or deepen their trauma. Cost manifests in vulnerable exposure: "dragged numbness out into the open, where it writhed."

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal unease to systemic corruption ("They're rewriting the maps"). The message creates pressure that forces Elias from passive observation to active investigation. However, the conflict remains largely internal without immediate external opposition testing his resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake of confronting grief deepens through the UV revelation that transforms understanding of memory's physical presence. Agency shown through her choice to open the sealed vial and use the UV lamp purposefully. The cost of seventeen years of avoidance is felt, though the escalation could tighten more dramatically.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding choice versus non-choice—escalates from personal quest to village transformation. The poet's method of "uncovering layers" deepens from physical rope examination to revealing moral complexity. Cost appears in the elder's tears and the village's shift from paralysis to action, though the transformation feels slightly swift.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes center on whether Lira's music can unbind trapped beauty from devastation, with escalation through the greenhouse's progressive response (vines stir→glass hums→beam groans→child descends). The cost is legible in the catalog of losses she plays for, though agency remains primarily observational rather than forcing harder choices.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulative intensity: from arrangement to hesitation to subsumption to destruction, with each phase deepening Vael's engagement with real feeling. The cost is legible (destroying her trade, accepting fractured legacy). Minor deduction for relatively low external pressure—the transformation feels somewhat self-directed rather than forced by circumstances.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation works through accumulative deepening—from five envelopes to discovering more silent contributors to the harbor's transformation. The widening cycle creates meaningful pressure with visible cost in workers' emotional responses. The "cycle had turned" moment effectively tightens stakes through pattern recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—finding kinship through resonance rather than blood—intensifies through Lira's sculptures evolving from pleas to announcements to welcomings. The search for Vesper provides escalation, though the elder's appearance and the arbor revelation arrive somewhat conveniently without sufficient resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through time-borrowing's increasing cost (fatigue to searing pendant) and the giant's near-awakening, forcing riskier choices. The dominant stake—finding where echoes are born before borrowed time collapses—tightens when she overborrows and must sculpt time to prevent catastrophe, though a second reversal or deeper complication could strengthen the middle.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (understanding loss of shared language) signals early and deepens through the equation discovery that reframes absence. The fruit falling into "waiting hands" shows agency, and Elira's choice to use it as compass rather than consume it demonstrates cost. Missing higher bands because the middle lacks a sharper tightening moment—discovery flows too smoothly without forcing harder trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake of visibility/invisibility deepens through the pattern of leaving objects, culminating in the tape fragment that triggers recognition. The cost of continued invisibility versus the risk of emergence creates genuine tension. However, the escalation relies more on accumulation than active pressure, and the power outage doesn't meaningfully tighten options.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as scientific observation fails to decode Lindy, forcing the protagonist to release intellectual control. The cost is legible (abandoning career identity, destroying research) and the final transformation reweights all prior observation. One meaningful deepening that changes knowledge occurs when Lindy glows in response to her surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation: three found objects, seventeen sleepless nights, then the journal discovery that recontextualizes everything. The protagonist's agency drives the exchange decision with clear cost (her best canvas and favorite brush). Pressure coheres but lacks the sharp tightening or foreclosed option that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation works through deepening understanding rather than external conflict, appropriate for the accumulative lens. The pearl's awakening and shadow convergence create genuine pressure. The cost of recognition lands but could be more visceral in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen through accumulation: from personal investigation to communal healing, with the trumpet valve as cipher evolving into "a mute compass pointing to all that had been loved and lost." The meaningful tightening occurs when Elira presents her findings to the council, risking rejection for an unconventional memorial approach that honors absence rather than presence.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes center on Elira's singular drive to find the fortress, with meaningful escalation when she must "accept whatever truth emerged, even if it unraveled her." The pressure builds through accumulation rather than reversals, appropriate for the textural lens. Cost lands clearly (dissolution of self/punch) but the abstract nature of the conflict limits visceral tension.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes deepen through accumulation as the tile reveals "entangled memories," forcing Elira to choose between solving its mystery or accepting partial understanding. The whale's song creating vibrational synchronization represents meaningful escalation. Cost is legible in her renunciation of complete knowledge for the sake of future seekers.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear dominant stake (discovering what lies beyond goodbye) escalates through the fragment's activation, spatial mutiny, and sanctuary collapse. The magnetic storm provides necessary pressure that narrows his window. Cost is legible—his refuge destroyed, stepping into the unknown—though agency feels slightly passive during the mutiny sequence itself.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—balancing inherited lies through fair trade—deepens as others arrive seeking their own recalibrations, with the child's choice to share rather than hoard marking the key turn. Escalation follows the Accumulative lens as each visitor adds weight to the transformation. The cost registers more conceptually than viscerally; while "vulnerability" and "participation" are named as prices, their immediate pressure could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen from personal collection to discovering she's not alone in her practice, forcing her to confront whether to remain solitary curator or acknowledge collaboration. The cost manifests when she weeps "not from sorrow, but recognition" and chooses to leave her sacred notepad exposed. The escalation follows the textural lens appropriately through density increase rather than reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving erased histories against bureaucratic forgetting—intensifies through accumulation rather than reversal. The child's shoe sequence deepens pressure effectively, and the tension between Elias's official death and continued collecting creates sustained conflict. Cost is visible in his isolation and the physical constraints of tides, though could be sharper at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—decoding grief's riddle—deepens through accumulative pressure as each ritual attempt (retelling, shell-to-cello transfer, compass reading) fails to provide answers until the revelation pivots inward. The final realization that "What do you bury when you refuse to speak?" reweights all prior seeking. Cost manifests in the destruction of her sacred objects.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal navigation of gentrification to collective action, with Lira's graffiti campaign forcing community crystallization. The "privatization stalls. Not defeated—postponed" shows clear cost and ongoing tension. Deduction for the corporate scouts section feeling slightly disconnected from the main pressure line.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through chemical countdown to 05:00, with the inspector's personal need to witness colliding with the device's engineered obsolescence. The deepening occurs when she realizes the message is "meant to outlast its audience," forcing her stance from archivist to vigil-keeper. Cost manifests in accepting beauty without reception.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through the tightening deadline (anchor lifting, tide turning) that would destroy a decade of research if the drone fails. The botanist's silent waiting adds pressure without interruption. Cost is visible in Elara's immediate turn to the grieving widow's music box, showing the endless demand on her skills.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes center on finding the mythic source of rivers, with pressure building through the falcon's delivery, phrasebook translations, and condensation patterns culminating in the ice revelation. While the discovery lands with resonance, the physical or temporal cost of this quest could be more explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through deepening resonance: shutter creaks→candlelight flickers→children peek→rain falls. The dominant stake (restoring Virelle through rhythm) tightens as each footstep accumulates effect. Cost manifests in her silent departure—she gives her instrument and method to the town.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (accessing the temple's memory-resonance before oxygen depletes) signals early and tightens through the oxygen alarm's escalating pulse. The central tension—overriding survival instinct to achieve stillness—creates genuine pressure. Cost is unmistakable (Elira's death), though the escalation could sharpen between middle descent and final activation.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from personal redemption to collective witness as the boy's action summons the disbelieved dead, forcing him to seal truth into the world before discovery. The cost is visible ("staggered back, spent"). However, the search party arrival lacks immediate pressure—they're "late and loud" but pose no active threat to the completed transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—repaying the debt across lifetimes—escalates through the bead's intensifying resonance near Elara, culminating in the transmission that transforms curse into gift. Cost is visible in the ghost bride's dissolution and Elara's inherited burden. However, Elara's agency is limited (she receives rather than chooses), and the resolution lacks a true foreclosed path since the transformation appears inevitable once contact is made.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake of mending vs. abandoning the plate deepens through the sewing sequence, with each stitch explicitly a "counter-spell against erasure." Escalation reads through accumulative pressure as the plate warms, painted eyes blink, and the canyon responds. Cost is legible in the needle-scars and the commitment to return nightly, though the conflict lacks a sharp tightening moment.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake of restoring faith deepens through archaeological discoveries that build context (ancestor stones, solstice alignments). Escalation reads through accumulative pressure rather than reversals. The cost of permanent rootedness lands clearly, though the villagers' arrival feels unearned causally.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving meaning in ephemeral chalk messages—is signaled early but never faces meaningful pressure or complication. The protagonist encounters no obstacles to her encoding work; she simply executes her plan without resistance. The widow's message adds emotional weight but doesn't escalate conflict or force difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake of preventing the coup escalates through the flame's violent shuddering, her discovery of the conspiracy's specifics in the adjacent layer, and her race to weave counter-patterns before the assassins arrive. Her agency drives the resolution through strategic deception. The tightening when conspirators seize the observatory creates genuine pressure, though the resolution feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: from summoning the "moment before deciding" to confronting the leaf-messages to releasing the letters, each step narrowing options. The cost manifests in memory loss and the irreversible dissolution of the letters, though the middle section could tighten to strengthen the pressure curve.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on witnessing versus erasure, with meaningful deepening when decrypted phrases reveal "they lied but the sea didn't." The coral's warmth increasing during decryption shows accumulative pressure, and Mira's shift from translator to witness carries emotional cost. However, external pressure remains purely internal/memorial without active opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake of rediscovering authentic creative joy escalates from fragment discovery through elder testimonies to the courtyard installation, with meaningful deepening when "the child's smile bloomed across the courtyard walls." The tightening moment arrives when observers respond viscerally, forcing Elira to confront her buried motivations, though agency could be stronger in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through the accumulative pattern: silence→single note→spiral→pressure waves→full absorption, with the hobo nickel's transformation marking the decisive shift. The stake (preserving certainty vs. embracing dissolution) crystallizes when Elira must choose to press the nickel into the mural, though middle beats could sharpen the cost of each awakening layer.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from individual seed-planting to collective resistance as neighbors notice patterns and Dr. Vex joins, with meaningful deepening when the plan expands from one gourd to "a hundred small rebellions." The cost is somewhat abstract ("grammar of resistance") rather than viscerally felt on-page. Agency drives the escalation through the scholar's choices and Dr. Vex's decision to help.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—transmuting collective trauma through art—deepens when the postcard warms and reveals "They're listening. Keep singing," forcing her shift from private lullabies to public psalm. Cost appears in "centuries of longing had carved her bones hollow" and the price of never sleeping, though the escalation could tighten further through more concrete obstacles to her mission.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—preserving memory without resurrection—is established early and tested through the caretaker's restraint against "tempted to shout the names louder." Escalation occurs through accumulation rather than reversal, with each whispered name building toward the climactic "Veyra-of-the-Unfinished-Song." The cost appears in what doesn't happen: "The light didn't last. It never did."

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes escalate from personal mission to civilizational restoration with clear cost (breaking promises shatters truth again). The pressure tightens through discovery of why the Syrathi ceased writing, building to the high-stakes performance. Agency drives the resolution through the protagonist's choice to conduct despite warnings.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure escalates through discovery sequence: adhesive analysis leads to amphitheater, chain measurements reveal relief carving, harmonic resonance exposes hidden equations—each narrowing her path toward integrating compassion into rigid systems. The dominant stake (mechanistic control vs. fluid mercy) tightens when she discovers the covenant that "control must be tempered with compassion." Cost appears in her trembling acceptance of working in secret, though agency could be stronger in driving discoveries.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—preserving lost songs before they dissolve—intensifies through the meteorite discovery, forcing Elara to risk her birds with the embedded chip. The escalation from passive archiving to active resurrection ("not an echo...a resurrection") shows meaningful deepening. Cost is legible in the transformation from one-way departures to songs returning home, though the resolution arrives somewhat easily through the child's validating letter.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation builds through accumulative discoveries: bench grief → logbook cipher → father's sacrifice → temporal paradox → final threshold choice. The dominant stake (understanding sacred thresholds) tightens as each revelation narrows Elara's options toward inevitable sacrifice. Cost is visible in her dissolution, though the single continuous pressure could have benefited from one more distinct tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes center on the protagonist's need for belonging versus isolation, with meaningful deepening when fireflies reveal threshold possibilities beyond logic. The hand-mirroring gesture represents agency through attention rather than action, foreclosing the path of pure observation. Cost manifests in accepting solitude as the price of wonder-bearing witness.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes deepen from discovering why paths disappear to understanding disappearance itself as intentional gift-giving. The crater glass vision sequence tightens pressure by forcing recognition that loss isn't tragedy but generosity. Cost appears when she must accept carrying mystery rather than solving it—foreclosing the certainty she initially sought.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake - proving wonder exists in monotony - develops through accumulation rather than reversal. Each audience transformation (barista's wonder, teen's gift, physicist's haiku) deepens this stake. However, the conflict lacks visceral pressure or meaningful resistance; transformations come too easily without genuine struggle or cost to Elias himself.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (preserving memory vs. safety) is signaled early and tightens when the moonstone discovery forces a choice between private remembrance and public inscription. The villagers' arrival creates pressure that crystallizes into teaching despite danger. Cost is legible in physical toll and exposure risk, though escalation could intensify further.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—finding sacred geometry in the mundane—deepens through the stone-drop sequence where physics becomes "messages, a dialect of nature's silent ledger." Escalation is textural rather than causal, building through accumulated observations toward the choice to transform Hargrove's window. Cost appears in his acceptance of being "odd" and the transient nature of his reckonings, though a sharper tightening would strengthen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake - processing trauma to help children - deepens through the letter-reading ritual but lacks a meaningful tightening that forecloses options. The "bargained innocence" remains abstract rather than tested through concrete choice. Cost exists but feels asserted ("lighter now") rather than dramatically earned.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—revitalizing hope's equations across timelines—is signaled early and deepens through incremental successes. The resonance cascade represents meaningful escalation under the Accumulative lens, with visible cost in the specific timeline changes. Agency manifests through pattern-creation and calibration choices. The piece lacks sharp reversals but doesn't require them; the accumulation of small victories creates legitimate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—discovering what walls remember—deepens through the diary discovery, forcing a choice between recording and witnessing. The cartographer's decision to leave her work behind forecloses her original mapping purpose with clear cost. Escalation could be stronger; the middle lacks a sharp tightening moment that would elevate the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—transforming possibility through borrowed heartbeats—signals early and deepens through the mirror transformations. Each mirror's revelation (forgiveness, boarding the feared train, the painter's past) escalates the emotional cost. The painter's withdrawal and dissolution shows clear foreclosure of path. Slightly limited by the lack of active opposition or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes center on whether ritual can succeed where diplomacy failed, with tension building through Elira's solitary preparation toward collective participation. The arrival of "survivors" rather than generals represents a meaningful shift in who has agency. However, the resolution comes too easily - no one resists or questions, reducing dramatic tension at the crucial moment.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure accumulates through layered ironies (funding orphanages by draining aquifers) toward the egg placement, with cost visible in Elias accepting his ruthlessness will continue tomorrow. The echo rising from the ground provides meaningful deepening. However, the stakes could tighten more dramatically—the transformation feels somewhat predetermined rather than fought for.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate through thread-untangling as each release builds pressure—from a sigh to a giggle to the final knot "weighted with a thousand suppressed confessions." The dominant stake (liberating suppressed voices) tightens when she must whisper "I remember you" to dissolve the final barrier. Cost is visible but the conflict relies heavily on symbolic resistance rather than active opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (ethical storytelling vs. aesthetic evasion) is clear and deepens through the veteran's violent reaction that becomes "punctuation, not interruption." The final choice to return to Mira with vulnerability rather than flowers shows earned agency. However, most conflict is retrospective; present-scene pressure could be stronger for this band.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.2)
    Under the Accumulative lens, pressure builds through the ritual's progression toward completion and the knowledge of imminent dissolution. The monarch's arrival creates a test of her discipline (not touching = preserving sacrament). Cost is legible in accepting erasure over permanence. Deduction for relatively static middle section where pressure plateaus rather than intensifying.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving forgotten names as "living resonance"—deepens through the casting process, with each stage (melting, pouring, cooling, breaking) tightening options toward the final act of embedding memory in bronze. The three-day cooling period and material constraints (specific alloys, reclaimed wax) create genuine pressure. Slightly lower score as the internal conflict could show more simultaneous contradiction during the work itself.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (discovering why paths choose walkers) established early and deepens through dream-descent that reveals the answer. The escalation through vision to revelation to action (removing the seal) shows clear progression. Cost is visible in the bunker's collapse and Elara's transformation, though the middle dream sequence could use more concrete resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—communion with cosmic order through the tile—is clear from the opening. Escalation builds through accumulation: preparation, alignment, drawing schematics, then the tile's activation at Sirius's descent. Agency is evident in his methodical approach and final choice to preserve rather than exploit. However, the conflict lacks a meaningful tightening that forecloses options—the tile activates as hoped without complication or reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.3)
    Escalation flows through textural deepening: from seeking the melody's return to discovering it lives within, culminating in the choice to teach through embodied presence rather than fixed mechanism. The cost is clear—surrendering the external anchor of the music box for uncertain internal resonance. One meaningful deepening that forecloses reliance on external tools.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes center on capturing the runaway dream with clear escalation through breathing synchronization, sextant levitation, and the dream's descent "not in fear, but in curiosity." The cost manifests in this being her "final craft" and the return of centuries-old fog. Good accumulative pressure though the exact price of success could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (bridging generational wisdom) escalates through discovered vow to footprints to green fabric, each narrowing the mender's options. The vow's resistance and honey-coaxing sequence provides concrete obstacle. Cost is visible in the daughter's absence despite return—relationship permanently altered even if hope remains.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from intellectual curiosity about "gaps" in catalogued lives to the visceral experience of touching petals that dissolve into skin, revealing alternate selves. The cameo blank's transformation from cold relic to warm vessel marks a clear tightening. Cost manifests in remembering "failing this quest, burning the orchard in despair," though the resolution could press harder on what's sacrificed.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes deepen from finding a library to understanding that rescue means reconciliation not extraction—a meaningful conceptual shift. The cost is legible: Kael's failed mission reframed, Elira becoming part of the library rather than finding it. However, the physical danger remains minimal and the transformation occurs through dialogue rather than dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming identity versus fracturing further—deepens through the mirror maze showing alternate selves and culminates in the tangible choice at the garden. Cost is visible when taking Lirien makes her "lighter yet heavier" and the ship recognizes her. The escalation could tighten more decisively in the middle third where exploration sometimes drifts.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation reads through density increase and pattern convergence - rope, seal, and clock rhythms synthesize into harmonic resolution. The cost manifests as the door's dissolution (losing access to mystery). However, the protagonist faces minimal resistance or struggle during the reconfiguration itself.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—finding quiet in chaos—escalates through deepening rather than reversal as Ripple-mark moves from avoiding beings to walking among them "like a current through reeds." The cost manifests in the ice wall's release and the energy being's transformation, though the middle section could tighten the pressure between discovery and application.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes deepen through accumulation—from proving patterns exist to becoming the pattern's keeper. The prism's fragility ("One misaligned star, one tremor in the glass") creates genuine tension that pays off when she succeeds in receiving the echoes.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: from measuring one shadow to many, from recording facts to embodying memories, from observer to vessel. The dominant stake — preserving/resurrecting lost civilizations — deepens as she physically absorbs their memories ("vibrations climb her calves, up her spine"). Cost visible in her acceptance of erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake of reclaiming joy against hopelessness escalates through the mosaic dance where each step raises energetic pressure culminating in the star's appearance—a visible cost paid through surrendering the kerosene knot. The accumulative structure fits the textural lens, though the middle section's pressure could tighten between discovering and dancing the mosaic.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding time's texture through transition periods—deepens via the companion's arrival, forcing application of insight to their unresolved conflict. Escalation occurs through accumulation rather than reversal. The "warmly observant gaze" applied to him represents meaningful pressure, though cost could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes center on the child's starvation for authentic silence versus the father's security, escalating when gravity inverts to create an escape opportunity. The child's agency drives the climb through ventilation shafts and the final choice to fall sideways rather than return. Cost is visible but could be sharper - we see departure but not what's specifically lost.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation reads through textural deepening—from fog-dense silence to silver eddies to golden completion. The operator's subtle weight-shifts and the woman's gradual release (shoulders dropping, fingers loosening, single tear) create meaningful progression, though agency remains primarily observational rather than decisional.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.9)
    The sunrise deadline creates genuine pressure that escalates as "the orchard's reality began to fray at the edges, colors bleeding into grayscale." The protagonist's agency drives the resolution through active choice of which self to carry forward. Cost is visible in the orchard's pixelated collapse and the spent ruby flake, though the internal stakes could be more viscerally contested at the throne moment.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes escalate through accumulative pressure as each scar "pulses" and memory threads are pulled to "stitch a new passage." The cost is legible in the final teaching: permission to "fumble in the dark" rather than providing light. The single meaningful deepening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Elara's need to transform betrayal into something meaningful—intensifies when she must decide whether to anchor the quantum convergence. Pressure coheres through the accumulating text messages, the warming bolt, and the mounting "existential pressure" she channels. The cost is visible in the crystallized structures representing "every slammed door, every fake smile." One meaningful deepening occurs when pressure translates into diamonds of resolved tension.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from uncovering truth to confronting personal identity when the voice proves to be her mother's, narrowing the protagonist's options between maintaining her destroyer role or pursuing restoration. The cost is visible in her frozen recognition and the irrevocable walk toward the clocktower. However, the conflict lacks intermediate pressure between setup and revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake (capturing possibility through surrender of control) escalates through physical unsnapping, pattern-work, and final harmonization with cosmic threads. Cost is visible in the dissolution of armor/identity. The reversal from control to surrender meaningfully tightens options. Some deduction for the stake remaining somewhat abstract rather than viscerally embodied in specific losses.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen through accumulation: from cataloging forgotten children to discovering the button, then recognizing dust patterns as stories, finally reframing her entire purpose. The dominant stake—whether institutional indifference erases human kindness—intensifies as each artifact reveals "quiet, stubborn love surviving." Cost appears in her ongoing heartbreak and three years of patient work, though the conflict remains primarily internal rather than meeting external resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes center on breaking the regime's information monopoly, with escalation from individual infiltration to city-wide broadcast. The conflict develops through Elira's methodical approach rather than dramatic reversals, fitting the "carefully resourceful" characterization. However, the lack of active opposition during the archive sequence and the too-smooth escape deflate potential pressure—enforcers arrive only after she's completed her mission and vanished.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation operates through accumulative deepening as the prophecy resists, the grotto responds, and memories surface to guide the final musical erasure. The cost is legible in the prism's destruction and the permanence of the silencing, though the conflict remains largely internal without external opposition testing the protagonist's resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from personal quest (decoding leaves) to communal restoration (summoning memory for travelers), with the moonstone discovery forcing Elira to alter her practice. The dominant stake—preserving forgotten memories—tightens when the grandmother validates Elira's work with tangible knowledge transfer. Cost manifests in the weight of "unshed tears" and "promises kept across centuries," though pressure could intensify more sharply between discovery and resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.2)
    Central stake of certainty versus uncertainty deepens through discovery—from repairing clocks to understand failure, through the compass's non-directional guidance, to embracing navigational ambiguity. The tossed watch represents genuine renunciation with cost. However, the middle section lacks sufficient pressure; Elias's cavern exploration feels contemplative rather than urgent, missing opportunities for meaningful obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes center on Elara's need for redemption through transforming guilt into "luminous regret," with the coin's cracking/shattering providing meaningful escalation. The cost is visible in her kneeling and the permanent integration of weights. Slight deduction as the conflict is primarily internal without external complication beyond the coin's response.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes center on transforming spectral grief into integrated laughter, with escalation through the layering of confessions ("I forgot how to smile before I forgot my name") to the breakthrough giggle that cracks the air. The collector's agency drives the harmonization process, though the transformation feels slightly predetermined rather than hard-won. Cost manifests in the ghosts' fading and the collector's emotional bruising.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: from physical escape to navigating by trauma-compass to discovering mercy's mathematics. The protagonist's agency drives each deepening, particularly the choice to offer the pewter strap. Cost is visible in releasing the mask's last remnant.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (healing the historian's grief) is clear from early paragraphs. The escalation through memory payment and lens activation creates meaningful pressure. Cost is legible in the traded memory and the lens's depletion, though the conflict could tighten further through more immediate obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—discovering what neglect conceals—deepens through the dust pattern discovery leading to the ceiling tile revelation, with cost visible in his responsibility to witness. Escalation is textural rather than causal: from observing disturbances to finding the child's drawing to encountering the sequined ghost. The final acknowledgment "I see you" forecloses his observer stance, accepting the burden of memory-keeping.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds from frost-reading through whisper-release to reality rupture, with the operator's agency driving each intensification. The cost is visible: perfect systems permanently destabilized, library "beautifully broken." One meaningful deepening occurs when she reaches into the aperture and seizes her mother's moment, forcing irreversible change.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal mourning to civilizational reimagining through the mirror-covering discovery. The tempest scene provides meaningful tightening where covering mirrors reveals the glyphs' true message. Cost is visible in tears and the abandonment of his original revolutionary path, though pressure could intensify further.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming stolen light through truth rather than force—escalates from stone wilting to chamber blazing with reclaimed light. The repairman's agency drives the resolution through his choice to sing rather than repair mechanically. The midnight deadline creates temporal pressure, though the shadow threat could be more causally integrated rather than appearing as external complication.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen through textural accumulation: from collecting petrichor to reading psychometric history to choosing permanent transformation. The cost materializes in Elira's irreversible passage into stone that "seals the way behind her." Slightly limited by lack of genuine opposition or complication—her journey proceeds without meaningful resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure builds through the storm's intensification and Elara's internal turbulence ("deadlines, critics, pressure to monetize"), culminating in her choice to leave the sculpture as communal property. The cost is visible in her ongoing weekly returns and additions rather than claiming ownership. The stakes deepen through layered historical gestures, though the external conflict could press harder on her artistic choices.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding night-blooming flowers—progresses through discovery of hidden glass layers, but escalation plateaus after the cathedral revelation. The protagonist faces no meaningful opposition or trade-offs; her quest succeeds without forcing difficult choices or visible prices beyond time spent.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes center on uncovering suppressed truth, with one meaningful deepening when the lagoon reveals submerged faces and the archivist realizes she's "retrocognitively trapped." However, escalation relies heavily on accumulation rather than active pressure—the archivist experiments with arrangements but faces minimal opposition or cost until the revelation. The final acceptance carries weight but the middle lacks tightening choices that would elevate the score.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—revival versus abandonment—deepens through accumulation rather than reversal. The alchemist's gift of the bottle to the child meaningfully tightens options, foreclosing his solitary path. Cost is visible in the permanent loss of the old town's soul and the acceptance that revival means transformation, not restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (preserving vs. awakening emotion) tightens when the prophecy shifts Elira's purpose. Agency manifests through her choice to release petals despite the "soft, pervasive" nature of change. The foghorn's silence creates urgency. Deduction for the relatively low immediate cost—the transformation is gentle rather than wrenching.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation works through accumulative deepening: from discovering the hollow egg, to walking barefoot creating "seams of release," to the acorn cap sinking into marble, culminating in the atrium's transformation. The cost is felt in "each name was a stitch in time's unraveling seam." One point off because the "vortex inheritance" stake could be more concretely defined earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes center on restoring trust after the "Great False Dawn" panic, with escalation through precise calibration requirements (3.2 knots, 7 degrees, 43 seconds). The protagonist's patient testing against premature activation creates tension, though the conflict remains primarily philosophical rather than urgent. Cost is legible in the seventeen-year burden and the risk of another false alarm.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen through the comet's arrival, escalating from routine meteor tracking to witnessing unprecedented dissolution. The janitor's agency manifests in choosing presence over protocol. Cost is legible in the gap between what sensors register (nothing) and what witnessing yields (perfect peace).

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake - preserving unspoken weights versus releasing them - is signaled early and deepens through accumulated ghost observations. Tension builds through the recluse's vigil and the box's unopened presence. The final acknowledgment between ghost and keeper provides meaningful deepening, though escalation could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes deepen from personal (Vey's timeless heartbeat) to collective (summoning others through garage sale listings), with the urn fusion forcing irreversible change. Cost is visible in Vey's years of arrhythmic existence, though escalation could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (beauty in brokenness) escalates from Elira's solitary practice to active intervention with the boy. The kite's transformation from broken to "crooked/glorious" deepens the thematic pressure with visible cost in accepting imperfection. One meaningful deepening sufficient for this length under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—creating a monument to interspecies respect before death—faces one meaningful deepening when the sparrow incident proves "respect isn't earned by dominance" but through belonging in the design. This realization shifts Arlen's methods from documentation to active remodeling. Terminal diagnosis provides persistent time pressure, though no on-page reversal tests his commitment; the cost accumulates through his declining breath and eventual death beneath his creation.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding homecoming's chemistry—deepens from external measurement to internal transformation. The protagonist's agency drives the escalation through her choice to sit, wait, and ultimately abandon her scientific framework, with the cost visible in leaving behind her hypothesis.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: collecting seeds → listening to birds → crushing pods → planting in specific memorial spots. The dominant stake of restoration-versus-erasure deepens when he plants "where no one remembered names anymore." Cost appears in "the hollow where laughter should echo," though the piece could sharpen the price of choosing restoration over other paths.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through discovery sequence: single cylinder → handler's voice → bunker of voices → settlement transformation. The dominant stake (preserving lost voices) intensifies with each revelation, forcing higher commitment. Cost is visible in Bracken's role shift and the settlement's complete reorientation. Slight deduction for predictable progression without significant reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on choosing presence over normalcy, with escalation through discovering the violet filament. Cost is visible in her isolation as "blessed pariah." The deepening from personal ritual to cosmic witness works, though the middle lacks sharp pressure points.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal quest to cosmic repair as Elric swaps pieces, each exchange sending tremors through reality. The dominant stake (fixing the wrong sky) is clear early and tightens when the board begins moving autonomously. Cost is visible in the world's transformation but Elric himself pays little personal price beyond reverent exhaustion.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: solitary walking becomes collective participation, the woman's ring placement unbinds her role, and finally the sovereign's arrival creates the peak test where walking "listen" applies maximum pressure. The cost is legible in the sovereign's trembling and the narrator's refusal to bow—power relations fundamentally shift.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on the seer's need for belonging versus her role as finder-of-others, with escalation through the stone's cracking and the architecture's responsive shifting. The cost manifests in her decades of translating others while never "daring to translate her own longing." One meaningful deepening occurs as texture becomes portal, though additional pressure points would strengthen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes deepen through winnowing progression from external threads to internal recognition: "Every thread she traced echoed her own." The mirror scene forces confrontation with her past self, paying visible emotional cost. One meaningful deepening that reweights her understanding of forgiveness through accumulated pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: each poetry session feeds the spire's hunger, the child's confession creates a turning point, and the artist's final self-session raises stakes to maximum. The ritual deadline creates time pressure. Cost is legible in the artist's choice to remain isolated rather than descend with the expected "polished parable."

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as each matched wound deepens the ritual's cost, with the workshop's deterioration ("seam split near the starboard gear shaft") creating a ticking clock. The dominant stake—conjuring meaning from ruin—tightens as personal cost increases. The resolution through transformed perception ("no longer felt like a raft on oblivion—it felt like an altar") carries clear emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.2)
    Under the accumulative lens, pressure builds through deepening interiority and the protagonist's confrontation with her seventeen-year-old promise. The stakes—whether she can still "listen" to quiet miracles—intensify through the cave sequence. However, the middle lacks a clear tightening moment that would elevate the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—proving whispers can guide better than shouts—escalates through Elara's test moving from individual fishermen to "the sea itself." The cost manifests in her physical depletion and the risk of failure with circling ships. However, the resolution lacks a true opposing force; the ships' transformation happens too smoothly without meaningful resistance or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on navigating loss through unconventional means, with moon phases creating genuine constraints (walking into static during wrong phase). The accumulative escalation builds from personal loss to cosmic reverse migration. Cost is more conceptual than visceral—the acceptance of seepage over resurrection—which fits the textural mode but lacks sharp physical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes center on psychological safety in a post-virus world where empathy has become contagion. Meaningful escalation occurs when the three traumatized figures arrive seeking help, forcing the protagonist to navigate her truthfulness curse. The cost manifests in her releasing the glass eye—surrendering her coping mechanism to help others.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—decoding the flower's meaning—escalates through the memory-flash that reveals the alpine connection and culminates in discovering Elara's photograph, forcing Silas's choice between reporting and protecting. The cost manifests in his acceptance of "witnessed isolation," though this price could be more viscerally felt. The investigation method through "gaps" and sensory echoes provides coherent pressure under the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake (finding the doorway to fulfill his promise) escalates from discovering the chip through following ants to stepping through the arch. The creek's rising creates time pressure, and the chip's absorption represents irreversible commitment. Could strengthen with more explicit cost during the threshold moment itself.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal (dreams) through physical (dangerous climb) to existential (confronting buried truth). The fireflies' appearance as breathing-synchronized guides and the grotto's revelation about her child create meaningful deepening. Cost is visible in tears creating constellations and the requirement to "unbury what you buried," though the figure's role could apply more direct pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.2)
    Elias's confession creates meaningful tightening that forces the alchemist's choice between rejection and transformation. The cost is visible in Elias's tears and the alchemist's fierce smile of "someone who had spent a lifetime learning how to return differently to broken things." Escalation works through accumulative pressure rather than reversal. Some abstraction around "density of presence" slightly weakens the stake's visceral impact.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation follows accumulative pattern: scroll resists → younger self appears → writing flows → multiple selves emerge → final acceptance. The dominant stake (making sense of fractured time/feral nostalgia) tightens through each encounter with past selves. Cost is legible in the jealousy and the line "they still believed in clean endings." Slight deduction as the pressure remains largely internal without external complication.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (finding meaning after sensory loss) signals early and deepens through Ren's reframing of the screw and clock. The "fraudulent healer" tension creates adequate pressure but lacks a sharp tightening moment. Cost appears in accepting the broken clock as sacred but escalation remains gentle rather than forcing hard trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes deepen from academic failure to personal transformation as Elira confronts her scars. The tension between crystallizing ink (panic) and fluid writing (acceptance) provides concrete pressure, though the conflict remains primarily internal without significant external complication.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (reconciliation before the orchard's destruction) tightens through the perfume bottle demonstration that makes their shared history visible. Cost is legible—"not healed, not whole, but humming with the same flawed frequency." The escalation through sensory memory to visible threads to manuscript exchange works, though the middle demonstration section could use sharper pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation through deepening layers of surrender—from reading her future handwriting to letting the library read her to ceasing distinction between seeker/sought—with each phase foreclosing return. The cost manifests as dissolution of language and self, though the abstract register slightly dulls visceral impact.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.1)
    Under the accumulative lens, pressure builds through the countdown (360→299) and the station's physical response—pistons slowing, dials flickering, time holding "not stopped—held." The dominant stake (understanding time's true nature) deepens meaningfully. However, the cost remains somewhat conceptual rather than viscerally felt at the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding how to let go of her mother—escalates from sensing to offering to witnessing dissolution, with the cost visible as the stranger becomes "motes of bioluminescent dust." The pressure builds through Aris's approach to the eastern trellis and crystallizes in the offering moment. Some abstract phrasing around "alignment" and "permeability" slightly dulls the visceral impact.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes escalate from personal rebellion to finding community through the cryptic network. The father's clover response provides meaningful tightening. However, the conflict remains largely internal without sufficient external pressure to test Elara's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on the operator's philosophy of teaching "endings how to begin," with escalation through accumulated wrong-number connections building to her own dissolution into the system. The cost becomes legible when she patches herself into the harmonica's resonance, though middle vignettes (teenager/widower, chef/painter) feel more illustrative than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on preserving "the weight of small moments" against institutional forgetting, with escalation through the archivist's deepening commitment from photo contemplation to active transcription. The covenant's regeneration creates meaningful tightening as personal memory becomes collective responsibility. Cost is visible in the disciplined restraint ("did not weep. Tears would blur the ink"). Deduction for relatively gentle pressure that could push harder against the protagonist's limits.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes crystallize early—cure loneliness through pattern—and escalate through accumulating exchanges from Mrs. Hargrove to the trembling man. Each story traded deepens the reciprocal web, with visible cost in vulnerability (tears, red-rimmed eyes). The final exchange forces both to voice their loneliest memories, a meaningful deepening that reweights all prior exchanges.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through accumulating emotional frequencies (nostalgia, regret, memory tests) toward the stillpoint encounter. The protagonist's agency manifests in choosing to enter the silence sphere and leave her ring. Cost is legible in accepting navigation without her compass, though the middle section could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from personal regret ("wrong seeds") through active revision attempts to the final acceptance that uncertainty is "the only honest compass." The cost appears in specific edits—"A betrayal unraveled into a misunderstanding"—though the personal price to the protagonist could be more visceral beyond the mentor's loss.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—creating beauty that won't be archived—is poetic but lacks concrete pressure. The story's escalation comes through accumulation (individual observer → Silas joining → mute girl appearing) rather than rising conflict. The girl's appearance provides meaningful deepening, but earlier sections lack tangible obstacles or costs that would heighten the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal mission to ancestral covenant as the tapestry reveals her face/lineage, with the archive's responsive tremors and opening passages tightening pressure toward the final chamber. The cost is legible in her acceptance of criminal status to fulfill the promise, though the middle section could sharpen the specific obstacles she overcomes.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes clear from opening (managing 27 grafted consciousnesses). Escalation through drumming rebellion that transforms the garden and herself. The cost is felt in the weight of carrying others' memories. However, the resolution lacks a sharper trade-off—she achieves wholeness without losing anything concrete, which softens the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from curiosity about the coin to uncovering corruption, with Lena's agency driving the investigation through her unique skill. The whispers-vs-shouts tension crystallizes in her choice to expose Delgado quietly rather than confrontationally. Cost is visible in Delgado's removal, though the personal risk to Lena could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes emerge through the guardian's covenant with "the drowned and the dreaming," deepening when the drowned woman appears and the guardian must prove her method works. Cost is visible in the woman's transformation and the guardian's necessary isolation. Pressure could tighten more dramatically in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—awakening dormant curiosity against societal conformity—escalates from private contemplation to public manifestation. The midnight activation represents a meaningful tightening that forces characters to confront their suppressed desires. Cost appears in characters' quiet revelations (Mrs. Cho, Jamal), though the resistance feels minimal for a "rebellion."

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal doubt through mystical summons to accepting a harder vocation of healing others. The whale's call creates the decisive pressure point that forces Lira's transformation. Cost is visible in the scrimshaw dissolving and her accepting vulnerability ("softer now in the spaces between sinew and soul").

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure escalates from initial retreat to Compliance Officer visits to the calculated box-presentation performance, each tightening the noose of mandated happiness. The cost is visceral in "Tomorrow, they'd begin again — lighter, emptier, perfectly compliant," where survival requires progressive self-erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure accumulates through the poet's progression from threshold to heart of colonnade, with the quartz responding to her presence and the lake mirroring her motion. The dominant stake—reclaiming artistic expression after the ban—deepens through physical interaction with the space, though the actual opposition remains mostly internalized.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes deepen from salvaging discarded materials to awakening dormant spirits, with the reed tongue discovery tightening pressure toward the courtyard's response. The shift from Elias teaching to Marta taking initiative with sunflower stalks shows meaningful escalation, though the transformation could use one more beat of resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—recovering authentic connection in a digitally saturated world—intensifies through Elira's sustained vowel that makes "the air itself seemed to lean in." The escalation from striking the fork to full-voiced singing that releases trapped harmonies shows clear deepening, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—transforming grief into meaning through anonymous acts—deepens rather than reverses, with the remote curtain-stirring confirming someone received her offering. Agency manifests through deliberate creation and placement choices ("beneath a park bench near the river's bend"). The cost accumulates through "scraps of receipt paper, theater tickets, hospital wristbands—ephemera soaked in other people's endings."

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding how culture rebuilds after financial collapse—is signaled early and maintained. Escalation occurs through pattern accumulation (phoenix stencils, chalk equations, converging hashtags) rather than confrontation. The visitor's arrival provides minimal tightening; their shared recognition lacks the cost or foreclosed option needed for higher bands. Agency manifests as observation and mapping rather than choices that alter outcomes.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes crystallize around breaking the cycle of forgetting-as-healing, with the historian risking drowning in "anguished joy" to purify memory itself. Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as emotional atoms surge toward her, forcing the patternless humming that confuses and releases them. The cost manifests physically (blood from nails, darkening veil) and emotionally (weeping openly). One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, though the external pressure could be more immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—preserving hope's essence—deepens through Elira's discovery that the shadow adapted rather than vanished. One meaningful turn occurs when she realizes the shadow metamorphosed, forcing her choice to embed the stone. Cost is legible but somewhat abstract ("luminous regret of what was lost").

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (reconciling integrity with compassion) established early and deepens through the reconstruction ritual. The tightening occurs when Elara commits to both testifying and opening her own sanctuary - foreclosing the easier path of pure abandonment. Cost visible in sacrificing savings and security. Slightly abstract in places rather than fully dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal healing through the scar examination to the cosmic weight of the seed's power to "resurrect what should stay dead," with Elira's choice to integrate rather than use it marking genuine transformation. The cost is felt in her weeping recognition and the permanent change to her nature. Minor deduction for the relatively smooth path through the tunnels.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.0)
    Escalation builds through accumulative discoveries—film strip to projectionist's napkin to bundle of letters—each deepening the stake of unused love's proper place. The gazer's agency drives the psychometry reading and choice to mail the letters. Cost appears in "sixty-eight years for an ear," though the personal stakes could tighten more sharply.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal ache to symphonic fury requiring immediate action. The winter crescendo meaningfully deepens pressure through "thousands of souls tethered by invisible chains." Cost is legible in the protagonist's physical depletion and emotional release. Minor deduction as the resolution relies partially on the protagonist's special ability rather than pure agency.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes center on cultivating dormant possibilities in collapsed probabilities, with escalation through the guard's resonance work awakening the silent village. The tension between entropy and potential creates coherent pressure, though the conflict remains largely conceptual without immediate opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake (rediscovering inner wilderness) escalates through the gear's evolution from burden to key, culminating at the Edge where "legends said it unraveled those who tried." The protagonist's choice to step forward shows agency with clear cost—abandoning the mechanical/known world. One meaningful deepening that reweights understanding suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes center on finding "unused courage," which deepens through discovery of the artifacts rather than escalating through conflict. The piece maintains coherent pressure through accumulation, but the abstract nature of the quest ("courage doesn't rust") limits felt urgency compared to more concrete stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate through the child's arrival forcing the bellhop to confront his safety/silence calculus. The cost is legible in his physical struggle to replace the bolt and the risk of structural collapse. One meaningful deepening rather than multiple reversals fits the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from individual exile to systemic revelation as her distributed messages converge into collective witness. The pretender's unmasking through dissolved ink rather than force demonstrates agency through patience, though the weeks-long gap reduces immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal mystery (why paths vanish) through technological discovery (CALYPSO's hidden subroutine) to ecological revelation (coral's downward adaptation), with Elara's submersible descent forcing commitment to her hypothesis. The cost of twenty years of concealment and the mentor's torn page create genuine pressure, though the resolution arrives somewhat smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—finding purpose after rebellion's pause—deepens through the stone circle's activation, which forces her choice between violence and remembrance. The escalation from personal hollowness to collective awakening narrows her options meaningfully. Cost manifests as she chooses the harder path of "remembering how to listen" over the simpler reignition of war.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes escalate from personal resistance to collective transformation as the grandmother moves from decoding glyphs to actively unsealing the embryo, with each step narrowing her options (refuse/comply/transform). The cost manifests physically in her gnarled fingers and creaking joints, and spiritually in choosing dispersal over power. The tightening from individual to collective destiny lands with felt weight, though middle development could show more concrete obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake of processing trauma coheres through the freeze moment that transforms perception of the photograph from "relic of loss" to "frame of pure, unguarded joy." Cost is legible in "for the first time since the strike, I let myself cry without counting the tears." One meaningful deepening suffices, though the transformation could be more viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from artistic paralysis through metaphysical questioning to physical transformation, with the protagonist's agency driving the stitching and painting acts. The compression sequence ("bone must break to grow correctly") shows clear cost, though the fantastical resolution slightly dilutes real-world stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from intellectual curiosity to existential choice as the tracker progresses from observation to self-experimentation with the ink. The revelation that "time didn't slow for the world—it slowed for the witness" effectively reframes the conflict. The final dissolution carries clear cost, though the middle section could tighten pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal moral conflict to societal transformation through the archivist's agency, with clear cost paid (her erasure and imprisonment). The tension between suppression and revelation drives toward meaningful closure, though the middle could tighten—the lengthy aftermath diminishes immediate pressure slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake of preserving beauty/continuity against brutality is signaled early and tested through visitor encounters. Escalation occurs through accumulation rather than reversal, appropriate to the textural lens. However, the conflict lacks a decisive tightening moment - visitors arrive and accept seeds without meaningful resistance or cost to Elara's mission.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.1)
    Escalation builds through sonic accumulation from dissonance to rupture to maternal fury, with the fisher's calculated risk of slamming the spike creating genuine consequences (garden folding, chime-blooms shattering). The stakes of catching versus carrying the echo shift meaningfully, though the personal cost to the fisher remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from the journalist's cryptic call to discovering the pattern of document destruction to taking decisive action. The dominant stake—exposing truth versus institutional silence—tightens when she realizes the "accident" timing correlates with the purge schedule. Agency manifests through her calculated intervention. Minor deduction for the resolution feeling slightly too smooth without visible immediate risk to her.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.2)
    Central stake of "hushing dissonance of old guilt" drives coherent escalation from discovery (amber/letters) through confrontation (machine's accusation) to resolution. The protagonist's agency manifests through deliberate ritual actions that forge new meaning. Cost is visible in blood sacrifice and the father's release.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on the artist's need to escape metallic city noise and find meaning, with escalation through the mandala's whisper revelation forcing her to confront absorbed but unprocessed voices. The cost manifests in the cracked tile and abandoned mandala, though the internal conflict could sharpen further.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulative renaming acts that deepen stakes from personal (Elira's kneeling) to communal (survivors joining), with the magistrate's challenge providing genuine opposition. The cost manifests in blood, in accepting being "retrocognitively trapped," and in the weight of redefining mercy itself, though the universal acceptance of her philosophy reduces some tension.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—luring possibility from despair—progresses through the ghost's discovery of the cerulean laugh thread and culminates in her sacrifice. The tarot coin compass creates genuine pressure by pulling her toward "intersections where hope still whispered." However, the escalation relies more on accumulation than decisive tightening, and the three human echoes feel somewhat mechanical in their parallel structure.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes escalate from personal navigation to finding Mateo to opening the studio for others, with each somatic marker forcing deeper commitment. The cost of vulnerability is clear in the final decision, though the middle section's exploration lacks a decisive tightening moment that would elevate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: mapping emotions → fossil warming → thermographic question → biothermal response → dissolution into light. The stakes (translating what remains of humanity) intensify when the cave itself asks "Who remembers us?" Cost is visible in the fossil's sacrifice to become relay rather than relic.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on decoding possibility from fragments, with meaningful deepening when the echo speaks clearly after the ivory button placement—a tightening that forces the turner to shift from solitary to communal practice. The cost of abandoning protected isolation for vulnerable teaching is visible. Deduction for relying on abstract "truth unraveling" without concrete dramatization of specific conflicts or pressures from above.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes crystallize around choosing legacy over survival/revenge. The escalation through burial metaphor ("planted one—an act of quiet sabotage") provides meaningful deepening. Cost is visible in her acceptance that she may never see vindication, though middle tension could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether to offer the needle and invite unraveling—escalates through accumulating pressure: passenger's cough, her unspoken burden, the rain's cadence matching internal rhythm. The coachman's choice to extend the needle after the rain stops carries visible cost (sharing his wife's tool, opening old wounds). However, the passenger's internal conflict remains somewhat opaque; we see her resolve but not the specific trade-off she makes.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes emerge through accumulation rather than causal escalation - each discovery deepens understanding of temporal resistance. The dominant stake (understanding why places resist change) tightens through the bee's arrival and glass's response to kindness, though agency remains primarily observational until the final choice not to fire.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes deepen effectively from personal grief to community transformation, with the protagonist's agency driving each prism placement despite physical cost. The "quivering hush" builds appropriate tension that pays off in the neighborhood's awakening to wonder. Minor deduction for the conflict being primarily internal without significant external opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (preserving/transforming extinction memory) escalates through cloud-tide crisis where the stone circle's failure threatens the woodpecker coordinates—forcing Veyra to risk channeling her own resonance. The shift from preservation to genesis ("possible ones: hybrids, chimeras") deepens stakes meaningfully. Cost is visible in her physical state and the "weight of extinction" transforming to "lightness of coexistence."

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—Aris seeking "the thread that connects all things"—signals early and deepens through his ritual of releasing names. However, escalation remains gentle rather than pressurized; no opposing force complicates his choice to dissolve. The transformation arrives without resistance or trade-off, missing the friction that would elevate stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from personal detection to community threat to direct confrontation with cosmic entities. The tricksters' irritation when "realizing its prey had teeth" shows meaningful reversal. Cost is visible in Elira's isolation and the ongoing vigilance required.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds from external exploration to internal transformation as the passages tighten and Elara must choose between retreat and her mission, with clear cost when she "squeezed her eyes shut, chanting coordinates like prayers." The organ's pull creates coherent pressure, though the resolution's ease (widened passage) slightly undercuts the established danger.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes build through textural accumulation: ribbon fragment → sketches on walls → killer's emergence → mask revelation. The dominant stake (remembering the vanished women properly) deepens when Elira's empathy project succeeds through the killer's grief. Cost is legible in his weeping and the town's collective mourning, though agency feels slightly diluted in the collaborative resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal (reversing exile) through familial (honoring grandfather) to global (controlling weather), with the discovery of Journal #7 as the decisive tightening that forces action. The storm's response creates immediate pressure that Elara must navigate through questioning rather than force. Cost is visible in the burning nail and the choice to claim power rather than seek pardons. The resolution feels slightly convenient—the storm yields too easily to her first attempt.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake is the fiddler's need to move beyond "never" into possibility, which deepens through accumulation rather than reversal—from playing for the hitchhiker through interpreting signs to releasing the glass flake. Cost appears in "years" of holding still and the "bridges he'd burned," though agency remains primarily observational until the final step forward.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding "why some paths circle back"—accumulates through the startup's rise/fall pattern and territorial marking system. Escalation reads through density shifts and the deepening understanding that "the center isn't the destination." While the cost of the collapsed startup is clear, the pressure feels retrospective rather than actively unfolding, limiting tension.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—continuing the chain of burden-sharing—escalates from academic translation to urgent rescue of the trapped guardian, then expands to establishing a new covenant of mercy. The pressure tightens when the telegram reveals she's "the only one left," forcing immediate action. The cost manifests in her acceptance of perpetual burden-bearing: "Tomorrow, another burden."

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through expanding circles of revelation, each ring peeling back armor until "the final circle reached her heart." The dominant stake—confronting hidden truth versus remaining guarded—tightens meaningfully as roots map her buried memories. Cost is visible in the physical unbending and emotional exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring the eclipsed covenant—is signaled early and pressure builds through the accumulation of sensory and symbolic details. The protagonist's agency drives the resolution through deliberate ritual action. However, the conflict lacks a meaningful tightening or reversal; the ritual proceeds without significant opposition or complication, reducing dramatic tension despite the atmospheric pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake of how to honor the dead escalates from Elira's solitary ritual through Kael's challenge to the orchard's intervention, forcing both to reconsider their methods. The reversal when roots restrain Kael meaningfully narrows options. Cost manifests in Kael's forced stillness and Elira's acknowledgment that they "patch holes" rather than fix souls—both accepting limitations.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure builds through textural accumulation: from mechanical cataloging to holding cloth to ear, to the laptop moment of "Project Echo." The dominant stake—recovering meaning from loss—tightens when Jasper chooses engagement over insulation, with visible cost in his "pulse thudded" and three years of defensive numbness.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from understanding physics of transition to the deeper challenge of accepting incomplete knowledge. The seed's germination sequence creates genuine pressure as Elira must resist her scholarly impulse to grasp and translate. The "touching distance" constraint forces a meaningful trade-off between possession and understanding, though the conflict could have benefited from one more turn of resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving wonder through accepting contradiction—is signaled early and deepens when the librarian lowers the creel into the pool, transforming it from container to resonant vessel. This single meaningful deepening narrows her options from cataloging "truths or merely beautiful lies" to accepting both. However, the cost remains more conceptual than visceral, lacking the immediate pressure that would elevate the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through deepening confessions that progressively increase vulnerability and cost—from hoping father didn't die alone to envying the dead. Each confession triggers intensified response (trembling→brightening→harmonic vibration), with the final crowning act foreclosing her previous isolation. The pearl's activation method creates genuine constraint requiring emotional exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.2)
    Under the accumulative lens, pressure builds through deepening encounters with graffiti wisdom and the protagonist's growing ability to play the accordion "louder, less broken." The dominant stake (self-forgiveness) remains consistent. Limited by lack of external resistance - all conflict is internal without complicating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as each discovery alters the archive retroactively, forcing constant adaptation. The watch's behavior (spinning wildly, freezing, going silent) tracks rising stakes effectively. The final revelation that she is one of many iterations crystallizes the true cost—not finding knowledge but becoming it—though the transformation could be more viscerally rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from authenticating an artifact to choosing between empire and ecological truth, with the Chancellor's arrival as pressure point. The violin's melting into seeds that root in the Chancellor deepens rather than reverses, forcing transformation rather than confrontation. Cost is legible in the empire's dissolution and Elira's acceptance of her telepathic burden.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—capturing consciousness before oblivion—is signaled early and maintained throughout. Pressure accumulates through the ritual's progression, with the emerald chip pulsing "green and deep as a forest at midnight" marking successful preservation. However, no meaningful tightening occurs; the ritual proceeds without complication or choice that would narrow options. Cost appears only in emotional response ("hands trembling") rather than foreclosed paths or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—finding contentment after betrayal—is clear, with one meaningful deepening as Elara realizes contentment is "returned to" rather than found. However, present-scene pressure is limited; most conflict is retrospective. The forgiveness has already occurred, reducing active tension.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—whether to shed false certainty—intensifies through the chimes' increasing insistence and the cloak's resistance. The unhooking forecloses her old professional path with clear cost: "if they walked away? So be it." One meaningful deepening occurs when the shard shows her true uncertain self rather than polished or might-have-been versions.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—teaching vanishing as emergence rather than escape—escalates through Kael's progression from confusion to understanding as he reads time in the ripples. The withholding itself becomes the pressure mechanism, with Elira's cost visible in her accumulated grief, though the conflict lacks a decisive tightening that would elevate beyond competent execution.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—learning to navigate without moving—deepens through the crow murmuration sequence where the skimmer reads the pulse and discovers "the next safe passage." Cost is visible in the centuries of waiting and the wanderers who died seeking motion. The escalation is textural rather than causal, appropriate to the piece's contemplative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—finding authentic magic versus automated perfection—deepens through the mist-walk sequence where Lior must trust without control. The cost is legible when he leaves the keystone but gains its warmth internally. The conflict could use one more concrete obstacle during the mist-walk to fully earn the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—discovering the color of sound—deepens through the vow's revelation, forcing acceptance of a predetermined path with its inherent cost. Escalation occurs through accumulation rather than reversal: mysterious woman → key → dive → ledger → revelation → acceptance. The protagonist's agency manifests as conscious participation in an eternal pattern rather than breaking free, though the middle section could tighten the pressure between discovery beats.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—finding meaning after universal collapse—deepens through the static burst that reveals her agency paradox, forcing her to choose between continued surrender or accepting purpose. The vision of herself with a child creates genuine pressure that narrows options. Cost appears in abandoning her lot-casting system. Escalation could be stronger; the middle lacks intermediate pressure points before the vision.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (transforming grief into bearable form) escalates through the naming sequence with each monster receiving witness-status. The cost is legible in his centuries of carrying this weight and the choice to become "heart-carrier." Missing stronger mid-story tightening; the ritual proceeds without significant complication or reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as droplets cohere into the bell's restoration, with stakes clearly tied to cosmic balance. The dominant stake (correcting imbalance) remains coherent throughout with meaningful deepening when the bell completes. Cost is legible in the months of patient observation, though the final triumph lacks sharp trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from documenting relics to preserving collective memory, with Elias's professional mandate creating genuine tension. The supervisor confrontation crystallizes the conflict between institutional erasure and human remembrance. Cost is visible (permanent reassignment) though the resolution feels slightly convenient—the state's acquiescence to his defiance could use more friction.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through textural density as the flame deepens from blue to gold, the crystal transmutes rather than melts, and the starlings' dance guides rather than decorates. The cost is visible in the crystal's absorption into flame—a material sacrifice for spiritual gain—though pressure could tighten more decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—maintaining communal trust through careful communication—is signaled early and tested through the village's response to the chime. The escalation from personal memory (mentor's buckle) to active invention (new signals for the eastern ridge) shows deepening, though the pressure could tighten more dramatically. The "silence as signal" reversal provides the meaningful turn required at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central stake—vivifying the brain to defeat emotional numbness—faces escalating pressure through the custody battle's temporal fractures and the judges' accusations. The resolution emerges from Kael's choice to grant autonomy rather than claim ownership, with clear cost in relinquishing control. The complementary opposites mechanism (joy/grief, guilt/absolution) provides concrete tactical progression toward resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether true innovation requires patience for the grotesque and uncertain—establishes early and deepens through the seed's dormancy and strange growth. Escalation occurs through the rooms' increasing intensity (from "The Dormant Bloom" to "The Spiral Root") and their effects on clients, with visible cost in those who "fled screaming" and others who "returned, week after week, obsessed." The conflict remains primarily internal/philosophical rather than dramatically urgent, with pressure accumulating through time and commitment rather than sharp reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation works through accumulative deepening - from conducting machines to conducting absence to conducting "the unsung, the unlaughed." The dominant stake (preserving joy's memory against silence) intensifies through pattern and repetition. Cost is visible in his isolation and the emotional price of each nightly ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake of connection versus isolation deepens through the guardian's swallowing of landscapes, recognition of the cultist's loneliness, and ultimate choice to place the pendant in the statue's hand. This single meaningful turn from solitary vigil to creating connection shows clear cost in accepting uncertainty. The pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens but lacks multiple reversals typical of higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—escaping "slow suffocation of a soul condemned to never create"—is clear early and tightens through the vivification attempt that forces Elric to abandon perfection for iteration. The escalation follows the Accumulative lens as each failed formula leads to this final synthesis of "error" as method. Cost is visible in accepting incomplete creation, though the single-beat structure limits opportunity for multiple reversals or deepening turns.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake of finding true silence/signal escalates through false echoes to the fragment's arrival to the lunar perigee activation, with cost visible in seven cycles of failure and the fragment's dissolution. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens as each discovery reweights understanding, though the middle exposition about the fragment's origin slightly diffuses immediate tension.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate clearly through accumulation: seven vanishings → discovering the radio → mapping patterns → leaving harmonic beacons → final convergence. The deckhand's agency drives each deepening ("he tuned it by instinct," "began leaving messages"). Cost is visible in the ferries' passengers' "bewildered relief" and the deckhand's acceptance that "timelines would fray again."

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: initial mapping, gallery resistance via mirror-selves, ceiling splitting, to final eruption/revelation. The dominant stake (discovering connection's texture) intensifies as resistance grows. Cost is legible in the gallery's transformation and her release of the thread.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—humanity must relearn navigation after aliens warped spacetime—intensifies through Elira's teaching challenge and crystallizes when she reframes the anchor as symbol of adaptability. The power outage forces a meaningful deepening: Elira demonstrates that edge geometry transcends physical sight. Cost is legible in accepting permanent underwater exile while mastering alien-altered celestial mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from detecting emotional echoes to discovering a trapped soul to helping her accept reality—each beat tightens options under the accumulative lens. The cost is visible in the girl's tears and the tracer's choice to kneel in damp conditions. However, the conflict lacks a strong opposing force; the girl's acceptance comes relatively easily once contact is made.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (honoring the unremembered) established early and deepens through accumulating details—the child's drawing, phantom workers appearing. The tidal pressure creates genuine urgency, though the phase transition resolution arrives somewhat mechanically without sufficient resistance or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake of retrieving/arranging corrupted data escalates through the ink's dendritic expansion and Dr. Voss's emergence, with Aris's agency manifested in initiating defragmentation and pressing the shard into his palm. The resolution shows ghosts "settled" rather than saved, with clear cost in Aris's continued liminal existence. Escalation could be stronger through more concrete obstacles during the defragmentation process.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.3)
    Escalation builds through textural accumulation: diamond pulsing → vacuum effect → air thickening with "texture made audible" → new echoes blooming as responses. The cost is visceral—she weeps but continues speaking, her copper veins conducting sound to ground it permanently.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from personal mission to cosmic release as the arrowhead splits and initiates metamorphosis, with clear cost in Elara losing her research identity for something larger. The gravity hiccups and floating objects provide tangible pressure, though the transformation itself happens somewhat passively to Elara rather than through her final agency.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake clearly signaled: breaking the "silence strangling this place." Escalation follows textural deepening—from single trembling note to statues freezing, then weeping dew, finally transforming into gardeners. Cost is visible in the violinist's physical deterioration ("bow arm ached, her fingers blistered") and the consumption of her grandmother's gift.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes center on delivering the storm to Lena's daughter before winter, with escalating pressure through tighter drone surveillance. The tension between detection risk and the child's need drives the climactic release. Some softness in how the storm-masking actually works reduces the cost legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen through the carpenter's recognition of the half-built carousel as either his past life's work or spiritual inheritance, narrowing his options to completion or abandonment. The cost is visible in his permanent dedication, though pressure could tighten more dramatically.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from personal quest (finding where stories live) to collective awakening (reminding stories they're loved). The tessellation scene creates meaningful tightening as she steps into another dimension, with cost paid through the scarf's transformation and her integration into the story-field.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming the lost dream—is signaled early and pursued consistently, with escalation through the three-component light formula (blush of first love, gold of loss, indigo of surrender). The cost manifests in decades of searching, though the actual confrontation lacks dramatic pressure as the dream simply "unfurls" once the formula is complete.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes center on freeing "an idea trapped behind fear" with clear escalation through the mirror corridor where each reflection tries to bar his way. The crimson ribbon moment represents agency—his choice not to carry fear forward—though the conflict lacks visceral opposition beyond abstract resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal memory recovery to understanding the orchard's predatory nature, with the mushroom's pulse creating a meaningful tightening. The cost becomes legible when she understands she must choose between warning others or feeding the orchard, though middle development could be more pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—maintaining the reversible exile while mentoring through "combative tenderness"—tightens when the cartographer's arrival tests her methods. The shadow "straining against the pane" creates ambient pressure. Cost manifests in her acceptance of being "the broken thing that teaches," though escalation could intensify more sharply between teaching moments.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from personal (Elira's inability to bear losing wonder) through cosmic (worlds thinning, children forgetting to gasp) to the immediate ritual's success. The seed's trembling and cracking creates tension about whether the succoring will work. However, the resolution lacks a sharp trade-off or visible sacrifice beyond emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulating releases until the guilt-knot creates genuine reversal—from gentle unraveling to violent rupture ("It unraveled violently, thread snapping"). The fisherman's confession "I cut the line. To save the others" forces moral reckoning without tidy resolution, and the protagonist's choice to continue despite physical toll shows agency with cost. Stakes remain primarily internal/spiritual rather than survival-based, appropriate for this lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes center on interpreting "silence as vessel" rather than filling gaps, established early through grandmother's lost villages. The seventeen video clips create escalating pressure as the shadow's spiral pattern emerges, forcing her to witness rather than rebuild. The cost lands in her tears of recognition and the torn map she leaves unrepaired—acceptance over conquest.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding "the physics of letting go"—evolves from intellectual pursuit to embodied surrender, with the snow globe's properties forcing increasingly personal admissions. The protagonist's seventy-three nights of obsessive study create meaningful pressure that narrows options to final release. Cost is legible when the globe vanishes ("Unmade") and the protagonist stands "hollow and humming."

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake of connection-versus-isolation escalates through encoded exchanges, with the ghost's response ("You encoded longing. I decoded love") forcing the protagonist's stance shift from private grief to public invitation. The tightening occurs when she chooses vulnerability over safety, with cost visible in tears and the risk of inviting "the next lonely soul."

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (seeking joy beneath anguish) progresses through the cipher discovery, diary fragment, and final revelation, with each floor marking deepening understanding. The cost is primarily internal transformation rather than external conflict, appropriate for the Accumulative lens. The "fractured view now a lens of gratitude" shows genuine stance crystallization with emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—proving "empty spaces remember"—drives her methodical cataloging with escalation through Altocumulus #112's dissolution forcing acceptance. Her agency manifests through observation and memorialization rather than action. Cost is visible in her isolation and the months without smiling, though the pressure could tighten more dramatically.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes escalate from preserving knowledge to transmuting it through art, with the revelation about her blindness-as-lens deepening the pressure. The demolition countdown provides external urgency while internal stakes shift from deficit to gift. Cost appears in the acceptance of destruction—her art "was never for display."

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal curiosity to ship-wide transformation as Arlen proves his theory, with the crew chalking larger grids and ships altering course to witness. The cost is visible in his "trembling hands" and three sleepless nights. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, though the external conflict could intensify further.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (understanding broken things that cannot be mended versus those that must be) accumulates through mirror revelations toward her final transformation. The gears' levitation and constellation formation provides visual escalation. However, the conflict lacks immediate pressure—she faces no real opposition or time constraint, reducing tension despite the conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: mysterious messages → bell discovery → collective gathering → nebula manifestation, with the orchard's thinning roots creating genuine urgency. The stake of collective survival versus dispersal is clear, though individual cost could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—making entropy gentle rather than violent—is signaled early and deepens through the activation of nested patterns that progressively still larger scales (sea, planet, constellation). Cost is visible in the world's dissolution and the adjuster's acceptance of his own ending. The tightening from personal duty to universal consequence forecloses all other options.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes crystallize around preventing another ghost joining the chorus, with frost as temporal pressure. The caretaker's indirect guidance method shows agency under constraint. The cost is more implied than visceral in the rescue sequence itself.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.2)
    Under the Accumulative lens, pressure builds through deepening metaphorical layers—chrysalis to foam to polymer scaffold—each reweighting her understanding of loss. The stakes (processing grief, finding meaning in daughter's death) intensify through accumulation rather than reversal, with cost visible in her acceptance of impermanence.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake - the vendor's need to manage her own erasure through helping others - accumulates through seven transactions that deepen understanding. Each sale reveals more about the weight she carries, building to her realization about distribution versus elimination. However, the conflict lacks a decisive tightening moment; transactions proceed without complication or meaningful resistance that would heighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—subsuming stored remorse—escalates from personal to collective as Elira descends, with clear cost when she removes gloves knowing the contagion risk. The tidal pool method guides her to the "still center" where she can work most effectively. Escalation through accumulation works under the textural lens, though the resolution arrives somewhat quickly after the buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—rehabilitating isolation into voice—escalates from Elara's singing through the elevator's hesitant response to full articulation and community gathering. Cost appears in Elara's night mission abandoning regular duties and the weight left behind as permanent commitment. However, the resolution feels somewhat frictionless; the town's instant acceptance and the elevator's rapid eloquence reduce earned tension.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—transforming grief into curiosity through neural modification—is signaled early and deepens when the child's memory floods the protagonist, forcing her to confront her own "lab where equations replaced empathy." The escalation from finding the mirror to absorbing memories to committing to ongoing excavation work shows progression, though the conflict remains largely internal without external resistance or clear trade-offs beyond emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (decoding the seventh eye to access forgotten knowledge) escalates through Elira's agency—fusing fragments, tracing the sigil, speaking dialects. The permanent sealing of the chamber provides clear cost. Minor deduction for relatively smooth progression without significant resistance once gravity inverts.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—breaking the world's hollow silence—escalates from Silas finding the insulator through mapping its fractures to carving the resonance chamber. The cost manifests in "months" of silence endured and the "tears tracking slow paths" at resolution, though the escalation relies more on accumulation than decisive turns.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—finding meaning in exile—is clear but lacks concrete opposition or escalation. The "magnetic field surge" provides atmosphere but doesn't force choices; the protagonist's decision to teach others feels inevitable rather than hard-won against resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving silences before fireworks destroy them—is clear but lacks visceral escalation. The story shows one meaningful tightening when the clasp begins to yield ("hairline fracture of surrender"), but the conflict remains largely internal and technical rather than dramatically pressurized. The fireworks provide external urgency but arrive too late to genuinely complicate the central action.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation occurs through the seed's seventeen-moon dormancy building to the bloom event. The "tide's thought turning" provides the pressure point that triggers transformation, though this mechanism could be more concrete. Village-wide change demonstrates clear cost in forced confrontation with truth.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (understanding resilience) progresses through discovery of the arrow, its growth-acceleration reveal, to the final understanding about memory/echoing. The gravity-inversion deadline creates genuine pressure. However, the physical stakes remain somewhat abstract—no clear cost if Elira fails beyond continued ignorance.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from investigating past disaster to predicting/preventing the next convergence point within six hours. The tightening occurs through discovery that repositioning the crane "only changed its shape" of danger. Agency manifests in the choice to map danger despite isolation, though the immediate physical cost could be more explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—certifying wonder as essential—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. There's one meaningful deepening when the ice reveals hidden veins and fossils, but no concrete opposition or trade-off forces a choice. The protagonist faces no resistance, no cost for her actions, making the stakes feel declared rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding how realms collapsed—escalates through concrete discoveries (Verdantis from ambition, Silmara from timidity, Khyren from perfection) that deepen understanding rather than reverse it. Agency manifests through her decision to witness rather than repair, with visible cost in leaving the flute behind. The pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens as insights accumulate toward her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on mapping emotion through borrowed personalities, with escalation through increasingly intense borrowed identities (widow→mad mathematician). The halo's dimming creates resource scarcity that forces the final choice to walk away. The warlord's transformation demonstrates concrete cost, though the protagonist's agency remains primarily observational rather than confrontational.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.9)
    Central stake of recovering/spreading wonder escalates from personal (pendant vibration) through interpersonal (child encounter) to communal (market transformation). The cost is legible when she releases the pendant. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, though the stakes could sharpen slightly at the child encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—proving emotional absorption—escalates through progressive revelations (faces→gestures→driver's moments→final relief), with the mystic's choice to withhold proof creating meaningful cost. However, the escalation lacks sharp tightening moments; the visions accumulate rather than forcing trade-offs. The "shifted hush" functions more as atmosphere than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes escalate through the spinner's progressive dissolution—"memories of his laugh, the scent of his cloak" transmuting into the weave forecloses return with each pass. The discovered puzzle shifts from curiosity to doorway, forcing the choice between remaining whole but separated or sacrificing form to reach him. The final cost—complete physical dissolution—charges the man's recognition when the bead appears.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on proving "meekness was not weakness" through the gradual depletion of the silk resource, with meaningful escalation as villagers grow stronger while Arlo's material thins. The final cost—giving up the silk entirely to become the source himself—lands clearly, though middle pressure could tighten further through more immediate obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal discovery to existential revelation about Elira's very existence being an "accident of divergence." The cost manifests in her non-existence in Universe Sigma-7 and the weight of responsibility. One meaningful tightening occurs when she discovers her mother's sacrifice. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the conflict until the final revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake - transforming grief into connection - deepens through the lamp's extinction creating genuine crisis that forces Elias to enact rather than merely deliver care. The cost is visible in his vulnerability with the sea glass and stone message. However, the lamp's mysterious re-lighting undercuts agency slightly, and the resolution feels somewhat predetermined rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes remain entirely abstract—"steering the world's dreaming edge" and "shaping dawn" never materialize into concrete conflicts with tangible consequences. No meaningful escalation occurs; the herald performs her routine without opposition or tightening pressure. The piece declares cosmic importance but dramatizes only static observation and ritual repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen through accumulative discoveries: wing's oblique brilliance → old man's refractive quietness → cultivating personal fractures. The progression from external observation to internal transformation shows clear escalation under the textural lens. Cost manifests in the emotional responses to the final fabric, though the middle section could tighten pressure between discoveries.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes deepen from mechanical repair to understanding grief's witnesses to accepting the role of memory-keeper, with the sextant's "overload" forcing the choice. The trees' active participation ("leaned toward her—not in threat, but recognition") escalates pressure effectively, though the resolution lacks a sharper trade-off beyond role abandonment.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from personal (keeper's scattered memory) through communal (forgotten songs) to realm-wide transformation, with the mica's response to humming providing the key tightening moment. The cost is visible in the community's prior isolation and the keeper's vulnerability. Slight deduction as the resolution feels somewhat inevitable once the singing begins.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.2)
    Central stake (belonging vs. self-exile) signals early and deepens when the invitation reveals her self-address, forcing confrontation with past choices. The cost is legible—seven winters of isolation, risk of judgment. Slight deduction because the external pressure remains mostly internal until the implied dawn arrival; more concrete opposition would strengthen.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes center on finding "tenuous absolution" through small acts of defiance, with escalation reading through accumulation: bread offering → uncloaking → seed planting. The cost manifests in "shedding armor" and accepting uncertainty ("doesn't know if they'll grow"). One meaningful deepening occurs when she shifts from passive noticing to active rebellion, though pressure could tighten more decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake of preserving meaning against oblivion escalates through the three vows, with forgiveness recalibrating the entire Array. The slide's dimming creates temporal pressure. Cost is visible in the slide's complete extinction, though agency remains primarily observational rather than decisional.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from observation through two failed infiltration attempts to the final calculated revelation. The protagonist's agency drives the climax through her choice to deploy the watch fob at the precise moment. Cost is visible in The Chain's retreat and the market holding its breath—though the protagonist walks away unharmed, limiting full cost.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding why people carry weather—escalates through the taste progression and culminates in the man's absorption by the forest. Agency manifests through her choice to trust rather than doubt. Cost is legible in his dissolution and her surrender of skepticism. Minor deduction for the slightly passive nature of her role in the central transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake of creative suppression versus expression signals early and tightens when the lock rattles in resonance with the cave's own imprisonment history. The discovery of the hidden charcoal escalates options, forcing the choice between continued suppression or release. Cost is legible through the portraits' dissolution and the father's final softening.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes center on finding lost conversations, with the protagonist's wilting creating physical urgency. The escalation through discoveries—child's echo, mother's note, chest of letters—builds pressure effectively. However, the resolution lacks a decisive trade-off; she simply packs up and leaves, making the cost feel more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on preserving wonder's capacity to be felt, tested when the child arrives and gasps—"the first honest reaction they'd ever known." Escalation reads through accumulation: daily climbing, storm adjustments, the child's awakening, then the tuner stopping her climb with the sculpture continuing. Cost appears in her death/absence, though agency at closure shifts to wind and weather rather than protagonist choice.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.9)
    The internal static escalates to threatened core overload, forcing the decisive burn action. Cost is legible in the physical transformation ("threaded with faint bioluminescent traceries") and the permanent integration of fears that can never be re-contained.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate through Elara's patient four-dawn ritual, with Leo's resistance creating genuine tension before his surrender. The cost is visible in his sustained weeping and the community's shared grief stories, though the resolution feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes escalate from infiltration to liberation to self-sacrifice, with Elira's dance protocol creating genuine pressure against patrol drones. The dominant stake of encrypted resistance coheres throughout. However, the Overseers remain abstract antagonists, and the middle section lacks a concrete tightening moment before the final escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen through accumulation: from cataloging anomalies to recognizing the coffee pattern matches her father's journal to making the irreversible choice to step through. The cost is tangible—three winters of searching, the risk of stepping into unknown gravity pockets. However, the resolution lacks sharp trade-offs; the reunion comes without visible sacrifice beyond the years already spent.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes deepen meaningfully as the prophecy reveals itself as plea rather than doom, forcing the summoner to accept an endless commitment. The cost manifests in her acceptance of perpetual service ("tomorrow, and the night after, and the night after that"), though the emotional weight of this sacrifice could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from personal curiosity to reciprocal communication with a sentient structure, with the seal-as-cipher revelation forcing a new understanding. The cost is years of patient ritual and coded tea sessions. The "agreed upon lies" create sustained tension without requiring reversals, appropriate for this accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure accumulates through the deepening resonance between shell and psyche, culminating in the vow "I remember you. I carry you. You are not lost." The cost is legible in what she leaves behind—the shell becomes a waypoint rather than a possession, showing genuine renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—releasing the kingdom from the Binding Scroll's curse—is signaled early and tightens as the scroll resists her forgery. Clear escalation as "ink writhed, letters bled, parchment buckled" with visible cost in her blood sacrifice. Minor deduction because the opposition comes mainly from the scroll itself rather than active antagonistic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate through the shell's progressive disclosures revealing deeper layers of the echo-theft, culminating in confronting the entity. The singer's agency drives the resolution through her choice to sing rather than destroy. Cost is visible in physical exhaustion and emotional weight, though the entity's transformation feels slightly unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—salvaging uncorrupted emotional echoes from drowned objects—intensifies through the revelation of the child's final protective act and culminates in the ghost whisperer's choice to create a permanent window rather than exorcise. Cost is visible in the released sigh and the ripple effects on strangers who must confront their own losses. The escalation through dream analysis to shrine ritual to release works under the accumulative lens, though the protagonist's agency could be more contested.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake of appreciating hidden effort deepens through accumulation (widow's story, chalk marks, harbor lanterns) with the philosopher's choice to remain anonymous creating tension. The whistling evolves from testing air to weaving wonder, showing progression. Cost appears in choosing invisibility over recognition, though a sharper trade-off at closure would strengthen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal investigation to world-scale discovery as she uncovers the stillpoints network, with meaningful deepening when the diamond transforms from "cursed object" to survival tool. The cost manifests in her sorrow for suppressed truths and her acceptance of being called "cursed" herself. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens though the middle section could tighten between letter assembly and orchard exploration.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake - broadcasting counter-narrative against Kael's unity-through-surrender - is signaled early and deepens when rebels start finding Elira through fragmented psalms. The tightening from passive listening to active transmission shows agency, though the cost remains somewhat abstract ("not as weapon, but as carrier wave") rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—preserving ephemeral beauty against loss—escalates from personal collection to community healing through the music box catalyst, with each jar exchange raising emotional cost. The poet's evolution from selling verses for pennies to gifting memories anonymously shows agency foreclosing his vagrant path, though the middle section's townspeople exchanges could use more dramatized pressure rather than summary.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (protecting the Heartstone) is signaled early and tightens when sonic harpoons strike, forcing her counter-frequency response. Agency manifests through her choice to become "the living dam against sonic entropy" with visible cost. However, the scavengers pose minimal genuine threat—their instant conversion undermines the escalation's credibility, resolving too easily through "harmonic grace."

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes build through accumulation rather than reversal—from solitary mapping to children arriving, then parents, elders, soldiers, finally the regime's envoys. The cost manifests in the regime's three-stage retreat (confusion, hesitation, withdrawal) and the mapper's sustained patience "under stone," though peak pressure could be more viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes deepen from routine investigation to confronting the city's "refusal to remember," with the investigator choosing witness over career advancement. The pressure accumulates through spectral encounters that force her stance crystallization. The cost manifests in her predicted dismissal and the physical burden of tattooed names, though the middle section could tighten around the discovery sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure escalates meaningfully through technical frustration to the storm-light revelation, with Elias's agency driving both the months of learning and the final synchronization choice. The cost is legible in his dedication and the emotional weight of fulfilling Maribel's dying wish, though the resolution arrives somewhat smoothly once the solution appears.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through Zeta's physical degradation ("voice cracked") and the workshop's increasing instability under acid waves, with the seventeen-cycle dormant bell as the measure of success. The arrow tip's "ancestral memory" deepens the algorithm's hunger for organic desire. Cost is visible but could be sharper—the transformation feels earned but the personal price to Zeta beyond exhaustion remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation follows discovery pattern from numbers to coordinates to ritual restoration, with each revelation narrowing her options. The final cost—eternal vigilance as their anchor—is legible. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the crew exists in system gaps rather than being deleted.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—reconstituting courage through witnessing humanity—escalates from personal healing to collective possibility as she prepares to carry this practice forward. The ice shifting from threat to possibility provides meaningful deepening. However, external pressure remains somewhat abstract; the conflict is primarily internal without concrete opposition testing her methods.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (understanding endings) escalates from passive listening to active pursuit when Elara climbs onto the ice floe toward certain danger. The glacier collapse provides meaningful deepening as she discovers endings are "thresholds" not "events," with near-death as the visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on whether understanding can emerge from fundamental incompatibility ("I'd rather burn than bend" vs "I'd rather bend than break"). One meaningful deepening occurs when Mara shifts from "our love failed" to "we were meant to be...differently," with visible cost in their permanent separation yet newfound understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake (preserving wisdom's echo) deepens through accumulation as each clearing forms and stabilizes, with the parapet's response creating reciprocal pressure. The protagonist's agency drives the ritual through peripheral awareness rather than force. Cost is legible in physical exhaustion and the irreversible nature of consecration, though the conflict lacks a sharp tightening moment.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.8)
    Under the Accumulative lens, the piece builds pressure through three photographs that deepen the meditation on transformation, but stakes remain abstract—"collective healing" never faces concrete opposition or test. The archivist's work proceeds without obstacles, trade-offs, or visible cost; even the "knees protesting" is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding growth through decay—builds through accumulation until the crystal's question forces the scholar to abandon her detached observation. Cost is visible in her setting down the stylus and breaking years of silence. The escalation is subtle but appropriate for the textural mode, though a stronger mid-story tightening would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—locating the sound of aging—tightens through ritual precision with driftwood pointing toward specific tapes, culminating in the discovered sound beneath chalk's screech. Cost is legible in physical trembling and immediate forgetting. However, escalation remains somewhat static as the prophet's agency is limited to repetitive searching rather than adapting tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake of restructuring time's architecture escalates from observing the spinning hand through placing it on the plinth to achieving synchronization with cosmic radiation. Cost is visible in the "bittersweet throb of letting go" and environmental response (dust, flickering stars), though the resolution through "the sound of a leaf falling" feels somewhat arbitrary rather than inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—reunifying souls with peace through mundane hymns—is signaled early and deepens as each hymn triggers recognition in the gathered souls. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure builds through layered mundane sounds becoming sacred, with the vinyl shard's dissolution marking irreversible commitment. However, the lack of genuine opposition or risk to Elara herself limits the escalation's intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes clearly established: finding where shadows literally go at noon. Escalation through seventeen nights of ritual builds pressure. The cost is visible when Elira transforms into "keeper of thresholds," forever changed. One meaningful deepening as she discovers shadows are "sealed" not destroyed.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—transforming grief into redemption—deepens through the protagonist's ritual with the tooth, though escalation remains subtle rather than dramatic. The "cleft in certainty" between belief and truth creates tension, and the final image of the tooth "pulsing...like a heart remembering" carries emotional cost without requiring external conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes deepen through accumulative pressure as polishing becomes metaphor for processing trauma. The dominant stake (sharing light without fire) intensifies through memory layers. Cost is visible in physical toll and years of isolation. One meaningful deepening occurs as the glass transforms from personal vow to communal healing.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (reclaiming agency after viral exposure) deepens through accumulation rather than reversal. The shift from hiding to "grafting new meaning" shows agency through micro-choices. Cost is visible in placing the confession under moss - transformation requires accepting rather than erasing.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes crystallize around the novelist's refusal of "narrative inevitability" and "publishers who wanted resolution," with escalation through accumulating cameo encounters that teach her to release rather than preserve. The dominant stake—authentic witness versus marketable product—tightens when she places the seashell down, though the middle section could apply more pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—restoring sacred practices—is signaled early and pressure builds through the vine's response, the arbor's gathering hush, and the oak's question "Why did we stop singing?" The meaningful deepening occurs when Elara shifts from playing forgotten songs to enabling the land itself to remember. Cost is visible in the generational loss acknowledged, though agency remains somewhat passive (listening rather than deciding).

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes emerge through the ritual's accumulating pattern with blood as signature creating irreversible commitment, though lacking a sharp reversal or tightening moment. The transformation from seeking to becoming the map carries clear cost through physical sacrifice and the responsibility of guiding "the lost not by sight, but by pulse."

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving wonder for "when the world grew too loud"—signals early and deepens through accumulation of discoveries (glyphs, pulses, shattered stalactites). Agency manifests through deliberate methodology rather than external conflict, with the locksmith's patience and peripheral vision approach foreclosing direct observation. Cost appears in the abandoned village context and his solitary work, though pressure could tighten more decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes deepen through the accumulation of burden metaphors, from the man's lost daughter to the weaver's own trapped purpose. The tension between helping others and bearing eternal duty creates genuine pressure. The cost is visible in the final image, though the conflict lacks a decisive tightening turn—more resonant accumulation than escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes deepen through Eleanor's shift from attempting to "contain" memory to learning to "move with grief," with the carving serving as the pressure point. The kettle's escalating demands ("screamed again, urgent") provide temporal pressure, though the conflict remains largely internal without a sharp tightening moment.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulation of collected fragments toward the ghost confrontation, with the camera exchange marking a decisive shift. The cost is conceptually clear (accepting inability to fix the past) though the emotional price could be more viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether decay can be transformed through redirection rather than restoration—deepens through escalating interventions that each require more complex engineering.

However, there's no meaningful opposition or risk; everything Elira attempts succeeds without setback, reducing tension despite the conceptual elegance.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake (reconciling with artistic abandonment) deepens through the crystal's influence, forcing Elias to confront his fossilized dreams with palpable cost in accepting a smaller creative scope. While pressure accumulates effectively, the resolution arrives somewhat smoothly without sharp resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes center on understanding versus deception, with meaningful deepening when the locket's inscription reframes lies as "architecture erected to keep love from crumbling."

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes center on preserving vanishing knowledge through embodied learning versus documentation. The tension between "photograph/frame/forget" and "carry/weave" creates meaningful pressure. The protagonist's patient sitting, mimicry, and failure before success shows agency foreclosing the easier path of mere observation.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes intensify through the progression from general absence to specific focus on Elira, with the traveler's obituary becoming "a compass" that reweights loss as orientation. The deepening from passive grief to active cartography shows meaningful escalation, though more visible cost in the mapping act itself would strengthen this.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—reawakening beauty in a mechanical world—signals early and deepens through the prince's increasingly desperate assembly work. Escalation reads through accumulating details of his efforts (copper veins, dismantled music boxes, calibrated pendulums) toward the activation moment. The cost is visible in his isolation and the risk of failure, though the resolution's ambiguity about the egg slightly softens the final pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.0)
    Under the accumulative lens, pressure builds through layered imagery of fire/water, destruction/salvation, culminating in her choice to thread the coin around the figure's wrist—a gesture that forecloses the path of denial with visible cost. The tension between her professional duty (fire call) and personal reckoning creates authentic pressure, though the stakes could tighten more dramatically.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes center on liberation of trapped memories with clear escalation from individual fountain to city-wide transformation. The "slap of bare feet on wet stone" and weeping old man show concrete cost. One meaningful deepening occurs when memories pour out "as scent, warmth, vibration." Slightly limited by the protagonist's lack of personal risk.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (breaking destructive generational patterns) signals early and deepens through the gear's transformation. The choice of "slow seep" over "fire" represents meaningful agency with clear trade-offs—accepting that gentle change "might never be noticed." Escalation occurs through accumulation rather than reversal, fitting the Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: family poems → stranger epitaphs → final grandmother ribbon, with Silas's presence intensifying from distant watching to direct heart-touch. The butterfly migration provides external pressure. Cost is legible in accepting grief as "current to be joined" rather than void to fill, though the middle could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—Elias's need for "incremental absolution"—deepens through the rake's discovery into a choice between mechanical perfection and grace. Escalation occurs through accumulation rather than reversal, building from duty through discovery to surrender. The cost manifests in releasing forty-three years of identity, though the transformation could face more resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding intentions and unfinished stories—deepens through the tapestry untangling sequence, with each thread revealing specific losses (buried letters, swallowed joy). The escalation from external observation to personal recognition ("these were not strangers' stories, but reflections") provides meaningful tightening. However, the resolution lacks a sharp decisive moment where cost becomes undeniable; the transformation feels more contemplative than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—seeding innovation within constraint—is signaled early and deepens through the revelation that "innovation thrives not in boundless freedom, but in tension." The story's single meaningful deepening occurs when she shifts from forcing grandeur to coaxing resonance, with cost visible in accepting misuse and misunderstanding.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen from personal rebellion to collective resurrection as she discovers the network of scribes. The radio's increasing heat provides escalation, and her tears as "final catalyst" creates meaningful cost, though the middle section could tighten between discovery and action.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation operates through accumulative density rather than causal reversals—the powder ritual intensifies, the woman's recognition creates emotional pressure, the chair's stillness forces confrontation with "absence." The dominant stake of capturing/honoring fleeting emotion before it evaporates coheres throughout. Limited by the visitor interaction feeling somewhat brief and the cost remaining primarily conceptual rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—preservation versus erasure—establishes immediately and deepens through accumulation rather than reversal. The Council's "Forward Without Looking Back" monument provides the clearest tightening of opposition. His methodical cataloging against their bulldozing creates genuine tension. Some deduction for the conflict remaining somewhat abstract rather than forcing immediate, costly choices.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.8)
    Under the accumulative lens, pressure builds through layered memory and the weight of "vanishing arts" until the student's arrival forces Elara's choice between resignation and renewed teaching. The stakes (preserving harmony in a dissonant world) remain somewhat abstract until the final confrontation. Cost is more retrospective than immediately felt in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—transforming ruin into potential—escalates through Elara's pruning choices, seed planting, and decision not to harvest. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens as memories flood her tongue with each cut. The celestial alignment provides time pressure, though the actual cost of her ongoing commitment could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes escalate from preserving wonder through riddles to revealing the drones' evolution into living batteries, with the woman's arrival forcing Elias to choose between maintaining mystery and sharing truth. The cost lands in "Wonder isn't meant to be explained. It's meant to be revealed," showing his commitment to gradual revelation over immediate understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—sanctifying forgotten architectures—deepens when the protagonist senses the specific cottage "pulsed" with unresolved presence. The ritual's completion releases the cottage's grip, a meaningful if quiet resolution. However, escalation relies more on accumulation than active pressure, and the cost remains primarily conceptual rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from historical discovery to civilizational transformation to personal metamorphosis. The ampoule's shattering triggers meaningful deepening as light reveals hidden murals and truth. However, the historian faces little resistance—her wonder makes acceptance too frictionless for maximum pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: from carving proofs to speaking them aloud, until one "so elegant, so brutally simple, it folded space like origami." The stakes—capturing the texture of missed opportunity—deepen when the staircase ripples and reveals the frozen moment, forcing him to touch and absorb what he'd avoided.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (proving strangers remember kindness) accumulates pressure through escalating glyph effects, from barista's compulsion to teenager's arrival. Cost becomes visible through the painter's isolation and the weight of carrying this mission alone until the final shift. Some middle sections could tighten the connection between specific glyphs and their city-wide effects.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from individual artistic preservation to communal renaissance, with the bread ritual forcing increasingly vulnerable artistic expressions (boy's drum, cracked flute, wire lyre).

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—breaking fate's design—escalates from investigation to activation to accepting consequences. The reversal where he discovers the yoyo was a message from his future self meaningfully tightens the paradox. Cost is visible: the lighthouse fractures, the hunger stone dissolves, and he must "carry its weight alone." One meaningful deepening occurs when memories flood in, changing his understanding of the stone's history.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clear escalation from wandering to confrontation to revelation that fear is "the hunted thought." The dominant stake (conquering fear) tightens through the extraction of memories and direct confrontation. Cost is visible in the physical act of reaching into one's chest to extract trauma. Slightly mechanical in the fear-as-mirror revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes escalate through sonic accumulation: cloud-reading → wave-playing → sea darkening → fruit-seed percussion → Kael's golden helix altering reality. The Prophet's agency drives each escalation, with visible cost in his exhaustion. The transformation isn't reversed but internalized as "the tide turned inward," showing permanent change.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (breaking the watchers' silence) escalates from theory to proof when one turns its head, narrowing options to direct confrontation. The "electric certainty" and willingness to join the lost expedition shows clear cost, though the final confrontation remains prospective rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—rescuing historical truth from calcified myth—intensifies from discovery through the choice between explosive revelation and strategic invitation. The mentor's warning about holding the lantern "too high" or "too low" creates a genuine tactical constraint that shapes her final approach. Cost manifests in accepting the "revisionist" label and the "quiet certainty" replacing any triumph, though the middle could tighten the pressure between truth and social cohesion more viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (preserving memory against entropy) established early and deepens through accumulating note-placements to the bride's letter discovery, which forces Elara's emotional breakthrough. The pavilion's physical resistance ("resisted her—not with hostility, but with entropy") creates coherent pressure. Cost is visible in the draining inkwell and Elara's transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from seeking origins to witnessing deliberate erasure, with the Master Index revelation forcing her to become testimony-bearer. The "blackout" as suppression creates persistent pressure. Minor deduction for relatively safe investigation until the final ascent—the danger could have been more immediate throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on transforming grief, with one meaningful deepening when the basilica hums in a new key, forcing Silas's decisive action. The shadow's ascent into "hollows of memory" creates pressure that narrows options. Some softness in how the transformation mechanics work (shadow drinking dreams), but the cost is clear—destroying all his preserved memories to achieve presence rather than memory.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on cartographic proof that "potential doesn't die" with one meaningful deepening when coordinates emerge from the perturbation. The protagonist's agency drives the search while the geode provides the means. Cost is visible in her isolation and the names she whispers. Lacks a sharp reversal but the accumulative pressure coheres toward departure.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from physical discovery to existential recognition as the chip "tunes" the protagonist to suppressed frequencies of self. The dominant stake—recovering belonging through technological artifact versus internal recognition—tightens when visions reveal "These weren't her memories. Or were they?" Cost is visible in the tears and the surrender of professional armor, though the middle section could apply more pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering the weight of withheld truth—deepens through accumulation as Elira moves from general seeking to the specific revelation about her father's sacrifice vs. abandonment. The cost manifests physically (vomiting) and psychologically (carrying truth as "ballast"). While the transformation is meaningful, the lack of active opposition or complication keeps this from higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation works through accumulative deepening: from waiting alone → his arrival → relic exchange → walking together. The dominant stake (reconciliation vs maintained division) tightens when they exchange objects with clear emotional cost. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake of finding direction after collapse escalates through accumulation—naming poles, pocketing washer, finally paddling out.

Cost visible in accepting imperfect navigation over precision.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from seeking the lake to confronting unmade choices when ripples reveal "each wavelet a path not taken." The seeker's agency drives the release of the baseball with clear cost: accepting "raw, aching proximity to pain." Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens as images compound toward the kindling of empathy.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake (reforging the bond with the phoenix) intensifies through sensory accumulation and the protagonist's physical transformation. The cost is visible in her metamorphosis—"bone learning feather, blood learning flame"—and the final state where she's fundamentally changed. Under the accumulative lens, the deepening works well through density increase rather than reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from seeking lost time to confronting the archive of "unspent kisses" and "postponed lullabies," forcing the choice to release rather than reclaim. The transformation from "cartomancer" to "mother" shows clear cost. Slight reduction for the convenience of the child's voice appearing at the exact closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes escalate through emotional calibration requirements ("Too heavy, and the gate would shatter. Too light, and she'd slip past") with the shadow-work providing crucial deepening. The final photograph's "overwhelmed joy" frequency creates the precise tightening needed, and dimensional pressure physically buckles the ship, showing irreversible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from releasing bugs to confronting "unlived lives" to accepting her own abandoned path—each bottle raises the emotional cost. The fourth bottle's dissolution into her chest marks the crucial tightening where she must accept what she fled. The final bug shattering its own glass shows agency beyond the protagonist's control, adding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (sparking revolution through geometry) is clear early and tightens through the blackout opportunity. The protagonist's agency drives escalation via calculated risk-taking with the sundial alignment. Cost is legible in the phrase "cradle of sparks, gently rocked" suggesting fragility of success.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from failing to grasp sacred patterns through decades to achieving synchronization via painted rock sequences. The frictionless world's arrival triggers the eels' responsiveness, creating genuine pressure that narrows options to geometric arrangement rather than physical capture.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on whether to break the vigil by opening the envelope, with pressure accumulating through storm intensification and the timer reaching zero, forcing the choice to maintain sacred silence. The cost is conceptual rather than visceral—"honoring the question" over seeking answers—which fits the reflective mode but lacks the immediate price that would elevate beyond mid-7s.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from intellectual sparring to recovering culturally significant lost knowledge, with the 11:03 deadline creating time pressure. The shift from competition to collaboration marks a meaningful tightening. Cost is visible in their decision to spread forgotten knowledge rather than hoard it, though the personal price could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether beauty can bloom from anarchy—deepens through Molt's progression from reading smuggled poems to actively planting seeds and singing, with Elias's transfer forcing her final stance. The cost appears in her shed cynicism and grief, though escalation could tighten further in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—surprising fate to recover her lover—escalates cleanly from tentative playing to reality-shattering crescendo. Each musical progression tightens options: first chord → arbor shudders → clock ticks → compasses align → final impossible chord. The cost is visible in the burning film reel and the irrevocable change to reality itself.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving collective memory before the monsoon's erasure—is established early and tightens through Aris's doubt about misinterpretation. The pressure escalates from verification anxiety to the seed's violent pulse and splitting, with visible cost as villagers experience involuntary recall. While the conflict is primarily internal and procedural rather than oppositional, the stakes remain visceral through concrete examples of cultural loss.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (finding/diffusing the color of regret) is signaled early and tightens through the ritual sequence. Escalation occurs through the lace instructions building to color manifestation. The cost is legible in the transformed landscape and Elio's acceptance of carrying this burden to other islets.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes center on whether she can reframe catastrophe into calibration, and pressure deepens via progressive pattern formation culminating in the logarithmic spiral. The meaningful tightening is the spiral that fuses her astrophysics models with the dust, compelling a professional and existential stance. Conflict is mostly internal and textural rather than oppositional; the social pressure (“breakdown”) supplies a modest external cost.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes center on regaining purpose and reinterpreting the ledger’s meaning; pressure coheres through pattern accretion. The frost‑ledger synchrony is a clear tightening that alters knowledge and reweights her path. Costs are quiet but legible (renunciation of commerce, chosen solitude). Escalation is subtle yet sufficient under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear early; the key deepening is when the ice “sings back” and the thermal map begins to stitch into a score. Pressure coheres through the pattern of awakenings, but options rarely narrow and there’s minimal on‑page cost beyond endurance. Resolution is earned via agency (methodic strikes, mapping), albeit with low resistance. The gentle arc suits the lens but limits intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—answer the distress—tightens as he moves deeper and completes the lattice, with a clear cadence shift at activation. Agency is decisive, but obstacles are minimal; there’s no on‑page test that significantly endangers or complicates the plan. The price is conceptual (foreclosing surface, continuing burden) rather than visceral. Escalation is coherent and sufficient for the length but lacks a hard squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—sustaining a covenant of care under sanctions—tightens through the note’s challenge and the “longest night” convening. The first bell ring functions as the escalation payoff, shifting from solitary anonymity to shared agency.

The quiet pressure coheres and grows appropriately for the lens and length.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are singular and legible: locate the reservoir of unused love. Escalation deepens via pattern intensification—tear discovery, breath‑trail pursuit, pilgrim encounter, unfurling—but the pressure remains gentle with minimal narrowing or traded options.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes (artistic discovery vs. erosion of self/memory) are signaled early and escalate sharply at the inversion and disintegration turn. Agency comes via endurance and renunciation rather than conquest, fitting the lens; the price is unmistakable. Pressure coheres through one meaningful deepening and a crystallized final stance. A minor limitation: conflict remains internal/experiential, not opposed by a live will, but the cost compensates.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is established early (breach vault before wall falls) with a meaningful tightening at the piano lock and a quiet deepening in the vault. Pressure accrues through time and risk, though opposition remains off‑stage. The cost is present but understated; a single on‑page complication or forced trade‑off would have heightened escalation. Still, agency governs each turn, and the ending forecloses safety for signal.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—capture the sound before it’s too late—tightens through the marrow clock and the deliberate sacrifice of personal absences. The decisive intensification is the heard “crack,” leading to the device’s creation and the charged choice to leave. Cost is legible (relinquishing the hope of restoration, bodily hunger, sanctified ashes). Tension works on sentence and scene scales without requiring an antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—enact revelation without being seen—remains coherent and deepens with the jar’s depletion. Escalation is gentle: two interventions build density rather than narrowing options via resistance. The cost is clear but modest; pressure doesn’t truly tighten against a counterforce. Still, the cadence shift at the end reads earned under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes center on renunciation and building refuge; escalation accrues via ritual beats and furnace ignition rather than direct opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—liberation from a mentor’s theft—stays coherent and tightens into the decisive burn. The decryption deepens pressure and narrows options; agency drives the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—give shape to endless night—tightens via the clock of the final star and culminates in her chosen entry, foreclosing retreat.

The cost is implied and felt, not dramatized against an opposing force, which limits visceral pressure. Still, one meaningful cadence shift lands cleanly under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure deepens through patterned accrual: noticing → tuning to emotion → self‑resonance response → reframed quest. Stakes are internal but clear—answer versus the comfort of routine—and the path narrows when the “voice” arises from within, invalidating the external approach. The price is visible (losing the violin, closing a line of inquiry) and the protagonist’s agency drives the turns. Slight abstraction keeps it just shy of maximal bite, but escalation remains coherent and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure escalates texturally: private intention → public exposure → communal test via touch and hum → acceptance at cost. The dominant stake (thawing mistrust) tightens when others emerge and risk contact, culminating in the child’s hand and the lens cracking. Agency is endurance and exposure rather than debate, and it earns the resolution. Slight softness remains from low oppositional force on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure coheres around defying institutional metrics, with a clean tightening when the intern delivers a direct order. The protagonist’s refusal is the resolution, linking internal conviction to external defiance. However, consequences remain largely off‑stage, softening the felt price at the peak. The conflict is strong but remains more ideological than materially perilous in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.0)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake; escalation arrives with the other Elira’s warning and the necessity to maintain grip and adjust precisely. The tightening is real but measured—no antagonist, limited jeopardy beyond procedural risk. The choice to continue despite terror functions, if quietly, as the test. Stakes remain intimate rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—summoning/finishing the drowned symphony—intensifies as the ghost materializes and conducts. Escalation reads as a cadence shift under the textural lens (lantern sputter, water vibrating, image solidifying). Agency is clear in her decision to “disrupt” via intention and embodied mime; the price is mostly spiritual/physical rather than peril‑driven. A sharper on‑page trade‑off or foreclosed option would heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are internal but legible early (“mass of a truth” → “consequence”), and pressure coheres as the wind and illness narrow tactics. The meaningful tightening is the hatch opening and the choice to expose the drawing—foreclosing the path of perfect preservation. Cost is visible (sacrifice of the artwork, exposure to cold), though escalation is quiet rather than knotted through multiple reversals. The oracle’s counsel deepens rather than resolves the conflict for her, preserving agency.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (can she locate and own the weight of guilt) tightens through the radio reveal and culminates in the tactile act of turning the wheel and accepting burden.

Escalation is quiet but genuine and character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure escalates via density and cadence rather than conflict: entering the refuge intensifies stakes into the vision of seasons/civilizations, then resolves into a costed stance. The primary stake—can one witness without judgment—tightens at the inversion and the return. The cost is emotional renunciation/softening, not plot jeopardy, but it is clear. One substantive deepening occurs and holds to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake: can ordinary magic be nurtured in real time. The eclipse is the meaningful tightening; Elara’s agency is to hold the space, modulate song, and risk sharing/letting go of the keepsake. The price is vulnerability and loss of a private anchor, which narrows options and commits her mission to community. Absence of antagonistic pushback keeps the intensity gentle, but it remains earned.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—realigning memory against the displaced axis—tightens through clue accrual and culminates in a deliberate next step. Escalation is a deepening of knowledge rather than a hard narrowing with paid cost; still, the “loom” plan and underlibrary hazard raise pressure. No antagonist is needed under this lens, though a sharper on‑page risk or trade‑off would lift stakes. The final choice reads earned, not incidental.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are primarily existential and reputational—whether Elias can “transpose life”—and escalation is a density build, not a narrowing gauntlet. The analyst’s arrival reframes rather than heightens cost, and Elias never faces a path‑foreclosing decision. The fortunes’ real-world effects are shown, but rarely threaten his method or status. Tension is elegant but soft.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—deflect possession via rhetoric before completion—is signaled early and tightens with the chamber’s shudder, the molar chime, and the void’s hunger for certainty. The decisive escalation comes when he reframes the encounter and paints the question-mark, foreclosing possession’s path. Prices are primarily conceptual rather than visceral, slightly softening impact. Still, pressure coheres and deepens through a single meaningful turn.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is doing as much as possible “before exhaustion hits,” tightened by her choice to push for “one last memory.” The deepening is clear as personal sounds become orchestration, culminating in the father’s melody that tips the horizon open. Prices are present (time pressure, mental/physical strain, possible rupture signaled by fissuring ice), though they remain mostly implied rather than cashed out. Tension accrues at sentence and beat levels without a formal antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (integration vs recurrence) is clear and escalates from entry to confession. Pressure deepens at the crossroads/third path and the explicit risk of endless recurrence (“doomed to recur unless she reconciled them”). The decisive tightening occurs when she names fears and reclaims gravity, provoking the environment’s backlash. Costs register conceptually and physically, though a second external counterforce could have sharpened the pinch further.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (resisting annihilating numbness) tightens into a risky tactic (glitching the reversed record), escalating from quiet control to rupture. The cost emerges in the room (students crying, dissonance, loss of sanctuary’s safety), and the new practice forecloses prior gentler methods. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens and culminates in a charged cadence shift. Conflict remains primarily internal/existential, with limited direct opposition on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (truth vs. institutional erasure) is clear and tightens with the unexpected Bureau tube and “They’re rewriting the maps.” The turn is his refusal of official channels, narrowing options toward riskier covert action. Escalation is measured rather than sharp; no on-page confrontation, but pressure coheres. A more explicit immediate cost or blocked option would raise stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes center on whether she will risk reopening encoded grief; escalation proceeds through opening the vial, the memory “avalanche,” and the decision to reveal and absorb glyphs. The price—piercing beauty that becomes a second skin—is legible and alters future options. Pressure coheres without an antagonist; agency drives the turns. Slight softness in external opposition keeps it just shy of peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear: resist a false binary and find a stance that reweights time/choice. Escalation occurs via revelation (rope as record) and the public act in the square; agency lies in the choice to intervene with “texture,” then relinquish the rope. The price is conceptual/social more than visceral, but it reconfigures the village’s options. No redundant loops; pressure coheres to the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens: from tentative note to environmental response to the child’s revelation and the consecrated hush. The main tightening is the shift from sound testing to communal resonance, narrowing her performative options to the ethic of unfinishedness. Stakes are intimate but legible; explicit costs are subtle rather than biting. No antagonist needed, but a stronger on‑page trade‑off would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure coheres internally: the dominant stake is whether she remains a dealer or risks ruin to realign her craft. The meaningful tightening arrives when she chooses subsumption over transaction, then tests commitment by destroying her inventory. Stakes are largely internal but the social/financial cost is explicit, avoiding a soft reset. Escalation is quiet but decisive and consistent with the lyric lens.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (recognition of unseen labor) is clear and the pattern meaningfully deepens when the community responds with new envelopes. Escalation is gentle; there’s little resistance or trade‑off beyond relinquishing credit. The turn from giving to reciprocation tightens the pattern, but costs remain mostly conceptual. Tension exists more in cadence than in confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are clear (find/earn kinship) and escalate through the note and nocturnal trek to the weeping grove. Pressure coheres, but resistance is gentle—Vesper is welcoming and obstacles are minimal—so the tightening is more cadence shift than crucible. Agency drives the turn (choosing to follow, then to dedicate). The visible price is primarily vulnerability, which reads but doesn’t bite.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are clear early—birth echoes before the giant wakes—and pressure tightens with the premature chime and overborrowing from the giant’s dream. The protagonist actively escalates and adapts (bending time to buffer sound; accepting pendant sear to finish the work). Costs are legible (fatigue, risk of waking a titan, siphoning from a dangerous source) though consequences remain favorable. Resolution feels earned by agency rather than luck.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres around deciphering absence; escalation reads as pattern‑density increase: hum, projection, hidden equation, then coordinates and frequency via tears. Agency drives turns—she chooses calibration, speaks integrals, and accepts a deeper quest. The price is modest but legible, trading static mourning for uncertain pursuit. A slightly sharper pinch point could elevate stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes concentrate around being felt/known; escalation is the decisive intensification of the tape fragment and its public recognition. Agency drives the turns—she chooses to surface artifacts and risk being noticed. The price (remaining unseen, exposure risk, relinquishing objects) is legible but quiet. Tension is sustained, not jagged, fitting the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—how she relates to nature—tightens through the intent to cut, the refusal, and the self‑undoing. The decisive renunciation forecloses a path with felt price and the new pattern (shop transformed) proves consequence. Escalation is primarily internal but coherent and legible under the chosen lens. No antagonist needed; the storm and tools serve as pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clear early (wresting resonance from loss) and tighten via the journal’s revelation, reframing the brooch and forcing a trade. The exchange forecloses a path (continuing the sleepless, failing pursuit) at a visible price. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens; the dream/rain‑trail beat functions as intensification rather than a cheap coincidence. Quiet but definite escalation culminates in a purposeful relinquishment.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes focus: whether she can face and reinterpret the “unseen” when her foresight fails. Escalation tracks cleanly: arrival → thrum → pearl warms → shadows pattern → chord/vision → repricing. Agency appears in the decision to reveal/use the pearl and in the acceptance at the end. The price is largely internal and conceptual, so the tightening reads more as deepening than a hard foreclosure.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure escalates through density and communal stakes: trust accrues, evidence compiles, then the proposal confronts civic habit. Cost is conceptual—no statues, accepting rust and silence—which fits the lens but keeps visceral jeopardy low. The meaningful tightening is the council scene into the first rite, which reweights loss into practice. Stakes remain coherent and focused.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure coheres around whether she will dare the irreversible act; the tolling hour and reflective chambers intensify the path. The tightening is clear at the handle‑less door where options narrow to surrender or retreat. Stakes skew internal and the journey is low‑resistance, so felt jeopardy is more conceptual than visceral, slightly softening the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes concentrate around whether she forces explanation or attends—attention as agency. The whale-song synchronization is the meaningful tightening, culminating in her choice to transcribe and archive, not decode. The price is conceptual (foregoing mastery for stewardship) and felt. Tension is steady rather than ratcheting; no hard foreclosure beyond the chosen renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is tight and escalates through the storm’s peak and the room’s “spatial mutiny.” The decisive act—stepping through as his refuge implodes—carries a visible price and narrows options. Pressure is more awe than jeopardy, so it lacks a counterforce beyond the environment, but the accumulative cadence still tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure accrues through the chosen lens: active waiting becomes a method, then a public practice as others arrive, deepening the ethical stake. The meaningful tightening is the shift from private experiment to communal use, which raises cost and cements the child’s obligation. Stakes are moral rather than peril-based, but the choice to forgo force and commit to a slow, vulnerable reckoning narrows options credibly. A hair more resistance on the page could heighten the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes—ownership of the archive vs. opening it to a chorus—are signaled early and deepen with the alien resonance. The meaningful tightening occurs when she recognizes histories not her own, then chooses to invite others as footsteps return. Cost is the surrender of sole authorship and potential disruption of her curated order. The escalation is subtle but coherent for this lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under a textural lens, pressure coheres via density: the label’s weight, the stain, the shoe vigil, and the tidal clock concentrate his endurance into a commitment. Stakes—refusing erasure vs. isolation and potential literal danger—are legible. Escalation is a patience test rather than reversals, but the tide‑dictated moves and the dawn release of fragments provide a meaningful cadence shift. Cost is present though subdued.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (decode riddle vs accept silence) is signaled early and escalates through patterned attempts culminating in the compass’s downward verdict. The meaningful tightening forecloses a live option (ongoing seeking) and exacts an on-page price (sacrificed tools/identity facet). Internal and external pressures braid well; the renunciation is earned by the prior beats. Tension is maintained without soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are clear early (communal ownership vs privatization) and pressure coheres toward the contract deadline. The escalation hinges on Lira’s method intensifying—private signals to a city-spanning mural that mobilizes hundreds. Consequence is real yet partial, landing as endurance rather than victory. A sharper on-page price paid by Lira personally would raise the ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes concentrate on bearing witness before 05:00; the countdown provides the single meaningful tightening. The price is the acceptance of futility and the choice to keep vigil anyway. Escalation is quiet but coherent under the accumulative lens. A sharper mid‑scene test of commitment would lift pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are defined early (repair before departure) and the anchor’s lifting provides a live tightening. Yet the path lacks a turn or credible jeopardy; no meaningful loss or forced trade‑off tests commitment. Resolution flows smoothly from competence rather than pressured adaptation. The cost reads more atmospheric than concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—locating the singular convergence—is clear and tightens through the window ritual to the lake whisper and spiral. Escalation reads as density/cadence deepening rather than confrontation, appropriate to the lens, with one meaningful turn when the condensation forms the delta and compels action. The cost is a chosen quiet—eschewing triumph for precise witnessing—which lands but stays understated. No antagonist; pressure is internal/environmental but coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure coheres around one dominant stake: coaxing Virelle into harmonic balance. Escalation reads as density increase and pattern recognition (from first strike to autonomous hum), culminating in a charged pause at the fountain. Agency drives the turn (she stops, surrenders the fork). The price is more ceremonial than painful, keeping the stakes refined rather than acute.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (revelation vs. survival) is clear early; escalation tightens via oxygen depletion, the vial heating, and the command to stand still. Her choice forecloses escape with on-page cost. Internal and external pressures interweave, with a decisive deepening at activation. The resolution is a deliberate renunciation rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (inscribing truth before authorities arrive) is signaled and tightened by the live clock and by the witnesses gathered. Escalation is protagonist-driven: finding, prying, aligning, then sealing—the mid-beat “hover” deepens pressure by reweighting the beam into voices. Cost is legible: personal credibility and bodily expenditure (“spent,” called mad). While the conflict is largely one-sided, the situational pressure coheres and grows.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.3)
    Primary stake (breaking/transmitting the curse-debt) tightens when the bride targets Elara and relinquishes the bead. Escalation is quiet but real: a cadence shift from haunting to handover to systemic awakening. Agency sits with the bride’s renunciation and Elara’s acceptance; the price is the bride’s self-dissolution. Pressure is coherent, if more devotional than combative.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—resisting erasure by mending—tightens via the act of sewing and the plate’s awakening; pressure rises through accumulative responses. However, opposition is largely atmospheric; there’s no on-page counterforce beyond inertia/silence, so the trade-off reads as endurance rather than a forced choice. The meaningful turn is the plate’s living response and the vow to continue. Stakes remain intimate but clear.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—reweaving time into place—tightens when Elara realizes the dial is displaced, shifting the task from digging to reorientation. Escalation is a calm deepening rather than a reversal, consistent with the chosen lens; the dusk alignment functions as the single meaningful turn. Cost is primarily devotional/time and the relinquishment of plunder, with communal consequence at the end. Pressure stays coherent, if gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (smuggling meaning via ephemeral play) is clear, and the widow’s message introduces a day‑specific vector. Escalation is modest: we get planning details (lanes, bell timing) rather than a tightening that forecloses options. The cost (rain, erasure, delay) is embraced, but no on‑page reversal or test presses her commitment today. The cadence shift at the end deepens theme more than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes (preventing a coup) are signaled early and tighten with the flame’s violent shudder and the reconnaissance step. Escalation is protagonist‑driven—she crafts decoys, maps escapes, weaponizes misdirection. The cost is more conceptual than visceral; we don’t witness a hard loss, though seizure of the observatory and her spent state gesture at price. The resolution is earned by her tactics rather than luck.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether and how to confront the unsent apologies—tightens through the condensation messages and the ritual with the letters. The pivotal deepening is her decision not to speak or rewrite, but to surrender the letters and shard, paying a visible price that narrows old options. Pressure coheres without an external antagonist; the spirits’ silence intensifies the moment. Stakes remain largely internal, but they are legible and scaled to length.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—can she transform uncarried fear into witnessed meaning—tightens through the move from observation to speaking and pressing coral. Escalation is accumulative: density of image and emotion increases, culminating in the cast’s rearrangement and a stance choice. The price is a chosen endurance, not a fix; clear but quietly scaled. A touch more friction or a threatened failure beat could have sharpened the tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure escalates through density and timing (noon blade through gauze) to the projection climax; the communal reactions amplify stakes. The cost is primarily internal and conceptual, not material, keeping tension quieter but focused. One meaningful deepening occurs as “display” becomes “resurrection,” narrowing her path forward.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes focus on whether she awakens the mural/self; escalation is a density increase rather than adversarial struggle, fitting the lens. The meaningful tightening is the shift from direct contact to ricochet and the surrender to nested layers. Cost is felt as the forfeiture of her fixed role and the nickel; still, resistance is low, keeping pressure elegant but not fierce.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is clear early (smuggling language past cognitive taxation), and pressure tightens when Vex recognizes the lullaby and chooses to help, rerouting surveillance. Drones and monitored cognition provide steady pressure, and communal noticing adds textural escalation. The price remains mostly implied (traceable gratitude, surveillance risk) and the path feels low‑friction—success accrues with limited on‑page setback. Still, the turn is protagonist/ally‑driven and coherently advances stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—transmuting collective pain—tightens when the postcard activates, forcing a stance: remain hidden or answer a listening world. She escalates by shifting from lullaby to psalm, accepting the risk of being “pinned.” Cost is emotional and ongoing (insomnia, solitude, refusal of pilgrims) rather than physical spectacle, but it reads. The pressure arc is quiet yet coherent under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—preserve names without violating rules—is clear and tightens when the chime resonates and she chooses to speak “Veyra‑of‑the‑Unfinished‑Song.” The meaningful deepening is the illumination of absences and her disciplined refusal to force brightness. The price is an ongoing renunciation (no resurrection; acceptance of transience) that charges the final image. Escalation is modest but sufficient under an accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can she restore trust without re‑breaking it—tightens through the warned risk: “Sing only if you mean it,” which forecloses careless options. Escalation accrues via movements, each unlocking deeper environmental response. The visible cost is modest (spent ink, risk borne, communal vulnerability) and opposition is mostly ambient; still, the narrowing reads. Resolution is earned by her choice to conduct, not to publish.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are focused: recalibrate a failing system without losing soul; pressure tightens at the seventh marker and with the overseers’ implied scrutiny. The harmonic reveal deepens options and commits her to a covert path—synchronization over sabotage. Price is largely deferred and ethical rather than immediate; escalation remains coherent but quiet. One clear deepening beat suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (salvaging songs to heal a life) tightens when the meteorite recodes her methods and forces a leap of faith. Escalation is a density increase rather than adversarial squeeze, but the cost is legible: she risks identity and control to trust the birds and the stone. External pressure is light, so the tension relies on cadence shifts more than forced trade‑offs. The letter arriving functions as earned payoff, not deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes cohere around crossing the final threshold to find/understand the father’s sacrifice. Escalation is a deepening rather than reversal: decoding → recognition → vision → step, with the price being self‑unmaking. Pressure remains internal and steady; a single concrete counter‑pressure on the page would sharpen the trade‑off. Still, the choice at the rim narrows options decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes center on belonging versus disconnection, tightened by the uncanny incursion of fireflies and the threshold signal of the feather. The meaningful deepening arrives when the fireflies mirror the reactor schematic and then form the open hand, prompting her reciprocal gesture. Escalation is quiet but coherent under the accumulative lens; the price is the ephemeral nature of connection and her decision to ascend rather than pursue the miracle. The pressure never becomes urgent, but it does concentrate.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure escalates via a density shift: seed → crater glass → conceptual flip. Stakes remain largely internal; there’s little narrowing of options beyond the renunciation of “solving,” so the price reads more philosophical than felt. Still, the decision to plant seeds and carry mystery is a credible tightening under the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure escalates via cadence: the moon cue opens Act II, randomness intensifies, and audience responses shift from skepticism to wonder. Stakes center on whether attention can transfigure monotony; the final coin and audience offerings pay this off. However, costs and foreclosed options remain gentle, keeping tension more tonal than acute. Still, the tightening reads coherent under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—memory versus erasure—tightens via the moonstone’s activation and the endurance dance to inscription. Escalation is a density increase rather than a reversal, appropriate to the lens; the cost is legible (trembling muscles, blood, collapse). The arrival of villagers shifts pressure from solitary defiance to communal implication, reweighting risk. Slight softness in overt external opposition keeps it from higher.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (to sacralize the mundane before the day’s noise) is clear, but pressure barely tightens beyond the ritual—no real obstacle or narrowing of options beyond time’s gentle drift. The meaningful turn is a cadence deepening rather than a tested trade-off. Cost (misfit status, creaky knees) is present but not escalated. Tension remains low and aesthetic.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes center on whether pain can be translated into resonance rather than isolation; pressure deepens through the sequence of children’s questions to his candid replies. The meaningful tightening arrives when he adds his own letter—foreclosing the option to remain only a witness and accepting ongoing stewardship. Cost is emotional and ongoing, not resolved away. Quiet but coherent rise under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—keeping hope’s equations “breathing”—is clear and tightens via the emerald balloon’s “What if grief could be transmuted into lift?” and the disc-triggered cascade. Agency drives the turns: she selects patterns, calibrates, and chooses when to integrate the disc. The price is mostly conceptual (choosing ongoing, iterative labor over closure); no option is visibly foreclosed on-page. Pressure coheres but remains contemplative rather than acute.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure deepens rather than reverses: from hearing murmurs to encountering the diaries to choosing how to respond. The decisive tightening is her renunciation of capture and the placement of her own work with the burned grief—she trades possession for custodianship. Stakes remain internal and thematic, but the price is clear and felt. No coincidental resolution undercuts the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are clear (can she persuade mirrors; can she return the heartbeat intact) and tighten in the hush before the bell. Escalation reads as density: mirrors shiver, then reveal increasingly charged possibilities; the self‑image in mirror three is the turn. The price is primarily renunciatory, not contested, so pressure stays aesthetic rather than dire. Still, the cadence shift to release is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are clear: muster a binding peace via ritual; the tightening arrives when the sentries ascend and consent is tested. Agency drives escalation (she prepares, writes, reframes the treaty as a mirror, invites signatures). The price is borne internally and symbolically; external resistance is minimal, keeping pressure refined rather than volatile. The cadence shift at the horns and dawn reads as a meaningful deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (atonement through echo, not life) is clear and tightens through the ritual to leaving the egg behind. Escalation is tonal and textural (resonance, glowing cracks) rather than adversarial, yet it narrows options credibly. The price—relinquishment and ongoing complicity—lands. Slightly low external pressure keeps it just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (unlock the sanctuary, release echoes), with a meaningful tightening at the resistant final knot. Escalation is accumulative—each released sound raises texture until the thousand‑confession knot forces a different tactic (addressing silence). The price is endurance and defiance rather than harm; it lands but remains largely conceptual. A sharper felt consequence would heighten the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (ethical accountability vs. complicity) is clean, with a meaningful deepening at the “violence as punctuation” turn. On‑page pressure is contemplative; most danger lives in recollection, so escalation is felt more as cadence than narrowing options. The closure depends on acceptance of a cost to the relationship/artistic livelihood, not a decisive on‑page confrontation. Still, the final resolve to return with a risky show earns a credible tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes center on honoring the vanishing without claiming it; pressure deepens as the ritual nears completion and a monarch descends. The tightening choice—refuse to touch, tie the final tender knot—forecloses a path (souvenir, interference) with felt cost. The breeze and hush serve as a cadence shift that intensifies the moment. It’s quiet, but the ethical calculus is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes concentrate around whether forgotten names can be given breath and housed; escalation occurs via density—tugging braids to summon lives, then casting and sounding, then choosing to embed and leave. The cost is legible but interior; there’s no opposing force beyond time and entropy. The meaningful tightening is the helix’s first sound and the subsequent decision to let it go. A single counterpressure beat would sharpen the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure builds through density and cadence rather than antagonism—entering dreamstate, decoding symbols, and accepting the directive’s surrender. The key tightening is the epiphany that reweights her options, followed by the tangible act of taking the seal as the bunker yields. Stakes skew internal and face minimal resistance, so the felt price is modest despite a strong cadence shift. The storm functions more as punctuation than compulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (activate/confirm the covenant’s frequency) is clear and narrows through a timed celestial window. The meaningful tightening is the horizon-kiss and hum; agency is endurance and precision under scarcity, culminating in the choice to preserve rather than exploit. Cost is legible (privation, forsaken status) and reasserted at closure. The pressure is primarily internal-textural, with minimal antagonistic resistance on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure tightens through a deepening rather than reversals: the failed mechanism forces a shift from external to embodied release. The visible price is relinquishing the dependable tool and accepting uncertainty. Stakes remain intimate but coherent; the cadence shift (ghost chime → internal migration) earns the resolution. Slight softness in overt external opposition limits peak torque.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—capturing the runaway dream—is clear and tightens through ritual intensification and the dream’s cautious descent. Escalation is mostly atmospheric; resistance is minimal as the dream is curious, not antagonistic. The final choice is hers and forecloses future flight, with a soft but present price. A touch more friction or risk would heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes focus on whether she can materially bridge the distance; escalation concentrates around the fresh vow that resists retrieval and the later footprints that deepen the cost/possibility. Agency drives turns: she chooses unsanctioned methods, stitches vow to ribbon, and persists without external validation. The price—professional ruin and unresolved estrangement—remains present and unresolved, lending bite to the hopeful cadence. It’s a quiet pressure profile, but coherent and tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres as an internal stake—understanding nonlinear inheritance despite taboo—tightening through the bathroom inquiry and the cameo’s opening, then deepening when the petal dissolves and costs flicker (failure, burning the orchard, losing self). The turn is agent-driven (she inquires, she touches), not coincidental. Costs are more conceptual than visceral, but they reweight options credibly. Lack of an active adversary reduces overt tension but doesn’t stall escalation under this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—how to approach a sentient lexicon without breaking reality—is signaled and deepens through the reframing of “rescue.” The meaningful tightening occurs when Elira rejects extraction and offers reconciliation, triggering the library’s reconfiguration. The price is primarily conceptual; we don’t see a concrete loss beyond the renunciation of the original mission. Tension stays quiet but coherent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (reclaiming a self/name) tightens through the thickening “narrative threads” to the hesitation at Lirien, which narrows options. Internal/external pressures interweave: ship mechanisms enable access while the identity risk enforces a trade‑off. The decisive act (taking the name) is protagonist‑driven and paid for conceptually. Stakes remain focused; no off‑stage or coincidental resolution undercuts the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—restore coherence—is clear, and escalation arrives via the clock’s shifting cadence as she works. Pressure deepens once, but opposition is minimal; no choice forecloses a felt alternative beyond time spent and acceptance of disappearance. Resolution is protagonist‑driven and earned, just soft on consequence. A sharper trade‑off would have amplified tension.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure escalates through density and calibration rather than direct opposition: from drowned resonance to matched pitch to the “bloom of hush” and the final offering. Stakes remain singular (restore balance) and advance by one decisive deepening. The visible cost is low and the resistance is more environmental than adversarial, which slightly softens tension. Still, the meaningful tightening lands.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes center on rekindling understanding; pressure deepens through the first star‑pulse, the chorus at Cassiopeia, and the risk of collapse if misaligned. Agency is evident in precise adjustments and the final whisper/request to the stars. The price is primarily conceptual/emotional rather than a hard trade‑off, but it’s legible and carried into the ending. No antagonist, yet tension accrues cleanly under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure escalates via accumulative intensification: successive shadow-readings tighten toward the Arch’s jolt, which forces a stance crystallization. Stakes are internal but clear (what it means to “sculpt identity” ethically), and the final refusal/acceptance carries cost. Slight softness in overt external pressure keeps it from the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure coheres and tightens via density: the approach, tuning, and step-sequence build to audible rupture and the star’s reveal. The dominant stake (reclaiming light/joy) clarifies through action, not declaration. The cost—surrendering a talisman and sealing the secret—forecloses paths. There’s no reversal per se, but the cadence shift and resonance escalation satisfy the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stakes (leave/stay; can love survive migration) are signaled, with a meaningful tightening when the companion arrives and watches in silence. Escalation tracks via density and cadence rather than reversals, appropriate to the lens. The price is a chosen deferral, foreclosing premature action; tension sits in the shared pause. Slight softness: no additional complication tests commitment after the offer to defer.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (escape curation to find nourishing silence) is clear and escalates under a live clock. The key tightening is the waning hour and the choice not to return when gravity rights itself; the fall “sideways” is a charged consequence. Coincidence initiates pressure; agency closes it. The cost is emotional and situational rather than mortal, but it’s felt.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes cohere: shepherd a passenger from dense fog of silence to invited stillness. Escalation is a measured deepening—the glass’s shifts, the bench vibration, the passenger’s loosening grip—culminating in her silent smile and his charged acceptance of the next rider. The price is subdued and internal; no path is starkly foreclosed, but the earned stasis carries weight. A single meaningful tightening lands.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (reach the stairway before sunrise) is clear and escalates via the orchard fraying and the temporal eddies. Agency drives turns—decoding, opening, descending, choosing—without lucky shortcuts. The price is mostly conceptual; on‑page resistance is modest, so tension never peaks into a true squeeze. Still, one meaningful tightening and a credible choice at the end carry the load.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reconfiguring relation to a wound/place—tightens via the decision not to knock, the scar‑linking method, and the step into the lantern field. The price is a renunciation (no reclaiming or forgiveness), made tangible by releasing the knocker and leaving the sanctuary to fold behind her. Escalation is a cadence deepening rather than reversals, fitting the lens. Stakes never sprawl beyond the central pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—whether she can convert exploitative pressure into healing clarity—tightens meaningfully at the convergence. The escalation is internal but palpable; the directive “Pressure translates” reframes the cost and forces her to push pain through the bolt. The price is felt rather than merely stated, though resistance is minimal and external counterpressure is light. Still, the single intensification suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear (truth that could end the dynasty) and tightens with the reveal, but antagonistic pressure is largely absent. Escalation is a single, effective deepening from potential to revelation; the cost and narrowed paths are more inferred than contested. Her agency is in attention and restraint, which works, though the scene lacks a hard trade‑off on the page. The pivot to restoration reweights stakes convincingly.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (becoming a conduit/capturing possibility) escalates through forgotten patterns to the vortex/threads. The meaningful tightening is his unsnapping and harmonization, a surrender that forecloses control. Pressure remains coherent but lacks a concrete external opposition or loss beyond identity surrender. Cost is present but more conceptual than felt pain or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are internal and conceptual: can she transmute systemic erasure into living stories. Escalation arrives through density—artifacts mapped, the button’s provenance discovered, then institutional acknowledgment—constituting one meaningful tightening. The price is a chosen proximity to grief rather than a direct clash, so pressure remains low‑conflict but coherent for the lens. A touch more resistance could heighten cost.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are signaled early (memory vs erasure) and escalate coherently through entry, rewiring, and citywide blackout. Agency drives the turns, and the sirens/enforcer breach provide a credible tightening. The price is implied risk rather than a felt loss, so the peak pressure is high but not searing. Resolution is earned and rooted in her tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (silence the code-prophecy) is clear and escalates as resistance becomes physical pressure and environmental response. The protagonist adapts tactics (softening attack, dissolving notes, “playing absence”)—a meaningful tightening consistent with the lens. The price paid is conceptual and emotional rather than material, yet felt at closure. Stakes remain intimate but never deflate into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are clear—decoding the living oracle—and deepen through the moonstone thread and the arbor’s glyph response. Escalation is gentle but real under the accumulative lens, culminating in the apparition and knowledge flood. There’s little narrowing of options or visible loss; tension is largely wonder instead of jeopardy. The ending’s reweighting is earned if not harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are primarily internal—whether to relinquish mastery for uncertainty—and they tighten meaningfully at the cavern and the watch toss. Escalation is coherent under the accumulative lens and culminates in a price paid and a redefined practice. External antagonism is light, reducing surface tension but not the depth of the turn. The decision reads earned, not convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—redeem through naming—tightens when the coin saturates and cracks, forcing Elara to choose to continue and “let it break beautifully.” The shattering is a meaningful turn with a price (destroying the artifact) that reweights her options. Internal and external pressures braid cleanly; tension hums rather than spikes, but it coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (integrating grief into healing) tightens as confessions layer and she chooses a risky tonal shift with the “light, foolish” trill, inviting a fragile reversal (laughter). Cost is emotional rather than physical but is legible and reweights the ending. Pressure is consistent if gentle; danger is low, yet agency drives the turn. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (reclaiming a merciful self beyond “Subject Theta”) is legible, and pressure deepens via pattern recognition, corridor opening, and the clearing’s symbolic demand. The meaningful cost is the renunciation of the strap/identity scaffold. External opposition is minimal, keeping escalation mostly internal and cadence‑driven rather than turn‑driven. Still, the beat‑to‑beat tightening reads coherent under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are clear—unfasten grief and surface erased histories—and the price (memory forfeiture, surrendering the lens) grounds the resolution. Escalation is quiet but present: from seeking and bargaining to activation and witness‑reveal to return and re‑commitment. Pressure remains coherent under the accumulative lens, though conflict is largely uncontested. The meaningful tightening occurs at the activation beat when the paint “breathes,” changing options for the historian.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—witness and release—tightens meaningfully with the dust‑to‑ceiling discovery and the apparition’s silent ask. Agency drives the key turn (he chooses to pry and to acknowledge). The price is interior and vocational rather than risky; no adversarial force tests him, keeping escalation modest. Still, the cadence shift near the end deepens options and reweights cost.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—compression of eternity at the price of destabilization—is signaled early and tightens decisively when she opens the bottle. The aperture forces a concrete trade-off via the chosen moment; the library’s systems glitch is a visible price. Escalation is protagonist-driven and coherent under the accumulative lens. Stakes could feel even sharper with one additional on-page risk to self beyond the library’s systemic cost.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—rescue/reimagine civilization’s memory—tightens via the method’s refinement and Voss’s arrival. The key deepening is the velvet‑draped mirrors leading to full sentences, which reweights options. The conflict is quiet but coherent; the price is a re‑allegiance from action to attention. External antagonism (guilds, dispute) stays mostly offstage, keeping pressure more internal than peak.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (reclaim light by midnight) tightens via the chip’s sorrow-wilt and the imminent shadows. The key choice—eschew repair for truth-song and embed the chip—narrows options credibly. Costs skew internal and aesthetic rather than materially risky, but pressure coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—finding the place where explanations fail—is clear and tightens via the compass reading and journal discovery, culminating in a renunciatory step into the passage. Pressure deepens rather than reverses; no antagonist, but the piece earns escalation through a charged cadence shift. The visible price is leaving the surface world as the stone seals behind. Slight softness stems from minimal friction en route.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes center on art’s purpose under duress; pressure coheres and tightens once (the slide’s revelation) into a decisive praxis shift. The storm and failing GPS add situational squeeze, but conflict remains primarily internal and meditative. Cost is legible as renunciation rather than loss-in-scene. Escalation is sufficient for length, if quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake (reckoning with nocturnal bloom) is signaled early and deepens via discovery of encoded flowers and lunar alignments. Escalation is accumulative rather than adversarial, culminating in a purposeful renunciation of sleep and explanation. The price—quiet vigilance, secrecy, and a heavier purpose—reads on the page. Lack of overt opposition limits maximum tension but suits the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (reckoning vs. institutional forgetting) tightens via agency: she invents message‑rituals, correlates tides to massacres, and renounces transcription. The meaningful deepening is the lagoon’s luminous response and her acceptance of witnesshood. Prices (sleep, personal binding, surrender of conventional outputs) are felt. Stakes remain intimate yet consequential; there’s no antagonist, but pressure coheres under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reinvent or ossify—tightens via the first spontaneous lantern and the crowd’s nightly convergence. Escalation is textural rather than adversarial, but the cadence shift (child receives bottle → unclaimed ignition) credibly narrows options toward shared authorship. The cost is conceptual (surrendering mastery, abandoning restoration), not felt as a painful on‑page trade, keeping pressure high but gentle. Resolution arises from the protagonist’s stance and action rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes cohere (erase vs revive the city’s emotional ecosystem) and escalate through a decisive deepening when the childhood line recontextualizes the orchard. The ensuing activation and petal release are clear, but opposition is atmospheric rather than antagonistic, tempering pressure. The price is more implied than felt, and no option is visibly foreclosed beyond her prior archivist stance. Strong deepening, modest friction.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—reopening what entropy sealed—tightens through ritual action and pattern intensification rather than antagonistic resistance. The meaningful turn is pressing the cap into the spiral, triggering the weeping and return. The price is primarily an inward renunciation; no path visibly foreclosed beyond that, tempering tension. Still, pressure coheres and rises appropriately for lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—restoring trust without false alarm—is clear early and tightens with the tremble/still beat before the final toll. Escalation is quiet but real under the accumulative lens: density of signals culminates in a single resonant act. The visible price is restraint and acceptance of delayed action over siren-triggered certainty. A hair more on-page jeopardy could heighten cost.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (witnessing endings as sacred) tightens when the rogue comet arrives and chooses the pulsars’ “sigh.” Escalation is a deepening of attention rather than a hard narrowing of options; his agency is endurance/renunciation, not intervention. The setting’s non‑alarm ethos supports the quiet test of his method and commitment. Cost is felt, if subtle, in the recommitment to obscurity and the emotional toll.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are focused: preserve the unsaid vs. the lure of release, escalating via storms and the intensifying presence of ghosts. The tightening is a deepening rather than reversal, culminating in the gaze exchange that narrows options by reaffirming renunciation. Cost is legible (continued burden, bodily shielding), though there’s limited adversarial pressure or explicit temptation beat. Tension operates more in cadence and image than in conflict turns.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure escalates through a single meaningful deepening: Lira’s touch triggers the capsule shift, unlocking the letter and fusion. Stakes remain intimate and primarily conceptual, with limited foreclosing of options. The resolution is earned by collaborative action rather than coincidence, but the felt price is gentle. Tension operates mostly through wonder rather than risk.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can loss be tended into new form—tightens from rupture to re‑composition to test flight. Agency drives each step; the refusal to “fix” forecloses a path. Pressure is quiet but coherent, with a single meaningful deepening when the asymmetrical kite must fly. The costs are modest yet legible for the scope.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative lens, pressure builds through pattern: guiding growth, rescuing the fledgling, climbing the completed Spiral Stair, and surrendering the diary. The dominant stake tightens toward legacy with a visible price—mortality accepted and enacted in the final acts. Escalation is quiet rather than adversarial; the sparrow beat provides the clearest micro‑test of his ethos. Costs are felt but not contested by strong counterforce, keeping the ceiling just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are internal but coherent: will the scientific lens yield anything at homecoming’s site. Escalation is a deepening (spectrometer registers nothing; pressure shifts to resonance), culminating in the renunciation of measurement for convergence. The price is quiet but legible: surrendering objectivity’s primacy and the talisman. The tension is subtle, fitting the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are clear (seeded reconciliation vs. lingering war‑void) and escalate via bird‑mediated permissions and the ash‑mixing choice. Pressure tightens once as he moves from listening to irrevocable planting, then to the renunciation of immediate payoff. The price is time and continued return rather than a sharp on‑page loss; nonetheless it reweights options at the end. Quiet mode works, but opposition remains largely internal/environmental.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—translating distance into closeness—tightens via the handler’s voice and the choice to act on coordinates. The eastward trek and archive discovery escalate pressure with a clear deepening rather than reversals. Costs are endurance/time and a vocational shift; no antagonist is needed under this lens. The final commitment to decode for the settlement reads earned and consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (to remain and witness) is clear; escalation arrives with the violet filament, which she chooses to engage by sketching. Pressure is primarily internal and aesthetic, not adversarial, so the narrowing of options is subtle. The filament’s brief shimmer/vanish provides a clean tightening and test of purpose. Costs remain mostly implied (social exile) rather than paid on‑page in this scene.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (righting the sky) is clear, and tightens via the command “SWAP THE PIECES” and the tremor‑per‑exchange escalation. Agency drives the turn—he replaces the pieces, inviting transformation. The price is soft (no counterforce or sacrifice beyond risk and renunciation), so tension remains lyrical rather than palpable. Still, the cadence shift at the shimmer/convulsion reads as a meaningful deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (making absence speak vs. authority’s script) tightens through survivors’ participation and the widow’s unbinding to the sovereign’s arrival. Escalation is a density increase consistent with the accumulative lens, culminating in the refusal to bow and “listen.” The price is felt but remains abstract; no explicit external consequence lands on the page. Still, the pressure coheres and deepens meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear: transform pain of remembering into belonging. Escalation is accumulative: tactile pressure intensifies, the stone ripples, shelves shift, gravity reconfigures her stance. There’s minimal antagonistic push; the pressure derives from the risk of accepting a new identity, which reads but remains gentle. The agency is hers, and the outcome results from her chosen method.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are singular and legible early: can she transform guilt into accountable acceptance. Pressure tightens from entrance to tapestry winnowing to the mirror where the core choice is made. The price is internal but concrete—no absolution, only endurance—and the world’s release mirrors the inward shift without hand-waving. Escalation is more deepening than reversal, but decisive enough for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (unity demanded vs. chosen multiplicity) is clear and tightens through the child scene, the dream, and her self-refracting session. The ritual bell and elders add time and social pressure; the final refusal forecloses the “polished parable” path. Escalation is organic but remains largely interior and lyrical, with limited external pushback. Cost is felt as renunciation rather than loss endured on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.9)
    One dominant stake—finish the meaning‑ritual before the workshop fails—tightens credibly as fumes thicken and a seam splits. Agency drives escalation: she chooses which wounds to honor and spends breath and tears to complete the act. The price is legible and the aura’s arrival reads earned rather than lucky. A single deepening rather than multiple reversals, but it’s enough at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reconciling perception and meaning—is signaled early and tightens via the wrong turn, deepening interiority, and candle/time pressure. The act of painting evolves into a covenant, foreclosing the gallery/fame path and the mirror’s authority. Price is felt in the relinquishment of the shell and the acceptance of a quieter practice. Minimal external antagonism, but under the chosen lens the escalation is sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are legible (ships veering vs. safe harbor) and the tightening comes from enacting the risky, gentler method at scale. Escalation reads as a decisive intensification when ships correct course, marrying internal resolve to external result. The on‑page price is mostly emotional/physical relief rather than sacrifice, and there’s no strong reversal or counterforce. Still, agency is clear and the cadence turn lands.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure escalates via pattern density and timing constraints: the failed attempt during a crescent, then respecting phases, culminating in the full‑moon send. Stakes remain internal but coherent—the cost is endurance without fixing, committing to a practice that yields only seepage. One meaningful tightening lands with the final act and flicker replies. The conflict is quiet, not anemic.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—maintaining safety amid contagious hyper‑empathy—is signaled early and deepens when the trio demands indirection, forcing a tactical shift. The decisive tightening is her choice to give away tools of regulation (truffles, then the eye), culminating in relinquishment. Cost is felt but not harrowingly tested; conflict remains largely internal/relational rather than confrontational. Tension is steady and coherent without multiple reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—decode the gesture—tightens with the fourth‑night break when sensation arrives, altering knowledge and options. Agency appears as endurance and a final renunciation (not reporting), with a felt conceptual price. Lack of an adversarial force or harder trade‑off keeps escalation gentle rather than wrenching. Still, the cadence shift qualifies as a meaningful deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is clear (redeem a vow via the doorway), with one meaningful tightening at the arch. Escalation is mostly accumulative; opposition is minimal, so costs feel modest. The letter neatly resolves pressure, leaning on the world’s rule rather than conflict. Still, his final renunciation (locking the shop) is a credible, if quiet, price.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—will she face the truth her dreams demand—escalates through the climb, the bleeding sky, memory-pool, and the figure’s challenge. The decisive turn is her acceptance of renunciation and the charged descent. Pressure is primarily internal but coherent and steadily tightening under the accumulative lens. Slightly low external resistance keeps it just short of elite.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—whether their bond can transmute guilt—tightens through the confession and the chosen act of alchemical forgiveness. Escalation is quiet but decisive; the ritual and object transfer narrow options and exact an emotional price. While reversals are minimal, the deepening is clear and sufficient at this length. Consequences linger in the charged plan to “paint the next chapter.”

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (taming feral nostalgia) is clear and deepens via the scroll’s refusal/acceptance and the shift from fleeing to “hunting.” The meaningful tightening is the decision to write the jealousy, which reweights the rules of the dream-space and narrows options toward acceptance over erasure. Cost is conceptual but felt: surrendering the fantasy of “clean endings” and recasting the grave as footnote. Tension scales at sentence/beat levels without stalling.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure coheres around identity and vocation; the turn comes with the fulcrum insight and the decision to mount the screw, culminating in an earned stance. The cost is acceptance of a limited modality and the renunciation of scent as primary tool. Escalation is quiet but real, deepening rather than reversing.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres around one stake: can she write through stress without fracturing the ink or herself. Escalation is modest but clear—each rune compounds risk, culminating in the “breathe” stroke that must land cleanly before the world resumes. The tactic shift (reverting to superstitions as technique) earns the turn. Cost is internal but felt: she relinquishes the protective shame that has structured her responses.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure coheres around the apology/reconnection before the orchard’s destruction; escalation arrives through the scent reveal, the shared melody, and the risky offering of the restored score. The key tightening is her agency in making the private material visible/audible and then surrendering the manuscript. Costs are legible (humiliation, admission of theft, acceptance of an imperfect, non-hug resolution). It’s a deepening more than a reversal, but it narrows options credibly under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes stay internal (coherence vs. self) and escalate via ritual phases: axiom spoken, inversion sequence, consent to be read, dissolution, lenshood. The tightening is clear when surrender becomes necessary; cost is visible in the shedding of language/identity. Pressure remains serene—no external opposition or missteps—so tension is more meditative than combative. Still, the single meaningful deepening lands under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure coheres around the ritual and its risk of defying “standard time,” escalating through the countdown, shuddering gears, and the held instant. Stakes remain primarily conceptual; no antagonistic force or hard trade‑off narrows options beyond his chosen renunciation. The tightening beat (station stilling; time “held”) is earned and reweights the premise but doesn’t register a hefty price. Tension is sustained more by cadence than by jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (alignment/letting go) tightens as she closes distance, refuses to name, and presses the dead button to tune herself. The price—relinquishing the need to hold the figure—registers on the page with the dissolution and her exhale. Pressure is quiet but steadily intensifies; the cadence shift at the click and shimmer is decisive. No antagonist is needed under this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes center on whether Elara can convert rebellion into responsible widening; escalation is modest but steady (from decoding to initiating to receiving a response to testing it with her father). The father scene introduces a palpable pressure point and a small on‑page risk of exposure. Costs remain interior and understated, limiting peak tension, but the tightening reads. The final recommitment feels earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—her mission vs. her solitude/self-erasure—clarifies and tightens via successive curated collisions culminating in the self-call. Escalation is a density increase rather than a reversal, but the final choice forecloses a path and exacts cost. Pressure remains coherent; the “patch me through to silence” beat is a decisive narrowing of options. Stakes are intimate and conceptual, yet not abstracted away.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are intimate: reclaiming a generational covenant through attentive recording. Escalation is a deepening rather than a reversal—the drafting of covenant “clauses,” the choice to not weep, and the resolve to return. The cost is endurance and restraint, not spectacle; it reads but remains quiet, keeping the ceiling below the highest band. Pressure coheres with the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are quiet but coherent: can Elara induce connection without magic. Escalation tightens when the man requests the moon rock ritual, forcing her to risk honest reciprocity. The price—exposing her own loneliness—is felt, and his steadied hand marks consequence. Pressure is more deepening than reversal, yet sufficient for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure coheres around locating the stillpoint before the cosmic pause ends, escalating via resonance density into the silent glade. The decisive act—stepping into and then surrendering the ring—carries a visible price and narrows future options (she ceases absorbing languages). Stakes are primarily internal but legible and scaled to length. A touch more destabilization before the glade could have sharpened the test.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (revising history into livable meaning) is clear, and escalation arrives via a cadence shift when she “unbends” and invites the edits, producing concrete, scaled changes (scream→sigh; war→dinners). Agency is present but deliberately softened; she facilitates rather than commands. The pressure deepens rather than narrows with a hard trade‑off, so cost reads more philosophical than felt. Effective, if quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes concentrate around whether Elara can make felt music from silence and accept vanishing memory as the price. Escalation is quiet but real: from solitary mapping to the catalytic click to a live pupil asking “Show me.” The cost—choosing release over capture—is made explicit and dramatized through the camera’s non‑use. Lacks a counterforce that resists her aim beyond ethos, keeping pressure elegant but not intense.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear and escalates via density: from fragment to trail to responsive architecture to the sealed chamber. However, pressure lacks genuine friction—no counterforce or meaningful trade‑off beyond identity redefinition. The final act is her agency, but the path feels unimpeded, muting cost and tension.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are internal but coherent: resist institutional erasure by forging a living synthesis. Escalation is a density increase—from private tapping to full‑body engagement to choral singing—culminating in the garden sustaining the beat. The cost is more thematic than visceral; a clearer foreclosed option on the page would sharpen pressure. Still, the cadence shift at the lagoon’s lift reads as a meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes center on exposing Delgado by stealth; escalation arrives via the coin’s intensifying pull and the climb to the keyhole. The reversal (the key opens ears) deepens options without loud confrontation. Cost and danger feel relatively low; the antagonist remains offstage, softening pressure. Nevertheless, the tightening is clear and protagonist‑driven.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—guiding the lost at the threshold—appears early and tightens when the drowned woman materializes, prompting faster weaving and more urgent glyphs. Pressure is internal and situational rather than adversarial, but escalation is clear in cadence and image density. The price is the guardian’s continued endurance and acceptance of incomplete saves. The climax is quiet yet earned.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—can quiet subversion reawaken curiosity—tightens through a single decisive intensification (town‑wide activation). Pressure is coherent but gentle; opposition remains soft and largely offstage. Consequences and costs are more conceptual than felt, limiting the sense of narrowing options. Still, the midnight act is a credible escalation driven by protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—alignment vs. self‑erasure—tightens as she moves from dock to chest‑deep water to the island’s lift. The scrimshaw heating and the whale’s summons mark a decisive deepening; surrender has a price (relinquishing tool/identity). No overt antagonist, but internal fear vs. call creates authentic pressure. Escalation is clear if modest.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—surviving grief under a punitive regime—is clear and tightened by officer visits and the impending expiration of passive noncompliance. The protagonist escalates by choosing a performative compliance tactic (box, beeswax seal, “Permitted”), foregoing open defiance for survivable duplicity. The price is legible: surrender of the bouquet’s unsanctioned witness and continued emotional void. While not reversal‑driven, pressure coheres and deepens credibly under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming unsanctioned expression—is clear and advances through “Unfold,” the harmonics, and the dance. Pressure is primarily internal and aesthetic; the absence of live opposition limits narrowing of options. A meaningful deepening occurs as commandments melt into metaphor and she becomes “the threshold.” The price remains largely conceptual, tempering peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure escalates gently but coherently: from arrangement experiments to environmental response to Marta’s apprenticeship and the kiln vow. The dominant stake—can the courtyard be awakened—tightens through a single meaningful deepening. The on‑page price is soft; no option is starkly foreclosed. Nonetheless, agency drives each turn rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes center on reconfiguring what “silence” and “connection” mean; escalation arrives as density/deepening rather than opposition. The major tightening is her choice to sing, which activates the room and releases layered sounds. The felt price is recognition rather than loss; no live option is foreclosed beyond a stance against speed/overpowering. Pressure is coherent but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (rerouting grief) is clear and there is one effective deepening when the curtains respond as someone unfolds an offering. Escalation remains tonal and patterned rather than decisively narrowing options; the piece avoids a strong turn and relies on cadence intensification. The ending’s renunciation (no watching, no note) registers as a price. Tension is more devotional than adversarial but coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes center on whether meaning can be mapped in the ruins; pressure rises by density: convergence points, shared hashtags, #FeedTheFuture. The meaningful tightening is the visitor’s reading that reweights the work. Little explicit cost or foreclosed option appears on the page, so tension remains tempered. Still, agency appears in method and curation rather than confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—purifying memory to break a cultural cycle and reach her daughter—tightens through contact with the machine and the painful onrush of imprints. The strategic pivot (avoiding patterns) escalates pressure and carries a price in pain and exposure. Resolution is earned by her agency rather than coincidence. The visible costs are emotional and bodily, scaled well to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (preserve hope’s grit) is clear and tightens through the discovery that the “shadow” adapts, leading to Elira’s pivotal choice to seed “weight” back into the stream. The escalation is a deepening of meaning rather than a clash, consistent with the accumulative lens. Consequences (biting wind, sharper scent, companionable shadow) render cost and shift. The pressure remains low-octane; not a flaw, but it caps peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake: whether to stay complicit or leave with responsibility. Escalation occurs via the ritual deepening (each layer a vow) leading to the tri‑part decision that forecloses an option. The cost (loss of job, risk of exposure, heavier duty) is legible. A small additional on‑page friction could have heightened squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure escalates via discovery beats that narrow options: ivy coordinates → coffee-ring confirmation → root passage → the seed’s moral calculus. Stakes are predominantly internal; the monks’ fear frames risk without on-page adversary. The decisive act (letting the seed merge) forecloses her old pursuit. Cost is more conceptual than visceral, but it charges the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes center on transforming incubated love into motion; pressure deepens through visions to the tangible cache. The tightening arrives with the hidden compartment and the choice to become the vessel and then the releaser. The price is emotional burden, carried forward into action. Escalation remains quiet but coherent under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity vs. her bodily/psychic limits—tightens clearly when the voices turn furious, forcing a maximal expenditure of effort. Agency drives escalation (she chooses to trace hundreds), and the price is felt in exhaustion and frozen tears. Stakes remain intimate yet consequential; a further explicit trade‑off mid‑climb could have sharpened cost even more. The resolution is earned and not coincidence-led.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes—kindling potential against entropy—are established, and tension accrues via selection of the dimmest sphere and the delicate act of “charm.” Escalation is a deepening rather than a reversal, consistent with the accumulative lens. Concrete resistance is minimal, so pressure reads more as precision and cost of vigilance than threat. The ending’s small reweighting feels earned by his agency.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (risk the Edge to reclaim the inner frontier) is clear early and tightens credibly at the precipice. Escalation deepens through the gear’s resonance and the legend of unraveling, culminating in a decisive crossing. The cost is primarily existential rather than dramatized as harm, slightly softening pressure. Still, the agency at the peak beat is unmistakable and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes center on locating and reactivating “unused courage” without spooking it; pressure deepens via patience vs. pursuit, culminating at the crest. One meaningful tightening occurs when artifacts are found and consecrated, shifting options from searching to vigil and marking. The cost is a choice of restraint and ritual rather than a clash; while low‑temperature, it’s consistent with the lens. Escalation is cumulative rather than conflictual but stays coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—safety versus music—tightens with the child’s whistle and culminates in the choice to restore the bench. Pressure escalates via ritual breakage: he invades his own safeguard (the hidden bolt) and risks the fortress and his vow. The price is felt in the trembling hands and the implied danger of sound after collapse. It’s a quiet escalation, but coherent and earned under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is legible early (unmask the pretender) and tightens at the oath ceremony. The reversal—ink revealing ancestral sigils—reconfigures power without force, a satisfying pressure turn. Still, few obstacles oppose her in-scene; the plan works without visible jeopardy or adaptive recalibration. The cost is thematic rather than tactical, keeping tension elegant but modest.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure tightens meaningfully: storm breach forces action, the 17‑second lag reframes the mission, hidden logs escalate into the dive. Stakes remain coherent (truth vs. disappearance) and culminate in a knowledge cost that changes her practice. The price is more conceptual/emotional than physical; a sharper on‑page tradeoff in the dive scene would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—rekindling purpose without returning to violence—tightens as attention and ritual amplify the hum. The key deepening is her shift to look downward and then to seed the aria, which triggers tangible change (panels light, people gather). Tension is atmospheric rather than peril‑based, so the price feels light, but escalation is coherent under the accumulative lens. The resolution arises from her agency rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure accrues through ritual intensity—glow, cracking, the pivotal invitation to “Choose”—and culminates in diffusion. Stakes are primarily ideological and communal, not survivalist; escalation is quiet but coherent under the accumulative lens. The cost is the relinquishment of centralized power rather than a more visceral price, so tension remains tempered. Still, agency clearly drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes (calibrating hope without denial) are signaled and tighten through the held‑breath “freeze” that redefines the photograph and unlocks new behavior. The cost is vulnerability and relinquishing defensive counting/measurement of grief. Escalation is quiet but decisive under the accumulative lens, culminating in a practiced pause before reaction. No antagonistic counterforce on the page, but internal pressure coheres and deepens.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—whether she can confront fracture and remake meaning—tightens as her actions provoke the library’s escalating responses. The decisive deepening occurs when she steps onto the stitched tapestry, triggering inversion and cocooning. Cost is felt in compression and the acceptance of pain as coherence’s price. External antagonism is minimal, but pressure coheres under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—understanding time in crisis—tightens as her tactics escalate from observing to self‑application with irreversible cost. The key deepening (ink mirrors neural collapse) catalyzes the decisive act. Tension operates at line and beat levels without needing an external antagonist. Stakes remain personal yet consequential in the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—ignite truth despite personal risk—is signaled early and tightens when the Table syncs and guards arrive. The cost is legible: arrest, erasure, quarantine. Escalation is mainly internal-to-societal rather than adversarial reversal, but it coheres under the chosen lens. The refusal to flee functions as a credible endurance choice that forecloses safety.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—choosing gentleness as continuity—tightens through skeptical visitors and culminates in the child’s arrival, prompting an active, value‑laden gift. Escalation is modest but coherent under the accumulative lens. The renunciation carries a felt price (resources, safety posture), though no single beat hard‑narrows options. A sharper external pinch might have intensified the cost signal.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake is focused early and escalates through density: locating the bass fossil, matching the “feral” lullaby, spike overheating, world inversion. Agency drives each turn, and the end choice is a renunciation with visible price (forgoing capture; destroying the tool). Internal and external pressures interweave (grief tide, fragile chords) without coincidence resolving the conflict. The only modest limit is the protagonist’s near‑frictionless competence.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—piercing a cover‑up—remains coherent, and pressure tightens from observation to public release. However, opposition is largely offstage, with no direct reversal or on‑page price; the move feels precise but low‑friction. The “proof by contradiction” tactic provides a meaningful deepening. The climax is a quiet send, not a contested beat.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is legible early (quiet the haunted firmware and her guilt) and tightens as the machine accuses her and escalates to crimson tubes and articulated cries. The decisive act—tethering the glyph with blood and letter‑dust—carries visible cost and resolves pressure without coincidence. Internal and external conflicts interweave cleanly. Tension is steady rather than jagged, but the deepening is meaningful.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are internal (recover a way to hold meaning) but they tighten: from listening to placing the tile to the critical “interjection” that unifies the whispers. The price is tangible (tile cracks; she foregoes making a mural) and the city/grotto contrast frames risk and need. Escalation is a density increase credible to the lens. Pressure never becomes harrowing, but it coheres and deepens decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres around Elira asserting a new praxis under public scrutiny, tightening when the magistrate demands silence. The shift from solitary act to communal ritual broadens stakes and demonstrates consequence. Costs are primarily moral/social; the scene doesn’t press a tangible peril, but it credibly forces stance crystallization. The escalation is modest yet earned within the lyric frame.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—transmuting despair into possibility while confronting release—tightens as the three echoes manifest and demand a choice. The escalation is a density increase culminating in the relinquishment of the coin and self, with a clear price. No antagonist is needed; pressure coheres through her agency and the orchard’s response. A touch more friction before the final toss could have heightened tension.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—recovering authentic connection and coherence—tightens through embodied cues and the lab-built rig. The key deepening is the shift from “restore telepathy” to “find somatic resonance,” catalyzed by Mateo’s voice and the left-hand tremor. Escalation is accumulative rather than reversal-driven, appropriate to the lens. The felt price is soft; risk and exposure could be sharper to heighten consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are singular and clear: to translate what remains; escalation is a meaningful deepening rather than a duel. The turning pressure arrives with the cave’s “question” and her choice to respond, paying with the leaf. Tension is primarily tonal and conceptual, not adversarial; still, the cadence shift narrows options credibly. Slight softness: no strong competing harm beyond relinquishment.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are conceptual (truth as possibility vs. false prophecy) and escalate via a clear intensification when the echo speaks plainly after the cracked button. Agency drives deepening as she chooses dissemination over custody. The price remains mostly reputational/ideational; no hard trade‑off is paid on page, keeping the tension refined rather than visceral. Still, pressure coheres and tightens appropriately for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure is quiet but coherent: the choice to conceal irrevocably rather than transmit narrows options and imposes a cost. The deepening is the pivot from spycraft of extraction to planting, with injury and exposure heightening risk. Stakes—legacy versus survival/visibility—are legible throughout. Escalation is measured; there’s no hard reversal, but the cadence tightens credibly for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—crossing under vow until the gutter-clock stills—tightens via density and a cadence break as rain softens. Escalation is inward: fog thickens, then thins; he withholds turning until the clock forces stance. Cost is modest but present (endurance, chosen patience, and the risk-laden invitation to “unstitch”). The final beat is earned under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are internal but tangible: understanding resistance to change and deciding how to hold time. Escalation reads as density/deepening—the thrum grows, bees return, she shifts from making a container to cradling time, culminating in not firing and leaving the glass. Costs are gentle but legible (relinquishing the tool, choosing permeability over permanence). Pressure is coherent though quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are modest but coherent: reawakening communal wonder versus encroaching gray. Pressure tightens through sequential placements culminating in the final, largest prism at the rosebush—an earned peak that reweights the hush and her personal history. The price is an acceptance of temporariness and bodily strain rather than a decisive confrontation. A touch more risk or potential failure on a single placement could intensify escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are coherent (preserve and then reorient the library’s memory function) with a meaningful tightening when the hum stutters and the shadow wavers. Veyra’s agency resolves the crisis and then reframes the mission from preservation to creation. The escalation is clear and proportional for the length. The price paid is more conceptual than visceral, slightly softening the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—rejoining the pattern—tightens through a ritual progression to an irreversible renunciation. The command “Rejoin” forces a stance crystallization; entering the water forecloses a path. Cost is clear (selfhood surrendered), but escalation lacks resistance or a tangible counter‑pressure. One sharper trade‑off or hesitation at the lip of the pool would elevate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (protect campus from corrosive influence) is clear and escalates when the signal “tightens” in response to her interference. The tactical choice to destabilize rather than overwrite is a meaningful turn that reframes conflict. However, the price feels light—little pushback beyond a writhing signal, no tangible loss or hard trade‑off on the page. Tension persists but never truly threatens to break her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake (find the harmonic cipher) is signaled early; escalation arrives through the narrowing passage and the organ’s pull. The meaningful tightening is Elara choosing to proceed despite claustrophobia. Yet resolution arrives smoothly once she reaches the chamber, with minimal on‑page cost or reversal testing commitment. Pressure is coherent but not punishing.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes—memory vs. erasure—are established early and deepen when the man arrives and Elira chooses connection over accusation. The meaningful tightening is her invitation to “help me remember them properly,” foreclosing a punitive path. Costs are conceptual and social (no prosecutable resolution) rather than kinetic, which keeps tension quiet but coherent. Pressure holds under the accumulative lens without sag.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are signaled early (weather gone wrong, exile, inversion clock), and there’s one meaningful tightening when she questions the storm and then overlays coordinates. Yet escalation is relatively smooth; no option is foreclosed and no material price is paid on the page. The piece leans on awe rather than friction, limiting pressure despite the apocalyptic frame. The resolution derives from her agency, if with minimal pushback.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is internal: will he choose pursuit/denial or allowance/forgiveness. Escalation arrives via density and a single meaningful tightening—the mirror silhouette—and the choice not to turn forecloses a path. Cost is present but subtle, largely conceptual—more renunciation than loss. Pressure remains coherent though gently scaled.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure strengthens from rise to collapse, narrowing options and forcing a stance: instead of fleeing or relaunching, he redefines the ground and purpose. The territorial dissuasion adds a middle‑beat tactic, and the refusal to reopen constitutes an earned stasis with cost. Tension remains primarily inward, so escalation is quiet but coherent under the chosen lens. One sharper on‑page test of risk would further tighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—shouldering and redistributing burdens—is clear and deepens with the telegram and the guardian’s dream-state. The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses to sing and share weight, transforming her brief from transcription to action. However, resistance is minimal and costs are largely conceptual, so escalation feels serene rather than pressurized. The resolution is earned but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (submit to revelation vs. remain guarded) is signaled early and tightens via the seed’s expanding circles. The meaningful deepening comes when rooting reaches her heart—foreclosing the old stance with felt cost. Pressure is coherent under an accumulative lens, though external jeopardy is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes center on reactivating a suppressed covenant before the glade “forgets itself.” Pressure tightens through the guided approach and the ritual ignition, but opposition is largely atmospheric; no live counterforce tests her resolve. The decisive “heed” and insertion of the clipping earn the culmination, yet the price remains abstract. Escalation is present but not harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure coheres around the philosophical and practical clash; it tightens when Kael lunges and the orchard intervenes, pushing toward a stance crystallization. The escalation is primarily textural/deepening rather than high-stakes peril, but it narrows options meaningfully. The price is a renunciation/softening rather than a hard sacrifice. Clear, if quiet, cadence shift at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes center on whether he remains insulated or risks meaning again; pressure tightens when the cloth’s light changes and he chooses to feel rather than measure. The decisive action—typing the project and pinning the cloth—forecloses his safety strategy. Cost is emotional rather than situational, but it’s legible and scaled to the form. Escalation is modest yet purposeful for a quiet piece.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure tightens in a lyric, accumulative way: from alignment attempts to the seed’s tremor/split to the invitation vs. claiming choice. The dominant stake (reestablish understanding without consumption) culminates in the refusal to translate, a tangible trade‑off. No antagonist needed; the opposition is ambition’s residue and the rules of the arbor. Stakes could read slightly abstract at moments, but the cost is unmistakable at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake is clear: enact a ritual that preserves wonder against flux. Escalation is a single meaningful deepening (the creel’s baptism and the embodied acceptance of paradox) rather than a chain of tests. Cost is present but gentle, mostly identity‑blur and the shelving choice foreclosing a harder, tidier certainty. The chime promises future waves rather than tightening present stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—ending isolation—tightens via the confession ritual’s escalating cost and the final coronation choice. Pressure is internal yet coherent; the glow/threading and bone‑deep vibration read as a decisive intensification. The price (exposure to a flood of others’ hopes; surrender of the pearl) is legible. Slight softness in external resistance keeps it just shy of peak tension, but the accumulative deepening is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure coheres around the single stake; escalation occurs via pattern-deepening (graffiti → Point Zero → Track 3 threshold) and the act of playing louder as a stance. A live option is foreclosed: external destinations/absolution yield to an inward map with a felt price. The sister backstory sharpens the moral calculus without resolving it cheaply. Quiet but decisive tightening meets the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure deepens through a clear sequence: shelves’ logic → “Regrets Never Voiced” → glyphs that alter the past → inner sanctum → mirror. The cost escalates from documentation scars to identity dissolution. Agency matters at each turn (what she touches, what she records, whether she steps through) and culminates in the chosen acceptance. Stakes stay focused on truth versus self and tighten credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is legible early (authenticate vs propagate truth), and pressure tightens with the Chancellor’s imminent arrival and the decision to play. The escalation is accumulative rather than adversarial; consequence is visible in the transformation of the object and the Chancellor’s stance. Cost feels more conceptual than personal, slightly blunting the sense of peril. Still, the choice forecloses the path of complicity and reweights power.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure tightens via a density increase: surrender to the memorized patterns, the air hesitating, the chip’s single pulse. Stakes remain singular and legible: capture the threshold spark before oblivion erases all. The earned stasis at the end (release instead of traditional rites) carries a felt price and resolves the dominant stake. Slightly inward conflict limits volatility, but the escalation is decisive for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (reclaiming contentment) is established early and tightens as she chooses to define herself beyond betrayal. Escalation is internal but clear: ascent and stillness concentrate pressure until the decisive insertion of the hairpin. Cost is legible as release and renunciation; no external antagonism, yet pressure coheres under the accumulative lens. A touch more on‑page resistance would heighten stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—whether to relinquish sold certainty—tightens through the repeated “Unhook” imperative and the physical resistance at the clasp. The decisive act forecloses a prior operating mode and names a price (clients may leave). Tension scales appropriately for the length despite the inward frame. A tangible reversal (resistance → release) lands.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure escalates texturally: withholding sustains the trance until the light fracture reframes ripples as notation. Stakes remain intimate (teaching/learning) and the tightening is primarily conceptual rather than consequential. The plan for descent promises cost but doesn’t test it yet. Sufficient deepening; limited on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (guidance through attention, not motion) tightens with the crows’ pattern culminating in the pulse lodging in the chest. The price is renunciation and prolonged waiting, made explicit. Escalation reads as density and pattern precision rather than reversals, which fits the chosen lens. Stakes remain primarily conceptual, but the cost is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (recovering living magic vs. standardization/self-failure) is clear and tightens at the mist’s invitation and the keystone’s placement. Agency drives escalation: stepping onto mist despite past failures, then surrendering the keystone. The price is modest but legible, and the renunciation is credible. The piece remains quiet, but pressure coheres under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (discover the color of sound) is active and narrows across beats from pier to plunge to ledger to synesthetic epiphany. Pressure grows coherently; the dive and breath limit provide real constraint. Cost is present but muted—he surfaces intact, and the main price is a shift in vocation rather than an acute sacrifice. Still, the renunciation of lighting lamps and the handoff to the next seeker give the ending bite.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: whether to keep abdicating to chance or claim agency for the survivors. Escalation arrives when the static comes unbidden and she reframes the “backwards prophecies,” culminating in the coin toss as celebration, not decision. Price is subtle (accepting responsibility; relinquishing the protective ritual). A touch more external pressure could sharpen the trade‑off, but the internal test lands.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are internal—transform fear by naming—and escalate through the ritual: unfolding the atlas, invoking light, naming, crystal blooming. Pressure tightens as each monster is redefined from terror to witness, culminating in a felt price (tears, stewardship). The arc lacks a sharp reversal, but the cadence shift is sufficient for the accumulative design. The choice to accept a new purpose forecloses solitary mourning.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure builds texturally from measured drops to the release decision; the key tightening is his choice not to ring but to surrender the bell. Stakes are clear (cosmic imbalance vs. patient repair), and the cost is the relinquishment of a hard‑won object. The escalation is quiet yet coherent under the accumulative lens. A single stronger complication might have deepened the squeeze, but what’s here reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—erase vs. honor memory—is clear and tightens as Elias shifts from private cataloging to public testimony, culminating in the officials’ challenge. Escalation is mostly ethical and communal rather than peril‑driven. The reversal is earned, but the price paid on the page (no arrest, reassignment) lowers felt jeopardy. Tension lives in quiet accrual rather than hard turns.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes—retain self before the final transformation by harmonizing logic with intuition—tighten through the decisive surrender that alters the flame’s behavior. The starlings’ pattern becomes the method, narrowing options from force to resonance and costing the crystal. Pressure is coherent and deepens once; no antagonist, but the internal crucible suffices at this length. Slight softness in overt consequence keeps it below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—sustaining trust under eerie silence—is clear and tested when she must decide whether and how to signal. The tightening is subtle but real: silence is reframed as the signal, and she pays the price of restraint rather than spectacle. Escalation is more tonal than confrontational, so the felt risk remains conceptual, not bodily. Still, the minimal chime forecloses panic and affirms her ethic at a cost.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (autonomy vs. possession; numbness vs. aliveness) is clear and tightens through accusations and Kael’s refusal to litigate. Escalation is accumulative: density of paradox builds to a shift where resonance, not argument, awakens the duplicate. The cost—foregoing ownership and identity reclamation—is present but abstract. The dissolution of the “trial” reads earned under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (protecting a sanctuary for innovation despite rot, time, and fear) is clear, with one meaningful tightening when the seed’s spiral growth redefines tactics and inspires “The Spiral Root.” Pressure is primarily conceptual and atmospheric; there’s little on‑page forced trade‑off under a ticking constraint. The price paid (lifelong patience, social isolation implied) is legible. A single concrete reversal or in‑scene dilemma would heighten escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are focused—salvaging joy’s echo—and deepen as the tunnel “answers” with gradations (giggle, snicker, full laugh, tonight’s tiny laugh). Escalation is tonal and density‑driven rather than reversal‑driven, fitting the accumulative lens. Social cost (neighbors’ judgment) and emotional cost (begging the concrete to give her back) sharpen commitment. The final recommitment forecloses retreat without false catharsis.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes concentrate on isolation vs. connection under the risk of dissolution/fossilization; the shift from guarding to giving is the key tightening. The pendant’s plea escalates pressure toward the irreversible handoff, foreclosing the hoarding path. Cost is legible (surrender of a talismanic anchor; accepting ambiguity). The conflict remains primarily internal, with modest external pressure, but it coheres and deepens.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—interrupting a destiny of failure—tightens via the ritual’s feedback (thrum, tremor, frost) and the pivot from perfection to iteration. The meaningful turn is the internal reframe (destruction→deconstruction) that narrows options to perpetual becoming, with the price of abandoning “arrival.” Tension accrues sentence‑to‑sentence as adjustments risk collapse. External antagonism is light, so escalation is primarily internal/procedural.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure coheres around a single dominant stake: unlocking silence at perigee. Escalation accrues via density: perigee’s arrival, the fragment’s activation, the hush’s cut, and the city’s reanimation, driven by her tuning choice. The tightening is meaningful (silence over noise), though the price paid is more philosophical than lived. Lack of a sharper sacrifice caps intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is legible early and escalates via density: each disappearance tightens the braid until the convergence event. Agency is clear (he decodes patterns, calibrates beacons, and executes the harmonic merge). The cost is conceptual rather than visceral—he trades permanence for stewardship—which slightly softens pressure. Even so, the cadence shift at the hourglass ignition is a meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure coheres: each stitch thickens the thread and provokes resistance, culminating in the split/eruption. The decisive act (releasing control) resolves the tension, but the risk profile stays largely abstract—no palpable jeopardy beyond psychic and ontological strain. The gallery’s warnings via mirrors offer a credible tightening, testing her commitment to “rational enchantment.” The price is felt more in stance shift than in loss of options.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes are clear (humanity must relearn navigation), but escalation is gentle: the blackout prompts awe rather than a crisis, and the teaching beats persuade more than they pressure. The tightening comes as a thematic deepening rather than a narrowed option with visible loss. Agency expresses as endurance and reframing, which is valid but low-temperature. A single concrete, on-page failure or risky test would have raised urgency and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure tightens from searching to urgent when the pulse stutters and surges, culminating in the decision to broadcast a steadier frequency and speak the hard truth. Stakes remain intimate and coherent (ending a harmful waiting), with one meaningful deepening. The cost is primarily emotional; no antagonist, but internal and situational pressures interweave. A touch more resistance or failure‑risk could have intensified the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stakes are clear early (time, claustrophobia, mission) with a meaningful tightening at activation and the tide’s return. Agency is endurance/attention rather than confrontation, culminating in the choice to remain until water touches her boots. Cost is felt via sacrifice of the fleck and risk of entrapment. Escalation is purposefully quiet; an added tactical complication in the chamber could heighten turn pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.3)
    Under an accumulative lens, escalation arrives via density—the ink’s branching, the ghost chorus focusing into Voss’s line, and the heartbeat count’s cadence. The ritual produces a clear deepening from chaos to “arranged,” and Aris’s stance crystallizes. Costs are conceptual and internal (accepting settlement, remaining the “dead” custodian), not materially narrowing, which keeps the pressure from tightening further. Still, the cadence shift at bloom completion lands.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is clear: reclaim a language’s voice. Pressure tightens when the diamond’s vacuum risks consuming everything except “emotional residue,” forcing careful calibration. Escalation is a density increase (flock syntax → activation → canyon responses) consistent with the chosen lens. The risk feels contained rather than perilous, but the emotional price and tool‑constraint keep tension live.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear: release the entity and transmute bitterness. Escalation arrives via the arrowhead’s hum and gravity’s hiccup, culminating in the decisive SEND and the metamorphosis. The felt cost (phone shattering; surrender of bitterness and control) reads, though pressure stays lyrical rather than constricting. No hard reversal beyond the commitment beat, but the deepening is sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is legible and escalates via density rather than confrontation (statues freezing → weeping → kneeling → gardening). The price is stamina and risk of triggering guards, but danger never truly bites, limiting pressure. The shift to louder yet “never harsh” plays as a meaningful tightening consistent with the lens. Resolution is earned by her endurance and attention more than a hard trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is legible early (deliverance across a perilous border) with one meaningful tightening (interceptors → basement reroute and EM masking). Agency drives escalation; the protagonist chooses risk and method. Cost is primarily conceptual/emotional rather than an on-page loss, tempering the peak pressure. Still, the narrowing of options reads cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure escalates texturally: the carousel stirs, then lives, culminating in a turning crown. Stakes are aesthetic/spiritual rather than oppositional; the piece deepens rather than narrows options. The visible price is labor and devotion, not a hard trade‑off. Still, the final stance crystallizes coherently under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake (find where stories live) is signaled early and escalates through the crossing and song. Pressure is mostly textural; no antagonist or hard obstacle tests her resolve, and risk/cost are muted. The meaningful tightening is the decision to enter and then to sing to reawaken, which reweights purpose. Earned but gentle stakes keep tension below truly bracing levels.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear early (reclaim the runaway dream), and pressure coheres via the chromatic cipher culminating in the decisive blend. The meaningful tightening is the three-component formula executed under a specific dawn window. External resistance is minimal; escalation is primarily internal and procedural, which suits the lens but limits visceral cost. Resolution feels earned by her endurance and method, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are clear (liberate an idea from fear) and escalate via the mirrors’ resistance and the vow that forecloses carrying fear forward. The meaningful tightening is the crimson ribbon choice that dissolves opposition. However, resistance yields quickly; costs remain mostly thematic, not felt as loss or compromise. Tension is steady but rarely truly jeopardized.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—recover vs. risk further loss—tightens through the experiment’s pulse and the seeped fragments that change her options. The trawler’s route break as trigger is a crisp pressure point; coincidence complicates but does not resolve. The final decision forecloses a path with felt cost. Slight limitation: external antagonism is diffuse, relying on environmental pressure rather than contested exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—misreading leads to exile and shadow escape—is clear, with pressure deepening through dusk and the swing’s hush. Her agency drives turns (disciplining the novice, the cartographer intervention, the deliberate forward step, then retreat). The price is endurance and self-fracture rather than a flashy reversal, but it’s legible. A hair more on-page jeopardy would sharpen the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is early and clear: if the seed fails, the hue of wonder vanishes. Pressure accrues via ritual intensification (memory filaments, world hush) to the crack/unfurl beat, but there’s minimal challenge or narrowing of options beyond perseverance. The cost is mostly implied devotion; a sharper test or threatened failure moment would heighten escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (grounding spirits by releasing hoarded silence) is clear from the outset, and pressure meaningfully deepens at the guilt-knot. The violent release and confession constitute a real test with risk to her and the sanctuary—a price paid in the room. Resolution stems from her agency, not coincidence, and the ensuing stillness feels earned. Minor note: tension between speed and care could have been sharpened with one more forced trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure escalates through density and pattern recognition rather than confrontation: the migrating shadow, spiral path, and timed dusk viewing. The choice to witness—not rebuild—forecloses a path with an implied reputational/academic cost. Stakes remain intimate but legible; the cadence tightens into the last‑light moment. Lack of overt resistance keeps the ceiling below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—understanding/achieving letting go—tightens from curiosity to compulsion to renunciation. The decisive act (opening palms and stepping back) bears a tangible cost and reweights options. Escalation is primarily internal but coherent and pressure increases via sleeplessness, isolation, and the globe syncing with the narrator’s pulse. One more on-page test of risk could have sharpened stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (being understood) is signaled early and tightens as she moves from encoded paint to voice, then to communal broadcast. Escalation reads as density and cadence shift consistent with the chosen lens. Cost is emotional exposure rather than material loss, but it registers. A single deepening rather than a hard reversal keeps pressure coherent at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are internal (integration of grief), signaled early and coherently deepened at the cipher reveal and diary recovery. Escalation is textural rather than confrontational; the meaningful tightening is the discovery mechanism that reframes her search. The price—embracing acceptance over answers—is felt but not acute, keeping tension in a contemplative register. Ending agency (choosing “truth” over treasure) is earned but quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—proving empty spaces remember—tightens as Altocumulus #112 shifts and dissolves, forcing her toward an acceptance/memorialization choice. The meaningful deepening is the movement from “quietly explosive” to “release,” which narrows her stance rather than offering escape. Cost is emotional endurance and renunciation of the duet’s return, felt in the ledgered epitaph. Escalation is subtle but consistent with the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—complete the transmutation before destruction—is clear and tightens through radios, countdowns, and the final hydraulic whine. The choice to prioritize communion over preservation narrows options and exacts a cost (no witnesses, loss of the work). Escalation is mostly textural but legible under the lens. Lack of a sharp reversal keeps it short of peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes remain predominantly aesthetic/intellectual (discovery, steering light) with low friction; skepticism dissolves quickly and obstacles are light. The meaningful tightening is the public test with crew boots and the signal beam, but few options are foreclosed. Cost is under‑articulated, so tension plateaus into triumph. Strong concept, muted pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is clear—gain the rhythm—and escalation deepens via the mirror interrogation and the moment of choice not to seize. The tightening occurs when the voice queries her and the gears assemble, forcing a values trade‑off; the cost is her relinquished glow and tool‑set. Pressure is quiet but coherent under the accumulative lens. A slightly sharper jeopardy or loss mid‑scene would heighten the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—collective passage to the nebula—tightens at the “third moon” beat and culminates in the bell’s chime revealing the path. Escalation is primarily ritualistic rather than oppositional; cost is implied (leaving home) rather than pressured on the page. Agency is present through Elira’s orchestration and Kael’s ringing. One clear cadence shift occurs, but without a hard trade‑off scene test.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—gentling the end—tightens through the activation sequence (heartbeat → wind → star‑hum) and the pane’s thickening, culminating in the eye’s fall. Pressure escalates coherently under the accumulative lens; agency is endurance/ritual rather than reversal. The visible price is the consenting extinguishment of all things and his acceptance of it. Slight softness remains from the absence of antagonistic pushback.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is clear early and tightens under the frost clock; his tactics adapt (non‑triggering signs, acoustics) to avoid the birds/wards. The find‑and‑handoff sequence provides the single meaningful deepening. The price is endurance rather than injury or rupture; opposition (birds/curse) stays atmospheric, keeping escalation textured rather than combative. Still, agency drives outcome and forecloses relief.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stakes (atonement and reframing grief) are clear and tighten through the foam‑led insight toward a felt renunciation of rigidity. The turn from “predictability” to “phase change” functions as escalation under the accumulative lens. The cost—letting go, accepting impermanence—reads on the page. Pressure is largely internal but coherent and mounting.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes focus on the vendor’s need to redistribute/erase burden; escalation is an accumulative tightening through repeated sales and incisions. Costs are conceptual but legible (quantified regrets, dissolved home). The pressure remains coherent though quiet; no sharp turn, but density increases toward the “seven” tally. Resolution is earned as a stance rather than a decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—absorbing stored remorse until it becomes “bearable weight”—is signaled early and tightened by the choice to remove gloves and finally submerge both hands. Escalation is clear (touch → overwhelm → still center → plunge), and the price is viscerally rendered. The conflict is primarily endurance-based rather than choice between competing goods, but the cost is unmistakable. Resolution is earned by the protagonist’s fortitude and method.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are focused: rehabilitate the elevator’s voice to restore communal trust. Escalation reads as density/deepening—language layering → elevator’s hesitant response → chime cascade → doors open. The pressure is effective but gentle, with limited jeopardy or trade‑off beyond the anchoring sacrifice. Still, agency drives the turn, and the narrowing of options (anchor time to stabilize the ritual) is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is internal: transform grief into agency via modification. Pressure coheres and deepens when she allows the child’s memory to flood and chooses integration rather than avoidance, then escalates with the decision to keep the mirror and return. The cost is present but subdued; no path is palpably foreclosed beyond prior habits of mourning/sterility. One meaningful tightening lands, though it could cut closer to bone.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (access the hidden chamber during the sky’s sigh) is clear, with one meaningful tightening at each threshold and the fragment fuse beat. Escalation is primarily knowledge‑deepening rather than direct resistance; risk feels aesthetic more than perilous. The time‑box and sealing provide consequence. Agency drives each turn, though the price remains low‑temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are focused: awaken resonance in a world gone hollow. Escalation deepens via method (crack analysis → resonance chamber → alignment) culminating in the intentional “strum.” The price is mostly internal and aesthetic, not a trade‑off under duress, so tension is exquisitely quiet rather than pressured. Still, the cadence shift at activation is decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes center on perceiving/choosing under the eclipse clock; pressure coheres as the field surges and the covenant reframes. Escalation is a deepening rather than reversal, consistent with the lens. The final choice forecloses a return to mere anxiety, but the visible price is modest. Tension is steady, not sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—recovering fragile silences before the fireworks—is clear. Escalation is accumulative: blunt C‑sharp fails → gentler harmonics → textured braid → fracture → click. Price is mostly conceptual/endurance rather than visceral, but the time pressure and delicacy create credible stakes. Resolution grows from her chosen method, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (finding equilibrium and guiding the village through change) is clear, with a meaningful tightening at the bloom. Elira’s agency is endurance and attention rather than decisive confrontation, but it still forecloses the path of avoidance. Costs are present (stench, tears, the willingness to be altered), though the conflict never truly jeopardizes her core aim. Tension is steady more than harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (discovery) is signaled early and meaningfully tightened by the inversion window and the glint→vines eruption beat. Escalation is agency‑driven: she chooses to deepen risk by flying deeper and planting the arrow. The price is primarily conceptual (accepting a listening role) with modest immediate hazard; no antagonist, but pressure coheres under the clock. The final act reweights options for her future behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are clear (prevent the next accident) and pressure coheres via anomalous gusts and the shifted crane. Escalation is mostly informational and textural; the main tightening is the decision to plant sensors and step into the gust. There’s limited foreclosure of options or paid cost on the page. Tension lives in the measured data spikes rather than a concrete test.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure accrues through intensifying strikes and cascading revelations; the dominant stake (tending wonder) tightens via the final unfettering. The meaningful turn is the surrender of control to the aurora and the sheet’s internalization. However, conflict is largely uncontested—no opposing force beyond silence—so escalation reads more ceremonial than fraught. The felt price is present but not sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure coheres around the ethical stake: to test the weave without repeating catastrophe. The tightening beats—uncasing, the breath-note seam, the forensic walk through failures, and the refusal to play—progressively narrow options toward renunciation. The price is conceptual and vocational rather than kinetic, but it’s legible and consequential. A minor added stressor in-scene (risk of re‑collapse or a test that almost tempts her to play) could heighten escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes escalate via density: halo dimming, vanishing constellations, and the widening social impact (clockmaker, warlord). Her agency culminates in spending the last of the halo on a single multi‑valent glyph, a choice with visible cost. Pressure is coherent but mostly reported rather than dramatized, muting visceral tension. The dominant stake remains conceptual rather than directly contested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—duty vs. wonder—tightens through the fork and hush scene to the costly release. The market beat credibly escalates pressure as attention concentrates (lanterns sway, wind pauses), making the renunciation feel necessary. Stakes remain intimate but felt; no false antagonist or convenience resolution. Slight softness: the delivery deadline doesn’t materially bite once she reaches the Market.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure escalates via a steady intensification: frost translates into faces, to last moments, to the revaluation of “proof.” The decisive tightening is her choice to forgo publication, a meaningful trade‑off. Stakes remain intimate but coherent under the accumulative lens. A slightly sharper on‑page price or external pressure would raise impact.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake is legible early and escalates through a single decisive tightening: to send the message, she must dissolve herself into the weave. Agency drives the climb (rebuilds loom, chooses solstice, begins the passes), and cost is unmistakable as memories convert to glyphs. No antagonist, but pressure coheres and narrows options under the accumulative design. The rummage‑box coincidence complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure escalates via the silk’s attrition and the choice to spend the last length on the enduring glyph. The dominant stake (returning courage/magic through mundane tools) tightens into a single test: risk the last resource for communal return. Costs are felt but remain gentle; there’s no antagonist, yet the renunciation reads consequential. The cadence shift at the chime and held glyph earns the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (retrieve the withheld truth) tightens through the universe jump and the core’s reveal. The cost is conceptual/emotional rather than tactical; there’s little adversarial pressure or obstacle that forces a trade‑off on the page. Escalation reads as deepening knowledge rather than narrowing options. Still, the final renunciation of old ignorance creates felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserving fragile light/connection—tightens with the lamp’s failure, forcing an immediate reassertion via ritual action rather than spectacle. The refusal to turn back after relume is a priced stance, not a dodge. Escalation is quiet but real under an accumulative lens; coincidence (re‑flicker) complicates but does not resolve. Slightly modest cost visibility keeps it below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes center on guiding human longing; the urgency spike (“stars… pulsed with unusual urgency”) and the wick’s flare provide a meaningful deepening. However, escalation lacks a pressured trade-off or narrowed options—she succeeds without significant tactical adaptation. The felt price is endurance and vigilance rather than a costly choice. Tension remains more atmospheric than oppositional.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are internal (can she find a true magnetism) and escalate via density: the seven‑ and twelve‑sunrise beats tighten knowledge toward a decisive stance. The act of infusing the dye crystallizes commitment and forecloses mimicry. Prices are primarily identity‑level rather than situational, so tension remains low‑heat. Still, the progression is clear and earned under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes tighten through a shift from technical repair to ethical attention—choosing to carry witnessed sorrow. Escalation is lyrical rather than adversarial; the major turn is the projection and the decision to follow. Visible cost is soft (no counter-force tests this choice). Tension holds, but remains gentle, with low consequence risk on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are singular and legible: either the realm remains dark or a communal dawn is rewoven. Escalation is a decisive intensification (solo hum to collective chorus to shattering release). The price is mostly implied (abandonment of silence/hoarding), with minimal on‑page sacrifice or loss, keeping it shy of fiercer tension. Still, agency drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (self‑acceptance vs. institutional belonging) tightens from rediscovery of the self‑addressed summons to the aisle step and public pinning of the letter. The key turn is internal but consequential; the price is exposure to the dawn arrival. Escalation is appropriately quiet for the lens, though it lacks a sharper on‑page test. Still, the cadence shift at midnight clearly narrows her options.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are internal (seeking tenuous absolution), signaled early, and deepen through offering, candle, uncloaking, and seed‑planting. The key tightening is the uncloaking and the act of guerrilla gardening—small defiance against forgetting—which leads to the charged final image. Cost is mostly conceptual; no significant option is explicitly foreclosed. Tension remains steady rather than sharpening into a decisive test.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—salvaging vows before they fade—is clear and tightens as radiance bleeds away. The key turn is the discovery that “I forgive you” recalibrates the Array, leading to the chosen cost of spending the slide’s remaining magic. Escalation is quiet but credible for the lens; no antagonist needed. Slightly limited by the conflict’s internal/lyric nature, though the price is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is explicit and pressure tightens via near‑exposures, a staged false start, and the memory-triggering brush. The reversal hinges on her agency (choosing listening and the fob over confrontation). The price is implicit rather than dramatized (risk of being marked “lighthouse blood”). A slightly sharper consequence or narrowed option after the break would heighten escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is legible early: learn why weather‑carriers converge and whether the forest will absorb him. Escalation is a taught pattern intensification culminating in the vote and the ring pointing down. Cost is visible (his archive surrendered; her tool and stance relinquished). Slight limitation: situational resolution leans on the forest’s agency more than hers, though her choices aim and admit it.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (freeing suppressed creativity) tightens via a decisive intensification: from internal visualization to external liberation with wings. Agency drives turns (choosing to kneel, to release rather than capture, to soften the father with a single tear). Costs are emotional and relational, legible on the wall and at parting. Stakes remain personal but potent; no false antagonist intrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (locating lost conversations) tightens as her physiological cost rises and the search path narrows from atrium to chest. The decisive deepening occurs when she reads the letters aloud, reversing the wilting and transforming the quest into witnessing. The pressure is mostly internal/external ambience rather than antagonist, but it coheres. The earned stance change at the end is clear and paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is clear (preserve wonder) and deepens via storm harmonization and the child’s awakening. Escalation is more density than narrowing: the child scene and cobalt glow intensify payoff but don’t force a hard trade‑off on the page. The final renunciation carries cost conceptually but isn’t dramatically contested. Tension operates, if quietly, at sentence and beat scales.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—prevent core overload and stabilize the farm—tightens as the shift scrambles systems. The choice to ignite fears narrows options and enables syncing the farm; internal and external conflicts braid effectively. The resolution is earned and character‑driven. The felt cost is more metamorphic than sacrificial, slightly easing intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate quietly via repeated visits and the choice to hum rather than confront; the cost is time, exposure, and restraint. The meaningful tightening arrives when Leo finally opens the door and the ritual is tested. Pressure remains coherent under the accumulative lens but never bites hard. The conflict resolves without a hard trade-off beyond vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure coheres (drones sweep, core cipher pulses) and deepens through tactical misdirection and the culminating encryption. Yet escalation reads as steady competence rather than narrowing options; the drones and master cipher don’t bite back on the page. The final renunciation provides cost, but the stakes feel more conceptual than visceral. One meaningful tightening lands; room remains for a sharper squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (recovering displaced memory/father) is signaled early and deepens through the ritual’s turns (galaxy → whale bones → doorway). Escalation is smooth and coherent, but largely frictionless; Elira faces little resistance or trade‑off beyond the implied crossing cost. The “missing arm” echo is a strong mid‑turn that tightens options. A clearer price at the threshold would further charge the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure deepens when the prophecy speaks and reclassifies itself; she must choose to receive rather than suppress. The escalation is consistent with the accumulative lens, but the stakes remain mostly conceptual. There’s one meaningful tightening—recognizing the plea—and it resolves credibly through her agency. A clearer felt price would raise heat.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure escalates through revelation and reciprocal disclosure rather than danger: the seal’s function, the building’s sentience, and the key to the vault. The decisive narrowing is choosing truth and the vault, but immediate price is light. The “lies scaffold” motif tightens the relationship stakes nicely. A small, concrete risk or sacrifice on the page would heighten consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserve and structure memory before dawn—tightens via the fading stars and the shell’s increasing resonance. Agency drives the turn (she vows and archives, then relinquishes the shell), and consequence persists (not healed, but sovereign). Pressure is quiet rather than combative, yet the cadence shift and trade‑off are unmistakable. A sharper external counterforce could have heightened risk, but the internal stakes suffice.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (freeing the land from inherited guilt) tightens via the vault opening and the scroll’s active resistance under a live clock. Escalation is primarily a single meaningful deepening rather than multiple reversals; still, the accelerated dripping and fissures provide pressure. Agency is consistent—her choice to soften edicts into pleas is the moral hinge. The cost is present but mostly spiritual; a concrete loss mid‑scene (e.g., a near‑failure beat) could heighten it.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear (stop resonance theft without destruction) and tightens through progressive disclosure to the lullaby gambit. The entity offers soft pressure—curiosity over hostility—so tension leans on cadence shifts and ethical calculus rather than visible reversals. The price (endurance, exhaustion, relinquishment of voice/time) is present but mild. A sharper test of her resolve mid‑song would elevate escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are clear: salvage a pure echo and release it without harm; escalation is a deepening from pattern-mapping to an irreversible placement. Pressure remains gentle but coherent under the accumulative lens, culminating in a choice that forecloses continued cameos. The felt price is acceptance and letting go rather than confrontation. A sharper on-page resistance or trade-off could have heightened tension without breaking tone.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are quiet but coherent: will she meaningfully witness the unseen, not merely admire it. Escalation comes via density—whistle to test air → widow’s name → shanty that synchronizes fireflies—culminating in the “I see you” renunciation of recognition. Cost is felt as chosen smallness, not dramatized threat. The lack of a sharper narrowing keeps pressure from cresting higher.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (excavate truth; test whether the “curse” masks tech) is clear, with a meaningful tightening when she deploys the diamond. Pressure is largely environmental and conceptual; little active opposition limits felt cost. The plaque discovery deepens options rather than foreclosing many; the earned stance at the end still reads as a real commitment. Tension is steady but never bites hard.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (resist Kael’s homogenizing dawn by offering a shadow-savvy alternative) is clear and tightens via the rebels’ hail and the decision to co-opt Kael’s towers. The escalation remains mostly conceptual and atmospheric; visible price is muted. Agency drives the turn (she sings to trigger the lattice) and resolves to an invitation with future risk. A small on-page loss or immediate repercussion would have lifted pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes center on preserving and translating memory toward redemption; escalation deepens via the music box’s revival and the child encounter echoing generational continuity. Pressure is quiet but coherent and increases through pattern density rather than adversarial clash. Cost is legible in the final renunciation/vanishing. Slight softness: conflict rarely forces a hard trade-off on the page before the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure escalates credibly with the sonic harpoon strike, forcing an immediate tactical shift into counter‑frequency buffering. The dominant stake (protect the Heartstone) stays coherent. Resolution relies on her agency, but the conflict resolves quickly and cleanly, with minimal aftermath cost. The antagonistic force dissolves rather than extracts a price, softening impact.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—reconfiguring power through silence—remains coherent and deepens via pattern (children, parents, soldiers; envoys → threats → silence). Escalation is more tonal than event‑driven, but the cadence shift to regime hesitation and retreat constitutes a real tightening under the chosen lens. The price is restraint under provocation, though it’s not stress‑tested in a discrete confrontation. Quiet resolution feels earned, if not knife‑edge tense.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (truth vs institutional amnesia) is clear, and escalation comes via the realization of a historic panic surge causing death. Her choice to anchor the lantern and accept institutional dismissal is an earned renunciation with cost. The tension is more deepening than reversal; adding a concrete risk (physical or bureaucratic) in-scene would heighten stakes. Still, the cadence shift at “Show me” and the lantern’s silver light functions as the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—fulfilling Maribel’s request to reconfigure self‑worth—intensifies through accumulated failed trials toward a decisive alignment choice. The storm‑beam insight introduces a deepening rather than a deus ex machina; he still must execute a precise, value‑laden tactic (synchronize to Clair de Lune). The visible price is patience, humility, and the surrender of force, read clearly at the bench. Internal and external strands braid cleanly without overreach.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (earn the bell) is clear and tightens: engine activation, faster refractions, external instability, and her degrading voice. The meaningful turn is the final transliterated glyph and trigger leading to a whisper, not a ring—an earned but partial win. Costs are conceptual and bodily rather than catastrophic, keeping escalation strong but contained. Agency drives every step.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes cohere around recovering the de‑referenced crew and the moral risk of breaking protocol. Pressure escalates via the 0707 pattern, the janitor link, and the timed mass restore, narrowing options to a single ritualized action. The earned stasis—choosing silence and ongoing vigilance—carries felt cost. No overt antagonist, yet the corporate/technical pressure is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (reconstituting courage/empathy) is clear, with a meaningful tightening at the oldest mirror when the reflections turn inward. Escalation is primarily tonal/density‑based rather than conflictual; no antagonist, but pressure coheres toward the final stance. The price—accepting incompletion and choosing to carry forward—is present but understated. A slightly sharper on‑page test would heighten cost clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—how to meet endings—tightens through a concrete hazard (shear) that forces a choice. The turn is her agency: walking onto the floe instead of evacuating, sacrificing safety for insight. Cost is legible (near‑freezing, foreclosing euthanasia path) and carries forward to the later refusal. Tension operates at both sentence and scene scales without requiring an antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—how to honor a mismatched love—tightens via the parallel of entwined vines and the tasted grape post-frost. Elias’s methodical persuasion and Mara’s evolving stance create a clear deepening toward “meant to be… differently.” The price is foregoing reconciliation for reframed regard. Escalation is subtle rather than knife-edge.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is focused and escalates through a felt deepening: air thickens, first clearing stabilizes, multiple vessels form. Agency is a disciplined refusal to force, which narrows tactics to peripheral attention and surrender. The visible cost is stamina/renunciation of control; the parapet’s “click” seals the earned result. Pressure remains low‑temperature but coherent under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.9)
    Pressure is primarily internal and textural; the stakes (maintaining a healing ritual) deepen but rarely tighten. The most pronounced “turn” is the mural’s reflected birds, which reweights wreckage, and the maxim “Don’t rush the bend,” yet these don’t foreclose options. The cost is quiet (time, solitude, physical ache) and undercharged on the page. Effective for a lyric piece, but limited escalation keeps the band mid‑high.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are internal—whether to keep mapping or answer the living question—and pressure coheres as the crystal’s anomalous clarity forces a choice. The tightening is a single decisive deepening consistent with the lens. The cost is modest (risking voice, breaking method) but felt. Absence of external antagonism is fine, though it keeps intensity in a quiet register.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are singular and clear: locate the frequency of aging before it slips away. Pressure escalates via pattern density rather than reversals—more driftwood, directional pull to older tapes, then the culminating screech. Cost is legible (inevitable forgetting; chalk spent; fragile arrangements left behind). The tightening is subtle but decisive under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are internal but coherent: can she reframe time without force while the lunar world destabilizes. Escalation is a density rise rather than reversals—the synchronization sequence tightens options and commits her to tenderness over thrust. The cost (relinquishing repair-as-control) is legible, though largely conceptual. No antagonist, but pressure coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes (reunification/last goodbye) are signaled early and deepen via the pattern of mundane hymns mending fractures. Pressure escalates texturally: density thickens (recognitions, child’s touch, final lullaby), culminating in the shard’s dissolution. Opposition is soft; the piece leans on intensification rather than conflict, which fits the lens but slightly reduces bite. The price—relinquishing the instrument/role—is clear at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure escalates from observation to experiment to crossing and assumption of stewardship, with a clear tightening around noon’s phenomenon. Stakes remain largely metaphysical; danger and loss are implied but not viscerally felt on the page. The major turn—stepping through and later choosing to maintain the seal—is earned by her method. A sharper on‑page price or threatened failure beat would raise urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—recomposing a harmful myth into a practice of repair—is clear and deepens after the substitute’s reveal. Escalation follows an accumulative cadence: myth shatters → ritual → leave the tooth, inviting communal healing. The cost is a renunciation of vengeance/closure rather than a hard trade‑off, so pressure stays low‑temperature. Still, the tightening is coherent and protagonist‑driven.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.1)
    Pressure is quiet but tightens: the vow is tested through method and culminates in placing the glass where water activates it, publicly committing to reflection over ignition. The “no flames” constraint creates a genuine trade-off that defines the tactic. Stakes (solace versus relived trauma) are legible and deepen at the villagers’ arrival and the child’s touch. Escalation remains internal/accumulative rather than confrontational, but it lands.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes center on self‑reclamation under public exposure; pressure tightens at the decision to transform the confession rather than destroy it. Escalation is modest but credible within the accumulative lens. The price—a continued, unhidden relationship to pain—charges the plan to return. Absence of a sharper external counterforce keeps the band below top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres around a refusal of conventional closure; the tightening arrives as mist/hush thickens and she chooses transmutation over transcription, then releases the shell. Stakes are internal but consequential—defying reader/publisher catharsis and her own habits to accept an unfinished manuscript. Escalation is more deepening than reversal, but the cost is unmistakable at the end. A touch more on-page friction could have heightened the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes (restore sacred practice) are signaled early and deepen as the song elicits a response, a question, and then a chorus. Escalation is agency‑driven through musical choices rather than external antagonism. The price is primarily emotional/ritual (restraint, listening), not a hard trade‑off, which keeps intensity moderate. Nonetheless, the cadence shift to communal song is a clear tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (revelation through listening) is signaled early and deepens through the blood‑seal that triggers the map’s activation. Pressure coheres via patience/endurance rather than overt opposition; the key tightening is the humming plate syncing to her pulse. Visible price is modest but present. The absence of a counterforce or meaningful trade‑off keeps intensity below top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure deepens through patterned revelations and one incisive intensification (the dusk tone cracking a stalactite), confirming stakes in preservation over repair. The dominant stake is coherent and narrows toward a choice to seal the archive and leave. Escalation is lyrical rather than adversarial, so the visible price is nuanced rather than visceral. Still, the cadence shift at thaw provides a clear tightening and earned end.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (transmuting unbearable weight) is clear and tightens as the ritual deepens from the father’s burden to her own. Escalation is accumulative: density and cadence shift into the “shingled hush,” then to the inward turn. The price—continued servitude to purpose—is unmistakable. Lack of a harder reversal keeps it shy of the top band but remains fully coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are internal: whether she can hold grief without drowning. Escalation is signaled by the kettle’s first whistle and its “scream,” culminating in her refusal to rise—an on‑page price. The deepening insight about time crystallization is tied to action (shaving curls, setting the piece in light). The cost is modest but legible and sufficient at this scale.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure coheres around a single dominant stake: negotiating with the ghost of ambition. Escalation is a meaningful tightening from collecting others’ fragments to confronting the self—handing over the camera forecloses a path. The cost is legible and internal, not grandly external, but it reweights options credibly. Quiet, single turn escalation fits the length and lens.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—can decay be repurposed into function and meaning—tightens once with the geothermal discovery and its redirection. Escalation is primarily density and reconfiguration rather than clash; the pressure is coherent but gentle. Agency is clear and drives the turns, yet opposition is low and trade‑offs are light. The conceptual cost (accepting imperfection) lands more than any tangible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure coheres as an internal stake: whether to reanimate a grand dream or accept a quieter vocation. The meaningful tightening arrives with the tuning fork and harmony—his agency reweights options and narrows toward humming. Cost is conceptually legible: relinquishing public grandeur for intimate making. Escalation remains quiet; no antagonist, but the cadence shift suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes center on internal stance; escalation is a tightening: glint → restraint → tool-assisted alignment → salvage → repricing of lies. Agency is attention and renunciation; the choice not to reach until conditions align is pivotal. Cost is quiet but legible as the end of the hunt ethos. The tension is sustained without reversals; one more felt trade-off could elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—earning access to living tradition—tightens when Havel withholds, then grants instruction, and again as she proves competence. Pressure is quiet but coherent under the accumulative lens. The cost is primarily endurance and responsibility rather than a sharp trade-off, so escalation reads as deepening rather than narrowing. Absence of a harder price or reversal limits peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—making absence present through mapping—tightens as the traveler moves from observation to inscription to burial. The cost is a chosen loneliness and the refusal of prayer/hope in favor of exacting orientation. Escalation is a density increase rather than a clash; it fits the lens but limits felt jeopardy. The “Elira” passage deepens pressure by specifying what’s being mended.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is clear early: reawaken beauty against a mechanized world. Escalation tightens through the build and the high‑risk activation, with a decisive intensification when the hum begins and mirrors shatter. The price is continuing uncertainty and the accumulated toll on the prince, not a single sharp trade‑off. Lacks a direct antagonistic force on the page, but pressure still tightens under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reconciling legacy and vocation—tightens through the lagoon’s recognition, the obsidian figure’s witnessing, and the radio call. The charged choice to tie the thread and then depart for the fire narrows options, foreclosing secrecy for an ongoing, costly attention. Escalation is quiet but firm under the accumulative lens; no false beats or convenience. A touch more immediate jeopardy could have heightened price, but the earned stasis reads.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake (liberate memories) is clear, and there’s a single meaningful deepening at Fountain Twelve. Escalation remains gentle; pressure is mostly tonal and procedural rather than narrowing options with cost. The ending is earned but low-conflict, which moderates intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (share light without burning) tightens via the move from pinging to singing and the gear’s transformation. Escalation is a density increase rather than conflictive reversal, apt for the lens. The cost is felt—gentleness risks being ignored—even if consequences remain conceptual. One meaningful deepening lands when the gear shifts from calculating to feeling, narrowing the ancestral path.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes (“discover the shape of collective grief”) are clear and deepen through the ribbon-installation and the final, personal ribbon that reweights the communal web. Pressure coheres but remains gentle; the meaningful tightening occurs at the last-butterflies/last ribbon beat. Escalation is textural rather than oppositional; visible cost is subtle. The quiet resolution is earned but not razor-edged.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (control vs grace) tightens through the inscription’s reveal and the hinge‑pause. The on‑page refusal to wind is a clear narrowing with identity cost. Quiet escalation fits the textural lens, avoiding false dramatics. A slightly frictionless acceptance keeps it just short of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes focus on transforming how she relates to the dead/intentions; tension deepens as threads yield specific human costs and the border loosens. The decisive tightening occurs when she uses the needle to stitch-to-reveal, releasing the silo’s stored yearning. Pressure is primarily internal and textural, but the tremor and humming case give it physical valence. A slightly clearer on‑page trade‑off would elevate the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure accumulates via the glyph sequence—humming parchment, tuned harmonics—toward “Begin.” The dominant stake (inviting actionable futures) is clear, and the cadence tightens once meaningfully. Still, there’s limited narrowing of options or visible price beyond ritual commitment; no hard trade‑off is tested on the page. The escalation is satisfying for lyric mode but not maximal in cost clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reviving story against famine—tightens via a pattern break when the broadcast names her and demands mourning. The felt price (tears as catalyst) forces a new tactic and forecloses mere preservation; she risks exposure by transmitting. Pressure is accumulative rather than adversarial, but it coheres and deepens credibly. A clearer external counterforce could have heightened cost.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes—honor truth vs. perform safety—tighten through pattern intensification: the chair stills, the ritual commences, an outside witness arrives, and the protagonist doubles down by keeping the mask on. The visitor’s recognition functions as a deepening rather than a reversal, appropriate to the lens. Cost is quiet but legible: continued exposure and refusal of comfort. It’s strong, if intentionally low‑voltage.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (memory vs erasure) is clear and tightens via the Council’s approaches, his refusals, and the climb to attempt a measured “signal.” Escalation is quiet but coherent under the accumulative lens; the bell‑tower scene is the peak attempt with cost implied. Resolution is an endurance stance that forecloses reintegration. Stakes remain mostly conceptual rather than visceral, slightly limiting pressure intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are quiet but coherent: can harmony be reanimated in a world rewarding volume. Pressure escalates credibly via the creak and the child’s question, culminating in Elara’s consent to teach. Cost is a recommitment to a path defined by patience and gentleness, not spectacle. The conflict is internal-external braided, though its subtlety keeps intensity modest.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure deepens through a single tightening (the midnight alignment and the choice to water with memory), and the sprout’s sideways growth reweights options. Stakes remain largely internal and aesthetic; opposition is minimal. The cost is felt but soft, keeping escalation below peak-band intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure rises through discovery and reinterpretation rather than antagonism—adequate for the piece’s mode. The dominant stake (knowledge/wonder vs disclosure) tightens at the platform and in the “why” exchange. However, concrete costs or narrowed options are lightly felt; there’s little risk beyond belief recalibration. The escalation is elegant but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are concentrated: honoring the memory architecture so a lingering house can unclench. The escalation is a tonal tightening—the hush, then the houses stirring, then the cottage’s release—rather than a reversal, fitting the chosen lens. The price (letting go; accepting a perpetual, self-assigned vocation) is felt but remains understated. A single decisive deepening lands; no antagonist is needed.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is whether to enact the revelation and accept its reweighting of history. The tightening is the ampoule decision and its cost—activating the cascade and ending the statue’s custodianship while burdening the historian. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens; the price is legible. Only modest limitation: resistance is brief, so escalation leans more on deepening than on contested struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (reclaiming the missed chance’s texture) escalates via method: carving fails, speaking intensifies, the elegant proof produces a ripple. The on‑page tightening prompts a costly turn—he touches the reflection and loses the die. Agency drives the deepening under the chosen lens; coincidence does not solve anything. Stakes remain internal yet tangible through object, body, and rule pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure escalates through patterned deepening rather than reversals: barista compulsion → note → offerings → the knock. The tightening choice is whether to admit the teen and share the craft, which shifts the lonely stake into communal stewardship. Stakes remain mostly conceptual/empathic; the felt price is vulnerability, not survival—effective but modest. The cadence shift at the end earns the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes (reviving art under the weight of grief) are clear and deepen as glimmers coalesce into performance. The tightening beat is the boy’s revealed drum catalyzing others to act, shifting from private remembrance to communal risk. Prices are felt but soft—no sharp foreclosure beyond undertaking ongoing vulnerability. Escalation stays coherent under an accumulative design but lacks a hard turn with visible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (break fate to end hunger) is signaled early, and pressure tightens through the ritual’s escalating effects. The decisive act (taking the gear) carries consequence and forecloses the relic’s future use. Conflict is largely uncontested—little resistance beyond ritual risk—so escalation reads as solemn inevitability rather than contested struggle. The cost is nonetheless legible and charged at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.8)
    One dominant stake (defang fear) escalates through ritual steps toward a focused confrontation. The cost is legible: the protagonist extracts traumatic echoes to weaponize them. Pressure coheres under the lens; the read‑aloud break and waiting silence heighten stakes before the decisive unbosoming. Resolution is earned by protagonist agency rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure escalates coherently under the accumulative lens: fractal urgency → sea densifies → Prophet must repurpose orchard biology → apprentice must act. The key tightening is the black sea, which forecloses simple continuation and forces the root‑note gambit and delegation. Cost is felt but light; the piece favors transformation over harm. Still, the agency at the peak (tossing the mallet, Kael’s strike) earns the release.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear—reach/watchers vs city’s denial—and escalates when the pattern elicits a head turn, narrowing her options to confrontation. The choice to go at midnight is agency‑driven and forecloses safety and social belonging. Costs are felt but largely prospective. One more on‑page counterforce or loss would have intensified pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake is clear (recover and reframe national myth), and pressure deepens from retrieval to decision about method. Escalation is primarily conceptual; there’s no external force narrowing options on the page. The choice to reveal via parallels instead of accusation forecloses a louder path with reputational risk implied. Tension is steady but not strenuous.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes (memory vs. oblivion) tighten via the drawbridge sealing them in, the pavilion’s entropy, and the ink running out to a terminal act (copying the bride’s letter). The copper tube is a meaningful pressure point that reweights the mission. Escalation reads as deepening commitment under constraint rather than adversarial clash, fitting the lens. The price and renunciation (no treasure, only testimony) are explicit and lasting.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are ethical and archival: expose deliberate erasure. Escalation is a steady deepening rather than sharp narrowing, with the Master Index as the key pressure increase. Agency is endurance and verification, not confrontation; the price is implied risk and burden, not dramatized loss. Effective, if quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes condense from preservation to relinquishment, tightening when the basilica shifts key and the shadow climbs recorded dreams. Silas’s agency drives escalation—shattering lanterns to weaponize memory, then risking his last link (the sapphire). Costs are visible and irreversible, and the final act forecloses a path. Tension is more solemn than edge-of-seat, but it coheres and deepens under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake (pursue probability pools to salvage meaning) is clear early, and escalation reads as simulation collapse → new coordinates → launch decision. The AI’s readiness update creates a modest clock and cadence shift. Internal and external threads interweave without melodrama; the cost is commitment to a path that isolates her. Lacks a sharp reversal or concrete sacrifice beyond resolve, keeping tension high but not peak.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure deepens from curiosity to self‑reckoning; the activation and harmonic memory cascade function as the meaningful tightening. Agency is clear—she chooses to open, align, and then relinquish the search. Yet the warned risk never bites, so the price remains internal and gentle. The piece opts for a quiet escalation, effective but not bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes center on whether she can face and carry a truth that reconfigures her past; pressure tightens through the discovery sequence and embodied shock. The watch hand’s acceleration and the father carving escalate to a hard knowledge turn with a visible price. The resolution—choosing a new ethic for her trade—derives from that cost. It’s primarily internal, but momentum and consequence remain legible.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure tightens via the shift from transactional list to moral accounting (“Did you bring the names you buried?”) and culminates in the exchange of relics. Stakes are internal/ethical rather than tactical; still, the on-page ask-and-answer forces a stance. The price—recognition of complicity and relinquishing personal talismans—is clear. External stakes (the prisoner list) recede, but the pivot reads intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—escape the grip of regret by choosing coherent motion—tightens through concrete beats (naming poles, accepting the washer, reapproaching the kayak). Escalation is internal but clear; the choice to launch forecloses the stasis path. Price is emotional (abandoning perfectionism, accepting uncertainty) rather than event‑driven, but it charges the ending. The compass’s final reorientation underscores agency rather than luck.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—can the seeker kindle empathy—tightens when the water externalizes buried refusals and the baseball’s release tests commitment. Pressure coheres and escalates through density rather than reversals; the key turn is renunciation with a visible price. Internal and external threads interlace cleanly in the lake sequence. Quiet but legible cost fuels the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear from the outset, and pressure coheres through an intensification from scent → spark → embodiment. The decisive deepening is her surrender—foreclosing resistance—and enabling the hybrid return. Costs and trade‑offs are present but primarily conceptual/identity‑level rather than dramatized through risk, keeping the escalation elegantly quiet. The cadence shift at the phoenix’s emergence reads earned under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (reconciling lost time with her daughter) tightens when the saucer becomes a mouth and she chooses to enter. The cost is visible in the release of “every ‘later’ that never came,” trading possession for grace. Pressure coheres internally; no antagonist needed. The resolution stems from her agency and renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (reunion via Echo‑Realm) tightens through calibration risk (too heavy/too light) and the required acceptance of rage. The decisive act—stitching the final photograph’s frequency—arises from her choices, not luck. Visible price (loss of relic, leaving the ship) charges the resolution. Pressure coheres without an external antagonist, and the escalation reads as an intensification of the established pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes escalate through a patterned release with a decisive intensification at the fourth bottle (self-implication) that narrows her options. Pressure is mostly interior and conceptual, but it coheres under the chosen lens. The “sack grows lighter/heart heavier” line makes the price legible. Tension is quiet, not inert, though it never becomes a direct test against external resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (seed a silent revolt) is clear, and there is one meaningful tightening as guards pass close while she executes the alignment and drop. Pressure remains coherent but rarely spikes; no reversal or visible price beyond risk. The blackout and dwindling lanterns help, yet consequences are deferred to off‑page dawn recipients. The resolution is earned but low‑heat.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure accrues texturally: repeated failures implied, deliberate sequencing under constraint, and the arrival of the star-dusted eel tighten the frame toward a single decisive placement. Dominant stake (align with the sacred sequence) is signaled early and paid through the method. The price is more conceptual than visceral, keeping escalation elegant but understated; still, the final micro-choice (the last rock) brings a legible narrowing of options and repriced understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether to break the vigil—tightens via the ticking timer and storm escalation to a clear refusal with felt price. The turn at “clicked to zero” elegantly narrows options; not resetting or opening crystallizes stance. Stakes remain intimate but coherent, with internal and environmental pressures braided. Slightly limited by the absence of an external counterforce on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure rises through temporal narrowing (toward 11:03) and the precise alignment with the fissure, yielding one satisfying deepening. Stakes are intellectual and reputational—recovery of a lost Accord—kept taut by waiting and coordination. Opposition is largely environmental, not personal or moral, and the price paid is modest. The result is elegant but low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes focus on whether Molt will remain armored or risk belief, tightening through Elias’s poem to concrete acts (public posting, candle, planting, song). Escalation is accumulative rather than adversarial but still narrows options toward a bolder stance. Cost is primarily internal and reputational (exposure, grief), legible on the page. A sharper external counter‑pressure in the present frame could heighten the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (break fate to reclaim the lover) is clear and escalates via the compasses’ agitation, the clock’s advance, and the instruction to “Play until the needle stills.” The tightening culminates in a single irrevocable choice: an impossible chord that risks her last guide (the reel) for a potential return. The cost is legible, though internal moral friction is minimal; tension is more strategic than ethical. Still, pressure coheres and rises to a clean peak.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserving collective memory before the monsoon—tightens through the early bloom and the last-of-its-kind seed. Escalation pivots on the live risk of misinterpretation and the tremor/awakening, testing Aris’s method and belief. Cost and trade-off are legible: expend the final seed to anchor memory, accepting autonomous outcomes. Pressure could deepen with one more on-page complication or price paid mid-ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure deepens via the compass’s stutter/swing, the ghost‑voice, marrow‑hum, and rising color, culminating in the lace’s final circle. Escalation is steady but gentle; there’s little resistance or sacrifice beyond enduring presence and cold. Stakes remain coherent (diffuse regret vs. residue), with one clear tightening. The price is mostly conceptual, limiting visceral tension.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story's central conflict is a quiet but powerful internal struggle: recalibration versus breakdown. The stake—Elira’s sanity and intellectual purpose—is clear. The pressure deepens effectively through a series of observations, culminating in the discovery of the logarithmic spiral, a turn that confirms her path and forecloses a return to her old life.

    Dominant stake—weight of swallowed truth—tightens via oracle’s recalibration and Elira’s act of exposure. Pressure escalates through pattern break (smudge becomes center) rather than causal reversals. Cost is felt in the relinquished drawing.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“can I unload this truth?”—tightens when the radio replays her own confession. One decisive turn: twisting the valve redefines the haunting as internal, foreclosing magical absolution. Cost is visible—she pockets the corroded radio, not the valve, accepting permanent cargo. Pressure escalates via accumulating sensory density rather than external threat.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—witnessing without judgment—is signaled early and reweighted at closure, but escalation is atmospheric rather than driven by agency; the drift of seasons deepens texture without narrowing options. The keeper’s only “choice” is to return, a renunciation without visible price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—nurturing wonder—intensifies through the eclipse’s pressure, but escalation is external (celestial coincidence) rather than driven by Elara’s agency, blunting the cost clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—mending the world’s torn causality through story—tightens once the diary links the displaced axis to the tapestry’s dragons; the cost is the historian’s irrevocable commitment to descend into the underlibrary, foreclosing a life of mere observation.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—can Elias transpose fates without claiming authorship—tightens when the analyst arrives with annotated proof. Escalation is accumulative: each fortune widens ripple, pressure grows until pattern recognition threatens anonymity. Agency remains Elias’s orchestration; no coincidence resolves. Cost is anonymity itself, felt when he silently hands over dish duty.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—preventing the possession from completing—is signaled early and tightened by each successive question; the cost is the priest’s relinquishment of certainty itself.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—transform private memory into living music—tightens through each mapped chamber until exhaustion forecloses continuation. Agency is renunciation: she releases the last memory, accepting silence. Cost is the cracked lake and extinguished candle. Escalation is accumulative, not causal, but pressure is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“conquer the labyrinth of self”—is signaled early and escalates via procedural corridors that force confession and integration.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—Elara’s fight against her own numbness—is signaled early and escalates through the needle experiment. One decisive tightening: the reversed song forces collective exposure, trading her private sanctuary for communal catharsis. Cost is felt in the luminous, no-longer-muted silence. Agency remains hers; coincidence is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—truth versus erasure—is signaled early and tightened when the message proves Bureau maps are lies. Agency crystallizes in the refusal to report and the lateral move; the price is the surrender of institutional safety. Pressure escalates under causal logic; coincidence is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will she dare uncork grief?—is signaled early and tightened by the single act of opening the vial.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: discover the texture of impossible choices. Pressure tightens when the rope’s frays reveal Silas’s refusal as a third path.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—beauty in the unfinished—tightens through each bow stroke that risks silence instead of resolution. One meaningful deepening: the cracked beam “groans…in recognition,” proving the music is working and foreclosing the option of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will Lira knot herself into the web?—is signaled in paragraph three and tightens through each offering left beside her sculptures.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prevent temporal collapse by midwifing echoes—escalates through each borrowed second and the giant’s threatened stirring. One decisive tightening: overborrowing triggers the chime, forcing her to sculpt time to cushion the ripple. Agency drives every beat; no coincidence resolves. Cost is visible fatigue and the giant’s stirring curiosity.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—comprehending ambiguous loss—tightens through each beat: from tracing cracks to decoding Aris’s equation. Agency is intellectual yet embodied; the harmonic hum narrows options to a single frequency. Cost is felt in relinquishing the hazel eye and accepting separation as generative.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—visibility versus erasure—tightens through each cached offering until the tape fragment’s placement forecloses total invisibility.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—will she dissect or belong—tightens once: the trembling hand at the clippers. Escalation is driven by her agency under the Accumulative lens; the cost is the forfeiture of her entire epistemic stance. Storm season supplies coherent pressure without coincidence.

    Dominant stake—extract meaning from loss—tightens with each artifact until the exchange forecloses further pursuit. Pressure grows accumulatively; no external antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—whether to use the pearl—tightens once when the cave responds to the pilgrim’s kneeling. Escalation is textural: each harmonic layer raises the cost of denial.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—how to honor absence without erasing it—tightens through each interview and deduction. The final rite is a meaningful deepening that narrows options (no physical memorial). Cost is felt socially but could be sharper on the page; hence not 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—finding the fortress—tightens when arrows cease at the door, forcing the dare that costs the punch and her prior identity. Pressure escalates under the Accumulative lens: each reflection of doubt is a denser layer until the chorus of truths reconfigures the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—how to honor entangled memory without claiming it—tightens as each harmonic memory raises the ethical cost of appropriation; her renunciation to archive rather than possess is an earned narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominated by one stake—“the mathematics of fair trade”—each new signature both testifies and redistributes moral capital, shrinking the ink and widening the possible future reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—lifting the curse—is signaled early. Pressure tightens when the bead’s resonance syncs with Elara, foreclosing refusal. The cost is the bride’s dissolution and Elara’s inheritance of perpetual night; both are visible on the page. Agency is shared: bride initiates, Elara accepts.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake: to redeem broken precedents without repeating ancestral erasure. Escalation is textural—each stitch intensifies the cost of refusal (guild rules vs. personal vow).

Escalation is textural: each unearthed artifact thickens the pattern until the final stone forces the decisive crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—no message lost again—tightens through the widow’s last words encoded in chalk; cost is the deliberate delay and fragility of rain-washable medium.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.5)

    Dominant stake—finding the moment before deciding—tightens through embodied pressure and culminates in the irreversible release of the letters; agency is clear, cost is felt, though external opposition remains spectral rather than concrete.

Agency: pressing seeds to temple and later choosing to plant rather than hoard redefines the path. No external antagonist; pressure is ontological.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.2)

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—permission to speak—tightens once: the ban lifts, the colonnade hums louder, and her single word forecloses exile. Pressure is situational and aesthetic; the cost is the long silence already paid, not a new forfeiture, so escalation feels cumulative rather than sharply rising.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“discover the texture of connection”—tightens through escalating sensory saturation rather than external opposition. One meaningful deepening: the shift from passive listening to active singing refracts the stakes into visible hues. Cost is the irrevocable solitude she accepts, lens glowing as proof.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—translate isolation into sovereignty—tightens when the tide floods and the hum stutters; Veyra’s agency (channeling atomic resonance) forecloses the path of passive remembrance and pays a visceral cost (marrow vibration, skin flare).

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—rejoining the hidden architecture—is signaled early and escalates through the folding ritual. One decisive tightening: the spiral’s glow forces the irreversible dissolution. Cost is felt in the loss of corporeal self, though the beat is more luminous than harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: prevent psychic civil war via subversion of subliminal signal. Tightening occurs when she patches the counter-frequency—live option foreclosed (no committee backup). Cost is legible: permanent solitary vigilance. Escalation is causal and irreversible: tricksters’ signal “writhes, weakened, then retreated.”

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—retrieve the cipher—tightens when the compass points inward, forcing a trade-off between possession and embodiment; the cost is the surrender of her claustrophobia and the old definition of space.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—awakening empathy for the vanished—is signaled early and tightened when Elira pins faceless portraits to stone. Agency is renunciation: she forsakes accusation for shared mourning, foreclosing legal justice with visible social cost. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—reversing exile by proving predictive maps—tightens when decoding the stanza reveals it can control, not merely predict, weather. One decisive escalation: Elara layers stanza with ancestor’s coordinates, narrowing options to mercy or annihilation. Cost is felt in the irreversible atmospheric inversion and the personal exile turned pilgrimage.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether to chase or release the vanished hitchhiker—tightens through the warming glass and dancing flutters, forcing the fiddler’s stance crystallization. The cost is conceptual (permission to be remade) rather than visceral, but it is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—how to respond to collapse—tightens through each return to the train. The protagonist’s agency shapes escalation: chalk arrows dissuade investors, Fibonacci spirals recalibrate thought. One meaningful deepening: failure reframed as curriculum. Cost is visible in lost capital and reputation.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—whether to continue the burden-chain—tightens once the telegram arrives and the guardian’s plea crystallizes the cost. Agency is renunciation rather than reversal, but the narrowing of options is palpable and the price (perpetual service) is on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—truth vs self-protection—tightens with each expanding circle. Agency drives escalation: she kneels, presses palm, breathes into the invasion. The final thaw of confessions is earned, not coincidental. One visible cost: her guarded heart is literally cracked open.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“restore the covenant between dream and waking”—gains one meaningful tightening when bureaucratic denial becomes physical entanglement. The protagonist does not defeat an antagonist but merges with the glade, foreclosing flight. Cost is visible in flesh-root fusion and in acceptance of a lifetime vigil. Escalation remains coherent under accumulative lens: each sentence thickens the glade’s breathing until the sky responds.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes tighten from “patch holes in the soul” to the live choice between vengeance and grace. Each escalation is organic: lullaby → root-shudder → Kael’s hiss → living manacles. The cost is visible—Kael’s ankles bound, Elira’s knees soil-streaked. A touch more tangible forfeiture (a snapped root, a drop of her blood) would secure 9.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will he stay sealed in data or risk feeling music again—tightens when cloth glow triggers ear test, foreclosing the safety of pure measurement. Agency drives escalation: he assigns no catalog number, types new project name, pins cloth publicly. Cost is legible: abandonment of emotional insulation method that defined three years. One meaningful deepening suffices; no external antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single dominant stake—“understand transition without rupture”—tightens through each analogical gesture; the seed’s tremor and split mark the decisive intensification, with the cost of renunciation legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preserve wonder amid routine—tightens when the librarian chooses to shelve the creel under “Waning Wonder,” accepting loss as preservation. One meaningful deepening; cost is conceptual (softened identity) but legible under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—reversing isolation via pearl activation—tightens with each confession; the harmonic vibration marks the decisive intensification. Agency is hers alone; no coincidence resolves the conflict. Cost is the emptied shell and irreversible internalization of others’ hopes.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.4)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—dream vs. empire—tightens through plant telepathy’s escalating dread and the violin’s resonance. One decisive deepening: the instrument’s transparency reveals stolen names, forcing Elira’s final propagation. Cost is felt in the Chancellor’s literal rootedness and Elira’s relinquishment of her only leverage.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“capture one last spark before oblivion”—is signaled early and tightens through the infusion beat; the cost is the scholar’s bodily cessation and the mortician’s eventual self-offering. One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming contentment—escalates through the climb and grotto stillness; the hairpin’s reinsertion forecloses lingering resentment. Pressure is coherent, though external stakes remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: whether Elira will keep selling certainty or allow doubt. Pressure tightens when the chimes translate to “unhook,” forcing a single irrevocable act that forecloses the old business model. Cost is the literal shedding of protective identity; escalation is causal and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—teaching vanishing as emergence—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens through each withheld explanation. The single reversal: Kael moves from frustration to recognition when he sees “not waves, but symbols.” Cost is visible in Elira’s withheld final step; the path is foreclosed, not postponed. Agency remains with Elira; coincidence plays no role.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—becoming the pulse’s keeper—tightens once: the flock’s break west forces the skimmer to accept perpetual stillness. Cost is the forfeiture of motion itself, legible in the closing “would not journey today. Nor tomorrow.” No escalation loop; one decisive intensification suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—whether magic must be grand or can remain intimate—tightens when mist forces surrender of direction and keystone demands release. One meaningful deepening: tree’s memory-doors crystallize the cost of clinging to old ambition. Agency drives every turn; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—discover the color of sound—escalates from abstract desire to visceral cerulean streak behind eyelids. One decisive deepening: the ledger’s pre-signed vow forecloses escape, forcing acceptance of drowning as payment. Pressure coils through each beat; no reversals needed, only intensification of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—whether to surrender to entropy or reclaim agency—tightens when the unbidden vision forces a stance. Escalation is accumulative: each coin, burst, and vision adds pressure until the decisive renunciation. Cost is felt in the “stellar doubt” that softens but remains. No external antagonist needed; internal conflict suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—transforming nameless terrors into named witnesses—tightens once when he begins the naming ritual. The cost is the emotional weight he must carry thereafter; pressure grows under causal lens as each naming stiffens the page and crystallizes memory.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restoring cosmic balance—tightens through each measured drop; the mage’s agency is measured patience, not force. One deepening: the resin’s setting “with a sigh” forecloses any faster path. Cost is the months of dawn vigil and the irreversible surrender of the bell to the sea.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“contain sentiment vs honor memory”—tightens once, decisively, at the gazebo photo. Pressure is coherent under situational lens: each artifact surfaces more ethical weight until silence after the chime becomes the space where truth must speak. Cost is visible: career path redirected, myth left alive. No escalation after that single turn, hence not quite 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will rigor eclipse wonder?—tightens via the crystal’s hum and the starlings’ dance; the deepening is one elegant intensification, but the price (loss of the crystal) is more symbolic than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.8)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—defeat emotional numbness—tightens when vivifying the brain threatens to re-imprison Kael in identity. One decisive deepening: the duplicate’s spoken refusal forces Kael to surrender ownership, foreclosing the path of self-reclamation. Cost is the permanent absence of a reclaimed ego. Pressure grows through harmonic accumulation, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—safeguard space for the grotesque—tightens when clients hallucinate and when the root spirals downward; the price is visible in the obsessed returnees and in Aris’s lifelong deferral of bloom; escalation is accumulative, not causal, but the final reconfiguration makes the cost legible.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restoring lost laughter—tightens through iterative attempts to coax sound from absence. Each hum is a micro-choice that forecloses the option of giving up; the tunnel’s occasional answer deepens the cost of hope. No external antagonist is needed; pressure is situational and emotional. The final tightening is the dropped-to-his-knees moment that still ends in renewed song—visible price, no release.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: transform homesickness from wound to tool. Tightening occurs when guardian relinquishes the pendant, trading certainty for relational risk. Cost is legible: eternal uncertainty carried “like a lantern.”

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“interrupt stifling destiny of only breaking”—is signaled early and tightens when successive approximation forecloses purity as an option; each iteration costs blood, pride, and time. One meaningful escalation: the shift from “flawless ritual” to “error as scaffold” narrows choices and raises stakes under causal lens. Price is visible—frozen bloom melts into singing light he must now carry. No coincidence resolves; the crozier’s rebirth is authored by his iterated agency.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—finding genesis inside endings—tightens through each failed echo until the lunar perigee clock forces the decisive tuning. Agency is continuous; each micro-choice (discarding assumptions, syncing gloves) escalates stakes and exacts the cost of letting the towers live on without her.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: restore singular timeline for vanished souls. Pressure escalates via each ferry blink-out; deckhand’s agency narrows to harmonic stitching. Cost: sleepless, foodless, perpetual stewardship—visible in “didn’t sleep. Didn’t eat much.” Final tightening merges seven ferries; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“discover the texture of connection”—is signaled early and deepens via each stitched memory. Escalation is textural: mirrors spawn hostile doubles, ceiling splits, thread thickens; each intensification raises the cost of continuing. No reversible escape hatch remains once she releases the thread. The price (loss of youthful self, irreversible gallery transformation) is visible in the closing mirror image.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—humanity must relearn navigation or remain lost—is signaled early and tightened through the semester’s arc. The power-failure night forces a micro-choice: Elira recites coordinates from memory, proving the method works under existential pressure. Cost is legible—she forfeits nostalgia for utility. Escalation is steady but lacks a single irreversible fork, capping below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—rescuing a stranded child’s memory—tightens when the pulse flutters “like wings against glass.” One decisive deepening: the tracer chooses to broadcast a counter-pulse rather than merely trace, narrowing her options from observer to participant. Cost is the emotional toll of telling the girl “they’re not coming back,” paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—return presence to the unremembered—tightens as tide creeps in. One meaningful deepening: the Phase Transition Chamber’s activation forecloses retreat. Cost is visible on page: “the gold fleck…crumbled into dust.” Agency drives escalation; coincidence only complicates via tide.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—retrieve wisdom from systemic failure—tightens through escalating ink pattern that forces stance crystallization: accept imperfection rather than repair it. No external antagonist needed; pressure is coherent and internal. Cost is the sting of shard and the irreversible bureaucratic death.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restore a dead language—is signaled early and tightened through the diamond’s hunger and the canyon’s echo-memory. One meaningful deepening: the diamond must be fully fed, risking total silence, to let pure texture escape. Agency is hers; she chooses to feed it selectively and then release the sound. Cost is visible in her tears and the irreversible dispersal of the tongue into the world.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—freeing the Gravity Dancer while shedding bitterness—tightens through escalating physical anomalies: floating books, spinning thyme, upward fall. Each beat increases cost; the final chord forecloses return to prior self.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—reawaken beauty—tightens via each resonant note; the statues’ spear-lowering marks a visible trade-off. Cost is felt in physical exhaustion and the shell’s dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—deliver mercy across a lethal border—tightens once when drone interceptors are reported, forcing reroute through ventilation shafts. Cost is visible: relinquishing the storm, accepting heightened risk. Agency drives escalation under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: to finish the abandoned beauty. Pressure tightens through each stroke of chisel and sandpaper; no external antagonist needed. Agency is quiet endurance; cost is lifetime of silence. One deepening: first horse moves, confirming the wager.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—locate and awaken stories—is signaled early and tightened when she chooses caretaking over extraction. The cost is conceptual (eternal stewardship), visible in the scarf’s luminous re-stitching. Escalation is single but sufficient under Accumulative lens; agency is clear, though external opposition is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—recover the runaway dream—is signaled in paragraph 7 and tightened by each failed capture until the decisive blend narrows options to one final brushstroke. Escalation is accumulative: every sunrise harvest raises the chromatic stakes. Cost is the surrender of further searching.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—liberating the idea from fear—is signaled early and tightened when the mirrors attempt to bar passage. The protagonist’s agency is renunciation: he refuses to carry fear forward, embodied by the crimson ribbon. Cost is visible in the mirrors’ shatter and the corridor’s collapse, though the pressure remains more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—recover stolen memories—is signaled in paragraph four and escalates when the orchard offers them back at the price of staying. One decisive tightening: the moment the mushroom pulses and the air thickens with lost scents, forcing the choice between flight and surrender. Agency remains with the folklorist; coincidence (storm-veering trawler) complicates but does not resolve. Cost is felt in the final smile that accepts further loss.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—reversible exile—escalates through each misread tea leaf; the cartographer’s despair becomes the final test. The tightening occurs when her fingertip line at 37 degrees bisects his map and the shadow simultaneously. Cost is visible: one wrong annotation could eject her into the void. Agency remains hers: she chooses to mentor despite the risk, and the swing’s creak ratchets pressure without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“preserve the color of wonder”—is signaled early and tightened through each distilled memory; the final crack of the seed forecloses failure. Cost is felt as irrevocable stewardship, though external stakes remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—witnessing the chapel’s silence—tightens through each footage comparison until the spiral path forecloses excavation. Agency is exercised in the decision to wait and witness; cost is the renunciation of proof. Pressure deepens rather than reverses; sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—understanding the physics of letting go—tightens through each anomalous reading until the globe’s final unmaking forecloses further study. Agency is exercised in the deliberate release; the cost is the irreversible loss of the object and the analytic project. Pressure grows via pattern accumulation rather than external antagonist; coincidence is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—being heard by the ghost—tightens once through the encoding act; the cost is the tear-streaked smile that concedes vulnerability. Escalation is driven by her agency under the causal lens; no reversals needed.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are internal—seek joy beneath anguish—and tighten once when the cipher is deciphered; the deepening is lyrical rather than causal, but the felt cost of absorbing grief is legible. Agency is contemplative, not active, yet still forecloses denial.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—proving emptiness remembers—tightens through each cloud classification; the final dissolution of Altocumulus #112 forces the crystallized stance. Agency is observational, yet the act of memorializing carries visible cost in charcoal nub and salt-stained ledger. Pressure escalates accumulatively; no external antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—translate the coin’s sky before obliteration—tightens once: crews idle, dawn bruises. No external antagonist; pressure is situational and temporal. Escalation is a density accrual of pigment and time, not a causal turn. The cost is the irreversible loss of the only witness; felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—charting blank spaces—tightens when hopscotch reveals a way to steer light; each numbered hop narrows options and raises stakes. Agency drives escalation: Arlen’s three nights of cross-referencing, then public demonstration. Cost is visible: the luminous beam exposes the ship to unknown attention. No coincidence resolves; every turn stems from prior choice.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—to know which breaks must remain broken—faces escalating pressure with every mirrored scene that forecloses a path. Cost crystallizes when accepting the rhythm costs her silver mantle and lifelong identity as locksmith, paid on the page. The single reversal (from fixing to reharmonizing) lands under causal logic yet keeps stakes personal rather than cosmic.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—make the end gentle—tightens with each nested pattern activation; the spindle turn is the decisive, irreversible narrowing of options. Pressure is accumulative: density of hush increases until stars “fold like petals,” a visible price. No antagonist is needed; entropy itself is the coherent pressure. Cost is unmistakable in the adjuster’s vanishing body and the frozen mid-wave sea.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—prevent one more ghost—tightens when the girl appears; the tightening choice (hand over the nut) narrows his own escape options and carries immediate cost. Escalation is causal and single-cycle, sufficient for length. No reversals beyond the one decisive act.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—transforming separation into connection—tightens when she redefines atonement as rhythm, not repair. Agency drives the shift: her decision to sketch foam geometries and later redesign the scaffold. Cost is visible in the felt weight of “loosened grief” that still moves.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—trading personal absence for others’—tightens with each sale; pressure escalates via accumulating gleams and ledger weight. Cost is legible, but escalation is more additive than decisively narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—subsuming ancestral remorse without being destroyed by it—tightens with each touch; the cost is viscerally paid as her skin “burned with borrowed heartbreak.” One decisive deepening occurs when she kneels in the liquid-shadow basin, foreclosing retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—rehabilitating the silo’s voice—tightens when the elevator’s first hesitant phrase (“Хліб не вмирає”) forces Elara to respond in kind; each linguistic layer narrows her options until the final harmonic chime. Cost is visible in the permanent surrender of the cuckoo weight.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—excavate and re-wire abandoned dreams—tightens when the child’s abandonment memory collides with her own sterile-lab grief, foreclosing the option to remain detached. Escalation is accumulative: each entanglement increases density until the mirror births a new constellation, a visible price. No external antagonist needed; internal pressure suffices. Could use one earlier tangible loss (time, stamina) to push tactics, keeping it just under 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—recovering the forgotten combinations—tightens as each threshold strips away false options. The price is paid on the page: the chamber seals, gravity snaps back, and Elira exits with the whispering burden. Escalation is driven by her choices, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—break the silence—signaled in paragraph 5; escalation is accumulative: each failed phantom strum thickens the vacuum until the discovery of the insulator offers a single, narrowing path. The tightening beat is the decision to carve the resonance chamber; it forecloses the option of simply listening and risks destroying both porcelain and tree. Cost is legible: the insulator’s cracks could shatter under tension, a price Silas accepts when he embeds it. No reversal, but the deepening of silence-to-song under one agency suffices for 600-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—translate silence before eclipse peak—is signaled early; pressure tightens as magnetic pulses intensify. Agency is attention/renunciation rather than overt action; cost is conceptual (accepting exile as path) but legible in the final stride toward treeline.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake of protecting authentic silences intensifies as the external firework countdown shrinks time; each frequency test tightens the noose around failure. Final cost is endured: silence is archived yet future access remains perilous under advancing noise. No escalation slippage; the tightening feels causal and necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—cultivating serenity within motion—escalates as collective doubt crests and the bloom’s stench dissolves arguments. One meaningful tightening: the odor forces villagers to confront grief/fear, narrowing options to apology and shared stories. Cost is communal and felt, though slightly diffuse across the village rather than personally paid by Elira.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—understanding resilience—tightens when arrow’s resonance forces a choice: exploit or commune. One meaningful deepening: discovery that resilience is memory, not biology. Cost is the open-ended commitment to echo with the orchard.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—prevent next “singular convergence”—is signaled early and tightened when crane reposition is revealed to have “changed its shape.” Escalation is accumulative: each wind reading narrows options until only direct confrontation remains. Cost is visible: investigator accepts becoming the wind’s next student. No external coincidence resolves tension.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“certify wonder”—is signaled early and tightened through each chromatic chime. Agency is exercised in the deliberate strikes; the cavern’s response escalates pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—how to honor failure without repeating it—tightens through each beat: uncase, breathe, record, renounce. Agency is renunciation with felt cost; no coincidence resolves tension. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—mapping emotion’s unmappable math—tightens as each borrowed personality exacts a toll; the final glyph crystallizes the cost of empathy without boundaries, foreclosing further use of the fragment.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—deliver oracle’s last breath before dawn—tightens via the fork decision and the dawn clock. Pressure grows through the pendant’s warming pulse and the child’s wonder, but the external deadline never collides with the internal choice; the delivery completes off-stage, muting the cost of the detour. Still, the courier’s agency in choosing wonder over efficiency is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—proving emotion lingers in objects—escalates through each refracted memory until the driver’s surrender reconfigures the mystic’s goal from proof to witness. One decisive tightening: she lowers the prism and chooses silence. Cost is the forfeiture of public validation.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—deliver the message or lose love forever—is signaled in paragraph three and tightened by each thread sacrificed. One decisive deepening: the realization she must weave herself into the pattern, which forecloses retreat. Cost is visceral and on-page: memories transmuted to glyphs, body dissolved.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—coaxing resilience from rubble—is signaled in paragraph three and tightens as the silk thins with each barter. One meaningful deepening occurs when Arlo realizes the silk’s last length must be spent; the cost is the irreversible loss of his tool. Agency drives every turn; coincidence never resolves. The price is visible on the page: “the Magician’s silk thinned with each barter.”

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—retrieve the withheld truth—tightens when the shard flares in Sigma-7. The crystalline data core confrontation forces a single irreversible choice: accept erasure for knowledge. Cost is visible in her ghost-status and final tears.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: preserve a fragile chain of wordless hope. Pressure tightens when the spectral lamp snuffs—Elias must act without speech. Agency: he converts private grief into public signal via stone-cairn code, paying the cost of remaining unheard. No external antagonist; the sea’s indifference and his own silence supply coherent pressure. One meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—reshaping human longing from weariness to wonder—escalates through the lantern’s flare and the glimpse of coral libraries. The tightening is poetic rather than tactical; the cost (her sleepless eternity) is felt but not dramatized as an immediate trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—why some lives catch light—is signaled early and tightened through each sunrise’s micro-epiphanies. The final fabric test forces a trade-off: revelation without explanation. Pressure escalates via pattern intensification rather than causal turns, fitting the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—measuring sorrow via trees—is signaled early and deepens through each dream fragment. One meaningful tightening: she stops repairing and starts mapping, foreclosing the “fix-it” path with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single dominant stake: rekindle communal dreaming. Pressure escalates via accumulating voices joining the song; each new singer tightens the weave, foreclosing silence as an option. The cost is the realm’s relinquishment of isolation, crystallized when the windows crack open.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—self-acceptance vs exile—tightens once when she smooths the invitation; pressure deepens as midnight nears and books shift, but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“permission from the earth to feel sacred again”—is signaled early and tightens through each sensory accrual. The middle deepening occurs when she uncloaks: the wheat-colored dress exposes her to the courtyard’s judgment and re-opens the wound of the vanished bakery. No external antagonist is needed; the pressure is ontological, and the cost is the bread left to rot and the seeds that may never grow.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserve meaning against oblivion—tightens as each vow’s frequency fades; the act of measuring becomes the escalating pressure, culminating in the irreversible dimming of the slide.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—prevent the deal before sunrise—tightens via each failed disguise and the ticking watch. One meaningful turn: fob’s touch ruptures the truce without violence. Agency is listening-as-intervention; cost is the audible snap of trust and the girl’s self-exile into darkness. Pressure escalates under causal lens: each misdirection buys seconds, final act buys silence.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—why humans carry personal weather—is tested through the man’s storm and the forest’s offer of absolution. The tightening occurs when the skeptic realizes the election is about absorbing *him*, not answering her. The cost is the man’s dissolution and her surrender of the compass, both irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—uncork creativity or drown—signaled early and tightened by each remembered face. Agency drives escalation: she kneels, exhales, draws with mind, then with charcoal; cost is the irrevocable release of every stored portrait.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—“to find where lost conversations go”—is signaled early. Mid-story discoveries of unsent letters tighten the pressure and redefine success from ‘find’ to ‘bear witness.’ The final choice forecloses no external threat; risk is internal-existential, which fits the lens yet softens cost.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder’s color—tightens when the child arrives; the tuner’s choice to share the iceberg fragment risks dilution yet ultimately secures transmission. Escalation is subtle: seasons cycle, storms test calibration, but each adjustment forecloses no path except her own eventual absence. Cost is felt in her silent endurance and final disappearance.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—resolve inner static before system collapse—tightens when magnetic shift scrambles irrigation. One decisive burn narrows options and externalizes cost. Pressure grows under Accumulative lens via density of fear-sparks and rose-glow. No off-stage resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: can unspoken grief be safely heard? Pressure tightens each dawn as Leo’s silence lengthens; the fourth-morning door opening is the decisive narrowing of options. Cost is Leo’s public vulnerability and Elara’s surrender of the locket—both on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—liberation through encryption—tightens when each dance step narrows options: reroute vents mislead drones, dice purge cores, final dance collapses the frame. Escalation is driven by Elira’s agency under Accumulative lens; each journal stanza and pirouette increases density until the harmonic implosion. Cost is legible: she forfeits her body to become code.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“find deleted memories”—tightens when the coffee grounds form the whale skeleton, forcing the crossing. One meaningful deepening; cost is the irreversible exit from normal gravity/time.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preventing a sky that forgets dawn—is signaled early and tightened through the summoner’s shift from silencing to listening. Escalation is subtle but coherent under Accumulative lens; the price is quiet endurance rather than visible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: learning to converse with the building. Pressure tightens when the archivist confirms sentience and offers the key—an irreversible step. No external antagonist; conflict is internalized desire colliding with newly revealed possibility. Cost is felt: she trades safety of half-truths for the vault’s unknown sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—translate isolation into independence—signaled in paragraph 6 and tightened once: the vow converts memory into compass, foreclosing the option to keep carrying the shell. Pressure grows via density of recalled images, each a supernova that collapses into unbearable void; the tightening is felt, not declared. Cost is the shell’s silence and her renunciation of return. Agency is archival attention; no external antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure tightens through each stroke of the brush; the scroll’s resistance and the accelerating drip create a single, meaningful escalation culminating in irreversible release.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—return stolen emotional resonance—tightens from legend to personal theft once the shell delivers the final layer. One clear escalation: when “progressive disclosure” reveals entity nesting in nexus, stakes narrow from curiosity to life-mission; the final choice crystallizes cost (voice for song). Coincidence (mute child) complicates but does not resolve. No extraneous reversals, pressure coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—salvage uncorrupted echo—tightens through accumulating dream fragments until the globe’s placement forecloses further haunting. Agency is renunciation/attention with visible cost: the whisperer relinquishes ownership to the ice window. One meaningful deepening suffices for length.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—bearing witness to hidden effort—is signaled early and deepens through each beat. Escalation is accumulative: each whistle, touch, and observation tightens the weave of acknowledgment. Cost is conceptual (fading footprints) but legible. No external antagonist; pressure is situational and internal.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—excavate truth despite danger—tightens when the diamond’s true purpose is confirmed and the plaque reveals larger stakes. Escalation is driven by her decision to plant the gem, narrowing her path from lone seeker to network reassembler. Cost is felt: she trades safety for burden. No coincidence resolves; luck only complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will Elira seed a messy, shadowed dawn or surrender to Kael’s sterile unity—tightens when the child’s cipher arrives. Pressure escalates via accumulating fragments until the harmonic lattice forces a single irrevocable act. Cost is visible: her anonymity and Kael’s monopoly are both breached. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversals required.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—becoming translator—escalates through each jar exchange; the music-box revival is the decisive tightening that proves the method and raises the cost of anonymity. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens: every captured sound increases communal claim on him. Final disappearance is renunciation with felt cost. Could be sharper if one jar failed to work, forcing adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—protect Heartstone from discord—signaled early. Escalation tightens once: metallic sonic harpoon raises cost, forcing her to transmute dissonance into absolution. Agency is harmonic adaptation; price is physical depletion and irreversible shift from engineer to guardian.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—replace conquest with stillness—tightens as each chalk line forecloses the old industrial song. One deepening: soldiers arrive, are disarmed by wonder, retreat. Agency is attention itself; cost is the mapper’s anonymity.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—transmute apology into mechanical heartbeat—tightens when every failed cog raises the probability of permanent silence, forcing the final tactic of surrender to the music’s rhythm. One meaningful deepening: the shift from forcing gears to synchronizing with melody narrows options and charges the closure with audible cost (the heart’s off-beat tick). No coincidence resolves; the storm-light is complication, not solution. Price is persistent: the box will always stutter slightly, keeping him humble.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—“ring the unheard bell”—is signaled early; tension escalates through each transliteration beat until the single trembling note forecloses failure and crystallizes the new possibility at visible effort cost.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—recovering the erased crew—tightens through each recurrence of 07:07; final restore narrows her future to perpetual listening, price paid on-page. Escalation is steady, coincidence only complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—reconstituting courage via empathy—is signaled early and escalates through each mirror encounter; the final tightening is the self-glimpse that forecloses the option of remaining an external peacekeeper. Cost is the surrender of anonymity.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“learn the sound of endings”—tightens when the glacier’s collapse forces a stance crystallization: she chooses transition over termination. Pressure escalates via the audible shear; coincidence (slip on ice) complicates but does not resolve. Cost is the lost marina and forfeited euthanasia path.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—preserve wisdom’s echo—is signaled early and tightened by each conjured clearing; the cost is the walker’s spent focus and ultimate renunciation of access. Pressure is steady but lacks a decisive reversal; the ritual succeeds as planned. Agency is present but not tested against opposition. The escalation is textural—more clearings, more resonance—rather than option-narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: decode patterns of decay. Harmonic interrogation of crystal tightens options until pause/refrain becomes renunciation, changing stance from knowledge to listening. Pressure coherent under Accumulative lens. Late reveal of growth system is abstract; modest deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—capturing the sound of aging—is signaled early and escalates through each chalk screech and fog echo. The final tightening occurs when the prophet hears the “low, wet sigh” and drops the chalk, foreclosing the hunt. Cost is visible: the chalk erodes, memory dissolves, and the prophet walks away empty-handed.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—restructure rather than freeze time—is signaled early. Pressure tightens via the shaking foundations and the hand’s refusal to stop; the leaf-sound reweights options. Cost is felt as surrender of control. No coincidence resolves; the final image crystallizes stakes without external rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reunifying presence with peace—tightens through each mundane hymn; agency is renunciation/witness rather than reversal, cost legible in shard’s dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single dominant stake—"where shadows go at noon"—tightens from curiosity to stewardship under spiraling paradoxes. Tension escalates each night via resonance pulses erasing temporal distortion, narrowing paths to acceptance of sealed awakenings. Agency is repeated choice to wind key despite burns, cost visible on her spine. Lucky coincidence avoided; every complication sourced by spoons and key mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—redemption through recomposition—is signaled early and tightens via the tooth ritual. One meaningful deepening: the discovery of the substitute’s hollowness escalates the cost of belief. Agency is exercised in the decision to plant the tooth; coincidence does not resolve. The price (accepting irreparable loss) is visible in the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“share light without fire”—tightens through each polishing beat; the glass’s growing clarity is the visible escalation. One meaningful deepening: when droplets fracture dimness into constellations, the option of private grief is foreclosed; communal witness becomes inevitable. Cost is felt in her bodily surrender and permanent silence.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—transforming public shame into private sanctuary—tightens through each sensory beat. The pattern of thaw-drip spirals provides the single deepening that narrows options toward the burial act. Cost is visible in the relinquishing of the confession printout.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—“to collect the shapes of different hopes”—is signaled early and deepens through each cameo. The tightening is the refusal to capture them, but the price (unfinished manuscript) is more abstract than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—restore forgotten song—tightens through each refrain; the vine’s glow is the visible price. One meaningful deepening suffices, but the cost is more luminous than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—retrieve safekept starlight—escalates through ritual precision; each discarded item raises the ante until the map pulses beneath her palms, a visible price paid in blood and exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—bearing others’ burdens—tightens when the weaver must bear her own. One meaningful deepening: after calcifying the father’s letter, she turns the lamp inward. Cost is felt in the hush that “settles over her,” narrowing future options to perpetual service.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—how to hold grief without being devoured—is signaled early and tightened when she risks the first irreversible cut. Agency is renunciation: letting the kettle scream itself dry forecloses comfort and crystallizes the cost of attention. Escalation is textural—each shaving narrows options until the carving becomes the only vessel left. The price (scorched pot, damp sleeves, irreversible act) is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reconciliation with ghost—tightens when camera is demanded. One deepening: ghost mimes adjusting lens, forcing shift from collecting others’ ghosts to facing own regret. Cost is relinquishing camera and accepting “frame, not fix.” No coincidence resolves conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—can decay be rechanneled into habitation—tightens when geothermal steam offers either hazard or warmth. Escalation is one deepening: each redirection (steam, light, footfall) raises the cost of failure and widens communal stakes. No external antagonist; pressure is systemic. The felt price is perpetual upkeep—walls still crack, slope persists—visible in the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reconciling with the abandoned dream—tightens once when the droplet blooms on the score. Pressure is textural but unmistakable: the clocks’ softening is the felt cost. Agency is renunciation rather than action, fitting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—understand lies, not catch them—tightens when the locket forces choice: expose or honor the scratched-out face. One meaningful deepening: realization that architecture shelters the liar, not the victim, narrows options and reweights cost. Agency is attention/renunciation rather than confrontation; price is the forfeiture of “proof” as victory. Pressure coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: preservation of living craft. Pressure tightens as silence and snow accumulate; the “storm’s eye” knot becomes the decisive micro-turn that crystallizes readiness. Cost is the collector’s prior certainty—she now carries the rope’s weight, not just seeds.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—mapping absence to keep the gone present—is signaled early and tightens through each obituary beat. The final crane-folding is a meaningful deepening that forecloses the option of forgetting; cost is visible in the thread’s glow and the traveler’s renunciation of hope. Agency remains with the traveler; no coincidence resolves tension. Slight abstraction in “geography of healing” softens visceral bite.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“reawaken beauty”—is signaled early and tightened through each experiment. One decisive deepening: the egg’s glow re-tunes the world’s frequency, foreclosing the mechanical status quo. Cost is visible: prince’s frayed tunic, dented crown, acid-scarred lungs. No coincidence resolves; agency drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can she graft her father’s wild mercy onto her disciplined compassion—tightens once: the coin’s descent forces a public witness and audible cost. Pressure is coherent, no extraneous reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—liberation of trapped memories—is signaled in paragraph four and tightened when the box clicks open, foreclosing the option to remain detached. Pressure grows accumulatively: each breadcrumb increases density until the geese listen and the city’s silence flips from absence to presence. The price is the box’s emptied weight and her transition from observer to midwife. No causal antagonist is needed; the conflict is between forgetting and witnessing.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—break the generational pattern of burning to be bright—escalates through each pulse and petal, culminating in the gear’s quiet radiance. The tightening is present but diffuse; the cost is poetic rather than sharply material.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake: how to transmute communal grief into living stone. Escalation is incremental—each new ribbon and ghost-guided stroke tightens the obligation to keep carving. The final crimson ribbon crystallizes the cost: perpetual service. No external antagonist; pressure is the accumulating weight of names and poems.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restoring communal balance vs. personal absolution—tightens once: the storm-fractured rake forces Elias to choose between mechanical certainty and human grace. Agency is clear; the cost is the surrender of his 43-year identity, legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“will she keep the dead neatly silent or awaken their unfinished voices?”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightens when the first thread burns umber beneath her finger. Each decoded knot forecloses the comfort of anonymity; the seafoam strand’s sigh costs her tears and forfeits the lullaby habit. Agency is continuous: she pulls, hums, threads her own dusk-yarn. No external coincidence; pressure is purely accumulative density. Cost is legible (sovereign case grows heavy, silo exhales), but a second tightening beat could push it to 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“seed innovation within constraint”—is signaled early and tightened by the physical limits of ink, weather, and parchment. One meaningful deepening occurs as the parchment begins to hum, foreclosing abstraction and demanding action.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“teach dust to tell stories”—escalates from transcription to resurrection to transmission. One tightening: pirate song about her forces the tear-price, crystallizing her agency. Cost is felt (singed thumb, blurred ink) and forecloses anonymity.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—crystallizing emotion before it evaporates—is signaled early and tightened when the woman’s recognition forces the scatterer to witness the cost of her ritual. Escalation is accumulative: each ash layer deepens the gallery’s silence until the chair stops. Agency is renunciation—she sits motionless, accepting the silence. Cost is felt but could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—memory versus erasure—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens through each salvaged object. The final act (placing the cog, whispering coordinates) is an endurance that forecloses reintegration; cost is the perpetual exile acknowledged in the last descent. Pressure escalates by density, not causality, fitting the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake: will the last student return? Pressure escalates via silence thickening, footsteps absorbed, leaf about to fall. Agency crystallizes in Elara’s low hum—an act of endurance that risks permanent obscurity. Cost is the acceptance of remaining unheard if no one comes; closure reweights that risk into possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—create beauty from ruin—tightens once when Elara chooses to water the seed with her own memory, narrowing options. Pressure grows under Accumulative lens: each vine surrendered feeds the sapling. Cost is visible in the irreversible gift of personal memory. No external antagonist needed; internal conflict suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder versus disclosing truth—tightens when the woman’s riddle forces Elias to choose revelation or secrecy. Agency: he selects the ladder ascent, trading immediate explanation for experiential awe. Escalation is one deepening beat, not multiple reversals, but the cost (shared secret, generational burden) is unmistakable. Coincidence (her grandfather’s box) complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—freeing the trapped cottage—is signaled early and tightened by the shard’s placement. Agency is ritual action, not confrontation; pressure deepens as the hush thickens and the ghost house “unclenches.” Cost is the shard’s dissolution and the irreversible farewell. One meaningful intensification suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: surface certainty vs. fluid truth. One tightening—shattering the ampoule—forces the historian to accept cascading revelations. Cost is visible: the statue dissolves, the historian’s career narrative collapses. Agency is hers; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“capture the texture of what might have been”—is signaled in paragraph three and escalates via each failed proof and rolled die. The 37-step landings provide rhythmic tightening; the liquid-glass moment forces a stance crystallization: continue without the relic. Cost is visible: the die disappears, the past is metabolized, and the climb becomes the only remaining path.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—proving encoded kindness can awaken empathy—is signaled early and tightened through each glyph’s ripple effect. Escalation is accumulative: each painting widens the circle of influence. The final beat forces a choice: keep the ritual private or share it. Cost is felt in the loss of sole authorship.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—rescue of dying arts—tightens from whispered histories to communal performance. Each loaf, each reclaimed instrument raises the cost of failure. The boy’s hidden snare triggers the decisive intensification; no coincidence resolves, only accumulated courage.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“step beyond fate’s design”—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens through each beat: yoyo decoded, mainspring forged, gear lifted at cost of lighthouse’s integrity. One meaningful escalation: the moment the gear is lifted, options narrow irreversibly; no coincidence resolves. Cost is visible—stone to ash, tower cracked.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—trick fear into revealing weakness—tightens once via the paradoxical notes and the unbosom act. Agency drives escalation; cost is the self-extraction of toxic memories. One decisive tightening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—truth vs national myth—tightens once via the letter’s reveal; the price is lifelong vilification accepted by the historian. Escalation stays causal under own agency; no external reversals break pressure. Secondary accent (spring timing) not dramatized here.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—translating drowned absence into remembered presence—tightens as ink runs low and the pavilion decays. One deepening: discovery of the bride’s letter forces Elara to confront her own renunciation of detachment, paid with the inkwell’s final drops. Escalation is accumulative, not causal, yet the cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—preserve truth vs civic erasure—sharpened by the Master Index’s last inscription. One tightening when the stamped notation replaces anonymity with accountability. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, slightly muting felt price against the scope of submerged city.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve vs release the recorded dreams—tightens once: the basilica’s new key forces the dirge and shattering. Cost is visible in the lanterns’ destruction and the shadow’s satiation.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—cartography of lost futures—is signaled early and tightens through each simulation collapse; the final burn forecloses return, paying a visible price. Pressure escalates via algorithmic overload and cooling capacitors, not external antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—“frequency of belonging”—escalates from external search to internal resonance; visions force a visible trade-off (shedding pilot identity). One meaningful tightening suffices; cost is felt in her stillness at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—truth’s unbearable weight—tightens once: the carving’s revelation forces irrevocable redefinition of self and vocation. Cost is visceral (vomit, dissolved relics, silent watch). No external antagonist needed; internal pressure suffices and escalates under Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—can two former adversaries trade ghosts instead of prisoners—tightens once when relics change hands. Agency is negotiator’s choice to proceed without guarantees; cost is the relinquished talisman and the unspoken names. No coincidence resolves the tension; pressure remains coherent under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—coherence vs. collapse—escalates via each pole waypoint and the washer talisman. One decisive tightening: turning back to the kayak after Pole Seven forecloses passive regret. Cost is felt in the relinquished certainty of “true north.”

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—manufacture empathy—tightens when submerged memories bloom. One decisive turn: releasing the baseball, which forecloses retrieval and forces internal change. Pressure escalates via fractal ripples, not external antagonist. Cost is conceptual but legible: the seeker trades certainty for raw feeling.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reforge bond beyond death—signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened when spices soften reality’s edges, foreclosing retreat. Escalation is textural: each aroma adds density until refusal would shatter the spell, so agency shifts to surrender. Cost is legible: she exits “something in-between,” implying permanent translational existence. No external antagonist, but internal pressure suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost time—tightens once: the saucer’s fracture widens into a portal, forcing the choice to enter and release rather than reclaim; the price (permanent surrender of those moments) is felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—reunion via nonviolent persistence—tightens through escalating calibration: too heavy shatters the gate, too light loses her forever. The photograph’s joy-tear supplies the exact frequency, forcing a final trade-off: Tear for passage. Pressure coheres under causal lens; no coincidence resolves. Cost is visible when the ship sighs and the relic vanishes.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—understanding transformation—tightens as each bug reconfigures her interior and the world. Agency is renunciation/acceptance; cost is the unlived life she reabsorbs. No external antagonist needed; pressure is situational and accumulative. One deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“spark a silent revolution”—is signaled early; pressure tightens through blackout and guard proximity, forcing precise timing of the coded angles. One meaningful deepening: blackout lifts just as she finishes, underscoring irreversibility. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, keeping score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—transforming curse into wonder—tightens through each placement of painted stones; agency is visible, cost is the surrender of predictive certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserving the last uncensored poem—tightens through ritualized delay. The pressure deepens when the timer hits zero and she still refuses; the cost is the perpetual suspension of voice. Agency is renunciation, not action, and the price is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—recover the lost overture—tightens when the 11:03 shadow angle triggers the decisive alignment.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—beauty from anarchy—tightens when the smuggled poem replaces coins in the tin, forcing her from passive carrier to active planter. One meaningful deepening: candle lit beneath the poem turns remembrance into endangerment, seeds pressed into dust turn memory into future risk. Cost is visible (arrest risk, emotional exposure). Escalation is accumulative rather than causal, fitting the lens; no reversal, but the final lullaby crystallizes stance. Sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—fracture destiny’s script—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened by each harmonic risk. The final chord forecloses the path back to 11:53; the price is the lover’s film reel and the unknown future. Escalation is causal: every modulation raises the cost (hailstone fugue, prismatic spray, ticking clock). No coincidences resolve; the laughter arrives as earned consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—protect cultural memory from monsoon erosion—is signaled in paragraph three and tightened by the early bloom. Agency: Aris chooses Elira, plants the seed, accepts doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—diffusing unspoken apologies—tightens through each traced stitch; the color’s rising gradient is the escalating pressure. Agency is ritual action that forecloses hoarding regret. One clear reversal: the needle’s stillness signals task complete and path closed.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (purpose in pauses) tightens through protagonist's agency—daily frost study leads to synchrony discovery. Cost is legible in "subtracting noise" and shattered glass fusion, though smugglers' "mercy" revelation edges toward convenient coincidence rather than pure agency.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.9)

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through Accumulative escalation: intern's arrival crystallizes the garden's consent vs. compliance conflict, narrowing options to refusal.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist’s agency (mirroring gestures), but opposition lacks active resistance beyond environmental pressure. Cost ("lungs empty") is palpable, though escalation remains atmospheric rather than confrontational under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes (orchestrating hope) are clear but pressure never tightens; the storm arrival is coincidental rather than a meaningful deepening, and no visible cost alters Elias's tactics despite his "orchestration" claims.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through Lira’s agency (graffiti reorganizing space), with conceptual cost legible in "privatization stalls... postponed," yet escalation lacks a narrowing trade-off—her methods succeed too smoothly against corporate scouts, missing a tangible loss (e.g., a mural defaced) to deepen pressure before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stake (bearing witness) tightens via the 04:57 countdown and vacuum mechanics, narrowing options to endurance. Cost legible in "throat tight" when realizing message is undecodable. Agency is quiet but potent—her outlasting forecloses leaving early.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through Elira’s agency—her prophecy-triggered pivot from archiving to activation narrows options to a single, resonant choice (releasing petals), with cost legible in the businessman’s unexplained smile, fulfilling short-form escalation demands.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes deepen through sensory accumulation (textures → echoes → accumulated moments), narrowing options via Vey's choice to curate rather than fix time. Cost is visceral (reconnected heartbeat), but the "sudden timeless" trait lacks mid-beat tradeoffs despite clear climax payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten via Elira’s agency: grief’s "hardening" crystallizes into tangible rupture (ruined kite), narrowing options to reframing loss; cost is visible in the boy’s initial paralysis, but escalation lacks one additional deepening beat for 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.4)

    Dominant stake (belonging vs. memory pain) tightens when the feather dissolves, forcing the stone to crack open.

Escalation via sensory density reweights options under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist's escalating agency: refracting strangers' regrets evolves to raw self-confession, narrowing options to "carrying broken pieces" with visible cost in the spire's shuddering dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes tighten relentlessly via protagonist agency: "running out of air" forces temporal pressure, narrowing options to final tear-lacquer application. Cost is unmistakable in the workshop’s near-collapse and the alchemist’s literal breathlessness during revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.2)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency: preserving "small eternal weights" against cultural amnesia culminates in writing covenant clauses that reframe loss as active resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.2)
    Single dominant stake (curing loneliness via reciprocity) tightens through Elara’s agency: her "Tell me, and I’ll tell you mine after" forces mutual vulnerability.

No redundant loops; pressure coheres to a single deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.1)

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.6)
    Stakes crystallize immediately ("abandon creatures vs become complicit"), with accumulation-driven escalation: each pigment blend deepens resolve.

    Stakes crystallize through quiet escalation: internal conflict (bitterness vs. contentment) tightens via reflection density, not external pressure. Cost legible in "refused to let [wound] define soul's shape" and enduring caretaking role. Lacks visible trade-off for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake (certainty vs. nuance) tightens via chime sequences forcing single decisive action. Cost is visceral (trembling exposure) and professional (clients walking away); agency entirely protagonist-driven with "velvet thing" struggle narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through Elira’s withholding agency: the stone toss forces Kael’s shift from "Why?" to revelation, narrowing options via the grotto’s humming constraint. Cost is felt in her grief over lost colleagues, visible when "her younger face betrayed none of the grief."

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes tighten through the flock's thermals: the pulse's arrival narrows options to stillness-as-direction, with cost legible when the skimmer "felt the pulse nestle into its chest cavity" beside the arrowhead.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (authentic magic vs. sterile automation) tightens when mist-walking forces surrender—a meaningful deepening where Lior’s hesitation ("failed every trust-based ritual") collides with the keystone’s pulse. Cost is visceral: his entire identity shifts from chasing grandeur to "crooked runes," shown through the glyph-engines’ indifference. Agency drives escalation; coincidence (drones) complicates but doesn’t resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully when vow predating birth forecloses search path, but escalation lacks physical cost during dive—water’s resistance feels atmospheric rather than actively narrowing options under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes escalate through the unbidden static vision—a deepening rather than reversal—that transforms "distilling meaning" from passive reception to active creation, with the conceptual cost of realizing her choices were never random, narrowing options toward celebration.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake (confronting nameless fear) tightens through the naming ritual, narrowing options to this singular act. Cost is unmistakable in the weeping climax: "the echo of sacrifice was not hers alone—it was his, too." Agency drives every deepening beat under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (erase vs honor memory) tightens through Elias's agency: photograph trail deepens knowledge, locals' arrival forces stance crystallization. Cost is unmistakable—career risk for communal truth—but escalation lacks one tangible mid-beat tradeoff (e.g., discarding an order).

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stake (harmonizing logic/intuition) tightens through protagonist’s agency: starling patterns guide flame’s "surrender," transmuting crystal not via calculation but resonance. Cost legible in "altered soul’s architecture" and journal’s hidden script—rigor’s veneer now permeable to awe.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (defeating numbness) tightens via Kael’s silent endurance, narrowing options to balance as solution. Cost is unmistakable: "warmth return to his chest—not the heat of ego." Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, but secondary "custody battle" slightly dilutes singular focus.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes signaled early: safeguarding grotesque innovation. Escalation via Aris' agency—designing rooms, nightly vigil—deepens under Accumulative lens. Conceptual cost unmistakable in journal's reframing, though visceral cost slightly abstract. One tightening (seed sprouting sideways) sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist’s iterative actions ("Too sharp... Too slow"), but the dominant stake (suffocation vs. creation) lacks a concrete on-page price beyond psychological reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten via lunar perigee deadline and her discarding assumptions, narrowing options to a single resonant choice; cost is unmistakable in the fragment's dissolution and prior "seven cycles" of failure, though escalation could deepen the physical toll slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes deepen through pattern-mapping; cost crystallizes in "didn’t sleep. Didn’t eat much" though escalation lacks one tangible forfeiture beyond stamina.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten when mirrors reflect alternate selves, forcing her to prioritize discovery over safety. Agency-driven escalation peaks with the ceiling split, but resistance from the gallery feels slightly abstract—cost is emotional (sorrow/satisfaction) yet lacks tangible tradeoffs like lost memories.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stake (navigating alien-altered stars) tightens through Kael’s "What if we get lost?" forcing Elira’s thematic resolution. Escalation driven by her agency (using chain as teaching tool), with conceptual cost (abandoning static worldview) legible in "unfolded horizons" redefinition.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stake (waiting vs. moving on) tightens through the pulse’s escalation from "stuttered, surged" to panicked flutter, narrowing options. Tracer’s counter-pulse broadcast drives the deepening, with cost legible in her kneeling endurance and the girl’s tearful realization. Hairline slip: tracer’s personal cost (emotional labor) isn’t foregrounded as sharply as the girl’s.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes (honoring forgotten) signaled early; tidal clock creates meaningful deepening. Escalation driven by environmental pressure rather than active protagonist choices (she executes grandfather's plan), slightly weakening agency under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake (retrieving wisdom from system failure) signals early, but conflict lacks teeth—ghosts plead rather than resist, and escalation relies solely on ink bloom’s deepening without narrowing options or raising visceral stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: diamond’s hunger forces selective resonance-feeding, narrowing options to "let it gorge on noise." Cost is legible as veins "conducting sound... so it would not vanish again." Pressure grows via flock’s evolving patterns (spirals → braids → glyphs), but escalation lacks one palpable mid-beat sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes tighten when arrowhead vibration causes boots to lose purchase, forcing Elara’s decisive SEND press. Cost is visceral (physical disorientation) but the bitterness-to-hope shift could deepen earlier; Moira’s "cosmos stole it" line salvages conceptual weight at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: "resonantly soft" pressure seeps into statues’ vigilance, narrowing options as moss cracks and saplings sprout. Cost is legible in blistered fingers and the shell’s dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes ("beauty left incomplete is a wound") escalate through density increase: mist thickens as he sings, culminating in carousel's movement. Cost legible in "bones hummed" and silence becoming song. Single deepening suffices for length.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation driven entirely by librarian's agency: whispering the axiom narrows options to irreversible entry. Cost is unmistakable in the scarf's glow and her emotional labor ("remind them they were loved").

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stake (reclaiming the dream) tightens via her agency: mixing the light hues narrows options to one final attempt. Cost is legible in "indigo of surrender"—she stops searching. Escalation is accumulative (density of light-harvesting) with no coincidences; the dream's traces deepen pressure organically.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.5)
    Escalation through accumulating pressure: cosmic hum → fractured moonstone → star-guided thread → weeping mirror reflections. Agency tightens options via locksmith's micro-choices (withdrawing ribbons), but fear's cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.4)
    Escalation driven by protagonist’s agency: placing mushroom under skylight triggers climax. Cost unmistakable in "let the orchard take the rest," narrowing options to stark sacrifice. One tightening suffices, perfectly calibrated to length.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    Escalation via the "hush" moment tightens stakes—when the swing’s absence forces the library to "listen hardest," the archivist’s exile flickers, narrowing her options to precise tea-leaf annotation under palpable cost ("void between seconds").

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes (preserving wonder’s color) are clear and urgent, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven tightening; the weaving ritual deepens texture without narrowing options or forcing trade-offs. Cost is conceptual (fading wonder) yet feels distant from Elira’s immediate actions.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.2)
    Stakes escalate through the blackened knot’s "scream," narrowing options to life-or-death moral choice ("I cut the line"). Cost is visceral: "weight lifting from the air" and the fisherman’s hollow eyes fading inward. Single tightening suffices for Accumulative lens, but secondary stake (self-preservation vs. duty) lacks deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.6)
    Dominant stake ("to hear what stones refused to speak") tightens through footage comparisons into shadow's spiral. Agency in waiting for dusk crystallizes stance with visceral cost. Pressure grows via pattern break (organic spiral vs mathematical). Slight deduction: external conflict resolves neater than emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist’s agency: analytic resistance to "letting go" forecloses path via physical decline (stopping eating/sleeping), culminating in earned renunciation with visible cost (hollowness); lunar perigee mechanic slightly overcomplicates pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stake (being understood) tightens via protagonist agency: spraying gold arcs after ghost’s "I WILL HOLD THE NOTES" forecloses isolation. Cost is visceral vulnerability in "tinkersong wonder" tears, legible under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes deepen through accumulation: "joy beneath anguish" evolves from abstract mission to embodied truth via vellum’s "quiet companion" revelation. Cost crystallizes when she absorbs "encrypted grief" as warmth seeping through wool—visible price paid in perspective shift.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (proving emptiness remembers) tightens through cloud classifications; #112’s dissolution forces memorialization as renunciation of doubt. Cost is visceral in "scent of pine and unfinished conversations," though secondary conflict with colleagues lacks on-page escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.4)
    Escalation driven by protagonist agency: tactile revelation ("discovered its limit") deepens knowledge, narrowing options to urgent communion. Cost legible in "palms stained" and erased art, tightening pressure under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=9.3)
    Single dominant stake (controlling luminance for discovery) tightens through Arlen's agency: his three-night research narrows options to a decisive presentation. Visible cost in "trembling hands" during the captain confrontation alters tactics, making the crew's chalk-grid adoption feel earned rather than convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes deepen organically as mirrors force confrontation with past failures, narrowing her options to understanding over fixing; the cost—surrendering the apron’s light—is visible and thematically resonant, though the internal conflict’s escalation could feel more urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes tighten through collective agency: chalk messages narrow options to bell-ringing, with cost paid in the orchard’s "pride" (not loss). Escalation driven by Elira’s orchestration—Kael’s bell lift shifts from hesitation to action. Nebula’s arrival hinges on unity, avoiding coincidence; the "brambled but blooming" hope embodies trade-offs between risk and sanctuary.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation is driven entirely by protagonist agency: turning the spindle "slow as glacier drift" tightens pressure by thickening the hush into "viscous, golden" membrane. The cost—civilizations pausing mid-moment—is viscerally felt in "gulls hung frozen in descent, their cries suspended like dew."

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes tighten credibly around the frost deadline and ghost chorus, but the guidance method executes flawlessly without visible trade-offs or tactical costs, missing the 8.8+ requirement for a price that alters later moves.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.5)
    Dominant stake (reframing grief) tightens through river observation: "foam cells collapse and coalesce" shifts her from "blaming the hospital" to "graceful dissolution" design. Cost legible in changed tactics (sketching geometries vs measuring pH) and emotional vulnerability ("tears" integrated as musical element).

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation driven by vendor's agency: seven quantified sales narrow options toward distributing her burden. Cost unmistakable in ledger's "12 grams of unsaid words" and her realization that weight distribution—not reduction—brings lightness.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.3)
    Single dominant stake (transforming remorse) tightens through Elira's agency: her "sanding" action narrows options from avoidance to absorption. Cost ("skin burned with borrowed heartbreak") visibly alters tactics for cooking's new purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes tighten through Elara’s language-layering method, with agency crystallizing in the suspended cuckoo weight’s harmonic cascade; escalation culminates in the elevator’s vocal progression (Ukrainian → Rumi → English) and visible cost in "shaking loose decades of silence."

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation driven by agency under Accumulative lens: memory flood triggers deliberate collision/recombination ("alchemize" child’s dream with her thesis). Dominant stake (resurrecting latent energy) tightens via synaptic rewiring choice, narrowing options to modification not mourning. Cost crystallized in "rewired grief" heartbeat and "museum of salvaged dreams" commitment. Single deepening suffices for length.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through agency-driven threshold challenges (water curtain → root bridge), narrowing options to location revelation. Cost legible in sealed chamber—knowledge preserved but physical vault lost—under Causal escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation via Silas’s agency: analyzing cracks shapes the resonance chamber, turning fracture into frequency. The cost—his transformation from creator to created—is unmistakable in the grove’s irreversible awakening and his tears of recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes tighten through magnetic surge and eclipse countdown, but "correlate silence" mechanism remains abstract; cost crystallizes in "too late... just in time" line yet lacks tangible trade-off beyond conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stake tightening through frequency layers narrows options to a single decisive choice; cost legible in "reverence" amid chaos. Minor deduction: pressure lacks visible tactical shift during escalation beats.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten through the corpse flower's dormancy breaking at collective clarity, narrowing Elira's path to observation over intervention; cost is legible in the bloom's decay and village transformation, though the tide's "thought turning" lacks tangible pressure escalation before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=9.3)
    Temporal pressure of gravity inversion ("minutes" left) narrows options, driving the deepening where agency (jamming arrow into tree) transforms stakes. Cost is undeniable: "not to pilot... but to echo with it" forecloses her prior identity.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (certifying wonder) tightens through sensory escalation, but opposition ("cities trading silence for sirens") stays abstract. Pressure coheres via aurora-guided strikes, yet the cost remains conceptual—no tangible loss (e.g., physical toll, sacrificed opportunity)—weakening the escalation's visceral impact despite lyrical precision.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes deepen through protagonist’s agency: each realm’s collapse reveals distinct failure mode. Cost crystallizes in "let failures be honored" with visible consequence (flute abandoned). One tightening suffices for length.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (mapping unmappable emotions) clear, but escalation lacks tightening: "last star vanishing" feels atmospheric, not earned narrowing of options. No visible price paid mid-story (e.g., fragment dimming should cost her a pamphlet). Warlord's change proves stakes but occurs off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (deliver casket vs share wonder) tightens meaningfully at ridgeway fork; courier’s agency in choosing Hollow Market narrows options with felt cost (relinquishing pendant). Pressure accumulates through sensory escalation under textural lens, no coincidence resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake (message delivery) tightens via protagonist agency: solstice timing forces crystallization of stance. Cost unmistakable in dissolving memories ("scent of his cloak transmuted into glyphs") and physical vanishing. Pressure accumulates through harmonic resonance altering gravity (blossoms falling upward).

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes escalate through silk’s thinning—a visible price narrowing Arlo’s options until the final glyph hold. Agency drives deepening: "willingly given, thread by thread" forecloses preservation, with cost made legible in its gratitude glow.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.4)
    Escalation driven by protagonist agency through shard vibrations narrowing options; cost crystallizes in Sigma-7 as erased existence, reweighted by the archival chamber discovery with undeniable felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (preserving connection against grief) tightens via lamp outage forcing stone ritual. Agency is clear, but escalation leans on coincidence (light failure) rather than pure protagonist-driven pressure under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes signaled early ("steer the world’s dreaming edge"), but pressure lacks deepening—stars’ "unusual urgency" prompts identical ritual response, failing to narrow options or change knowledge; cost ("spent but smiling") is visible but not escalated by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.5)
    Stakes deepen through protagonist agency as she shifts from wing analysis to studying the old man, narrowing options toward authentic fracture-cultivation; cost is unmistakable in the fabric's emotional detonation and patrons' visceral reactions.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.6)
    Single dominant stake (can sorrow be mapped?) deepens when sextant shifts from measuring stars to measuring grief, narrowing options to "follow it." Cost is visible in worker's transformed identity: "She wasn’t fixing anything anymore. She was remembering for them." Perfect Accumulative escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (communal song loss causing realm collapse) signaled immediately and escalates through keeper's humming inviting participation. Protagonist agency drives pressure via "invitation not demand," narrowing options to resonance. Cost crystallizes in the mica's "crack—not destruction, but release"—visceral yet conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.3)
    Single dominant stake (reconciling "unorthodox empathy" with societal rejection) deepens through midnight’s deadline. Pressure coheres via Accumulative escalation: handling the invitation shifts her from "shame and fury" to recognizing empathy as "fiercely clarifying," with cost crystallized in the library’s physical reordering—a visible reconfiguration of exile into sanctuary.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake (feeling sacred again) tightens through her shift from passive offering to active gardening. Cost is visceral in "crust hardened like old promises" and shawl removal, though bakery reflection slightly over-clarifies the stake’s origin.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (preserving meaning against oblivion) tightens as slide fades ("colors bleeding into gray"). Elira’s agency drives escalation—her precise measurements against time’s erosion—culminating in the forgiveness vow’s conceptual cost ("recalibrated the entire Array"). Pressure coheres perfectly under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes (breaking truce before sunrise) tighten through daughter’s agency: false starts buy seconds, fob deployment narrows options. Cost is conceptual—irreversible trust collapse—legible in the silence. Escalation driven by Accumulative lens: sensory density peaks at recognition. Minor flaw: "sunrise" timeframe’s urgency slightly undersold versus tide motif.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.1)
    Escalation driven by protagonist's mental visualization deepening pressure; "slow thrum of earth’s forgotten songs" tightens options. Cost unmistakable in sizzling tears and dissolved faces, reweighting stakes through auroral ink.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes escalate through protagonist's agency: wilting reverses only when reading unsent letters, proving truth's physical cost. Dominant stake (recovering lost conversations) narrows to bearing witness, with "toxic sky" imposing conceptual price on the final archive.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes deepen through atmospheric pressure harmonization ("turning chaos into cadence"), with child interaction crystallizing the cost of wonder's fragility; agency manifests as endurance where renunciation (stopping climbs) forecloses her physical presence with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.1)
    Escalation via magnetic shift deepening and static cracking louder narrows options to the burn; protagonist’s agency in igniting fears reweights stakes through visible cost—flames transmuting dread into light that alters its very being (bioluminescent traceries).

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=9.1)
    Escalation via accumulative deepening: four dawns of humming narrow options toward Leo's weeping. Stakes (unresolved grief) viscerally materialize through the locket's humming and his "breath hitched." Agency-driven under accumulative lens with felt cost in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through Elira’s agency: redirecting coolant buys time, dice rolls escalate pressure by awakening subs. Cost is legible in her sacrifice ("she didn’t board") and the conceptual price of collapse-as-harmony. Single deepening (final dance) suffices, reweighting liberation as resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stake (finding memory's location) tightens through Elira's agency: aster placement triggers doorway. Cost is visceral in suspended tears and whale's glowing bones. Perfect escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist agency when the whisper reconfigures the prophecy from doom to plea, narrowing options to endurance. Cost is legible in "damp with dew and resolve"—the burden of returning nightly—but could resonate more viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.4)
    Stakes tighten through reciprocal revelation ("gargoyles weep before storms" to basement vault), narrowing options via protagonist’s agency. Cost legible in physical weight of seal/key; single deepening suffices for length.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes (inherited guilt vs. redemption) tighten through textural escalation: drips accelerate, scroll resists, aurora flares—all narrowing options via sensory pressure. Cost (anonymity) is viscerally legible in "kingdom would never know her name." Deduction because the drought-sin rule isn't dramatized beyond the scroll rewrite.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (unraveling echo theft) tightens through protagonist's progressive disclosure, narrowing options to singing as solution. Cost legible in raw throat and emotional shift, though escalation lacks one felt price altering mid-scene tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (delivering the child's message) signaled early via "windows of connection," but pressure lacks visible escalation within the shrine scene. Deepening occurs through dream analysis, yet the cost—"release"—remains abstract until the final beat. Agency is clear (placing the globe in the frame), but the single-scene design limits tactical narrowing; cost legibility arrives late ("sigh echoes... release").

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stake ("appreciate hidden effort") tightens via widow’s memory and firefly response. Agency manifests in "demure audacity" choices—whistling her name, weaving shanty with fireflies—narrowing options to witness rather than escape. Cost is felt in vanishing footprints yet fireflies tracing moon paths in her honor.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.9)
    Pressure tightens through knowledge deepening (shredded letters revealing Project Stillpoint), narrowing options to truth-seeking. The cost is visceral: trembling shifts from "thrill of near-discovery" to sorrow when realizing the cover-up. Dominant stake (truth vs. control) crystallizes without coincidence resolving it.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation driven by Elira’s agency—decoding fragments to singing—narrows options as rebels find her. Cost is unmistakable: Kael’s “hollow-eyed” followers vs. her “mud, static” dawn. Single tightening suffices for length.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.4)
    Escalation via deepening: "gleaned redemption" shifts from abstract to embodied cost when he leaves jars anonymously, narrowing options to pure legacy. Stake ("translator between generations") signaled early, with visible price in his death; pressure tightens through the schoolgirl encounter’s crystallized wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: scavenger attack forces vibrational singing as sole option. Cost legible in physical collapse; "fleeting sunset" clock intensifies pressure without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes deepen through the mapper's agency (aligning viaduct with moon paths), but pressure lacks a tangible mid-beat reversal; the regime's retreat feels earned yet slightly passive, missing one visible tactical cost before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=9.5)
    Stakes crystallize through deepening: electrocution reconfigured as "rupture in memory-field" narrows options to documentation despite dismissal, with visceral cost in ancestral dread absorption and etched names.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: rejected cogs and escapement failures narrow options until the light-triggered realization forces realignment. Cost legible in "years preaching forgiveness yet never granted it to himself," though storm-light deus ex machina slightly dilutes escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes tighten through Zeta's agency: the kaleidoscope's accelerating spin forces vocal strain ("voice cracked"), narrowing options until the final spiral. Cost is visceral in her slumped posture and cooling arrow tip, reweighting the "whisper for the next one" under Accumulative escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.2)
    Stakes viscerally tighten as 0707 evolves from coincidence to coordinates to ritual trigger, driven entirely by protagonist agency. Cost—"documented nothing. Reported less"—unmistakably alters tactics, with silence itself becoming the dominant pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation via Accumulative density (creak of hulls → glacier sigh) narrows Elara’s focus to the threshold moment. Cost is legible in her post-closure actions (declining euthanasia, hospice work), though the "trawl" metaphor slightly softens tangible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—whether mismatched love can be redefined—tightens through Elias's vine analogy ("They don't match... but together they bear fruit"), narrowing options from "failure" to "mattered." Cost is visceral: Mara's emotional shift from "arms crossed" to taking his hand. Agency entirely character-driven under accumulative lens; one hairline slip in Mara's rapid emotional shift.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (preserving wisdom) is clear and resonant, but conflict lacks authentic pressure—dunes' "jealousy" and murmuring remain atmospheric rather than testing commitment with escalating cost or meaningful trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully when the crystal’s question forces confrontation with the present’s unknown; the cost is visible in her renunciation of transcription for dialogue, driven by agency under the Accumulative lens as sonic density peaks into conceptual reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten through ritual precision of driftwood triangulation, but escalation lacks protagonist agency beyond repetition. Cost ("decay felt like his own") is visceral yet the pressure buildup feels atmospheric rather than decision-driven under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes deepen through "shaking foundations" to cosmic dissonance, but the dominant "restructure time" goal lacks tangible trade-offs; cost feels conceptual rather than tactical until the braiding climax.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes deepen via scent density: "thickened" hope becomes "tasted," narrowing Elara's mission from singing to dissolving. Pressure tightens through auditory accumulation (IV drips → teacup clinks → lullabies), yet agency lacks escalation—no live option foreclosed until vinyl dissolves. Cost legibility in final image saves from mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation driven entirely by protagonist agency: nightly rituals narrow options from observation to embodiment. Cost unmistakable in closure—her eternal duty ("key warm in her pocket") reconfigures the dominant stake with conceptual price paid on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.4)
    Stakes deepen accumulatively: hollow chest cavity shatters the town's myth, narrowing options to recomposition.

Escalation driven by her method, not coincidence; cost unmistakable in final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation via Accumulative density: each ritual (proffering nectar, tracing icicle patterns) deepens reclamation stakes until burying the confession forecloses erasure. Cost is unmistakable—"not to erase them, but to transform them"—as the moss swallows words with patient grace.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake ("closure as myth") deepens through cameo accumulation, but escalation isn't driven by protagonist agency—mist guides her. Conceptual cost is unmistakable ("manuscript remained unfinished" yet "pulsed with potential").

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=9.6)
    Stakes viscerally felt through song's progression: the "sadder" verse about steel fences/radios narrows options by deepening loss, while reclamation crescendo forecloses the path of silence with earned cost. Agency drives every escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes (translating heartbeats) deepen through ritual density under Accumulative lens, with conceptual cost in the pulse-map's "brutal" truth, but lacks meaningful escalation via protagonist agency—pressure accumulates passively without competing choices or tactical shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (preserving wonder against time's erosion) deepens through density (11:03 glyph, 3:17 pulses). Agency via methodical work forecloses path of "fixing time," but cost remains abstract; departure lacks visceral dramatization despite conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stake (containing grief) tightens via chisel action: "let the first curl peel away" narrows options to art over safety. Escalation driven by agency ("pressed its tip to the blank"), not coincidence. Cost crystallized in kettle abandonment—prioritizing wisdom over mundane survival.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.5)
    Dominant stake (negotiating with ghost-self) tightens through protagonist’s agency: winding the camera, collecting fragments, then surrendering it. The ghost’s shift from whispering desires to demanding "develop this" creates deepening with felt cost in the relinquishment of fixing the past.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes escalate texturally from measurement to community integration, yet "hope" remains abstract without tangible threat; cost legible in persistent cracks but lacks personal sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation is protagonist-driven under Accumulative lens: his "serene upheaval" training forces stillness until physics/patience align, narrowing options to observation alone.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes escalate through the obituary’s construction: each adjective becomes "a landmark" narrowing options toward the crane ritual. Cost is visceral in "hollows in the soul" and the traveler’s emotional labor, though escalation could deepen the "explanation" deception’s immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.6)
    Stakes tighten causally through prince’s agency: installing "copper veins," calibrating heartbeats, culminating in the palm press.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.1)
    Escalation driven by protagonist's agency: lowering coin to "kiss surface" narrows options from observation to active grafting, with cost legible in irreversible submersion ("coin now resting beneath surface, still pulsing").

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (liberating memories) tightens through the key insertion at Fountain Twelve, reweighting options via memory density; cost is legible in the deepened silence, though escalation lacks a narrowing of live options under accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes deepen through Elias' realization that grief has "angles of absence," with the migration timeframe tightening his urgency for the crimson ribbon. Agency in tying ribbons forecloses solitary grief, though the internal/external conflict interweaving could be sharper under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.4)
    Escalation driven entirely by Elias's agency: reading inscriptions forces surrender choice. Stakes ("no child missed a train") viscerally felt; cost unmistakable in physical release ("knees stiff") and thematic shift from "counting seconds" to "savoring time."

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (decoding intentions via threads) tightens through gardener's agency—humming to loosen knots, sleeve-threading choice. Cost legible in sovereign case's weight shift, but "uncharted echoes" concept remains slightly abstract until final revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (charting ignorance) tightens through glyph-by-glyph escalation; "compression of all prior failures" crystallizes cost. Agency drives every beat but minor tension dip when backstory interrupts present pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.5)
    No meaningful escalation: pirate broadcasts merely deliver revelations. Stakes remain atmospheric; no narrowing of options or visible price altering tactics despite dial burning thumb.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.5)
    Stake tightening when visitor recognizes her emotion: scatterer’s agency ("It’s how you still feel") forces crystallization. Cost is visceral—chair’s stillness, mask seams, woman’s relieved departure. Single deepening under textural lens suffices, reweighting "safety" with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (harmony vs. world’s dissonance) signaled early; deepening via creak-to-voice progression narrows options. Cost is visceral: girl’s "I don’t know how to sing" against Elara’s life work—agency in teaching choice forecloses solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes deepen through Elara’s internal pressure: pruning archives of grief risks being overwhelmed, yet the celestial alignment’s urgency tightens her micro-choices (e.g., watering with specific memory). Cost legible in her vulnerability during planting, though external pressure lacks teeth for higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully when drones are revealed as capacitors (foreclosing "broken tech" option), with visible cost in Elias' prior silence; agency through observation works perfectly under Accumulative lens despite single escalation point.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation via Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory saturation ("gulls paused mid-cry," "shard glowed faintly") deepens the dominant stake (honoring memory) until the cottage’s release carries conceptual cost—no cheap resolution, only earned reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully when historian breaks ampoule against statue's fracture, narrowing options from scholarly pursuit to active rebirth advocacy; cost is legible in her emotional shift but escalation leans more on revelation density than pressure intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes tighten through Elara’s persistent rituals (bread, lens-scanning), narrowing options toward the drum’s discovery. Cost is visceral—"frost from their spirits"—but the boy’s drum feels slightly fortuitous, softening agency’s role in the escalation peak.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.0)
    One tightening forecloses fate’s path: gear insertion snaps "threads of consequence" with immediate cost (lighthouse fissuring). Stakes escalate through protagonist agency alone—no coincidence resolves conflict—making the price ("carry its weight alone") unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes (memory vs. entropy) tighten via inkwell thinning and pavilion’s groaning beams, culminating in the letter discovery. Agency drives escalation: copying the letter with last ink is a trade-off foreclosing neutrality. Cost felt in emotional yield ("stoicism yielding to sensitivity"). Slight deduction for low-stakes pressure in short form.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.3)

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.5)
    Stakes deepen through protagonist agency: failed simulations narrow options to "empty" coordinates, forcing her to "queue thrusters" toward oceanic void.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake ("decode frequency of belonging") tightens through deepening as chip shifts from external signal to internal tuning.

Pilgrim's warning creates secondary pressure without resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.6)

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single tightening ("Did you bring the names you buried?") forces prosecutor's vulnerable admission; dominant stake (truth vs. political expediency) narrows options to relic exchange; cost felt in "etched with grief" eyes and exchanged cold relics.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.3)

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.1)

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.1)
    Escalation driven by protagonist's agency: spice ritual narrows options to surrender ("did not resist"), with visible cost in metamorphosis ("no longer just whisperer, no longer just beast"); dominant stake signaled by paragraph 2.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes escalate purely through protagonist agency: each stitch tightens emotional calibration pressure ("Too heavy, gate shatters") with visceral cost (Tear’s dissolution).

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.9)
