  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—discovering purpose in the pauses—is signaled early, but escalation is replaced by accretion without pressure. The ledger-to-frost "synchrony" moment is a revelation rather than a choice that narrows options. The protagonist's agency in the final third is summary: "she gathered shards… began fusing them… never sold them." No on-page scene dramatizes the trade-off between hiding and healing, or the cost of gifting rather than selling. The meaningful tightening required under Accumulative lens is absent; the story moves laterally through motifs without a visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake (translating silence into music) is signaled early but never genuinely tested. No reversal or tightening forecloses an option; each tuning-fork strike succeeds without friction. The protagonist faces no meaningful obstacle, error, or trade-off. The accumulative design deepens understanding but does not escalate pressure or narrow choices, leaving the ending without felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: giving rest to the unquiet dead, now complicated by broadcasting distress signals. One meaningful tightening occurs when he realizes he can't bury or ignore the chorus—he must answer it by turning the lens into a beacon of release. The method (embedding prisms in impossible spaces) narrows his options and carries visible cost: he walks deeper rather than toward surface, committing to "more fractures to mend." Agency is present through his choice to dismantle, place, and activate rather than ignore, though the escalation could sharpen further with a clearer trade-off or obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—sustaining community cohesion under sanctions—is signaled early and remains coherent. Escalation reads as density increase (more baskets, more participants) rather than a tightening that narrows options. The note ("Why stay anonymous?") offers a micro-turn but Elira's response costs nothing on the page. The sanctions deepen, yet the narrative declares resilience without showing a trade-off or foreclosed tactic; coincidence (others joining) complicates but does not force a decision with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dominant stake—locating unused love's reservoir—is signaled early and pursued through breath-tracking. The tear discovery at midpoint narrows the search to the pilgrim. Yet the climax demands no choice: the artist kneels, matches breath, and the tear unfurls automatically, granting access without cost. No live option is foreclosed, no trade-off faced. The single tightening (finding the tear) raises anticipation but the resolution gifts revelation rather than extracting visible price, leaving escalation incomplete under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—discovering time's texture—is signaled early and drives Elira's garden work. The middle turn occurs when she brushes the fragment and the photographs disintegrate, narrowing her access to memory and forcing reliance on direct sensory contact. Yet this reversal is externally imposed (the fragment's power) rather than driven by her choice, and the cost legibility is moderate: we see her scream and weep, but the final tactile cataloguing reads more as victory than trade-off. No live option is foreclosed with visible consequence; she achieves her goal and smiles "trembling," which undercuts the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (breach vault, scatter seeds before dawn) is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs: the piano-key puzzle narrows her options and the vault opens, deepening access. Yet the resolution feels frictionless—no on-page reversal forces her to sacrifice one goal for another, and the raiders mentioned early never materialize to test her. The escalation is present in density and task completion but lacks a visible price that forecloses a live option. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure accumulates through tactical steps, but cost at closure is oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—find the sound of trust breaking—is signaled in paragraph two and drives each beat: building the forge, feeding it absences, listening through bone. One meaningful tightening occurs when she hears the crack and recognizes it as the warning frequency, then forges the memory-catcher. Agency is clear: her decision to feed the forge her sister's voice hollow and her choice to leave the greenhouse foreclose paths with visible cost (scarred spirit, thinned body, no return). Pressure accumulates under the Accumulative lens through density and cadence shift. The cellular countdown ("while cells divide") is mentioned but does not materially narrow her options or alter tactics on the page, weakening the escalation slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—demonstrating the thief's translation of fate—is signaled early but never tightens or deepens under pressure. She executes two identical interventions (moonbeam vision + flower code) without obstacle, adaptation, or cost. No reversal narrows her options; coincidence (the woman holding sunflowers arrives exactly when cued) resolves both reunions without protagonist agency forcing a trade-off. The declared motivation ("press your ear against destiny's door") remains decorative; no on-page choice tests it.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—crafting safe zones for inquiry—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or scarcity. She announces rituals, places spheres, and departs without encountering resistance, resource limits, or a decision that narrows options. The ice melting outside provides textural parallelism but does not escalate pressure. No reversal or tightening occurs; the narrative arc is declarative performance rather than conflict-driven escalation, leaving cost abstract and agency largely ceremonial.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—proving the protagonist can turn betrayal into liberation—is signaled early but remains abstract and internally resolved. No on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows options: the protagonist discovers notes, decodes them (off-page labor summarized), finds the reel, and burns it without friction or trade-off. The mentor's betrayal and the rival studio threat are backstory scaffolding; no present antagonist or obstacle tests the protagonist's commitment. The ending offers no visible price—no relationship severed, no resource spent, no future path foreclosed with felt cost scaled to this length.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=3.1)
    The dominant stake—drawing a map of silence—is signaled early but never tested. No reversal, no tightening, no on-page choice that forecloses an option or imposes cost. The storm rages but the oracle works unimpeded; she finishes her task and departs without friction or sacrifice. Agency is absent: she does not decide, renounce, or endure under pressure; she simply completes a predetermined action and leaves. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen or break a pattern; here it remains static.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—"Where do thoughts come from?"—is signaled immediately and sustained. Accumulative pressure builds through loop repetitions: each iteration adds a detail (wind-hum in loop two, emotional tuning by loop seven, technician's trembling hands by loop twenty-three) until the whisper redirects the quest inward. This single meaningful deepening forecloses the external search with visible cost: the violin melts, the courtyard role shifts from answer-source to listening post. Agency is renunciation (abandoning the wrong question) with a trade-off legible on the page. The escalation is primarily textural (density increase, pattern break) consistent with the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (thaw mistrust) is signaled early, but pressure remains flat: Elira places the lens, it glows, keepers soften—no reversal or complication tests her commitment. No cost is legible until the lens cracks, which feels decorative rather than a forfeiture that alters later options. The keepers' response is unanimous and immediate, erasing genuine conflict. One meaningful tightening or deepening is absent; the story delivers atmosphere without escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—proving gardens know their gardeners—is signaled early and drives all choices. One meaningful tightening occurs when the intern demands replanting; her refusal forecloses compliance with visible cost (bureaucratic resistance, isolation). Agency is renunciation with on-page cost ("the garden doesn't comply. It consents") that narrows options. The garden's firefly response and her seated acceptance at the altar constitute a resonant reconfiguration. Under the accumulative lens, pressure coheres and tightens; coincidence does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (prove lateral time) is declared early and pursued through seventeen cycles of sensor work, culminating in the lever pull and adjacency vision. One meaningful tightening occurs when the other Elira whispers "Don't let go," forcing the 2.7-degree adjustment—a decision under pressure. Yet the escalation is intellectual rather than forced by scarcity or threat; no live option is foreclosed with visceral cost. The resolution (file saved, tea poured) registers as Earned Stasis with conceptual cost, but lacks the felt trade-off or loss that would lift it into high-band territory.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake: decode the ghost's unfinished symphony and grant him peace. Pressure accumulates through her weeks of study, tonight's ritual setup, and the climactic "performance" in invisible bowing. The tightening is a single deepening—when the ghost appears and conducts, she mirrors his gestures, summoning harmony from ruin. However, the escalation relies on atmosphere and assertion ("the water rose slightly, swirling in eddies") rather than a protagonist choice that narrows options or pays a visible price. No credible loss or forfeiture alters her tactics; the resolution feels inevitable rather than earned by prior friction.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: the weight of a swallowed truth and its consequence. One meaningful tightening occurs when the oracle reframes her query from "mass" to "consequence," then to "Release requires rupture." Her agency is renunciation and endurance—stepping onto the gantry, pinning the illustration, accepting that "Let the smudge become the center." The cost is visible: exposure to the storm, relinquishing control of the perfect image, choosing to endure rather than resolve. Escalation is driven by protagonist micro-choices under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—finding weight/validation for her father's deathbed confession—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure tightens when she discovers the radio playing her own drunk call, collapsing the external ghost into recursive grief. This reversal narrows options: no phantom absolution exists, only self-reckoning. Agency at closure is modest but present: she twists the wheel, pockets the radio, and walks home steadier. The cost is emotional/relational (accepting the burden as hers alone) rather than a high-stakes external forfeit. Escalation is more accumulative than causal-agonistic; she uncovers rather than fights, and coincidence (the corroded radio still whispering) aids discovery without her forcing the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—witnessing without judgment—is signaled early but never tested by a live dilemma or trade-off. The keeper moves through the space and the refuge's vision without encountering opposition, temptation, or a choice that narrows options. The weeping and the act of writing are presented as fulfillment rather than escalation with cost. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, one deepening (entry into the refuge) occurs, but the tightening or foreclosed path required for higher scores is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake ("nurture lifelong wonder") is declared but never tested on the page. The eclipse complicates the scene but does not escalate Elara's internal or external conflict; she responds with ease, singing without friction or trade-off. No reversal narrows options, no tightening forces a choice with visible cost. The gathering's participation feels passive convergence rather than earned escalation driven by protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.6)
    One dominant stake—collecting and mending stories to realign meaning—is signaled early and deepens at the tapestry cross-reference: "Match." The discovery that "someone, long ago, had tried to stitch it shut" narrows options from passive collection to active mending. The final commitment to "learn to weave" forecloses passivity with felt cost (she must descend into the underlibrary where "gravity still stutters"). One meaningful tightening under an accumulative lens with cost legible at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—orchestrating others' fates via cryptic fortunes—is signaled early but never faces meaningful opposition or a complication that narrows Elias's options. The widow and teenager transformations land as successes without friction; the analyst's arrival affirms rather than challenges Elias's method. No on-page reversal tests commitment or forces a visible price. The piece accumulates outcomes rather than escalating pressure, and coincidence (a stranger rows ashore with annotated fortunes) supplies the coda without agency-driven cost.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—prevent possession by illuminating hidden assumptions—is signaled early and escalates through three distinct rhetorical gambits that deepen understanding. The priest's agency drives the tightening (each question warps geometry, confuses the entity, ultimately disperses it), and the conceptual cost is legible when the possession "unravels...into the very stillness it had sought to dominate." Under the Accumulative lens, the pattern of charged questions constitutes meaningful escalation. However, the victory feels intellectually foreordained rather than hard-won with visible tradeoffs; no live option is foreclosed with felt personal sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—to conduct memory-symphonies—is signaled early but never faces meaningful resistance or cost. The protagonist performs her ritual without obstacle; the glass vibrates, the horizon splits, yet no option is foreclosed and no price paid. The "before exhaustion hits" rule is stated but not enforced: she pushes further without visible consequence, then simply lowers her arms. No reversal or tightening narrows her choices or alters her knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—"conquer the labyrinth of self"—is declared but never tested with live options or trade-offs. Each landing offers a scene to witness, not a dilemma to resolve; the protagonist simply touches walls and speaks confessions without visible friction or cost. No reversal or tightening narrows her choices; the tablet's bloom and echo-merge happen *to* her rather than through her agency. The viaduct's shudder substitutes for earned escalation, and coincidence (tablet cracks, echoes dissolve on cue) resolves the premise without demonstrated price.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—defeating emotional numbness—is signaled early and escalates through Elara's fear of becoming hollow, her risky experiment with the backward song, and the students' breakthrough responses. The broken needle discovery and its deployment create a meaningful tightening: the backward music "provokes" rather than soothes, dragging numbness into the open where it becomes vulnerable. The cost is legible on-page: one veteran cries from recognition, a girl with scarred wrists laughs startled by her pulse, and Elara's own hands tingle as she confronts the void. Agency drives the turn—Elara chooses to reverse the record despite uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: whether Elias will investigate the quarantine breach and forfeit Bureau safety. The message tube tightens pressure by naming Sector 7-C and "rewriting the maps," forcing a binary: report or investigate laterally. One meaningful deepening when he decides "I would not report this" and shifts to tracing witnesses—options narrow and tactics change. Agency is clear (decision to move east, gather tools, follow pigeon path backward). Visible cost: forfeiture of official channels, acceptance of surveillance risk, solitude weaponized. Coincidence complicates (unsummoned pigeon) but does not resolve; the protagonist's stance crystallization drives closure under the situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake ("discover the texture of time") remains abstract and is never tested by a concrete dilemma on the page. The poet faces no live choice between competing goods; she descends to the village and offers the rope without friction, cost, or reversal. The elders' paralysis is told, not shown as escalating pressure. Silas's impossible choice is backstory; the poet "celebrated his refusal" but never inhabits a parallel bind herself. No tightening forecloses a path or forces a tradeoff with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—unbinding what is trapped in silence—is signaled early and sustained, but pressure does not escalate through reversals or tightening choices. Each phrase of Lira's playing summons response (petals unfurl, hatch creaks, child descends) without resistance, cost, or a turn that narrows her options. The petal-offering feels like thematic closure rather than a decision with visible forfeit. No antagonist or meaningful obstacle shapes tactics; coincidence (the child was already hiding) delivers the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—Vael's shift from counterfeiting emotion to holding genuine feeling—is signaled early and tightens when she presses the petal to her sternum, subsuming the chemist's fractured legacy with visible cost (market ruin, loss of patron network). The destruction of her vials is an agency-driven renunciation that forecloses her old transactional path. However, the escalation reads as one decisive intensification rather than multiple pressure points; the chemist's memories (weeping, laughing, lying) arrive as summary rather than obstacles Vael must navigate, reducing the sense of struggle before resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—uplifting silent contributors—is signaled early and pursued consistently. However, escalation is absent: Elias faces no meaningful opposition, cost, or complication; each envelope delivery succeeds without friction, and the reciprocal envelope arrives as reward rather than reversal. The story's single deepening moment (workers initiating their own envelopes) is told rather than dramatized, and no on-page choice narrows Elias's options or imposes visible sacrifice. Coincidence (the mistaken envelope) initiates but does not resolve, meeting lens requirements minimally.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (graft onto community) is signaled early. The search for Vesper's tags provides a through-line, and Lira's sculptures evolve from plea to announcement, showing progression. However, escalation reads as accretive layering (others notice, a note appears, Vesper arrives) without a moment where Lira must choose between competing goods or pay a visible price. The arbor dedication is offered freely; no renunciation or foreclosed path is dramatized. Luck (Vesper waiting, figures emerging) resolves the want without agency-driven cost.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—finding the echo birthplace before the giant wakes—is signaled early. The "overborrowed" chime provides a tightening moment, but the protagonist cushions it with time-sculpting in the same beat, deflating the consequence immediately. The chamber discovery and echo-release feel like arrival rather than a pressure-driven reversal; no live option is foreclosed, and the cost (pendant heat, fatigue) is mentioned rather than forcing a visible trade-off that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding the mathematics of emotion to map loss—is signaled early and guides every beat. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: Elira threads equations into lullabies, the orchard hums in response, twin beams reveal coordinates, and the final fruit-compass deepens her resolve. One meaningful tightening occurs when tears refract secondary symbols, narrowing options toward reunion. However, no reversal or trade-off appears; each step grants insight without visible cost or error, and the orchard's glow strengthens as reward rather than consequence. The ending crystallizes intent but does not foreclose a path or exact a felt price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (visibility) is signaled in paragraph three and tightens when the dweller moves from caching to placing objects where they can be received. One meaningful escalation occurs when she places the tape fragment atop the reader, forecloses pure hiding, and accepts the risk of partial visibility. The intern's discovery and the staff notice crystallize the cost: connection without full emergence. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through the mosaic of cached items and the final placement reweights her isolation. Agency is present in the decision to place rather than hoard; coincidence does not resolve. The cost is felt but not visceral enough to break into the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding Lindy's defiance—is signaled early. However, escalation relies on the protagonist's internal softening rather than external pressure narrowing her options; no second character or resource scarcity forces her hand. The turning point (lowering the clippers) is a renunciation, but its cost is abstract: we do not see what she loses by abandoning her research beyond vague references to rent and colleagues. The storm and leaf's glow complicate but do not dramatize a trade-off with visible price. One meaningful tightening is present but lacks felt consequence scaled to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—threshing meaning from loss—is signaled early and tightens through the brooch discovery, journal revelation, and exchange decision. The journal's unveiling that "grief becomes legacy" and "loss calcifies into artifact" provides a meaningful deepening that reweights her seventeen-night vigil. The exchange choice forecloses the path of endless archival pursuit with visible cost (surrendering her best work and the brooch itself). However, the seaglass return in the final beat risks diluting the sacrifice, and the protagonist's agency in the hallucination sequence feels more受动 than driven.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding and magnifying everyday magic—is signaled early but remains abstract. The cave pearl's awakening provides one meaningful tightening when the unseen forces stir louder, but the pilgrim's passive kneeling and the clairvoyant's realization involve minimal agency. The resolution arrives through recovered memory rather than a choice that narrows live options with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—mapping grief into geography to honor silence—is signaled early and tightens through Elira's fragment-gathering (one meaningful deepening under Accumulative lens). The council presentation reverses expectation (they anticipate demands, she proposes a naming ritual), and the first evening's voices create a before/after shift: absences become acknowledged coordinates. Agency is clear in Elira's proposal and her choice to leave the valve unpolished, forecloses restoration in favor of preservation. The cost—accepting permanent loss rather than memorial monuments—is legible on the page, though the escalation could press harder against resistance or internal doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—finding the fortress of unspoken truths—is signaled early and sustained. The descent provides one meaningful tightening when Elira reaches the obsidian door and must press the punch, but the escalation is largely atmospheric rather than driven by narrowing options or visible trade-offs. The final act (pressing the punch, absorbing whispers) resolves through revelation rather than a choice that forecloses a live alternative, and the cost of "unraveling" is asserted but not demonstrated through a specific capability or relationship lost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—to transcribe the unheard symphony and honor forgotten patterns—is signaled early and remains coherent. The tile's unfolding of memories and the whale-song synchronization deepen the stakes, adding textural pressure. However, escalation is gentle: Elira's "skepticism warred with sensation" is a declared conflict, not a sequence of forced choices with visible trade-offs. The resolution (archiving the parchment) is earned by her shift in understanding, but the piece never tests her with a competing need or cost that would narrow options. Under the accumulative lens, one meaningful tightening is present (the realization "the magic wasn't in the object, but in the entanglement"), but the price remains largely conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: discovering "what happens after goodbye." The piece tightens once through protagonist agency—he aligns the fragment with the storm's magnetic crescendo, triggering spatial mutiny and the gateway. The cost is visible: his sanctuary collapses ("winked out"), and he steps forward into the unknown, forsaking millennia of safe ennui for vulnerability. The escalation reads as accumulative density increase (whispers, ruptures, helix of force) followed by a decisive deepening when "the amulet shattered completely" and "walls screamed as they inverted." The final kneeling gesture—"pressed his palm to the ground"—crystallizes his stance with felt price: engagement replaces detachment, wonder supplants boredom. Pressure coheres under the inferred lens and narrows to one irreversible choice.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—using the ink to find fairness mathematics—is signaled early and pursued throughout. However, escalation is minimal: the child uncorks the ink, it works immediately as legend promised, others arrive and use it successfully, and the child departs unimpeded. No meaningful resistance, cost, or complication tests the protagonist's commitment; the mortician's arrival could create tension but instead he asks to participate. The tightening occurs thematically (from personal use to communal ritual to future confrontation) rather than through narrowed options or forced trade-offs. The cost of "everything" is declared but not dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.1)
    One dominant stake is signaled early: collecting and archiving invented histories. The discovery of someone else's "foreign past" provides a meaningful tightening that narrows her understanding of the archive from solitary to collaborative. Her decision to leave the notepad open with "Add Your Texture" forecloses exclusive ownership—a visible cost. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens is modest; the "cross-referencing" passage summarizes days of discovery rather than dramatizing pressure, and the townsfolk's return feels coincidental rather than causally linked to her choice. The protagonist's agency drives the final act, but the middle stretch lacks a second beat that would test commitment or force a trade-off before the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake—preserving texture of erased histories—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or scarcity. Elias encounters no constraint that forces a trade-off; he collects, layers, and releases fragments without visible cost or tactical shift. The tides modulate his access but do not escalate pressure toward a narrowing decision. No meaningful tightening occurs; the final paragraphs restate the premise rather than reweight options or exact a price.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—decoding a universal riddle—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the retelling ritual and compass spin, but escalation is textural rather than tactical; no live option is foreclosed. The riddle's answer emerges as revelation rather than a turn forced by prior choices. The cello's hum and compass's shattering feel illustrative rather than causally linked to a decision that narrows her path. Cost (stopping the search) is told in the final paragraph without dramatized forfeit.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—resist privatization without losing the carnival's memory—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the graffiti campaign (murals, color-coded warnings, redirected foot traffic), and one meaningful deepening occurs when corporate scouts arrive blind to the hidden resistance network. However, escalation is driven by Lira's off-page reorganization rather than on-page reversals that narrow options; the climax (dawn gathering, unsigned contracts) happens collectively and is summarized rather than dramatized with a visible personal cost. Agency is present but diffuse: Lira paints and plans, yet the peak choice—refusing to show at City Hall, climbing the tower to paint the final mural—feels like a confirmation of prior resolve rather than a trade-off that forecloses a competing path.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—photographing the last operational Nightwatch Hourglass before its final message is spent—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs: the 04:57 chronometer check raises urgency as the 05:00 threshold approaches, and the final grain's fall forecloses the object's purpose forever. However, the inspector faces no opposition or tactical dilemma; the escalation is temporal (dawn arrives) rather than driven by her agency. The cost is visible in the closure (loneliness, futility, the label that may never be found), but the path to that cost is observational rather than fought.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—operational drone before tide turns—is signaled early. However, escalation is absent; Elara's repair steps proceed without friction, failed attempts, or narrowing options. The botanist's research and voyage stakes remain declared but never tested on the page. No reversal or tightening forces a trade-off. The anchor-lifting frame creates atmospheric urgency but does not alter Elara's tactics or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—finding the convergence point of rivers—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure is largely contemplative; the protagonist traces, whispers, and observes without meaningful external opposition or internal trade-off until the final act. The ice "sighs" rather than cracks, and the protagonist simply draws a spiral without visible cost or foreclosed path. The escalation is textural (fragments → condensation → seam of light) but does not narrow options or force a sacrifice. Agency at closure is present (handing the page to the falcon) but feels more like completion than a choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: restore shared balance between lost and echoing. One meaningful deepening occurs when windows flicker, children peek, and the town hums—moving from silence to presence. The tuner's agency is renunciation (leaving the fork) that forecloses return, with felt cost in her now-silent footfalls. No reversals test her commitment; the walk proceeds without obstacle or friction. Pressure accumulates via imagery rather than narrowed options.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—unlock the vial's power to access trapped memories—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, escalation is primarily textural (deepening atmosphere, accumulating sensory echoes) rather than driven by protagonist agency; Elira's key action is to "stand still" and "not move," which is passive framing even when the text insists it requires will. The oxygen alarm provides a ticking clock, but no on-page reversal or adaptive choice alters tactics—she commits to the vial activation and follows through without complication. The cost (death) is clear and paid, but the path lacks a moment where she must choose between competing goods or adapt to new resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—seal the truth before the search party arrives—is signaled early and tightens through the boy's climb and the arrival of spectral witnesses. His agency drives escalation: he chooses to wedge the lattice, then presses it into the lens, actions that narrow his options and transform the lighthouse's function. The search party's boots on gravel in the final third create a live clock that raises cost. One meaningful reversal occurs when the beam fractures into whispers, summoning witnesses rather than merely shining—this turn arises from the boy's choice and reweights his father's legacy. The cost is legible: he will be called mad, and he accepts it ("Let them come"). Minor slip: the spectral hands grasping the railing feel like atmosphere rather than a complication that forces a new choice.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—repaying a debt across lifetimes—is signaled early but pressure remains atmospheric rather than escalating through protagonist agency. The ghost bride never faces a live choice; Elara's arrival and the bead transfer happen to her rather than through her struggle. The final transformation (fruit bearing, nectar tasting) provides visible cost (bride's dissolution) but the escalation lacks a meaningful tightening or trade-off driven by character decision. One deepening occurs (bead unlocks memories, reframes debt as balance) but it is told via summary epiphany rather than a choice that forecloses options.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—mending the plate to honor breakage—is signaled early but never faces opposition or cost. No reversal or tightening occurs; the weaver kneels, sews, succeeds without friction. The resolution is achieved by solo ritual with no trade-off, forfeiture, or tactical adjustment under pressure. Accumulative lens allows for deepening via density, but the final act does not foreclose a path or demonstrate visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—restoring the sundial to restore faith—is signaled early, but escalation is gentle: Elara digs, finds artifacts, reassembles stones without friction or trade-off. The orchard's roots "steady" rather than hinder, and the final alignment happens without visible cost ("the interruption was over"). Villagers' arrival provides communal validation rather than a protagonist-driven turn. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is present (realizing the sundial "wasn't merely broken—it was displaced"), but the lack of a live obstacle or renunciation caps the score in the 6s.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—encoding the widow's message—is signaled but never tested. No reversal, complication, or tightening choice appears; the protagonist completes her chalk ritual without opposition, constraint, or cost. The piece describes a method rather than dramatizing escalation under the inferred Accumulative lens. Agency (decision, renunciation, endurance) that forecloses a path with felt cost is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—preventing the coup through stitched warnings—is signaled early and pressure accumulates through the flame's tremor, the adjacent-layer vision, and the conspirators' arrival. However, escalation is largely told: "false stars had led traitors into ambush" and "hidden paths saved the Crown Prince's life" summarize outcomes rather than dramatizing a on-page choice that narrows her options or forces a visible trade-off. The final stitch with the silver filament is described but its cost or tactical price is not legible on the page; the resolution feels delivered rather than earned through protagonist agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: "to stir the moment before deciding" and deliver the unsent apologies. One meaningful turn occurs when she places the letters and they dissolve, reconfiguring her stance from withholding to release. However, the escalation is gentle accumulation rather than tightening pressure—spirits sing, moonlight heals, messages appear, path opens—without a moment where her agency forecloses a live option with visible cost. The shard's planting and the smile suggest release, but the trade-off (memory vs. healing) is told, not tested in a pivotal choice.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (graft new meaning onto old wounds) is signaled early and coheres through the Accumulative lens: coral warmth increases, scribbles shift from frantic to gentle, mist thins as Mira speaks the decrypted phrases. One meaningful deepening occurs when she presses the coral to the cast and the smudges rearrange, visibly unknotting the shared anxieties. The tightening is gentle but legible: her whispered affirmation forecloses the option of erasure or escape, accepting kinship as the cost. No overt antagonist, but the internal battlefield and ghost-pressure of memory provide coherent opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—rediscovering unguarded creative joy—is signaled early and pursued throughout. The projection at noon provides one meaningful tightening: Elira moves from carrying the fragment's "heavier" emotional weight to releasing its spirit through light, and passersby's responses validate the shift. The cost is legible (she abandons "preservation" and "acclaim" for ephemeral awakening) and the resolution is earned by her agency. However, the escalation is largely internal and reflective; no external complication or competing pressure tests her commitment mid-scene. The oral-history gathering functions as preparation without resistance, and the projection succeeds on first attempt, reducing tension.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.9)
    One dominant stake is signaled: Elira seeks to awaken the Nested Awakenings mural. Pressure tightens when direct contact fails, then deepens when the reflected-sound method succeeds and layers of memory cascade. However, the tightening is achieved by discovery rather than protagonist agency under duress—she grins, flicks the nickel, and the mural responds without resistance or tradeoff. No live option is foreclosed; the resolution grants transformation without visible sacrifice, leaving escalation and cost legibility below the 8.0 threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake (linguistic rebellion against the thought-tax regime) is signaled early but never truly tightens on the page. Dr. Vex's decision not to stop her is a micro turn, but it costs him nothing visible and alters no later tactic. The piece summarizes escalation ("By week's end, the gourd vine spiraled") rather than dramatizing a moment where the protagonist's choice narrows options or raises cost. The ending distributes success across a collective without showing the protagonist's agency driving the final reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—to transmute suffering into beauty via song—is clear and sustained, but pressure remains steady rather than escalating. The postcard's warming and new line ("They're listening") offer a micro turn, yet the poet's response is continuation rather than a forced trade-off. No live option is foreclosed; she simply sings a new kind of song (psalm instead of lullaby). The piece accumulates texture and reweights meaning, but under an Accumulative lens the closure lacks a decisive intensification or visible cost. Agency is present (she chooses to keep singing despite insomnia and centuries of longing) but the final act does not narrow options or impose a felt price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—preservation without restoration—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, no on-page tightening or reversal occurs; the wind arrives "as always," the caretaker whispers a name, light blooms and fades predictably, and she descends satisfied. The reference to other caretakers' failures is told rather than tested in scene. The nightly ritual unfolds without complication, error, or escalation that would narrow options or force a trade-off with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—restore mutual understanding after the Great Silence—is signaled early and tightens through the discovery that a single altered promise fractured civilization. The linguist's warning "If you break the promise, the truth shatters again" raises cost at the climax. However, escalation is smooth rather than pressured: each deciphered phrase succeeds without setback, and the final singing unfolds without dissonance or dissent, so the tightening feels more like accumulation than a choice that narrows options or forecloses a live alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake (reconciling flood control with mercy) is signaled early and sustained, but escalation is muted. The adhesive analysis is a setup move; the amphitheater visit involves measurement and humming without on-page resistance or cost. No reversal or tightening forecloses a live option; the floodgates' failure is told, not shown, and her planned recalibration is narrated as future intent. The story accumulates texture and motifs but lacks a beat where the protagonist's choice visibly narrows her path or forces a trade-off under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (preservation of lost songs) is signaled early and tightens when the meteorite introduces a method for resurrection rather than mere echo. The discovery and subsequent mapping/harness redesign constitute a meaningful escalation under the accumulative lens. Argent's trill—"It was her mother's melody. Not an echo. Not a memory. A resurrection"—delivers a clear tightening that forecloses the path of solitary archive-keeping. The cost is visible: she stops reinventing herself, and the arrival of the child's letter confirms the stakes have shifted from departure to return. Protagonist agency drives the turn (she redesigns the harnesses), but the meteorite's properties feel convenient rather than fully earned from prior constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—why thresholds feel sacred—is declared but never tested in a concrete on-page dilemma. Elara has no visible alternative to stepping off the terrace; the move reads as inevitable symbolic completion rather than a trade-off that forecloses a live path. The logbook and bench deliver backstory revelation, not escalating pressure that narrows her options. No second beat or micro-turn tightens her choice; the narrative accumulates metaphysical exposition without a causal tightening or felt cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—learning belonging's rhythm—is signaled early but remains conceptual. The fireflies' arrival offers a reversal (they "shouldn't exist"), yet the protagonist's response is passive observation followed by mirrored gesture. No live choice narrows options or imposes a trade-off; the ascent is framed as carrying wonder upward rather than a decision with foreclosed alternatives. Escalation reads as atmospheric intensification without tactical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake: discover why paths disappear. The piece offers one meaningful deepening—the shift from "lost" to "given away"—that reframes the mystery but does not narrow live options or force a trade-off with visible cost. The recollectionist's agency is observational (pressing seeds, touching crater glass) rather than decisional; no on-page reversal tests commitment or alters tactics. The ending gesture (scattering conjectures) feels like thematic closure rather than escalation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—proving monotony can be transfigured—is signaled early but never tested under pressure. The three audience members arrive pre-transformed; their wonder is a given rather than a hard-won reversal. No on-page choice narrows Elias's options or forecloses a path; the seagull and balloon are assimilated without friction. The coin landing heads-up is presented as confirmation rather than a turn that changes tactics. Under Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening or pattern break is required; here the beats loop without tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—preserving memory through dance against the nostalgia ban—is signaled early and sustained. The moonstone discovery provides one meaningful deepening that reweights her exile, and the final arrival of villagers shifts the social calculus. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens feels more asserted than dramatically tightened; the dance sequence is described in elevated language but lacks visible tactical choices or tradeoffs that narrow options. The cost of her action (bleeding feet, exhaustion) is mentioned but not leveraged to complicate her stance before the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.2)
    The dominant stake—"to illuminate value in the mundane"—is signaled early but never tested. No reversal or tightening appears; the stone-drop and prism-packing are steps in a familiar routine, not choices under pressure. The piece presents contemplation without opposition, consequence, or foreclosed paths. Under the Accumulative lens, a single deepening or cadence shift that reweights the stake with cost is required; none materializes. Agency is limited to habitual ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—translating pain into universal language by answering children's letters—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates through reflection rather than escalation: he reads, reflects, whispers replies, and leaves his own note. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is present (the shift from reading others' letters to contributing his own), but the deepening lacks a visible trade-off or cost on the page—no live option is foreclosed, no resource spent. The act of scattering letters "by dawn" is promised but not shown, leaving the climactic gesture deferred.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake (revitalizing equations for hope across timelines) is signaled early. Escalation under Accumulative lens: patterns → trial balloons → silver return → emerald launch → obsidian disc → resonance cascade. One meaningful tightening exists (the gauge's needle swing) but protagonist agency is passive—balloons return or don't, the tide deposits the disc. She observes and adjusts rather than forcing trade-offs. Cost is told in adjacent streams, not dramatized as a forfeited path for her on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—discovering what walls dream about—is signaled early and pursued consistently. Pressure accumulates through the revelation that the diaries were offered, not discarded, which deepens her understanding and shifts her from recorder to witness. The final act of leaving her sketch alongside the diaries reweights her mission, but the cost is oblique: she departs with "satchel lighter, heart heavier," a phrasing that gestures toward consequence without dramatizing a trade-off or foreclosed path. No reversal narrows options; the tightening is one of recognition rather than escalation under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"to persuade mirrors to show possibilities"—is declared but never tested. No opposition arises; mirrors comply immediately after her song. The borrowed heartbeat mechanism involves no cost, trade-off, or narrowing of options; she "took it gently" and "returned it—not spent, not diminished, but amplified." Agency is absent: the painter performs a ritual, and the world yields. No reversal or deepening occurs under the Accumulative lens; the ending dissolves her form without visible price or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—anchoring peace through ceremony—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates texturally: Elira prepares alone, writes clauses, then summons soldiers who choose to sign. One tightening occurs when the soldiers arrive and face the mirror-treaty choice; their signing forecloses the old battle-line stance with visible cost (smudged thumbprints blending, symbolic of compromise). The escalation is accumulative rather than causal-reversal, fitting the inferred lens. However, Elira's own agency at closure is muted—she orchestrates but does not herself choose under visible pressure in the final beat. The cost is conceptual (decades of failure) and relational (soldiers' consent) but not sharply personal for the protagonist at the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Elias's need to atone by preserving extinct echoes—is signaled early and sustained. The ritual (placing the egg, speaking the call, witnessing the resonance) functions as one meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens, reweighting his quiet crusade. Agency is present: he chooses to leave the egg rather than retrieve it, foreclosing possession with visible cost. Pressure coheres but does not escalate sharply; the piece accumulates texture and then releases rather than tightening options. The departure confirms he will remain destructive tomorrow, lending weight to the renunciation. No antagonist or external opposition tests the choice, and the resonance event feels more granted than earned through prior tension.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake is unlocking the prism to release suppressed voices, signaled early. One tightening: the final thread resists, she synchronizes breath and whispers "I remember you," the knot dissolves. Agency reads as endurance (working slowly) rather than a decision that forecloses an option; no live alternative is rejected. Escalation is modest—threads snap one by one without raising cost or complication. The release of echoes lands as thematic payoff but without visible consequence that alters her stance or options post-spill.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—ethical storytelling versus aesthetic evasion—is clear and sustained. The heated argument with Mira provides backstory pressure, and the protagonist's decision to return with a new show tightens options. However, escalation is largely reflective rather than dramatized: the turning point (the beer bottle thrown at the stage) is recounted in summary, not shown in scene. The final choice lacks a visible trade-off or cost; the protagonist's serenity feels awarded rather than fought for. Under an Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is sufficient, but the on-page pressure doesn't narrow options or charge the final image with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—honoring overlooked histories through temporary structures—is signaled early but never genuinely tested. No external or internal pressure threatens the ritual; she executes her method without complication, and the final dissolution is pre-planned rather than a consequence of choice under duress. The piece lacks a meaningful tightening or reversal; the monarch's arrival is a micro turn but does not narrow options or force a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—preservation of forgotten names—is signaled early and sustained. The ritual unfolds in stages (unspooling, molding, pouring, cooling, blowing), creating a texture of accumulation. However, no on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows options; each step proceeds as planned without obstacle, adaptation, or visible trade-off. The stakes remain abstract; we are told the work matters but never see a moment where failure, loss, or sacrifice threatens the outcome. Escalation reads as elaboration rather than pressure under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake (discovering why paths choose walkers) is signaled early and pursued throughout. The dream-state descent functions as a tightening that narrows Elara's search to a single revelation. However, escalation is conceptual rather than decision-driven: the answer "blooms" in her chest, and the wafer seal's glow marks the directive's surrender, not Elara's trade-off. No live option is foreclosed by her agency; the storm, bunker collapse, and forest's "salute" all cooperate to deliver the answer without extracting visible cost. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is present, but the lack of a felt price at closure (per Q2) limits the band.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—seeking communion/revealing a frequency—is signaled early but remains abstract. Pressure accumulates through ritual layering (uncloaking, positioning, sketching, alignment) under the Accumulative lens, yet no reversal or tightening choice narrows live options on the page. The tile hums, he notes the wavelength, and re-wraps it; the loop is closed without a visible trade-off or cost that alters tactics. Agency is present (he climbs, aligns, records) but the final act reads as confirmation rather than a decision that forecloses a path with felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—restoring the music box's function to trigger resentment release—is signaled early and present at closure, but pressure does not escalate through a reversal or tightening choice. The protagonist kneels, reflects, imagines the pin as pivot, and the melody simply "migrates" inward without a decision or tradeoff that narrows options. No meaningful cost is legible: she walks away humming, with no path foreclosed or price paid on the page. The "cellular memory" method and shifting reality remain atmospheric rather than sources of tactical friction.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—capturing the runaway dream—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the dream descends and the mirror maker must synchronize breath to draw it near, narrowing her tactical window. However, escalation is thin: the dream arrives without resistance, driven by "harmonic resonance" rather than protagonist struggle, and the final capture involves no reversal or trade-off. The resolution lacks visible cost; the mirror maker stands victorious, the fog returns, and no live option is foreclosed. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure accumulates through imagery but does not crystallize into a choice that tests commitment or forecloses a path with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—bridging generational wisdom—is signaled early and coheres through vow-gathering. The daughter's vow ("I will never understand you") provides one meaningful tightening when it resists retrieval, forcing the mender to use honey and patience. The green fabric constitutes a micro-turn that narrows the mender's solitude and reweights her persistence. Cost is visible in her solitary sleep and the daughter's hesitant, partial return. However, the footprints and fabric lack prior causal grounding, reducing the sense that the protagonist's tactics earned the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (understanding nonlinear inheritance) is signaled early and tightens when she moves from observation to inquiry, then to embodied contact with the petal. The bathroom beat narrows options by introducing the glyph ("chosen, borrowed, stolen"), and the petal-touch delivers a concrete cost: she remembers failing, burning, succeeding-and-losing-herself. Agency is present in her choice to touch the petal, which forecloses ignorance. One meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens; the cost is felt in "becoming someone she no longer recognized."

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—finding/understanding the library of unlearned lessons—is signaled but never tested with a visible trade-off. Kael's chrono-core fracture and Elira's listening constitute observation, not agency that forecloses a path. The shift from "extract" to "renegotiate" arrives as dialogue insight rather than a choice with on-page cost. No reversal forces a sacrifice or alters tactics; the mountain simply "listens" and realigns without resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—recapturing the lost twin self, Lirien—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through spatial descent and proximity to the name, with one meaningful tightening when she reaches for *Lirien* and hesitates: "Would that self still fit inside her skin? Would she become whole—or fracture further?" This moment narrows options and raises cost. The resolution is earned by her decision to take the name, accepting dual identity ("I am both. And neither. And all."), and the ship's recognition signals consequence. However, the stakes remain largely internal and abstract; no external antagonist or time limit sharpens urgency. The garden offers "no answers, only solace unkindled," which fits the Accumulative lens but dilutes immediate pressure. One on-page tightening is present and sufficient for this length under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—translate confusion into clarity—is signaled early and sustained. However, pressure never escalates; the archivist encounters no obstacle, makes no error, and faces no cost or trade-off. She studies, loosens knots, threads the seal's imprint, and the rope "responds" without resistance. The clock's repair is a triumph, but triumph without friction or visible price. Under an Accumulative lens, one deepening occurs (the rope settles, the door dissolves), but agency is passive alignment rather than a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—to find quiet in the storm—is signaled early and pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens as the hush blooms outward. One meaningful deepening occurs when the stone absorbs tension and Ripple-mark adjusts pitch to match the fractures. However, agency remains constrained: the beings "settle" without resistance, and no live option is foreclosed. The final stone-release to the largest being offers a gift without visible cost to Ripple-mark; she "stepped back," work done, and moves on. Cost clarity is weak; the story substitutes competence for struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: proving coincidences have meaning through rekindling the prism. Pressure accumulates through the ritual: she adjusts the prism "inch by inch," guided by forearm notations, until star-pulse strikes and memories unspool, revealing hidden convergences. One meaningful tightening: the vision is fragile ("one misaligned star... and the vision would collapse"), forcing precise final adjustment and the whispered request "Show me the next thread." Agency is present but passive—she kneels, adjusts, holds breath—with the stars and prism doing the transformative work. Cost is conceptual (reinterpretation of her role) rather than visceral trade-off; no live option is foreclosed on the page, and the "fragile rekindling" never truly threatens to fail.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=3.9)
    The stated stake—"to sculpt identity from experience"—never encounters resistance, complication, or tightening. The archivist performs her task unimpeded: she measures shadows, writes, and leaves. No reversal, deepening, or narrowing of options occurs. The "deepening hush" and "preemptive nostalgia" recur as atmospheric labels rather than escalating pressure that forces trade-offs or alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—reigniting hope by decoding and activating the mosaic—is signaled early and pursued across beats. Pressure accumulates through her chant shifts, footfall sequence, and the mosaic's resonance building. However, escalation remains textural rather than choice-driven; Lira faces no meaningful opposition or trade-off. The climax delivers sensory reward (star appears, fortress seals) but no on-page cost that narrows her later options or forces a sacrifice. One tightening is present, but the felt price is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—discovering time's texture through observation—is signaled early and pressured by the companion's arrival, which introduces relational tension (leaving, roots, love vs. migration). The piece delivers one meaningful deepening: the chronicler's shift from solitary seeking to shared suspension, accepting flux without resolution. However, the escalation is more atmospheric than causal; no on-page reversal forces a trade-off or narrows options. The cost—deferring the argument, choosing presence over answers—is felt but oblique; the final line ("The tide turned") recharges the premise but does not dramatize a visible price paid in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—collecting the flavors of different silences—is signaled early and drives the child's longing. The gravity inversion provides one meaningful tightening by creating access to the sky, and the three flavors of silence (snowfall, bird's note, held breath) accumulate density under the Accumulative lens. Yet the child encounters no forced choice or trade-off: the trellis "welcomed them without question," the doll sprouts without conflict, and the final fall lands "softly" in a hidden garden. Pressure coheres but does not narrow options or extract visible cost before the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: transform the passenger's silence from burden to vessel. One meaningful tightening occurs as the woman's fog-dense silence gradually unwound (shoulders drop, fingers loosen, tear escapes, letter no longer a weight). Yet escalation reads passive—the operator's adjustments (lean, weight shift, silence) trigger automatic responses without visible trade-offs or a moment where his choice forecloses another path. The second passenger's rage sets up perpetual recursion rather than a cost paid for the first success.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—reach the stairway before sunrise—is signaled early, but pressure never meaningfully tightens on the page. She counts 37 paces, finds the hatch, descends, sits, and ascends without friction or forced trade-off. The "halfway down, the stairway trembled" beat hints at escalation, yet she simply "quickened her pace" and succeeds. The throne's revelation reframes the goal (power → perspective) but no live option is foreclosed; she "chose the version" in a moment of contemplation, not a high-cost decision that narrows tactics. Coincidence doesn't resolve, but agency is more observer than actor.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—"to teach suffocating to breathe"—is declared but never tested through a concrete trade-off or live consequence. No meaningful tightening occurs: the protagonist arrives, hovers, steps through; each beat reiterates symbolic intention without narrowing options or forcing sacrifice. The threshold "dissolves" rather than resisting, removing friction at the moment of climax. Agency reads as passive enactment of a predetermined ritual ("not to knock," "she did not look back") rather than a decision forged under pressure with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will anchor the convergence and transform her relationship to empty promises—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates (texts, bolt warming, seam forming), and her decision to press the bolt into the seam is protagonist-driven. However, escalation lacks a visible trade-off or foreclosed path: she channels betrayals without on-page resistance, and the outcome (glowing mushrooms, crystal veins, no nightmares) rewards her without legible cost or loss. The convergence itself is convenient coincidence rather than earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—uncovering hidden truth—is signaled early and remains coherent. The cylinder's revelation (mother's voice, swapped-child secret) produces one meaningful tightening: her identity and mission invert. However, the escalation relies on information delivery rather than a choice under competing pressures; she does not face a live decision that forecloses an option with visible cost. The gramophone "spinning of its own accord" removes her agency at the peak moment, and the walk toward the clocktower, while charged, occurs after the tension has already resolved via the recording.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—to capture possibility via forgotten patterns—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through increasingly mystical imagery, but no on-page reversal or tightening forces the knight to trade one good against another or pay a visible cost. The marionette program's sequences are enacted without friction or failure; vines "balance" rather than bind, fruit releases "silhouettes" that merely brush him. The ending declares success and transformation without demonstrating what was risked or lost in the attempt.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: transforming institutional neglect into recognized tenderness. One meaningful deepening occurs when the button discovery leads to Vance's story, reweighting all subsequent artifacts. However, the escalation is more accumulative than pressurized—each artifact adds texture but doesn't narrow options or raise cost. The supervisor's easy acceptance and the absence of institutional resistance or personal sacrifice (she simply continues her work with coffee and more boxes) keeps stakes largely conceptual. Agency is present in her choice to open the "Magnifications" logbook, but it doesn't foreclose a live path with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—broadcast suppressed histories—is signaled early and sustained. Elira's decision to stay and watch the upload rather than flee immediately is one tightening moment, but the sirens pose atmospheric threat without forcing a hard trade-off; she completes her work and still escapes. The escalation is conceptual (broadcast spreads, indifference cracks) rather than a narrowing of her own options. Cost is declared in future terms ("enforcers will hunt") but not paid on the page; the Ace of Keys is a flourish, not a price.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—silencing the prophecy—is signaled early and drives all action. Pressure accumulates through the grotto's resistance ("It resisted. Of course it did") and the saxophonist's tactical adjustments (softened attack, playing absence into presence), but the escalation is textural rather than a narrowing of live options. The prophecy's dissolution feels preordained by the protagonist's competence; no moment forces a trade-off or forecloses a path with felt cost. The ending reconfigures meaning but the protagonist never risks failure on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake—decode the arbor's message—is signaled early but never tested under pressure; Elira encounters no obstacle,误解, or trade-off. The moonstone speck revelation arrives as gift rather than reversal, and the grandmother's appearance resolves without agency or cost. No meaningful tightening occurs; the narrative expands outward (monuments grow taller, travelers ascend) rather than narrowing options. Coincidence (a glint catches her eye) drives the central turn, and the ending declares harmonization without showing what Elira forfeited or failed to achieve.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding why certainty fails—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the compass's mystery, the descent, and the journal's revelation. However, escalation is primarily textural rather than a tightening that narrows options: Elias follows the compass without significant obstacles or trade-offs until the watch-toss, which feels symbolic rather than a forced choice under competing pressures. The ending reweights his purpose, but no on-page decision dramatizes a live dilemma where he must choose between competing goods. One meaningful deepening occurs; cost is present but oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Elara seeking redemption by naming and releasing the weight of past failures—is signaled early and tightens through the coin-breaking ceremony. The ritual provides one meaningful deepening (the coin cracks under the "saturation" of her remorse) that narrows options and crystallizes her stance. The final reconfiguration (shattered coin → motes of dust → weights "transformed, integrated") reads as earned under the Accumulative lens, though the escalation remains more textural than causal. Cost is legible but would gain impact if a single live option were foreclosed on the page rather than reconfigured abstractly.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—integrating fractured souls via laughter—is signaled early and coherent. Pressure accumulates through the harp's dissonance and layered confessions, then shifts when the flute's "trill" cracks the air and the boy giggles. One meaningful deepening occurs (sorrow becomes laughter, the harp realigns), but no on-page choice forecloses a live option or imposes a visible trade-off. The ghosts' transformation feels atmospherically earned yet lacks a moment where the collector risks or sacrifices something concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—discovering the mathematics of mercy—is signaled early and sustained. The forest opens a path, thickens, and culminates in the clearing, providing one meaningful deepening under the accumulative lens. However, the protagonist's agency is passive: the forest responds, paths open, symbols appear. The final act is the release of the strap, but this gesture feels contemplative rather than forced by a trade-off with visible cost. No live option is foreclosed; the protagonist walks forward into understanding without sacrificing a competing want or enduring a tangible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—unfastening the historian's grief by revealing hidden ancestors—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the translator presses the lens and the triptych "begins to breathe," revealing hidden figures. However, this turn arrives without resistance or complication; the lens simply works as promised, and the historian gasps and weeps on cue. No live option is foreclosed, no trade-off dramatized. The resolution feels delivered rather than earned by protagonist agency under pressure, and the cost (returning the lens, accepting a new commission) reads as narrative housekeeping rather than a price that reweights prior choices.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake is clear: discover what the ceiling hides. The piece tightens from general observation to focused investigation (dust patterns → ceiling tile → drawing/button), constituting one meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. However, the protagonist's agency is limited to methodical discovery without opposition or cost—he encounters no obstacle, makes no trade-off, and the ghost cooperates passively. The resolution ("I see you" → air stills) is clean but frictionless; acknowledgment alone suffices, with no price paid or path foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—to compress eternity into a moment—is signaled early and drives the operator's action (uncorking the whisper). However, the escalation is thin: no obstacle prevents her from acting, no prior failure raises cost, and she "expected" the destabilization, which deflates tension. The climactic choice (seizing her mother's smile) arrives without a visible trade-off or competing option, and the cost ("perfection was ruined") is declared rather than shown through a forfeited path. The ending resets to repetition ("Another rupture") without dramatizing how this cycle has altered her capacity or stance.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: reimagining a lost civilization from fragments, with the academic dispute as secondary pressure. The protagonist's method—covering mirrors during storms—emerges from superstition, is tested, and proves effective, narrowing his approach and enabling the breakthrough. One meaningful tightening occurs when Voss validates the glyphs' resonance, forcing a shift from solitary mourning to collaborative transcription with visible emotional cost ("wept—not for loss, but for possibility"). The final image reweights the stake under the Accumulative lens, though Voss's arrival feels somewhat convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: reclaim stolen light by redeeming a lie. Pressure tightens when the chip wilts (sensing his dishonesty), forcing him to "tether the chip to something true"—a meaningful deepening. The cost is legible (he carries the song/weight forever, another box will arrive tomorrow), and midnight's approach supplies a clock. However, the escalation mechanism—singing a lullaby causes the chip to glow, which reforms the dancer's arm from "condensed resonance," which then repels shadows—relies on thematic logic rather than clear cause-and-effect under pressure, making the resolution feel more declared than fought-for.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—finding the place where explanations fail—is signaled in the opening and pursued through descent, psychometry, and journal discovery. The psychometry scene provides one meaningful tightening (Riel's compass pointed toward "moments of surrender"), and Elira's decision to leave the compass and enter the passage narrows options with visible cost. However, escalation is largely additive rather than driven by protagonist agency under pressure; obstacles do not materially resist her, and the turn from search to homecoming feels pre-ordained rather than earned through a choice that forecloses a live alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.1)
    One dominant stake—Elara's desire to carve meaning from chaos—is signaled early and deepens when she sees the slide's shifting figures. The on-page carving under storm pressure constitutes one meaningful tightening. However, escalation is muted: the "deadlines, critics, pressure to monetize" are mentioned but never test her in scene, and the resolution (teaching villagers) is recounted rather than dramatized as a choice with visible trade-off. Agency remains contemplative rather than decisional at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding why flowers bloom at night—is signaled early and drives the journey. However, escalation is largely investigative: she travels, kneels, traces glass, discovers encoded blooms. The "tightening" is the accumulation of discovered flowers leading to her weeping realization, which deepens understanding but does not narrow options or force a trade-off with visible cost. Her final painting and vigil feel like continuation rather than a choice that forecloses an alternative path. Under the Accumulative lens one meaningful deepening suffices, but agency remains passive.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake—uncover truth via parley with the lagoon—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening: arranging debris → lagoon responds with light → archivist becomes living archive. However, escalation is textural (density increase) rather than a narrowing of options or a visible trade-off; the archivist's agency reads as ritual performance without on-page friction or cost that forecloses a path. No antagonist or obstacle applies counter-pressure; the lagoon simply "responds" when she arranges debris correctly, bypassing struggle. Under the Accumulative lens, one tightening is sufficient, but the absence of legible price at the ending (she "sleeps little" is told, not shown as a forfeited concrete option) keeps this in mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—reimagining civilization without nostalgia—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the alchemist's nightly work and the townspeople's gradual re-engagement, but there is no meaningful tightening or reversal that narrows options. The lanterns appear as emergent consequence rather than through protagonist agency forcing a trade-off. The alchemist's decisions (placing the bottle in the child's hands, leaving sculptures at crossroads) invite participation but don't foreclose paths or impose visible cost. One tightening or deepening under the Accumulative lens would lift this; instead, the escalation is gradual and unfocused.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—preservation of emotional truth against civic sterilization—is signaled early and remains coherent. The accidental prophecy provides a meaningful tightening: Elira shifts from passive archiving to active awakening, narrowing her options to this exact ritual. However, escalation lacks a visible opposing force or complication; the orchard responds immediately, the petal dissolves on cue, and no resistant element tests her commitment. The businessman's smile serves as proof of concept rather than a cost-bearing consequence. The piece achieves one deepening but does not force a trade-off or foreclose a live path with on-page friction.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—reopening what entropy sealed, preserving life's fragile codes—is signaled early and sustained. Elara's agency is clear (she lifts the cap, walks barefoot, presses it into the dais), but the sequence proceeds without meaningful resistance: the acorn cap sinks "without resistance," the marble "drank it like thirsting earth," and the transformation unfolds as grace rather than contested escalation. No live option is foreclosed; no trade-off between competing goods appears on the page. The cost is conceptual (honoring loss to let it return differently) but remains thematic assertion rather than a visible tactical price that alters her next move.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—restoring credible storm warning without false alarm—is signaled early and coheres through the sensor installation. The rope's tremor ("Not yet") provides one meaningful tightening. However, escalation is muted: the storm arrives with reverence rather than testing her system under duress, and no live trade-off or visible price is paid at the climax. The resolution feels predetermined rather than earned through protagonist struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—honoring celestial deaths to find strength in vulnerability—is signaled early and remains coherent. The rogue comet's arrival provides one meaningful deepening (it dances, plunges, blooms in stillness), but the janitor's response is witnessing rather than agency; no decision narrows options or trades off competing goods. The comet resolves itself (unravels into efflorescence) without protagonist intervention, and the return to sweeping reaffirms rather than transforms his stance. Pressure accumulates but does not tighten into a choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving unspoken weights—is signaled early and held throughout. Pressure accumulates through the recluse's ritual actions (kneeling, tracing, shielding) and the ghosts' hovering presence, but escalation under the Accumulative lens relies on density and pattern rather than a tightening choice that narrows options. The beekeeper's turn is a micro-shift, not a reversal that forces a trade-off with visible cost. The story opts for Earned Stasis (she continues vigil, does not open the box, acknowledges gratitude) without dramatizing a live dilemma where opening or speaking would test her covenant with felt consequence. Agency is endurance without a foreclosed path legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding time's new texture—is signaled early and reweighted at closure when Vey shifts from measuring to curating. One meaningful deepening occurs when the urn fragments fuse, releasing the translucent moments and restoring Vey's heartbeat. Agency is present in the decision to post garage-sale listings and to meet Lira, but the capsule's opening and the fragments' fusion feel more discovered than fought for; coincidence (the tremor, Lira's reply, the letter's instructions) complicates without clear protagonist cost. The final listings demonstrate a stance crystallization, yet the price paid—renouncing the old role—is conceptual rather than viscerally tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Elira's drive to "discover beauty in the incomplete" and her method of tending rupture. The kite-string snap provides a single meaningful complication, and her weaving act narrows options (the original kite cannot be restored). The boy's question "Will it fly?" crystallizes the trade-off, and Elira's answer ("Differently") closes with visible cost: not restoration but transformation. Escalation is modest—one turn rather than multiple reversals—but coherent under the Accumulative lens. Agency is clear in Elira's decision to intervene and reconstruct.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—completing the orchard as a monument to interspecies respect before Arlen dies—is signaled early and remains coherent, but the piece never escalates or tightens. No obstacle appears; the sparrow rescue is resolved in the same beat it arises, villagers bring tea without complication, and Arlen's work proceeds in an unbroken arc from dawn to death. The terminal diagnosis should impose a ticking clock, but time is vague ("final month," "years," "days later") and never forces a trade-off or forecloses an option. The ending delivers renunciation (Arlen lies down and dies), but the cost is pre-set by the diagnosis rather than earned through a protagonist choice that narrows his path.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: understanding the chemistry of homecoming. Pressure accumulates through the protagonist's hypothesis-testing (spectrometer readings, waiting for resonance) and deepens when the data refuses to fit, forcing her to accept that meaning is emergent rather than isolable. The turn—realizing convergence is the reaction—narrows her options: she can no longer pursue purified truth. Cost is conceptual (abandoning her method) and felt (carrying "density" rather than data). Agency is renunciation with on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—restoring a battlefield through ritual planting—is signaled early but never faces meaningful resistance or tightening. The coachman encounters no obstacles; birds answer, soil is scooped, seeds planted, and he leaves planning to return. The sequence is procedural rather than escalating: three pods, three sites, three languages, without a turn or deepening that narrows options. Cost is asserted in backstory ("seventeen winters") but no on-page price is paid or tactic altered by pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake: resurrecting lost voices to translate distance into closeness. The cylinder discovery and bunker expedition constitute one meaningful deepening that broadens the archive from one voice to hundreds. However, Bracken faces no on-page reversal or forced trade-off; Veyra's arrival and the bunker's discovery unfold without complication or visible cost. The resolution—Bracken as living archive—is earned by accumulation rather than protagonist agency under pressure, leaving escalation more additive than tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—turning confusion into exploration through witnessing—is signaled early and sustained. The violet filament's appearance at ~75% provides a meaningful deepening that raises the conceptual cost (she recognizes "why she stayed"). However, the piece lacks a true tightening: no choice forecloses a live alternative, and the filament's peaceful vanishing feels like validation rather than sacrifice. Under the Accumulative lens the pattern break (filament) does reweight the stake, but the cost remains oblique and largely retrospective.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake (mend the sky by amending the board) is signaled early. Yet the swapping action unfolds without opposition, complication, or a visible trade-off; each exchange "sent a tremor" but no live option is foreclosed. The pieces move "on their own" after completion, removing agency from the peak moment. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful tightening is present (the wrong sky worsening), but no on-page cost or narrowed choice accompanies the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: to become the historian of small gestures during the interregnum. Pressure accumulates through the arrival of survivors who walk their own patterns, and the widow's unbinding gesture tightens the mission. The final beat—placing the board before the sovereign and spelling "listen"—feels like a deepening rather than a turn that forecloses options. The sovereign's trembling is described but does not alter on-page tactics or cost. One meaningful accumulation is present but agency remains observational rather than decisional, and no live option is visibly foreclosed with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dominant stake: finding/remembering the shape of home. The piece declares intensification ("remembering became painful") but no on-page reversal or tightening narrows options—the seer performs a ritual, it succeeds, sanctuary appears. Agency is ritual execution rather than a choice with alternatives. The feather and stone function as props in a sequence that unfolds without friction or cost. Under Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is sufficient, but here the accretion does not reweight the stake with visible price; the ending grants rather than tests.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—self-forgiveness—is signaled in the third paragraph and coheres through the labyrinth trial. Pressure accumulates via the tapestries (each thread echoing her own unspoken regrets), then tightens at the mirror where she must confront her past self. The final choice ("I see you" instead of turning away) forecloses the path of self-punishment with visible cost: exile becomes "irrelevant" rather than revoked, an earned endurance. Agency is present in every winnowing choice. No antagonist is required; the woven hush and her own ghost provide sufficient opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—refuse unified truth, preserve complexity—is signaled early and tightens across three sessions (pilgrims, child, self) with escalating intimacy and cost. The child's appearance deepens pressure: the artist must now refract innocence itself, and the spire's dimming mist proves the tactic works. Her final session inverts the method—raw sound instead of verse—and the elders' arrival forces the peak choice. Agency is clear: she remains atop the tower rather than descend with a polished parable, and the whispered phrase closes the loop. The spire's dissolution and the ritual bell mark visible consequence. Under the Accumulative lens, the escalation reads as density increase and cadence shift that reweights the stake with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—complete the statue's restoration before the workshop sinks—is signaled early and pressure accumulates through environmental escalation (fumes thickening, seam splitting). The tightening is primarily situational rather than driven by protagonist choice; the acid sea escalates independently. Agency at closure reads as endurance rather than decision (she "didn't flinch"), but no visible cost accompanies this stance—the golden aura conveniently pushes back all threats. Under the Accumulative lens this qualifies as one meaningful deepening, but the lack of trade-off or foreclosed path weakens the stakes' bite.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—keeping a hidden promise to find where "silence still sings"—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the wrong turn, cave entry, and painting act, culminating in her whispered "I'm still here" and the decision to leave the shell. However, the tightening is atmospheric rather than consequential; no live option is visibly foreclosed with felt cost, and the final renunciation (leaving the shell) lacks an on-page tradeoff or visible price that alters her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—proving whispers travel farther—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening occurs when the scent reaches the ships and the captain's rage dissolves, demonstrating Elara's thesis. However, the tightening lacks genuine resistance; no ship resists the scent, no cost or trade-off is dramatized in the moment of transmission. The Maris Stella captain's transformation is reported as smooth inevitability rather than a struggle that forecloses another path. Agency is present but unopposed, which lowers the felt stakes under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=4.6)
    A dominant stake—navigating loss through cryptic signals—is signaled early, but pressure never escalates. The Tuesday call, the censer hum, and the final singing are parallel rituals without a tightening that narrows options or forces a trade-off. No on-page reversal or deepening; coincidence (the voice replying, the flicker answering) complicates without protagonist agency driving the turn. Closure lacks a visible or felt cost that forecloses a live path.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—cultivating psychological safety—is signaled early and tightens when the three survivors arrive, forcing her to choose between blunt truth and occluded kindness. The tightening is meaningful: she first offers raw honesty, they flinch, she pivots to metaphor, they accept, and she later releases the relic entirely, foreclosing the path of personal control. One visible price (releasing the totem) alters her final stance. The arrival of the survivors is coincidental but complicates rather than resolves, and her agency drives the closure choice.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—decoding the stranger's gesture—is signaled early and coheres throughout. One tightening occurs on night four when the sensory shard narrows interpretation from mystery to deliberate signature, changing Silas's knowledge. The resolution (not reporting, pinning the flower, lighting the lantern) is driven by Silas's stance crystallization under accumulative pressure. However, agency leans heavily on witnessing rather than decision that forecloses a live option with sharp cost; the refusal to report feels predetermined by his character rather than a costly trade-off tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—finding the doorway to honor his sister-promise—is signaled early and sustained. However, escalation is absent: Elias follows ants without obstacle, the arch opens without test, and the letter delivers coordinates with no on-page trade-off. Coincidence resolves (the chip calls him, the arch grants his vow) rather than complicates. No choice narrows options or forecloses a path; the protagonist receives rather than decides, and the creek's rising tension dissipates without altering tactics or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—unraveling recurring dreams—is signaled early, and the climb provides one meaningful tightening as the queen confronts the pool's visions. Yet escalation is largely textural (accumulating imagery) rather than a decision that narrows options; the figure tells her what to do, and she accepts without visible trade-off. The cost of "unbury what you buried" is conceptual and forward-looking, not paid on the page through a forfeited path or irreversible act.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—whether the alchemist can transform Elias's secret into collaborative material—is signaled but never pressured by opposition or scarcity. No reversal tests her resolve; she responds with immediate, unopposed competence (the ritual, the vial, the columella transfer). Elias's confession could deepen pressure, but her instant forgiveness deflates rather than escalates. The ending gesture ("paint the next chapter together") offers conceptual closure without a visible price paid or option foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—distilling chaos into legible narrative—is signaled early and drives the action. However, the escalation under the Accumulative lens is weak: the protagonist encounters past selves, writes about jealousy, then "chases versions of myself through collapsing libraries and burning playgrounds," but these encounters don't meaningfully narrow options or raise cost until the scroll is full. The tightening arrives late ("By dawn, the scroll is full"), and the agency moment (writing through jealousy) lacks visible tradeoffs; the scroll simply "cooperates" once the protagonist commits, making the resolution feel easier than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—can Elara practice aromatherapy without smell?—is signaled early and tightens once when Ren reframes the screw as fulcrum, shifting her self-concept from "fraud" to witness. The remembered client ("tremor in her voice, clench of her jaw") deepens her understanding, but no live option is tested on the page. The pregnant couple encounter and therapy-table vow feel like confirmations rather than choices under competing pressure. One meaningful deepening is present, but agency reads passive and the cost is implied rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—transforming scars from haunting wounds to breathable stories—is signaled early and tightens when the ink threatens to crystallize under stress. Her choice to hum the old lullaby and proceed without rushing or flinching narrows options (she could have fled or let panic win) and the scars shimmer as waypoints by the end. However, the cost is primarily reputational/internal (shedding shame) rather than a visible forfeiture; no live option is demonstrably foreclosed with material consequence. The escalation under the Accumulative lens is coherent—each rune deepens pressure—but lacks the hard-edged trade-off that would lift this into the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—delivering an apology and restoring trust—is signaled early. Pressure tightens when Elias remains silent, then the scent device produces visible memory threads. The manuscript handover is the peak choice, but it arrives without visible trade-off or immediate cost; Elias's acceptance feels granted rather than earned through on-page friction. The orchard's impending destruction functions as atmosphere more than a ticking constraint that narrows tactics. One meaningful deepening occurs (the scent conjuring shared memory), but escalation under the Accumulative lens lacks a second pressure point or a visible price paid before the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—achieving unification through spiral arbitration—is signaled early. However, escalation proceeds through atmospheric description and passive progression ("the spiral arbitration had begun before she arrived... had advanced... completed itself") rather than protagonist agency. No meaningful tightening narrows options; the witness encounters no resistance, makes no trade-offs, and forfeits nothing. The text explicitly notes "None resisted. / None needed to," removing friction entirely. Cost remains conceptual and unproven on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding what clocks truly measure—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. The backward counting and key-turning are presented as habitual ritual rather than a choice under fresh pressure that narrows options. No reversal or complication forces the shepherd to trade one value for another; the station responds as expected, and the ending's "held" moment offers atmospheric pause without a tactical cost or foreclosed path. Agency is observational and repetitive ("Tomorrow, he'd blow the whistle again") rather than a decision that alters later moves.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—widening perspective responsibly—is signaled early and sustained. The scrawl network provides a series of interpretive puzzles, and the father's recognition offers relational pressure. Yet escalation under the Accumulative lens remains additive rather than tightening: each scrawl is another node, not a narrowing of options. The ending's "Begin again" line and clover exchange feel affirming rather than forcing a sacrifice or foreclosing an alternate path. No visible price paid on the page; the cost is conceptual and oblique, not dramatized through a renunciation or lost resource.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—teaching endings how to begin through cultivated estrangement—is signaled early and sustained. The story offers one meaningful deepening: the operator applies her method to herself in the climactic self-call. However, escalation is conceptual rather than pressure-driven; the operator faces no opposition, and her examples (man/librarian, teenager/widower, chef/painter) are told summaries rather than on-page confrontations. The self-call introduces a turn but lacks visible cost in altered options or forfeited paths—"the call never ended" reads as thematic closure rather than a decision with felt consequence. Under the Accumulative lens, the pattern accumulates toward the final reweighting, but the operator's agency remains curatorial and largely unchallenged.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is clearly signaled early: to preserve/regenerate the covenant through witnessing small moments. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure accrues through density and cadence rather than reversal, but no single on-page tightening forecloses a live option or forces a trade-off with visible cost. The archivist's final commitment to return is volitional but uncontested—no friction, loss, or renunciation alters her path. The stakes remain abstract (cultural memory) without a concrete test that narrows her choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—Elara's quest to cure loneliness through reciprocal exchange—is signaled early and tightens through the accumulation of successful trades. Escalation occurs when the moth-eaten coat man approaches with the loneliest-memory ritual, forcing Elara to enact her philosophy at personal cost (sharing monsoon vigils, unanswered calls). The resolution is earned by her choices and the visible warmth transferred. One friction: the secondary characters' transformations (widower teaching tricks, barista reciting recipes) occur off-page in summary, diluting the pressure Elara herself navigates.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—mapping uncharted emotional depths to find the stillpoint—signals early and coheres. The forest tests her with memories (mother's goodbye, brother's laugh dissolving), creating one meaningful deepening when she chooses not to flinch, letting sorrow swell without drowning. The stillpoint encounter delivers a reweighting: grief and joy are harmonics, not opposites. However, escalation is primarily textural accumulation rather than rising tactical pressure; the protagonist walks steadily inward without reversals that narrow options or force trade-offs until the ring-placement, which feels more symbolic than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake (thresh meaning, correct past mistakes) is signaled early but never tested by a live obstacle or choice. Pressure is declared ("paradoxes instead of clarity") yet the editing sequence in paragraph three unfolds without resistance, cost, or failed attempts. The protagonist invites edits; they arrive cooperatively ("a fallen tree re-rooted itself"). No reversal or tightening forecloses an option; the anomaly settles "like a sigh of relief" without visible sacrifice. Escalation under Accumulative lens would require density increase or pattern break that reweights the stake—here the middle adds examples without deepening urgency or narrowing possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake—to translate silence into music—is signaled early but never escalated or tested. Elara's gestures proceed without opposition, cost, or narrowing options. The fisherman's pause and the girl's appearance are reactions, not reversals that force Elara to adapt. No on-page tightening or deepening occurs; the piece accumulates demonstration without a meaningful turn or choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake—"rescue a forgotten promise"—is declared but never tested by on-page opposition or trade-off. She moves from corridor to antechamber to vault without a single tightening that forecloses an option or forces a price. The archive "responds" with tremors and glowing glyphs, cooperating rather than escalating pressure. No reversal or deepening alters her tactics; the pedestal awaits with "no guards, no traps," and she succeeds by touching the portrait. Cost is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether she will silence the voices or weave them into something alive—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure tightens when she moves from passive perching to active drumming, then escalates as the garden responds and "the dream took root." One meaningful deepening occurs when the entangled shift from invaders to collaborators, narrowing her stance from resistance to integration. The cost is legible in "weary" and the permanence of the shared chorus, though the resolution feels more graceful than conflicted; a sharper trade-off would elevate this.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: proving whispers travel farther than shouts (thematically and tactically). The coin's warmth and the map's guidance create one meaningful tightening that narrows Lena's path toward the keyhole. The reversal arrives when the keyhole produces no mechanical result but instead positions her to gather evidence—escalation under the Accumulative lens. Agency is present (she chooses to track, climb, and later plant the map), but the overheard confession is coincidental positioning rather than a choice Lena forces, which caps pressure slightly.

    Dominant stake: whether the drowned woman will remain trapped in despair or be eased into acceptance. The guardian's shutter-weaving accelerates ("wove faster now") when the woman pauses, tightening pressure. The drowned woman's touch and smile constitute the reversal, earned by the guardian's persistent glyph-work. Cost is present but dispersed—the woman still sinks—which keeps resolution from full weight.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—spreading the "humble rebellion"—is signaled early and remains coherent. Elira's agency is present (she places the grotto, synchronizes displays), but the escalation is minimal: one test in the annex, then immediate town-wide success. No reversal, no tightening that narrows options. The reaction vignettes (Mrs. Cho, Jamal, Milo) demonstrate effect but not cost to Elira; she encounters no resistance, no trade-off, no moment where her plan threatens to fail or exact a personal price.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—detaching from "the lie she'd worn" and finding freedom—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. The wading deepens pressure texturally (water to waist, then chest), yet the whale's call and the island's appearance solve the problem without Lira forgoing a concrete alternative or paying a visible price on the page. The final vignettes (kissing the child's forehead, mending the widow's sail, taking the runaway's hand) declare success but do not dramatize a live choice that narrows her options or tests her commitment under resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—surviving mandated happiness without losing grief—is signaled early and escalates when Compliance Officers arrive, forcing the protagonist to craft a compliant artifact. The sealing of the bouquet and the Station visit constitute a meaningful tightening that forecloses authentic mourning with visible cost: the protagonist earns a certificate but must continue hollow performance. Agency is renunciation with on-page cost; the whispered "I miss you" in true silence and the return to whittling demonstrate Earned Stasis under accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=3.6)
    The dominant stake ("to stride through boundaries") is declared but never tested by on-page opposition. No reversal narrows options; the atrium welcomes her without friction, the guardians have vanished. The climax—dancing and stepping onto ice—is surrender rather than choice under pressure. No visible cost: the ban lifted before the story began, so agency does not foreclose a live path.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—awakening the courtyard's spirit—is signaled early and tightens through Elias's arrangements, the reed tongue's vibration, and the courtyard's responses (rosemary twitches, ivy uncurls, birdbath fills with dew). The tightening is driven by protagonist agency: Elias chooses each plant placement as "a plea, each spacing a question." Marta's mirrored action (rearranging charred sunflowers) brings a micro-reversal that deepens the stake—her shift from observer to participant—and the green shoots' emergence provides visible proof of the awakening. Cost is felt in the commitment ("tomorrow, we wake the kiln") and the implicit foreclosure of returning to purely commercial glass work.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—"discover the texture of connection"—is signaled early but remains abstract and unchallenged. No opposition, constraint, or live trade-off narrows Elira's options; she performs each ritual step (lens placement, fork strike, singing) without resistance, error, or cost. The piece accumulates sensory density rather than escalating pressure under the Accumulative lens, yet the tightening is minimal—no foreclosed path, no visible price. The weeping and the lens's glow are outcomes granted by the world, not earned by protagonist agency. Band guardrails for 8.0+ require a tightening that forecloses a live option; here the "pilgrimage" completes unopposed. Apply −0.6 for lack of visible cost and −0.4 for no trade-off under the Non-closure Accumulation Cap.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—offering solace to strangers through coordinates and origami—is signaled early, but no escalation or tightening occurs. She traces the locket, draws the stencil, folds the crane, and leaves it; each step is meditative repetition without a reversal, cost, or choice that narrows options. The offstage discovery ("someone had unfolded one of her offerings") does not alter her course. No agency-driven decision forecloses a path or demonstrates a trade-off with legible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—mapping cultural patterns after systemic collapse—is signaled early and sustained through each beat (cards, measuring tape, journal, convergence points, visitor exchange). Pressure accumulates via density increase: from solo observation to pattern emergence (phoenix stencil, chalk equations) to the visitor's articulation. However, escalation is textural rather than oppositional; no reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off. The cartomancer's stance deepens but does not crystallize under duress, and the visitor's arrival affirms rather than tests her work, which limits the felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: purify memory's grip to break the cycle her daughter inherits. Pressure accumulates as nostalgia-atoms surge and flood her with images, then the arrhythmic hum narrows options by refusing patterns—a tactic that forecloses mourning or rage and releases the motes. The pagoda's shudder and dimming constitute a visible turn; her daughter "would hear this song" is agency with cost (she returns carrying raw truth, not sanitized silence). One meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens, with price legible.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving hope's original texture before it dissolves—is signaled early. Elira's investigative method (comparing footage frame-by-frame) provides procedural pressure, and her discovery that the shadow metamorphosed rather than vanished is a meaningful turn. However, the escalation reads more as accumulative realization than on-page tightening of options; no live obstacle forces a trade-off. The embedding of the stone alters the dream-feed, but we don't see a cost that forecloses another path—Elira's choice feels more ritual fulfillment than agency under duress. Lens is Accumulative/Textural, so one deepening suffices, but the cost clarity at closure remains oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—balancing self-respect and compassion—is established early and tightens through the reconstruction ritual, which becomes both physical act and ethical calculus. One meaningful deepening occurs: the realization that "conviction needed shedding" reweights her options and leads to a multi-part plan (resignation, testimony, new sanctuary). Agency is present in the decision to act rather than flee, and the cost is legible (anonymity, savings, isolation). The escalation is contemplative rather than dramatic, fitting the Accumulative lens, but the peak choice arrives without a moment of visible hesitation or trade-off that would sharpen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Elira's search for the displaced miracle to "translate" rather than resurrect—is signaled early and tightens once (the tunnel opens, she retrieves the seed). No meaningful reversal or cost-laden choice appears: the roots part "by invitation," the seed dissolves willingly, and no live option is foreclosed. The piece delivers one beat of intensification (descent and retrieval) but lacks a second pressure point or visible tradeoff that would raise escalation into the strong band.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—finding where unused love is stored—is signaled early and pursued consistently. The sequence film → projectionist's napkin → letters provides accumulative deepening rather than reversal. However, escalation lacks meaningful resistance: each discovery yields to the next without friction, and the final choice (to mail the letters) encounters no obstacle or trade-off. The cost of carrying and releasing is asserted thematically but not dramatized through a specific loss or complication that narrows her options.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.2)
    One dominant stake is signaled: freeing trapped creativity. The winter escalation ("voices grew louder—not pleading, but furious") tightens pressure, and her response (tracing "dozens, hundreds" of meteors) deepens the action. However, the escalation is emotional intensity rather than a narrowing of options or a trade-off with visible cost. The resolution—voices "released," she "finally, truly, rested"—is told rather than shown through a protagonist decision that forecloses a path. Agency is present but the cost at closure is conceptual, not felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is clear: cultivate sparks in unlit corners by charming dormant wave functions. The guard's action (humming a single note to coax the sphere into coherence) creates one meaningful pressure point, and the sphere's awakening narrows his immediate goal—but no reversal or complication tests his commitment. The trembling second hand reweights the opening stalemate, yet the guard faces no visible trade-off or loss; his unopposed competence flattens escalation under the Accumulative lens, where pressure should deepen through pattern break or cadence shift that imposes cost.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—rediscovering the "wild frontier of his mind"—is signaled early and sustained. The Edge crossing provides one meaningful tightening where legend warns of unraveling. However, the protagonist faces no visible trade-off or loss: he steps forward without renouncing a path, and the void "invites him in" rather than testing commitment. The gear becoming a key feels like a convenient unlock rather than a choice that forecloses options with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—finding where unused courage waits—is signaled early and remains coherent throughout. The guides' pilgrimage deepens at the ridge's crest when they discover the shoe and whistle, reweighting the abstract quest into concrete artifacts of halted bravery. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens is modest: the guides move with "gently persistent grace" and encounter no reversals or tactical friction. The final vigil crystallizes their stance, but the cost (patience, reverence, shared burden) is conceptual and soft rather than a visible forfeiture that alters later options.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clearly signaled: safety versus silence, tested when the child arrives with a tin whistle. The bellhop's choice to restore the bolt and press middle C is protagonist-driven and narrows options with visible risk (structural collapse, breaking his vow). One meaningful tightening occurs when the grandmother asks permission; the climax—playing the note—reweights the premise. The note does not shatter the fortress, but the cost (years of frozen caution, the gamble on sound) is legible. No coincidental rescue; agency is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.0)
    One dominant stake: unmask the pretender. The piece tightens once—from solitary planting to the converging witnesses to the fountain revelation—and that turn narrows the pretender's escape. However, the protagonist's agency is largely preparatory; the climactic exposure happens through the secondary cast's discovery and the pellet's reaction, not through a choice she makes in the closure beat. The cost (declining the throne) is declared but not tested on the page by a competing pull or visible sacrifice. Under the Accumulative lens, the pressure coheres but does not escalate tactically after the midpoint; the ending reconfigures meaning but without a felt trade-off that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—why some paths disappear—is signaled early and tightens once when Elara discovers ECHO's hidden sonar logs, narrowing options and reweighting her method (listening with hands rather than eyes). The tapping practice and CALYPSO's 17-second lag create coherent pressure under the Accumulative lens. Agency is present: Elara assembles fragments, digs through code, descends in the submersible. The resolution (teaching others to tap) is earned by the prior causality, though the shift from solitary discovery to communal teaching is summarized rather than dramatized, weakening the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering meaning in post-rebellion lull—is signaled early and tightens once when the stone circle's hum syncs with her heartbeat, prompting the whispered aria that seeds reassembly. However, escalation is environmental (the stones respond, the lights flicker) rather than driven by protagonist agency or a hard choice that forecloses a path. The gathering of others is told through indirect perception ("she knew") rather than a visible cost or decision. One meaningful deepening is present but the price remains implicit.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—unsealing the embryo to restore collective identity—signals early and escalates through one meaningful tightening when the vines steady her and the chant fuses plant-whispers with glyphs. The resolution (embryo dissolving into mist, seeding the land) is driven by the grandmother's renunciation of singular control, an act of agency with visible cost (the artifact is gone, power distributed). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens. The final reweighting—seedlings emerging, children asking questions—narrows the path from decree to possibility. No antagonist appears, but the Council's prior sealing provides background opposition. One weakness: the embryo's cooperative dissolution lacks friction; it answers her offer without resistance, softening the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—anchoring optimism in realism after trauma—is signaled early and tightens when the freeze at the cypress becomes a moment of reception rather than terror. One meaningful deepening: the photograph shifts from anchor/burden to compass, foreclosing the path of pure survival and opening witness-as-practice. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens through repeated dawn visits and the decision to leave unsigned sketches, each a micro-renunciation of control. The cost is visible: tears without timing, the gap climbed daily, the arboretum as necessary collaborator. No antagonist required; the protagonist's internal calculus between grief and green things pushing through drives escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—meeting fractures to find "the shape of a new whole"—is signaled early but remains abstract. One meaningful tightening occurs when she steps onto the stitched tapestry and the lighthouse groans, walls close in, sea rises vertically; this narrows physical and perceptual space. Yet the tightening is coincidental (the world responds to her foot contact) rather than driven by her agency trading one option for another. No visible price is paid; the transformation is described as "luminescent ache" and "bone must break to grow," but no specific capability, memory, or path is foreclosed on the page. The ending offers Charged Poise (the box hums, walls still intimate with collapse), but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—discovering why time slows in crisis—is signaled immediately and sustained. The piece escalates through accumulation: observation → ink experiment → revelation ("time didn't slow for the world—it slowed for the witness") → self-application. The tracker's agency drives each beat, culminating in the choice to apply ink to her temples and command "Show me." The final disappearance carries conceptual cost (she steps into a pattern "that doesn't return"), though the trade-off between staying and vanishing could be sharpened with more visible hesitation or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether to release the letter—is signaled early and tightens through the archivist's internal calculus ("duty demanded suppression, conscience demanded detonation"). Escalation under the Accumulative lens proceeds through density: the letter's scent floods the chamber, the Resonance Table pulses, emotional resonance transmits virally. The reversal is clean: from seventeen winters of suppression to one decisive act, with the cost landing across multiple scales (her erasure, the regime's panic, the populace's awakening). The protagonist's agency drives the turn; coincidence does not resolve. The price is felt conceptually (her legend replaces her name) and socially (the city's limbic infection), meeting the lens's demand for reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—cultivating peace in a post-collapse world—is signaled early and held throughout. However, the piece offers no meaningful tightening or escalation under the Accumulative lens: each visitor encounter (man, child) demonstrates the same gesture (gift, silence, teaching) without raising cost or narrowing options. The knife-sheathing ritual is repeated but not tested; no on-page moment forces Elara to choose between competing goods or pay a visible price. The deepening is conceptual but not felt in scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (catch the echo) is signaled early and pursued throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when the fisher matches the feral lullaby pitch and the garden shudders, narrowing options. Agency is present (voicing silence, slamming spike) but the fisher's moves feel procedural rather than forced by escalating cost. The echo's release forecloses the hunt with visible cost (spike destroyed, echo carried by constellations), but coincidence—the constellation drifting close at the right moment—aids rather than complicates the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—exposing a cover-up—is signaled early and sustained. Her method (proof by contradiction) provides a procedural tightening, but the escalation is intellectual rather than situational; no new complication arises on the page to test her resolve. The journalist's call and the archive's smoke pattern are prior discoveries, so the scene itself unfolds as execution rather than pressure-under-fire. The email dispatch forecloses silence with conceptual cost, but the lack of on-page resistance or trade-off keeps this in mid-range rather than high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (hushing dissonance of old guilt) is signaled early but remains abstract. The supposed escalation—discovering letters, the machine's accusatory cries—does not narrow her options; she proceeds to the ritual without visible tradeoff or cost. The father's voice thanking her is a coincidental resolution: the machine itself provides absolution rather than her choice forfeiting something on the page. No tightening forecloses a live option; the ending grants her peace without dramatized price.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering meaning in the mess—is signaled early and sustained. A single meaningful tightening occurs when she places the tile flake at the mandala's center and the whispers synchronize, then dissolve. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens requires a deepening that reweights the stake with cost; here the protagonist's interjection ("by altering the next swirl of her finger, diverting a line, softening an angle") resolves the problem without visible trade-off. The "lilac unease bloomed into something warmer—not peace, not joy, but recognition" describes emotional shift without showing what she renounced or what path closed. No persistent constraint shapes her tactics; the mandala responds cooperatively, and she leaves it "untouched" with no on-page consequence for abandoning it.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: redefining mercy from passive to active, justice-wielding force. Elira's kneeling refusal to rise before the magistrate and her placement of the tessera in his hand offer one meaningful pressure point that shifts his stance. However, the escalation is largely ceremonial; no live opposition tests her new mercy in action, and the survivors' participation feels unanimous rather than conflicted. The cost of her choice—what door she closes by renaming—is implied but not dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (lure possibility from despair) but remains abstract throughout. The ghost's spinning of the tarot coin and her seven-note song are presented as successful without resistance, negotiation, or visible trade-off. The three echo-figures respond immediately; no reversal or tightening tests the ghost's commitment. The ending reweights her own dissolution, which qualifies as a deepening under the Accumulative lens, but the lack of on-page friction or cost legibility keeps escalation modest.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—illuminate hidden pathways to reach Mateo—is signaled early and persists. One meaningful deepening occurs when the geode and studio tech converge to produce Mateo's voice, shifting from internal searching to external signal. However, the tightening is atmospheric rather than costly: no live option is foreclosed, no resource spent, no visible price paid. The static shock as "key" and the FDA recall as backstory complicate but don't test protagonist agency under live pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—documenting and voicing dormant human emotions—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure tightens when the fossil grows warm and floats, forcing her to shift from passive observation to active thermal call-and-response. The move from "not to observe, but to participate" is protagonist-driven and forecloses the prior solitary stance with on-page cost (the fossil dissolves, her isolation ends). One meaningful escalation point; the piece does not require multiple reversals at this length, and the final reconfiguration is legible under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—unscrambling the prophet's final words to transform prophecy into shared possibility—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through her cataloging ritual and the echo's resistance, then shifts when the echo speaks clearly and she begins distributing jars. However, no on-page reversal narrows her options with visible cost; the transition from solitary work to teaching happens off-page ("She began leaving small jars"), and the cliffs' final trembling is environmental rather than protagonist-driven. One meaningful deepening occurs when the echo's clarity prompts her methodological shift, but the cost is conceptual rather than felt in a specific forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—planting truth for reckoning—is signaled early and deepens through her physical struggle and the choice to leave the pillbox as a marker. One meaningful tightening occurs: she moves from seeking unused courage to realizing it was left behind in the act itself. The cost is conceptual (walking away, trusting an unseen future) rather than a visible forfeiture that alters immediate options. Escalation is present but more textural than causal; no reversal narrows her choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—distilling complexity, offering the needle to unpick grief—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, escalation is minimal: the coachman never faces a competing pressure that tests his resolve, and the passenger's acceptance of the needle arrives without prior resistance or visible tradeoff. The rain-gutter ticking functions as a temporal marker but does not tighten tactics; the crossing unfolds without reversal or complication. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is sufficient, but here the final beat restates the opening gesture rather than reweighting it through on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is clear: understanding why places resist change, manifested on-page as aligning the glass, interpreting the thrum, molding the pot. Pressure tightens through the bee's arrival and the lantern's brightening, narrowing options toward a stance of non-interference. Agency is visible in pouring water and choosing not to fire the kiln, forecloses permanence with felt cost. One meaningful deepening suffices; the final choice—leaving the pot soft—trades stasis for breath, a visible tradeoff that charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—transforming neighborhood despair into wonder via reflected light—is signaled early and tightens once through the circuit of prism placements, culminating in the child's laughter and the gardener's certainty. Agency is present (she chooses each angle, each corner) but the escalation is gentle accumulation rather than a forced choice with visible trade-off. The final cost (departure, mission complete, grief transformed) is felt but not urgent. One meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves, and pressure coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: preserve the library's alignment and translate isolation into independence. The cloud-tide surge forces one meaningful tightening—Veyra must physically channel her resonance into the sundial when the stone circle falters, a direct test of her commitment. Her choice to whisper coordinates of possible species (not resurrection of past ones) narrows options and reweights her role from archivist to midwife. However, the antagonistic pressure is environmental coincidence rather than protagonist-driven escalation; the hum "falters" without prior causality linking it to her actions. Cost is felt (she expends her atomic resonance) but the trade-off remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake ("find the thread") is signaled but remains abstract throughout. The twig spiral's arrival prompts action, but the sequence (write names → fold birds → step into pool → dissolve) unfolds without reversal or visible cost. No option is foreclosed; Aris's transformation is frictionless and unopposed. Escalation is metaphorical accumulation rather than narrowing pressure. The piece gestures at mystical stakes but never tests commitment with a trade-off or loss legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—prevent the tricksters from corroding the community—is signaled early and tightens when Elira "took the controls" after oversight dissolves, then escalates when the signal "pulsed with irritation" and the tricksters realize "its prey had teeth." The counter-frequency test at 2:17 a.m. is a clear reversal that narrows options (students calm, barricades come down). Cost is visible: Elira stays awake until dawn, knows the tricksters will return, and accepts ongoing vigilance ("next time, they'd find her ready"). Agency is decision and endurance under pressure, and coincidence (the rally broadcast timing) complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—find the harmonic cipher to restore spatial balance—is signaled early. The narrowing passage creates one tightening when Elara must choose to squeeze forward despite her phobia. Yet the organ's appearance and the key's dissolution into her body feel coincidental rather than driven by her prior choices; the resolution rewards arrival, not agency. The final "rebellion gentle, wistful, and utterly complete" declares victory without showing a trade-off or visible cost that alters her options.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (awakening empathy via solving the disappearances) is signaled early and sustained. The middle tightens as Elira descends into the quarry and stages the portrait gallery. However, the killer's voluntary appearance and immediate confession bypass a direct test of Elira's methodology; she waits and he arrives, removing the pressure of pursuit or confrontation. The cost at closure is social (no courtroom justice) but not personal to Elira—she gains the masks and town empathy without visible sacrifice or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—proving her theories to reverse exile—is signaled early and tightens when Elara finds Captain Riel's stanza. The resonance-board sequence escalates pressure (alarms blare, sky groans), but the storm's cooperation feels granted rather than won through a trade-off. Elara questions the storm and it answers; no visible price is paid, no option foreclosed. The resolution rewards her without dramatizing what she surrendered or risked losing in the act of control.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dominant stake: internal permission to begin again, signaled in the opening "sculpt possibility from the ashes of 'never.'" One deepening occurs when the glass flake warms and the hitchhiker's fate is reinterpreted, narrowing the fiddler's self-imposed exile. The final step forward and reweighting of "never" constitute a stance crystallization under Accumulative/Textural pressure. However, no live option is dramatized as foreclosed; the fiddler does not choose between competing paths with visible cost. The hitchhiker's vanishing and the fiddler's playing are presented as atmospheric rather than goal-driven—coincidence complicates but does not test commitment. Cost legibility is weak: "years holding still" is asserted in summary, not shown as a lived price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—discovering why paths circle back—is signaled early but remains philosophical rather than urgent. The startup's collapse is recounted in summary ("algorithms glitching, clients fleeing, CFO absconding") without on-page reversals or protagonist agency driving the failure. The territorial markers (chalk, ribbons, stones) are laid out but do not face a test; no one trespasses, no decision is forced. The think-tank pivot occurs off-page, so no live choice narrows options or imposes felt cost. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure accumulates in density and image rather than escalation, but the final "dancing in the loop" reweights meaning without a visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—continuing the burden-transfer chain—is signaled early and coheres. Pressure tightens when the telegram arrives and deepens in the dream encounter, but the resolution (singing to redistribute the burden) introduces a new capability without prior constraint or visible cost. The guardian's gratitude affirms success rather than complicating it. No loss or omission alters later tactics; the chronicler's song works on the first attempt. One meaningful tightening occurs (the summons), but escalation relies on告assertion rather than a dramatized trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—confronting buried truths—is signaled early and sustained, but escalation operates through accretion of visions rather than narrowing tactical options. The seed's method ("through expanding circles") describes the process but doesn't dramatize a choice that forecloses a path. The druid's agency reads passive: she kneels, the seed acts, visions arrive, transformation completes. No reversal or tightening alters her available moves; the journey from guarded to revealed lacks a visible price paid in renounced capability or relationship.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake: unseal the eclipsed covenant to restore dream-path legitimacy. The protagonist faces no on-page opposition, no failed attempt, no cost that narrows options—she arrives, walks to the center, plants the clipping, and the ritual succeeds without friction. The "future arrived early" premise promises temporal pressure but delivers none; the glade and clipping cooperate fully. The final merging reconfigures meaning under an accumulative lens, but escalation is absent: each step is facilitated, not fought for, and the ending reads as mystical consummation without a visible price paid or option foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—whether meaning can be inlaid to barter destinies—is signaled early and accumulates pressure through the confrontation with Kael. One meaningful tightening occurs when Kael lunges and the roots physically intervene, forcing him to acknowledge the orchard's agency. Elira's agency is consistent (touch, song, card placement), though the resolution tilts toward the orchard's action rather than a protagonist choice that forecloses a path. The visible cost at closure is muted; Kael's loosening grip implies future change but does not dramatize an irreversible price paid in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: discovering purpose after emotional shutdown. Pressure coheres through the accumulative lens—morning ritual, Ruiz's prodding, the cloth catching light—and tightens when Jasper types "Project Echo," a decision that forecloses his insulating habit with visible cost (vulnerability, uncertainty). The choice is protagonist-driven and narrows options. Minor limitation: the foreman's appearances feel slightly episodic rather than escalating; a second on-page complication would lift this into the 7.8+ range. Cost is legible but resides more in stance shift than immediate consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—reestablishing dialogue with the haunted ambition—is signaled early and tightens through Elira's methodical acts: speaking alignment, drawing signs, inventing forgiveness. The seed's trembling and eventual split constitute one meaningful deepening. Agency is clear: her choices (not planting immediately, adding the invented sign, stepping back) foreclose the monument path with visible cost. Escalation is gentle but coherent under the Accumulative lens; no sharp reversals are needed here, though a second beat of resistance or refusal would have raised pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake is signaled early ("to preserve wonder in routine"), but no on-page reversal or tightening narrows her options; she completes each ritual step without friction or visible trade-off. The creel's immersion and glyph-catching are presented as seamless transformations rather than decisions under pressure. The ending repeats the cycle ("the next creel waited") without escalation or cost that forecloses a path. Under an Accumulative lens escalation may manifest as density increase or cadence shift, but here the texture remains consistent throughout—no meaningful tightening or deepening reweights the stake with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—activating the pearl to reverse isolation—is signaled early and sustained. Escalation proceeds through the confession ritual: each spoken hope intensifies the glow and thins the barriers, tightening pressure under the Accumulative lens. The final act (crowning herself) is protagonist-driven and forecloses her prior identity with visible cost: the pearl vanishes, she becomes conduit. One meaningful deepening occurs when the confessions layer and the cave responds harmonically, narrowing her path to surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—self-forgiveness via methodical mapping—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through graffiti discoveries and accordion sessions, but escalation under the Accumulative lens requires a meaningful tightening or deepening that narrows options; here the protagonist encounters progressively resonant graffiti yet her tactics (mapping, playing, weeping) don't meaningfully shift in response. The final departure ("played until her fingers cramped") suggests endurance but not a trade-off or foreclosed path with on-page cost. Agency is present but the cost clarity needed for higher bands is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—finding the library of unspoken words—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or cost. The watch guides her without friction, shelves rearrange obligingly, and every discovery succeeds. No reversal narrows options; the "propagation delays" mechanic is described but does not force a trade-off or alter her tactics. The ending's recursion twist is conceptual but carries no felt price—she "becomes the archive" without forfeiting a live option or enduring visible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake is clear: authenticate the violin or propagate truth via resonance, weighing dream against empire. One meaningful tightening occurs when the coffee-stain prophecy shows the bridge collapsing and Elira decides to sound the violin, narrowing options from passive authentication to active disruption. However, the escalation relies on magical properties (ice melts into seeds, vines grow from shadow) rather than Elira's agency under constraints; she observes the transformation more than she drives it. The Chancellor's arrival complicates but does not force a trade-off; Elira's choice to play the violin is visible but the cost (physical, relational, or renunciatory) is not legible on the page—she steps back into clover without forfeit.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—capturing the scholar's lucid threshold before oblivion—is signaled early. Pressure is linear: the beautician performs each step of the ritual without complication, and no reversal narrows her options. The scholar's cooperation eliminates friction, and the chip's success is never in doubt. The final turn (her decision to one day infuse her own spark) deepens the theme but does not escalate on-page conflict or impose a visible cost scaled to the ritual she just completed.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (finding the source of contentment) is signaled in paragraph four and deepened at the grotto when Elara realizes contentment is "returned to" rather than found—a meaningful reconfiguration. The hairpin's replacement enacts agency as endurance/renunciation, forecloses vindictive attachment with visible cost ("her fingers trembled… from the weight of release"). Under the Accumulative lens, one tightening suffices. Weakness: no second on-page reversal or complicating pressure; the climb and reflection proceed smoothly without an antagonistic beat or surprise that tests her resolve, keeping escalation modest for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—whether to shed certainty and its armor—is signaled early and tightens once: the chimes' "Unhook" command forces the choice, and yanking the clasp narrows options irreversibly. The cloak resists ("Certainty clings harder than guilt"), raising cost before she succeeds. Her vow to offer questions instead of certainty in future client encounters forecloses the old path with visible professional risk. One meaningful tightening and visible cost meet the length requirement under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—teaching Kael to vanish so he can appear—is signaled early and maintained. The stone-toss moment creates a micro-turn (frustration → fascination → recognition) that tightens Kael's readiness. However, escalation remains conceptual; no live choice forces a trade-off on the page. Elira withholds explanation, but this is pedagogy, not conflict that narrows her options. The ending defers the true test ("tomorrow, you'll throw the stone"), so the pressure crystallizes without paying a visible cost in this scene window.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake ("to navigate without moving") is declared but never tested by an on-page tightening or reversal that narrows options. The crow flock's flight delivers information passively; the skimmer registers it without agency, trade-off, or visible cost. No escalation under any lens—pressure remains static assertion rather than dramatized deepening or choice-driven turn.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Lior's need to reconcile failure with magic's true nature—is signaled early and coheres throughout. The unstrapping and mist-walk provide one meaningful tightening that narrows options (trust the mist or remain isolated). The cloud-tree encounter deepens understanding rather than reversing fortune, fitting the Accumulative lens. Cost is visible: Lior relinquishes the keystone and his ambition for greatness. Agency is present in the decision to hold the stone bare and step into the mist, though the figure's explanation feels slightly delivered rather than earned through dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (discover the color of sound) is signaled early and pursued consistently. The dive represents meaningful escalation—physical risk plus the revelation of the pre-signed vow narrows his existential options. The ledger discovery provides one clear reversal that reweights his understanding of his purpose. However, the protagonist's agency is compromised by the predetermined signature; he's confirming fate rather than choosing under conflicting pressures. Cost is legible in the shift from searching to signifying, though the lack of a live tradeoff (no competing want vs. fear at the peak) keeps this from higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—finding meaning/purpose in the contracted universe—is signaled early and tightens when the unbidden static vision offers a new understanding. One meaningful deepening occurs: her realization that the prophecies are "echoes of what had already been chosen" reconfigures her relationship to chance and agency. However, the escalation lacks a visible trade-off or external pressure test; the shift from passivity to action happens internally without a prior scene beat that forces her to choose between competing costs, leaving the turn under-dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is legible early: transforming grief into bearable form by naming terrors so others carry less weight. Pressure accumulates through the ritual's progression (placing the page, calling scattered light, naming each monster), and the final pulse of the crystallized page confirms the stakes' resolution. However, the reaper faces no on-page opposition or complication; the ritual succeeds without friction, cost, or trade-off beyond the abstract burden of eternal remembrance, which limits escalation's bite.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—righting cosmic imbalance—is signaled early and tightens when the resin sets and the bell is released. The mage's agency is clear: he chooses to let the bell fall, relinquishing control with visible cost (no proof, only faith). One meaningful escalation: the sea stirs, then the fish breaches, confirming the gamble. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens. Minor gap: the middle section (dripping-rate exposition) is methodical rather than tense; we never see a moment where failure seems likely, only patient success.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: Elias's mandate to "expunge the myth before panic took root" versus his emerging conviction to honor memory. The tightening occurs when he kneels at the gazebo and realizes his true task, foreclosing the erasure path. Escalation is clear and driven by protagonist agency: cataloging → murmuring stories → arranging the shrine → confronting the supervisor. The cost is legible on the page: permanent reassignment that binds him to Hollowmere, a visible price that charges the final image of his perpetual walks. One credible reversal (the supervisor's acceptance rather than arrest) feels earned by the public witness of the locals.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—harmonizing logic and intuition—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or scarcity. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; the ritual unfolds as wish-fulfillment sequence where flame responds "not to her command, but to her surrender" without dramatized risk or failed attempt. The ending grants the alchemist her goal without visible trade-off, forfeiture, or altered tactic shaped by prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: preserve communal trust when silence screams. One meaningful tightening occurs when the arbor trembles and she must act without instructions, choosing the buckle-chime to prevent panic—a decision that forecloses the option of silence or flight. The escalation is driven by protagonist agency (she adapts old signals, reads the hush, strikes the buckle) and the cost is legible on the page: lanterns blink acknowledgment, trust holds, and she must now walk toward the next arbor to repeat the burden. Under the Accumulative lens, the pressure coheres through the silence/signal pattern and reweights at the chime moment. Minor issue: the middle passage's reflection on the past village failure adds context but does not materially narrow present options in the arbor scene.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—defeating numbness to feel without ownership—is signaled early and tightens when Kael's silence collapses the judges' noise, then deepens when he channels resonance into the jar, narrowing the custody battle to irrelevance. The duplicate's declaration ("I do not want to inherit it") and Kael's reply ("Live the answer") constitute a meaningful turn that forecloses the fight-over-relic path. Cost is legible: the battle dissolves, warmth returns, numbness shatters "like ice under spring sun." Agency reads as endurance and invitation rather than force, fitting the Accumulative lens. However, the judges' retreat and history's final rewrite feel more like atmospheric ratification than hard-won consequence—pressure is coherent but the price could land more visibly on Kael's body or immediate future.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—restoring lost laughter to his household through ritual—is signaled early and sustained. However, escalation is weak: each tunnel visit mirrors the prior without meaningful tightening or a choice that forecloses an option. The "giggle ricochets" beat offers sensory feedback but no tactical shift; he continues the same ritual. The ending "begins again" confirms Earned Stasis but lacks on-page pressure that narrowed his options or forced a trade-off. Cost (isolation, futility) is ambient rather than acutely felt at a decisive moment. No antagonist or reversal tests his commitment; coincidence (the tunnel sometimes "sings back") complicates but does not escalate.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—making friends with uncertainty, escaping dimensional homesickness—is signaled early and coheres. The tightening arrives when the guardian presses the pendant to its forehead, boundaries shimmer as invitations rather than walls, and it places the pendant in the statue's hand; the statue's eyes opening and asking "Friend?" is a meaningful reversal that narrows options (companionship now possible, exile status shifted). The final act of offering its paw to a new traveler forecloses the old hollow waiting with visible emotional cost (vulnerability, trust required). One clean escalation under the accumulative lens with agency-driven closure.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: vivify the crozier to prove creative destruction works. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elric adds his blood and corrects cadence mid-ritual, narrowing his options ("not mastery, but motion"). The crozier's tremor and reborn serpent head deliver a visible pressure point. However, no live antagonist or external cost appears; the transition from failure-prone to "becoming" reads as internal shift rather than a choice that forecloses a concrete path with on-page price. The "held breath before the thaw" tone suspends tension but does not escalate it through a second reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—tuning to find "the beginning in every ending"—is signaled early and coheres across the piece. Pressure accumulates through image and ritual (fragment placed, moon crests, wind stills, pulse arrives) but does not tighten through protagonist agency or a trade-off that narrows options. The final "tuning" succeeds without visible cost, obstacle, or failed attempt; the towers respond smoothly and she descends satisfied. One meaningful deepening occurs (fragment dissolves, city awakens) but lacks the felt price or foreclosed path required for higher bands under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—merging parallel timelines so souls have "a single, solid world to call home"—is declared midway but never dramatized as a choice with competing costs. The deckhand's descent into the grotto and radio tuning unfold without resistance, setback, or internal friction; he "didn't hesitate," "didn't sleep," "didn't eat much" but never sacrifices a concrete option or faces a tactical dilemma. The seven ferries converge through his humming and the hourglass igniting, which reads as mystical coincidence rather than protagonist agency narrowing options. No reversal or tightening forces a trade-off; the deckhand's final return to surface work resets to his opening cheer without visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake ("to discover the texture of connection") is signaled early but remains abstract and never tested by a concrete obstacle or trade-off. The architect encounters resistance ("mirrors began reflecting versions of her that hadn't lived her life… They mouthed warnings she couldn't hear. She ignored them"), but she dismisses it immediately without tactical adjustment or felt cost. The gallery's eruption is presented as "culmination" and "revelation" rather than a reversal that narrows her options. No on-page tightening forces a sacrifice or forecloses a path; the thread's release functions as narrative reward rather than agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—teaching celestial navigation in an alien-altered cosmos—is signaled early and remains coherent. Kael's question about Vega drifting offers a brief teaching beat, and the power fluctuation creates atmospheric pressure, but neither narrows Elira's options or forces a trade-off. The semester-end summary tells us students succeed without dramatizing a pivotal teaching failure, breakthrough, or cost. No reversal or escalation: Elira begins confident in her method and ends the same way, mounting the chain link as a static symbol. The story accumulates detail but does not tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—freeing the girl from her haunted waiting—is signaled early and narrows once when the tracer finds her and chooses to kneel rather than pull. The syncopated pulse provides a coherent pressure thread, though the escalation is more atmospheric accumulation than a turn that forecloses options. Agency manifests as the tracer's choice to assure and the girl's choice to take her hand, but the cost (ending the vigil) is more stated than dramatized through resistance. No antagonist or secondary complication tests the commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—returning presence to the unremembered—is signaled early and the tidal timeframe imposes a live constraint. The descent tightens spatially (fissure → stairwell → control hub) and the phase-transition activation is a meaningful turn that narrows options (the gold fleck is spent, the chamber seals). However, the protagonist faces no on-page dilemma that forces a trade-off; she executes her plan without complication, and the resolution (figures appear, gratitude conveyed, protagonist climbs out) unfolds without visible cost beyond the fleck's depletion, which was always the intended outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: retrieval of coherence for the digital ghosts (and by extension, Aris's own anchoring in a world that erased him). The defragmentation sequence is the one meaningful tightening; the ink's dendritic bloom narrows the ghosts from pleading chaos to patterned hum. Agency is present—Aris initiates the sequence, places the shard as totem—but the cost is more conceptual than visceral: he will remain legally dead, a hollow in the world. The escalation is sufficient under the Accumulative lens, though the price could be more immediate and visible on the page to reach higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: revive the lost language by translating texture into sound. Pressure tightens when the birds arrive and the diamond awakens, creating a single meaningful escalation. Agency is present (she raises the diamond, speaks), but the resolution hinges on the canyon's autonomous response rather than a choice that forecloses a live option with visible cost. The flock's cooperation and the diamond's cooperation feel granted rather than hard-won, reducing the felt price of success.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—releasing the Gravity Dancer to transmute bitterness—is signaled early but never tested by a competing want or forced trade-off. The arrowhead's activation proceeds without complication or reversal; no on-page agency choice by Elara narrows options (she "grips," "presses SEND," and the metamorphosis simply "began"). The piece offers spectacle (floating books, spiraling light, walls dissolving) but no escalation under pressure: no prior attempt that fails, no cost that alters tactics, no moment where Elara must sacrifice something live to achieve release.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—reawakening the orchard—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening occurs when the statues begin to weep and kneel, shifting from threat to gardener. However, the protagonist's success is never in doubt; no reversal tests her commitment, and coincidence (the statues simply respond as hoped) drives the resolution. The cost (locust shell turning to dust) is mentioned but does not visibly narrow her future options or force a trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—reuniting Lena's eight-year-old daughter with a promise via storm-signal—is clear and emotionally charged. The drone-border constraint (heat signatures, AI patrols) creates tactical pressure, and Marla's storm-interference trick narrows the method to one gambit. However, escalation is minimal: the mailman proposes the reroute, Marla agrees, the drone launches, and the plan succeeds off-page with no reversal or complication. The cost is conceptual (the storm's absence leaves "his chest heavier") rather than a visible forfeiture that alters his next move. Agency at closure is passive observation—he watches the drone vanish—rather than a decision under competing pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—restoring the carousel as sanctuary—is clear, but escalation is minimal. The carpenter encounters no obstacles; the wrong turn leads directly to the hidden train, the halo glows cooperatively, the horses stir without resistance. His "quietly persistent" work proceeds unopposed from discovery to completion. One tightening occurs when he begins to "sing" and the carousel responds, but this reads as confirmation rather than a turn that narrows options. The lack of friction or trade-off keeps the score below 7.0; pressure accumulates texturally but never forces a choice with on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake (find the place where stories live) is signaled early. One tightening: stepping through the tessellation into the amphitheater. But no on-page opposition or cost—she succeeds without friction, the scarf works, the orbs respond. Agency is present (she chooses to step through, to sing) but consequences are satisfaction, not sacrifice. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen via pattern or cadence shift; here the final beat adds wonder but not weight.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—capturing the runaway dream—is signaled early and sustained, but escalation under the Accumulative lens is minimal: the dream "resisted" and "darted between islets" in summary, not through on-page reversals that narrow options. The climactic palette-mixing beat lacks a visible trade-off or price; the librarian gathers the three light components (blush, gold, indigo) without struggle, and the dream appears without complication. The resolution feels granted rather than earned through protagonist agency, and no credible cost (loss of another dream, relinquishing the search, foreclosing a path) is dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake ("free an idea trapped behind fear") is signaled early, but pressure never tightens: the locksmith never raises his voice, never draws a blade, doors surrender, mirrors shatter into stardust at the touch of a ribbon with no cost. No reversal or deepening narrows options; the idea floats free because the locksmith "simply" acts. The ending asserts a future consequence ("a child would one day speak love") without showing the locksmith forfeit anything on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—recovering stolen memories—is signaled early and tightens through her charting work until the mushroom-pulse breakthrough. The orchard's revelation (it feeds on emotional rupture to survive) meaningfully reweights her options: leave and warn others, or stay and let it take the rest. Her choice to stay forecloses the recovery path with legible cost, though the "smiled, brushing soil from her knees" gesture slightly softens what should be a starker trade-off. One clear escalation point (the mushroom pulse moment) suffices for this length under a causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—maintaining the reversible exile by correct tea-leaf annotation—coheres and tightens when the cartographer's leaves shift from siege spiral to branching delta, proving her method works. Her backward retreat and the shadow's containment verify the pressure. However, the exile's reversal condition (three independent riddle-solvers) never becomes a live test; the story stays within one mentorship cycle, so escalation reads as deepening rather than a narrowing choice with an on-page tradeoff that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: preserve the color of wonder by succoring the seed. The weaving sequence tightens through accumulation (lullaby, kiss-arc, rain-scent) until the seed cracks, a meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. Yet no live choice forces a trade-off; Elira's actions proceed unobstructed, and the resolution arrives through her technique without visible sacrifice or complication. The hush and tendril-pulse register transformation but lack agency-driven escalation or a price that alters her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—grounding restless spirits to restore balance—is signaled early and sustained. Escalation operates through knot-by-knot progression: fraying edge → boy's laugh → mother's lullaby → the blackened guilt-knot that "roars" and forces the fisherman's confession. That central knot provides the story's single meaningful tightening, narrowing options (hesitation, then piercing) with visible cost (violent unraveling, walls shaking). Agency is clear in the needle's deployment. However, after that climax the remaining knots deflate into summary, and no further tactical adjustment occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is clear: to witness and interpret the chapel's silent testimony. Pressure accumulates through the video-interpolation spiral, tightening from scattered clips to the spiraling shadow-path to the final convergence at dusk. Agency manifests as patient methodology and witness-stance rather than dramatic reversal, fitting the Accumulative lens. One cost is legible: three years spent tracing the cartographic wound, and the emotional release signals foreclosure of doubt. The escalation is deepening rather than confrontational, appropriate to the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding the physics of letting go—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure escalates through the accumulative lens: each observation (lunar perigee, temperature drop, emotional resonance) narrows options until the realization that the globe is "a receiver" for consciousness releasing attachment. The cliffside choice (opening palms, stepping back) is driven by protagonist agency and forecloses possession with visible cost: the globe vanishes, the narrator is "hollow and humming." The trade-off between solving and surrendering is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dominant stake: the balladeer's need to be understood and to offer connection. The piece signals this early but offers no meaningful escalation or tightening under the Accumulative lens. The ghost replies warmly on first contact, the encoding proceeds without friction, and the final "build a bridge" decision introduces no visible cost or forfeited option—she simply adds more messages. No reversal or deepening narrows her choices; the arc is a smooth affirmation rather than a pressure curve with felt consequence. The protagonist's agency (spray-painting encoded graffiti) does not foreclose a live alternative or impose a trade-off legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake—seeking joy beneath anguish—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout; no concrete on-page cost tests commitment. The servant encounters no obstacle, reversal, or rival interpretation; the goggles yield their secret on schedule without forcing a trade-off or tactical shift. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening would suffice, but here discovery feels inevitable rather than earned through pressure. The final passage is received, not won. No visible price paid; no option foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake signaled early: prove that empty spaces remember. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure deepens through repeated acts of categorization, each cloud entry a memorial that reweights the central question. One meaningful tightening: the shift from observing Altocumulus #112 ("quietly explosive") to memorializing its dissolution, which crystallizes her method and closes with visible cost (the smile that acknowledges ongoing grief). Agency is attention and memorialization—endurance that forecloses retreat into silence. The gondola's fraying cables and her deliberate focus function as persistent constraints. No explicit antagonist required; the situational pressure (absence, silence, need for proof) coheres throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: to translate the coin's celestial cipher before dawn demolition. The ticking clock and her accelerated painting ("faster now, not in panic, but in communion") create one meaningful tightening. The cost—ephemeral art no one will see—is legible and accepted ("She didn't need witnesses"). The realization that her blindness enables rather than blocks her work deepens stakes with visible trade-off (years of self-doubt vs. mastery). Minor friction: the hydraulic lifts recur as ambient threat but don't force a tactical pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—charting discovery via stranded luminance—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Arlen's noting escalates from phrasebook study to hopscotch decoding to demonstrating control to Captain Veyra. However, the escalation is smooth rather than forced by a tightening constraint, and no live option is foreclosed. The captain's instant acceptance and the crew's compliance eliminate friction at the peak beat. No visible trade-off or price appears on the page, capping this in the mid-6s despite coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—learning "the rhythm of repair"—is signaled early but never tested by a meaningful on-page reversal or tightening. She reaches the hall unopposed, the gears align without resistance, and she departs without forfeiting a live option. The mirrors show past moments, yet no present choice narrows her path or forces a trade-off. Escalation under the Accumulative lens requires density increase or cadence shift; here the final beat summarizes rather than intensifies.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (reaching the nebula) is declared but never pressured; no on-page obstacle, failed attempt, or tightening narrows options. The bell succeeds on first use, the nebula appears as if summoned by unity alone, and no character pays a visible price or forfeits an alternative. Escalation is absent—chalk messages appear, settlers gather, bell rings, nebula responds—resulting in outline sequencing without reversal or deepening. Agency is minimal; Elira orchestrates off-page, and the settlers comply without dramatized conflict or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—"to make [the end] gentle"—is signaled early but never tested or deepened. The adjuster encounters no obstacle, risk, or tightening choice; he ascends, places the puppet, turns the spindle, whispers the lullaby, and succeeds exactly as intended. No reversal, no foreclosed path, no visible price paid. The text substitutes atmospheric intensification (stars blinking out, civilizations pausing) for narrative pressure, but these are declared outcomes, not contested turns. Agency is absent; the protagonist performs a ritual, not a decision under fire.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake (prevent another ghost added to the chorus) is signaled early and tightens when frost timing forces action. One meaningful escalation: the girl is lost, the caretaker assembles guidance under time pressure, and the successful handoff of the nut forecloses his own exit. Cost is visible—he returns to the orchard heart as frost forms, accepting another cycle of duty. The arithmetic motivation ("one more soul trapped…one more ghost") could be more viscerally tested on the page; the rescue succeeds without serious friction.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—translate separation into connection, atone for her daughter's death—is signaled early and tightens through the foam-tracing insight. The chemist's decision to redesign the polymer "not for rigidity, but for graceful dissolution" and name it "Chrysalis Mesh" forecloses her former approach with visible professional and emotional cost. One meaningful deepening occurs when she reframes the scaffold as successful ("bought time for joy") rather than failed. However, the turn arrives more through contemplation than a pressure-tested choice that narrows live options in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—unwriting her past through brokered erasures—is signaled early but remains abstract. No meaningful tightening occurs; the seven transactions are identical in structure and lack escalating cost or narrowing options. The customers drift in and out without testing the vendor's commitment or forcing a trade-off. The piece accumulates texture rather than pressure, and under the Accumulative lens, a single decisive intensification or cadence shift that reweights the stake is missing.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake (subsume stored remorse) is signaled early and remains coherent throughout. Pressure escalates through the descent and cumulative grief contacts, culminating in the basin plunge—a clear agency choice that forecloses the path of avoidance. Cost is legible: "hollowed but whole," contagion spent, rough memories now "polished stones." The accumulative lens supports the deepening, though the escalation feels more textural than decision-driven; she encounters no live trade-off or complication that tests her commitment mid-descent. One meaningful tightening (basin plunge) suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—rehabilitating the silent, grieving elevator—is signaled early, but escalation is absent; the elevator responds immediately and positively to Elara's song with no setbacks, adaptations, or visible trade-offs. The tightening required for higher bands never arrives: Elara's agency is declarative rather than tested by competing costs, and the resolution (doors open, children climb, community will gather) is convenience-plotted rather than earned through protagonist struggle. No on-page reversal narrows options or changes knowledge in a way that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake: to excavate and modify abandoned dreams, signaled early. The piece deepens once when the child's memory merges with the engineer's own past, but no live option is foreclosed and no trade-off is forced. The engineer's agency is attention and intent ("focused will and neural recalibration"), not a decision that narrows tactics or costs her something tangible. The resolution is a commitment to return, but the canyon and mirror impose no constraint, and coincidence does not complicate. Pressure remains atmospheric rather than escalating under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—finding the seventh eye's location—is clear and pursued throughout. However, Elira faces no meaningful opposition or tradeoff; each threshold yields to her knowledge without cost. The fragment ignites with "latent blaze" and sears memory, but this doesn't narrow her options or force a choice—it simply grants her the answer. The Seed is "nestled in her satchel, warm and whispering" with no struggle or sacrifice to obtain it. Escalation is spatial (deeper into the grotto) rather than pressure-based; coincidence (gravity inverting at the exact hour she reenters) enables rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—restore music to silence—is signaled early and tightens when Silas finds the insulator, then deepens when he carves the resonance chamber. The final act is driven by his decision to embed the porcelain and align its cracks with grain-lines. However, the escalation is primarily conceptual; no live option is foreclosed on the page, and the price (months of silence, his isolation) is told rather than shown as a trade-off in the closure beat. The hedgehog and grove awaken, but no visible cost lands in the final image itself.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—discovering beauty in difficulty via translating silence—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening occurs: from anxious tracing of the worry stone to a resolved decision to teach others "correlation." The nexus's magnetic surge at closure adds atmospheric pressure, yet the protagonist's agency remains meditative rather than tactical; no live option is foreclosed on the page, and the cost ("too late to save kingdoms, but just in time to save souls") is asserted rather than dramatized through a visible tradeoff. Under the Accumulative lens, the tightening is present but the felt price at the ending beat is oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—recovering varieties of silence before fireworks drown them—is signaled early and sustained. Escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as a density increase: C-sharp is "too blunt," she switches to whale song and cathedral bells, the clasp trembles, she layers in child's breath and wheat rustle, the clasp opens. Yet these adjustments feel iterative rather than narrowing options with visible cost. No live alternative is foreclosed; the unlock arrives through persistence without a felt trade-off or tactical sacrifice. Coincidence does not resolve, but agency (the final frequency layering) is more patient problem-solving than high-stakes choice that reweights the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is clear: cultivate serenity and coax the seed to bloom. The seventeen-moon dormancy and the "tide's thought" turning provide a tightening, and the bloom delivers sensory escalation. Yet Elira's agency is passive—she waits, tends, and inhales; no on-page decision narrows her options or forces a trade-off. The village's transformation is consequence, not cost to Elira. The bloom's lesson ("grief is fertilizer") arrives as recognition, not a reversal that alters her stance. One meaningful deepening occurs (the bloom unfurls), but the protagonist does not drive it through a choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—tracing the orchard's resilience during the inversion hour—is signaled early and tightens when Elira discovers the arrow tip. The vines erupting around her and the sprint to the Grandmother tree narrow options under time pressure. However, the escalation lacks a visible trade-off or live consequence; the arrow solves the mystery without prior cost or friction. One meaningful deepening occurs, but the price feels conceptual rather than viscerally tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—predict the next convergence point to prevent another crash—is signaled early and coheres throughout. The piece tightens once: from passive survey to active confrontation ("Let it learn me too"). However, the investigator's agency remains observational until the final beat, and no live option is foreclosed with visible cost; planting sensors and walking deeper are tactics, not trade-offs. The wind's adaptation escalates pressure conceptually, but the investigator never faces a decision that narrows options or imposes a felt price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake ("certify wonder as essential") is signaled early but never faces a concrete obstacle or choice that narrows options. The piece is a series of bell strikes with beautiful consequences; no reversal, no escalation under pressure, no visible price paid in the moment (the child's laughter thaws, walls weep, hush dances). The final walk into the blizzard asserts future commitment but does not dramatize a trade-off or cost on the page. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, one deepening or cadence shift is sufficient—here the final return-with-difference ("carrying the sculpted hush inside her") qualifies minimally, but agency remains passive and escalation is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—whether to risk reopening the weave or let the collapse remain—is signaled early and tightens when she steps through, then crystallizes in her choice to leave the flute rather than repair it. The accumulative case studies (Verdantis, Silmara, Khyren) function as forensic escalation, each failure narrowing the viable approach until she concludes some doors stay open by staying closed. Her agency is renunciation with visible cost: she forecloses restoration, the Council's "never again" becomes her own internalized ethic, and she shifts roles from relic keeper to threshold keeper. No sharp antagonist, but the pressure coheres through her meticulous investigation under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake ("to map the unmappable") is signaled but never tested—no on-page scene forces a trade-off between competing methods or costs. The protagonist distributes pamphlets and tests the halo fragment on others (the skeptic clockmaker, the warlord) without facing meaningful resistance or consequence herself. The final typesetting and departure occur without escalation; earlier beats (borrowing personalities, pressing the fragment to her temple, setting type) do not narrow options or raise cost. No reversal or tightening is present; the narrative is a static catalog of prior acts summarized in past tense.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—whether to honor routine (delivery) or seed wonder (lingering for encounters)—is signaled at the fork and tightens when the courier chooses the Market path. The pendant-sharing with the child narrows options by externalizing the relic's power, and the final release forecloses possession with visible cost ("empty-handed"). Agency is clear: she extends the auroral encounter, chooses the less efficient path, and lets the pendant go. The casket's urgency, however, evaporates off-page without dramatized consequence, weakening the trade-off's felt weight at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—proving objects absorb emotion—is signaled early, but pressure never genuinely escalates. The mystic succeeds without resistance: the prism works, the frost speaks, she records it. No reversal or tightening choice narrows her options. The driver's story (panic, apology, surrender) is revealed but does not test the protagonist. Her decision not to publish is stated as certainty without dramatized cost or trade-off that would validate the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: carrying a message to a love unseen for seven winters. Pressure accumulates through the puzzle discovery, loom reconfiguration, and the solstice deadline. The climactic weaving sequence narrows options (she must dissolve herself thread by thread) with visible cost: memories transmuted into glyphs, her chair left empty. The sacrifice is described rather than dramatized in micro-choices, which softens its impact. The man's recognition provides a resolution beat but his agency is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—proving that what is buried can rise—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the silk's depletion and Arlo's repeated descents, but there is no on-page reversal or tightening choice that narrows his options or forces a trade-off. The villagers take his enchanted tools without complication; the child's appearance is affirmative rather than pressurizing. The final glyph-holding is a validation rather than a cost-laden turn. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening or cadence shift that forecloses a path is expected; here the progression feels steady rather than escalating, and the protagonist's agency at closure is passive—magic returns because he has given enough, not because he makes a final, costly decision.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—uncover the withheld truth—is signaled early and pursued consistently. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elira touches the data core and the truth floods in, narrowing her understanding. However, the escalation is driven by setting discovery rather than protagonist choice under pressure; she follows the shard's pull without a trade-off or renunciation that alters tactics. The conceptual cost ("responsible") is asserted at closure but not dramatized as a visible price that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—sustaining fragile connection rituals against loneliness and loss—is signaled early and coheres throughout. The lamp's extinction creates one meaningful pressure point that narrows options: Elias must rely solely on his personal anchors (glass, stones) rather than the spectral light. His choice to complete the cairn and descend without looking back demonstrates agency with felt cost (the "hollowing" that shifts to luminescence). The escalation is situational: pressure deepens rather than reversing through causal turns. The cost is more emotional reframing than a foreclosed path, trending toward the lower end of the 7-band despite clean coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.6)
    One dominant stake (steering the world's dreaming edge) is signaled early, but no on-page tightening or deepening narrows options or raises cost. The herald's actions (whispers, laughter, raising the lantern) do not escalate—each beat restates the same gesture without reversal or consequence. The fisherman observes an effect but experiences no agency; coincidence (nets heavy with silver) resolves his need without protagonist cost. No visible price paid, no option foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—understanding story-magnetism—is signaled early and remains coherent. Escalation operates through accumulative deepening: first clue (oblique light), structural insight (lattices not pigment), observing the humming man, then the decision to "cultivate her own fractures" rather than replicate others'. This final choice narrows options with visible cost (using her own tears, choosing watchful silence over explanation). Agency is clear in each tracking session and the climactic dye act. The one meaningful tightening—from observation to self-application—forecloses the path of imitation and accepts vulnerability as method.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding arboreal witness to sorrow—is signaled early and drives the worker's choices. Pressure tightens when the sextant projects dreams, then deepens when she follows it into the forest; the oak's offered crevice constitutes a meaningful turn that narrows options (from fixing to remembering). However, no credible opposition tests commitment; the trees "lean toward her... in recognition" rather than resist, and the astronomer's precedent removes discovery-cost. The final choice (sketching dreams into her notebook) lands with conceptual cost but minimal friction, reading more as fulfillment than trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.1)
    One dominant stake—rekindling communal song to restore woven dawns—is signaled early and sustained. The middle turn (keeper hums, others join) constitutes a single tightening under the Accumulative lens. Yet the escalation arrives through spontaneous coalition rather than protagonist agency that narrows options or imposes trade-off; the keeper invites and others answer without visible friction. No on-page refusal, resource limit, or competing obligation tests her commitment. The lack of felt cost in the ending beat holds the score mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Elira's journey from hiding to self-acceptance and embodied presence—is signaled early and tightens through the discovery, smoothing, and ultimate pinning of the crumpled invitation. The midnight threshold functions as a time-pressure device that forces her stance crystallization. Her agency is clear in the final beat: standing in moonlight, whispering her name, and choosing to seat herself visibly for the Society's return. However, the escalation is primarily internal and accumulative rather than a sequence of on-page reversals, and the cost—exposure to the Society—is more anticipated than paid within the text. One micro-turn (the invitation's reweighted meaning) deepens the stake sufficiently for this length, but the absence of visible friction or a dramatized tradeoff in the climactic moment holds the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: seeking "tenuous absolution" / permission to feel sacred again after loss. Pressure accumulates through Accumulative lens as passive observation (bread offering) deepens into active defiance (seed-planting, uncloaking). One meaningful tightening: the protagonist moves from carrying stale bread to placing seeds, narrowing options from mourning to resistance. Agency is primarily renunciation and endurance; the bread remains untouched, guerrilla gardening doesn't promise growth, yet these acts foreclose passivity with on-page cost (vulnerability, uncertain outcome). The hidden spring's drip signals a micro-turn but doesn't reverse prior trajectory; it resonates as confirmation rather than complication. Cost clarity is solid but quiet; stakes remain interior and symbolic throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—preserving luminous vows to defy oblivion—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the slide's dimming ("colors bleeding into gray, voices thinning") which forces swift work, and through the three vows that each reveal deeper layers (sorrow-resolve, untouched warmth, pure forgiveness). The violet vow's recalibration of the Array is a meaningful deepening that reweights the entire endeavor, and the slide's final expenditure ("its magic spent, its purpose fulfilled") provides a micro turn. However, Elira's agency remains observational and technical—she measures and records without facing a trade-off or foreclosing a path. The slide dims as a time constraint, but no live option is abandoned; she completes her task, seals the capsule, and walks on. Cost is conceptual (the slide is spent) rather than felt in her choices or future.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—thwart the deal before sunrise—is signaled immediately and pursued with escalating tactics: two prior failures, the drunkard false-start, and the final pendulum move. The false starts themselves constitute the method of escalation, each retreat a "calculated reset" that buys seconds. Pressure coheres under a Causal lens: the girl's agency (dangling the fob at the exact moment hands clasp) triggers the memory that shatters trust. The cost is legible in the broken truce, The Chain's flight, and her solitary walk into darkness without pursuit or celebration.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding why people carry personal weather—is signaled early but never tested by a competing desire or cost. The man's arrival and absorption offer one tightening (the forests vote on whether to absorb him), yet the protagonist remains an observer; her only "choice" is recognizing the vote, not intervening or risking anything. The resolution hinges on his readiness, not her agency. One meaningful deepening occurs (the ring points down, not to destiny but to roots), but no visible price is paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—uncorking suppressed creativity versus remaining "polite, productive"—is clear early. The descent and lock-breaking provide one meaningful tightening under the accumulative lens. However, the resolution lacks a visible price: she retrieves the charcoal, draws wings, and ascends "sovereign" without forfeiting a tangible option (e.g., losing the father's memory, sacrificing a commission, or accepting permanent isolation). The portraits' release feels thematically complete but cost remains oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—finding where lost conversations pool—is signaled early and pursued across three discovery beats (plate, child's note, chest). The wilting trait generates physiological cost at each step, narrowing options. The final decision to become the archive constitutes a meaningful deepening with visible cost (she trades the search for the burden of witness), though the protagonist's agency leans more toward discovery than hard choice between competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.7)
    Dominant stake ("preserve the color of wonder") is signaled early but never tested by meaningful opposition or escalating cost. The child encounter offers a potential pressure point, yet the tuner simply kneels and the child gasps—no choice narrows options or forecloses a path. The sculpture continues "without her" at the end, suggesting her agency was never necessary; coincidence (wind, weather) replaces protagonist-driven turns. No visible price is paid on the page; the tuner's cessation of climbing is summarized rather than dramatized, and no tactic is altered by prior loss.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: resolve inner static before core overload. The controlled burn provides one meaningful tightening—igniting the fears becomes the pivotal act that transforms chaos into harmless light. The magnetic shift and failing systems escalate external pressure in parallel. Cost is legible: the box is emptied, the old containment method abandoned, petals physically spill outward. The turn from preservation to transformation narrows options with visible consequence. The nursing-wing choice at the end feels more like thematic closure than a pressure-driven decision, slightly softening the escalation curve.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—Leo's unresolved grief—is signaled early via the locket and envelope. Pressure tightens through Elara's four-morning vigil, but the escalation is recounted in summary ("She returned the next dawn… And the next"). Leo's door-opening and the mailbox's click arrive without on-page resistance or trade-off; Elara's method succeeds on schedule. The courtyard conversation at noon (Mr. Ruiz, Mrs. Chen) is told rather than shown, and Leo's shift to laughter occurs off-page. No visible price paid; coincidence (the mailbox clicks "organically") resolves rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—liberate trapped survivors by encrypting resistance into a transmissible code—is signaled early and sustained. Elira's pirouette triggers coolant vents to mislead drones, and rolling the dice awakens submersibles, both tactical moves under pressure. Yet the escalation is procedural rather than protagonist-driven: no on-page reversal forces a trade-off or narrows options with felt consequence. The Overseers' patrol sweeps past without complication, the mainframe yields to her final dance without resistance, and the survivors' eventual freedom is recounted in summary. One tightening (the choice not to board the submersible) arrives too late and without clear cost, leaving pressure coherent but static.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—finding where deleted memories go—is signaled early and tightens through the coffee-ground spiral matching her father's journal. One meaningful deepening occurs when the aster placement dissolves the galaxy into the whale skeleton, then the doorway, narrowing Elira's options to crossing or abandoning the quest. Agency is decision: she chooses to step through with visible cost (leaving the chamber, entering a timeless pocket). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; coincidence (the whale beaching) complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—hushing the prophecy—is signaled early but never truly tightens; the summoner's method succeeds without visible friction or a moment when failure looms. The prophecy's reframing from warning to plea is a conceptual pivot, not an escalation that narrows options. No live trade-off or cost appears: she will return tomorrow with the same tools and stance. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is present (the whisper "The sky forgets only when the earth stops listening"), but it does not foreclose a path or impose felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—learning to communicate with the building—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful deepening occurs when the archivist reveals the seal as cipher and offers the key, narrowing her options from passive listening to active dialogue. Yet this turn is delivered through confession and object-exchange rather than protagonist agency under pressure; she does not wrestle with competing costs or make a choice that forecloses a path. The "agreed upon lies" provide texture but do not escalate into conflict; the couple's unspoken compact dissolves without friction. No reversal tests commitment; the resolution is handed to her. Coincidence does not resolve, but neither does her decision carry visible price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—archiving memory to translate isolation into independence—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, escalation is primarily a deepening mood and cadence shift rather than a causal narrowing: she arrives resolved, performs the ritual without opposition or reversal, and leaves. The shell's warming pulse offers a micro turn (it "offers" rather than "pleads"), but no live option is foreclosed with visible cost; the piece reads as a ceremony enacted rather than a choice forced under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—unlock the scroll to absolve the kingdom—is signaled early and pursued throughout. One meaningful tightening: the scroll resists ("ink writhed, letters bled"), forcing persistence. However, escalation is assertion-driven ("persisted, her forgery flawless") without a visible tradeoff or live risk that narrows options. The resolution is Elira's agency, but the cost is told ("soul scoured clean") rather than shown as a path foreclosed or a tactical sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake (stop the entity's resonance-theft) is clear by the second paragraph. Escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as layered revelation (first, second, third truths), but each layer arrives via told exposition rather than a tightening choice that narrows options. The climax—singing the entity into dormancy—lacks a visible trade-off or reversal; the entity simply shrinks in response to her lullaby without resistance or cost-forcing complication. Agency is present (she chooses to sing rather than destroy) but the path feels frictionless, and the cost (raw throat, lighter soul) is asserted in summary rather than felt through a foreclosed option.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake—salvaging the child's uncorrupted echo—is signaled early but never contested. The protagonist maps dream cameos and places the globe without resistance, reversal, or visible trade-off. The child's appearances "will fade now" is told consequence, not on-page cost. No tightening narrows options; the whisperer's methods succeed on schedule. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen or cadence should shift to reweight stakes; here, the ritual completes as expected.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—witnessing and honoring hidden labor—is signaled early but never pressured by opposition or choice. No reversal tightens options; her climb, whistle, and descent proceed without complication. The widow's memory could create friction but remains a told anecdote. Under an Accumulative lens one deepening suffices, yet even the lyric accumulation lacks a turn that narrows her path or imposes a felt trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake—excavating truth—is declared but never tested by a meaningful reversal or cost. She finds what she seeks (the plaque, the coordinates) without forfeiting anything or facing a live choice between competing goods. The diamond's "curse" dissolves into backstory explanation rather than creating present tension. No tightening occurs; each discovery simply leads to the next step in a pre-determined itinerary.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—broadcasting a counter-signal to Kael's unity—is signaled early and tightens once (the younger voice confirms listeners exist). However, the escalation is additive rather than compressive; no decision forecloses a live option or trades one good for another. The storm "easing" and stars appearing dilutes pressure at the climax rather than raising cost. Agency is present (she chooses to sing) but the price remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—gleaning redemption through captured sounds—is signaled early but never tightened by live opposition or cost. The poet's actions (wandering, bottling, gifting) accumulate but do not escalate; no option is foreclosed until the poet vanishes, and that disappearance is not prepared by prior pressure. The child's arrival is coincidental, not a reversal driven by the poet's agency. The ending reconfigures meaning (wonder survives loss) but lacks a visible price paid in a beat where the poet must choose between competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (protect the Heartstone) is signaled early. The sonic harpoon attack provides external pressure, but the protagonist's counter-action unfolds without visible trade-off or narrowed options—she simply "adapted" and "became the buffer" without cost or failure. The scavengers' instant conversion to "harmonic grace" deflates the threat retroactively. One tightening occurs (assault peaks), but the resolution via "forgiving" absolution avoids agency-driven choice with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=3.9)
    The dominant stake ("patient revolution") is declared early but never tested on the page—no old rulers arrive, no credible opposition materializes, and the mapper's methods face no friction or trade-off. The piece offers no meaningful escalation, tightening, or reversal; each paragraph restates the same premise without narrowing options or raising cost. Agency is observation and ritual, not decision with visible consequence. Coincidence or summary drives outcome (children come, parents follow, regime sends "silence") rather than protagonist choice.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake: determine if the death was preventable and honor suppressed memory. The investigator's realization—"rupture in the tunnel's memory-field"—is a deepening that reweights her understanding, and leaving the lantern is a renunciation (her report will be dismissed, but the tunnel remembers). However, escalation is primarily cognitive revelation rather than choice under rising pressure. No live alternative is tested on the page; she moves from investigation to acknowledgment without a visible tradeoff that forecloses another path. Cost is legible (forearm tattoos, dismissed report, physical exhaustion) but pressure doesn't tighten through antagonistic resistance or a forced choice.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (fix the heart to honor Maribel's deathbed request) is signaled early and coheres throughout. The escalation is a single meaningful tightening: months of failure culminate in the light-shadow insight that reweights the heart's mechanism from solo to duet. Agency is embodied in Elias's decision to realign the escapement, and the cost (years of guilt, the humility of failure) is legible on the page. The resolution is earned by his alteration in understanding, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—ring a bell no one hears yet—is signaled early and tightens through the transliteration sequence as gears shriek, acid waves slap, and Zeta's voice cracks. The arrow tip's insertion narrows options (the algorithm "demanded organic memory"), and the final note emerges from protagonist agency under accumulative pressure. The bell's stir rather than ring is a meaningful deepening that reweights the yearning from fulfillment to promise. Cost is legible in Zeta's physical exhaustion and the bell's prelude status, though the price could be more vividly irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: finding where deleted files (and the vanished crew) go, signaled early through the mislabeled patch and mission-log scrubbing. Pressure accumulates via the 0707 recurrence pattern, the janitor's tattoo confession, and the crew's negative-space thread. The 07:07 mass-restore tightens options—she triggers it despite no guarantee of outcome—and the shadow-avatar appearance delivers a conceptual cost: they aren't coming back, but they aren't gone. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening suffices. Minor gap: her decision to restore lacks visible friction or trade-off in the moment; the stakes feel more philosophical than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—reconstituting courage by mapping empathy—is signaled early and shapes the protagonist's iterative mirror work. Pressure accumulates through the ascent and the encounter with her own reflection, delivering one meaningful deepening when she sees the girl she was. Yet no live option is foreclosed; the crystal "warms" and she tucks it away with resolve, but no visible price is paid on the page. The ice shift at the end suggests possibility rather than consequence. Under the Accumulative lens one tightening suffices, but the cost remains implied rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (learning the sound of endings) is signaled early and tightens when the parasol tip rings, triggering the glacier shear. Elara's agency—climbing onto the floe rather than evacuating—forecloses safety with visible cost (isolation, near-freezing). The accumulative lens supports the gradual deepening, but the peak choice (walking toward the water) reads as confirmation rather than a dilemma under competing pressures. One meaningful tightening is present; the consequence (drift, rescue, transformation) lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether mismatch is tragedy or invitation—is signaled early and tightens through the vineyard parallel demonstration. One meaningful turn: Mara shifts from "I thought our love failed because we weren't meant to be" to "we were meant to be… differently," a stance crystallization earned by Elias's persuasion and the grape-tasting beat. The cost is relational: reconciliation is refused, but rediscovery is allowed, foreclosing the easier path of reunion. Pressure escalates under the Hybrid lens, though the climactic insight is more philosophical than viscerally tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—preserving the prophet's wisdom—is signaled early but never tightened or tested. The line walker encounters no resistance: the parapet responds willingly, the clearings stabilize without effort, the ritual succeeds exactly as intended. Under the Accumulative lens, escalation should manifest as density increase or cadence shift that reweights the stake; instead, the piece loops through similar descriptive beats (clearing after clearing) without raising cost or narrowing options. No meaningful agency is visible; she does not choose between competing paths or forfeit anything on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.5)
    No dominant stake dramatized on the page; "collective healing" remains abstract. The protagonist faces no opposition, makes no tightening choice, and experiences no reversal. Photograph examination is pure observation without tension or cost. The promised return tomorrow confirms static repetition rather than escalation or transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding growth's harmonic pattern—is signaled early and sustained. The piece delivers one meaningful tightening when the crystal chimes differently and poses a question, forcing the scholar to shift from data collection to voiced response. That choice forecloses the transcription path with felt cost (abandoning her method). Under the Accumulative lens, the escalation reads as a cadence shift that reweights the stake. Agency is present but the pressure remains largely internal and meditative; no external opposition tests the commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: locate the precise frequency of aging, "not the creak of bone... but the sound of time thickening." The piece tightens through ritual arrangement of driftwood, then the chalk's screech on the fender (birthday song fragment), then the deeper screech on the tape case that finally opens the sound he's hunted. Agency is attention and ritual rather than decision; the prophet's choices do not foreclose live options or force trade-offs, limiting escalation. Cost is legible in the dropped chalk, his trembling, and the knowledge he won't remember tomorrow, but the accumulative lens makes this a deepening rather than a causal turn with visible price paid in earlier tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=3.4)
    The dominant stake—"harness the ephemeral" / "restructure time's architecture"—is signaled early but remains abstract. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; the hand slows when Elira waits and remembers, without prior failure or visible trade-off. The "Time of Shaking Foundations" is environmental set-dressing, not a force that escalates or tests commitment. Agency is passive (waiting, listening) and the resolution occurs through metaphor rather than decision with felt cost. Escalation under Accumulative lens requires density shift or cadence break; none is legible here.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=4.6)
    Dominant stake ("execute a flawless goodbye" / "reunification") is signaled but not tested by opposition or tightening. No reversal or narrowing of options; the gathered souls simply respond positively to each hymn without resistance. The "reunion" unfolds as accumulation of successful moments rather than escalation under pressure. Cost is claimed ("by witnessing, by holding space in the breakage") but not demonstrated through a trade-off or forfeited alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—finding where shadows go at noon—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates through the seventeen-night repetition, the threshold crossing, and the shadows' recognition of Elira. However, escalation reads more as textural deepening than decision-driven tightening: Elira never faces a dilemma or trade-off that forces her to foreclose an option. The resolution (inscribing ΘΑΛΗΣ-9 and maintaining the seal) feels preordained rather than earned by a choice with visible cost. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful cadence shift is present (the vault crossing), but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—recomposing fractured pasts into meaning—is signaled early and held. However, no on-page reversal or tightening forces a trade-off; the protagonist encounters no resistance, and her method succeeds without visible friction. The substitute body's discovery is backstory; the garden work unfolds as smooth progression. One meaningful deepening occurs (tooth pulsing, future teaching implied), but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt in her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—sharing light without fire—is signaled early and sustained. Yet the piece lacks on-page escalation or a meaningful tightening: the protagonist polishes glass unopposed, villagers are mentioned as future arrivals, and the child's brief appearance does not test commitment or narrow options. The ritual proceeds as planned with no reversal, adaptation, or visible cost, leaving pressure static rather than escalating under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming agency after public exposure—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through layered imagery (moss, icicle patterns, pendant warmth) but lacks an on-page reversal or tightening that narrows options. The protagonist's choices (photographing thaw patterns, placing the confession under moss, planning to return) deepen her stance but do not foreclose a live alternative or impose a felt trade-off. The closure crystallizes intention without visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—releasing unfinished work—is signaled but never tested by opposition or a forced trade-off. The cameos parade without complication; no reversal narrows her options. Her walk "sideways through the mist" and the seashell placement feel volitional rather than pressure-driven. The manuscript shifts from "desperate" to "pulsing with potential" via assertion, not on-page escalation. Under Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is required; here the turn is conceptual but lacks felt cost or tactical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—restoring sacred practices through song—is signaled early and pressure accumulates as Elara plays and the vine responds. However, escalation relies on external validation (the vine glowing, the chorus appearing) rather than protagonist agency driving a tightening or deepening under the Accumulative lens. No on-page reversal or trade-off narrows options; coincidence (the harvest moon's invisible power, the apparitions' emergence) delivers the resolution without visible cost or foreclosed paths. The oak's knot opening and the chorus stepping through feel granted rather than earned by Elara's struggle or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=3.6)
    One stake is signaled (translating heartbeats into maps) but never faces on-page opposition or escalation. The ritual proceeds without reversal, complication, or cost. No option is foreclosed, no trade-off dramatized. Agency is present in the form of deliberate placement and patience, but these acts do not tighten pressure or change knowledge. The piece offers atmospheric demonstration rather than conflict-driven escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—preserving wonder for the thirsty and lost—is stated early but remains abstract throughout. No on-page reversal narrows options; the locksmith encounters no opposition, and each discovery (glyph, tone, shard) accumulates without friction or cost. The timer "shuddering" and emitting a tone are atmospheric beats, not pressure points that force trade-offs. Closure is a smooth completion rather than a choice that forecloses a path, and the "years later" travelers provide thematic echo but no dramatized consequence tied to protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—holding unbearable weight until it becomes bearable—is signaled early and sustained. The man's arrival provides one tightening: his loss becomes calcified with visible consequence (he leaves lighter, the letter hardened). The weaver's choice to calcify her own burden at the end narrows options (continuing the cycle rather than seeking release) with felt cost. Under the Accumulative lens, this single meaningful deepening is sufficient, though the man's agency is minimal and the weaver's final turn feels more resigned than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—learning to move with grief rather than against it—is signaled in the opening reflection and tested when the kettle demands response. One meaningful tightening: Eleanor ignores the urgent whistle twice, crystallizing her priority (the carving over domestic routine) and foreclosing retreat into habit. Agency is attention and endurance: "Still, she didn't stir" becomes a renunciation that costs her the tea and charges her commitment to the work. The escalation deepens rather than reverses: first curl of wood → suggestion of mane → half-formed lion → placement in light, each beat reweighting her relationship to memory with visible cost in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake — negotiating with the ghost to resolve ambition's failure — is signaled early but lacks clear escalation under the accumulative lens. The protagonist collects fragments and winds the camera across multiple beats, yet no meaningful tightening occurs until the abrupt handover near the end. When the ghost finally speaks and gestures for the camera, the reversal feels more like authorial arrival than pressure-driven necessity, and the cost of "no film left" and the envelope's wisdom lack the visible tradeoff or foreclosed path that would anchor stakes in concrete sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—resurrecting the terminal through redirected flows—is signaled early and pursued consistently. Pressure accumulates through problem-solving beats (steam redirection, light projection, kinetic tile installation), but escalation remains lateral rather than tightening: each task succeeds without forcing trade-offs or narrowing options. The ending "recalibrate for the next quadrant" implies continuation rather than a decisive turn, and no on-page reversal forces Elira to choose between competing goods or accept a visible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—making peace with the abandoned dream—is signaled early and tightens once when the crystal's droplet reveals "the notes weren't dead." The tuning fork and hum constitute a meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. Agency is present but the cost of humming (versus not humming) remains abstract; no live option is visibly foreclosed on the page. The piece delivers one tightening but lacks a tangible trade-off or price that alters tactics or future stance.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake: to understand the architecture of lies, signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening occurs when the locket's inscription ("I needed you to be perfect") delivers the hindsight clarity that reweights the seeker's theory. The seeker's agency is renunciation—stopping the chase, accepting understanding over proof—with visible cost (carrying peace, not answers). No reversal or tightening that narrows options under external pressure; the seeker's calm control never falters. Escalation reads as accumulative density (mentor's "serene upheaval," the dial's alignment, the locket's reveal) rather than a choice under duress, fitting the lens but limiting high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving ancient methods as living practice rather than museum relics—is signaled early and guides the protagonist's approach. The piece delivers one meaningful deepening when Havel distinguishes her from those who "photograph, frame, forget" and agrees to teach. However, the escalation is gentle and cooperative; no live opposition tests her patience or forces a trade-off. The cost of learning (time, humility, the shift in mission) is present but muted—we don't see what she surrenders to kneel in the snow for hours.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding the geography of healing by mapping absence—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through sensory and reflective density rather than causal turns, consistent with the Accumulative lens. One meaningful deepening occurs when the traveler completes Elira's obituary and folds it into a crane, an act that moves from private ritual to potential transmission ("Perhaps they'd carry it to the cliffs"). The traveler's agency is visible in the choice to write, fold, and leave the parchment, foreclosing direct contact or hope. Cost is conceptual—renouncing prayer and hope—but the price feels more stated than embodied in a tactile trade-off or visible loss that alters later options within this single scene.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—reawaken beauty in a mechanical world—is signaled early and sustained. The story offers one meaningful tightening: the prince's activation ritual (palm to egg, hypothesizing aloud) narrows options to success or failure. The egg's responsive glow and the palace's resonant awakening provide a turn that reweights the stake, though the prince's agency is more ritual invocation than strategic decision under opposition. Coincidence does not resolve; the transformation arises from his sustained effort and emotional investment. Cost is felt (decades of isolation, physical reduction) and the final image charges the outcome with undeniable pressure, meeting Accumulative escalation standards.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—reconciling inherited fire with chosen compassion—is signaled early and tightens when she performs the graft, threading the coin around the figure's wrist. The lagoon hums, clouds pause, and the ritual deepens her stance from shame to harmonized witness. However, the radio call at the end ("En route") reads as resumption rather than a choice that forecloses a live option; no visible trade-off appears. Under the Accumulative lens, the escalation succeeds through the ritual's crescendo (coin dips, figure forms, she whispers "Sing with me"), but the cost remains atmospheric rather than actionable.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (liberating trapped memories) is signaled early and coheres across beats. Pressure accumulates through the breadcrumb method and tightens at Fountain Twelve when the key unlocks the box, releasing memories with sensory consequences (scent, warmth, vibration). Agency is present but procedural: the skeptic follows a method without dramatized opposition or a choice that visibly narrows options. The final fountain's drop signals success, yet no live cost or trade-off for the protagonist is made legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—teaching the gear to feel without calculating—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or scarcity. No meaningful tightening occurs; the sentimentalist proceeds unopposed through sonar pings to a frictionless resolution. The gear's transformation is granted rather than earned through agency or trade-off. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen or narrow options; here it simply accumulates description.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—discovering the shape of collective grief—is signaled early and coherent. Pressure accumulates through the nightly ritual, the spectral mentorship, and the ribbon-tying, creating a meaningful density increase. Yet escalation under the Accumulative lens requires a tightening or cadence shift that narrows options or raises cost; here the protagonist continues the same ritual without friction, trade-off, or visible price. The final realization arrives as epiphany rather than through a choice that forecloses a live alternative, capping escalation credit.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—restoring shared balance versus allowing personal grace—is signaled early and coheres across beats. The storm-shattered rake and inscriptions introduce a tightening, but the turn (choosing not to wind) does not narrow options with on-page cost; the clocks continue without consequence, erasing the trade-off. Agency is present (kneeling, waiting, choosing surrender) but the choice lacks visible price: no child misses a train, no mechanism fails, no professional identity is forfeited in scene. Pressure accumulates texturally but closure does not foreclose a path, only reframes his stance without felt loss.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding intentions—is signaled early and pursued through the untangling ritual. Pressure accumulates via the threads' resistance and the gardener's emotional recognition, but escalation is textural rather than causal; no live choice tightens options or forecloses a path. The ending shift (from lullabies to questions) lacks visible cost: we see no trade-off, loss, or sacrifice that makes the transformation difficult or painful. The piece operates in Accumulative mode, yet the final tightening feels conceptual rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=3.6)
    The stated stake—seeding innovation within constraint—remains abstract and unchallenged. No on-page reversal, tightening, or deepening: she climbs, reflects, writes glyphs in sequence, and the ritual succeeds without obstacle or trade-off. The summary of downstream actors (engineers, poets, children) replaces protagonist agency at the closure beat. Coincidence does not resolve because nothing is dramatized to resolve; pressure is declared ("tension," "friction") but never embodied in a choice that forecloses a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—teaching dust to tell stories—is signaled early and remains coherent, but escalation under the Accumulative lens is minimal: she transcribes broadcasts, then realizes tears activate transmission, then transmits her own score. The pirate signal burning "hotter than ever" and singing about her is the lone tightening, but it feels externally granted rather than protagonist-driven. The final transmission is an expansion, not a narrowing of options; she gains capability without visible trade-off. No live option is foreclosed, and the cost (waiting, calm) is abstract rather than a dramatized loss of stamina, safety, or prior path.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—to crystallize fleeting emotion through ritual—is signaled early and sustained, but the narrative presents no meaningful tightening or opposition; the scatterer performs her method without friction, the patron arrives and affirms it, and the ritual succeeds as designed. The chair's stopping functions as a timeframe cue rather than escalation. Agency is present (lighting the candle, choosing to sit) but these are confirmations, not choices that narrow options or incur visible trade-offs. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening or cadence shift that reweights the stake is expected; here the ending repeats the opening's somber-marvel tone without a felt turn.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preservation of ancient methods vs. Council's erasure—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the cataloging efforts, envoy visits, and the final bell-tower ritual, which narrows his options by crystallizing his opposition into symbolic act. The escalation is accumulative rather than causal: density increases (mold patterns, floodlines, multiplication tables) until the climactic placement of the cog and whispered coordinates. One visible tightening occurs when he moves from archival work to public (though solitary) declaration. Cost is conceptual and social (isolation, rejection by Council) but legible on the page through the contrast of monuments and his return to the depths. Agency is present in the bell-tower choice, though the broader endurance predates the text.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake: will anyone return to learn harmony? The creak and girl's entrance provide one meaningful tightening. But escalation is muted—Elara hums, waits, and the girl simply appears; no on-page choice narrows Elara's options or forces a trade-off. The final "Good. That means you haven't learned how to get it wrong yet" avoids testing whether Elara can still teach or what she must sacrifice to do so. Cost is told ("decades of showing up") rather than paid in this scene. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening is sufficient, but the lack of visible friction or forfeiture caps the score.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake—creating beauty from ruin—is signaled early but never tested. No on-page reversal narrows options; the vines surrender willingly, the seed sprouts perfectly, and neighbors respond exactly as hoped. Elara's agency is passive observation and patient tending without meaningful cost. The alignment and pruning do not escalate or tighten; they simply unfold as planned, and the ending delivers success without friction or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is preserving wonder vs. explanation, signaled early ("to remind himself... that magic hadn't fled") and tested when the woman arrives with her riddle. Escalation occurs through the matchbox exchange (Elias selects the lightning glyph, revealing stored knowledge), then the climb and discovery that the drones are capacitors. The woman's shift from urgency to reverence and Elias's choice not to broadcast the knowledge constitute agency with felt cost—silence forecloses immediate utility to preserve mystery. The turn is meaningful but lacks a second tightening moment; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens but could deepen further.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—sanctifying the vanished cottage's departure—is signaled early and sustained, but no on-page reversal or tightening occurs. The ritual proceeds without opposition, complication, or cost that alters tactics. The protagonist kneels, places the shard, and rises; the cottage "unclenches" off-page. Under Accumulative lens escalation should emerge through density increase or pattern break; here the action is linear and the pressure static, with no meaningful deepening that narrows options or changes knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: the historian seeks the city's "Fall" narrative, and the statue offers her "cascading revelations" that reframe collapse as transformation. One meaningful deepening occurs when she breaks the ampoule and light reveals hidden murals, changing her knowledge and mission. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens depends on density increase or cadence shift that reweights cost—here, the historian receives revelations passively (shown, told, gestured toward) rather than through choices that narrow options or force trade-offs. The ending reconfigures meaning but the price (carrying nuance upward vs. her career-long single narrative) is declared rather than dramatized as a forfeiture on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—capturing the texture of the missed opportunity—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates through the repeating climb, the equations that vanish, the die rolled on landings, building to the moment he speaks the elegant proof and the staircase ripples. That moment is the one meaningful tightening: his utterance causes the transformation, and touching the reflection delivers the texture he sought. The cost is legible (the die vanishes, a relic traded for insight), though the reversal leans on external response (the staircase's ripple) rather than pure protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—proving strangers remember kindness—is signaled in paragraph four and tested through the painter's nightly glyphs. Pressure accumulates via the brush's transmissions, the barista's compulsion, the note on the door, and the offerings at the fire escape. The girl's arrival constitutes a meaningful deepening: the painter's solitary proof becomes collaborative continuation. Under the Accumulative lens, one tightening is sufficient at this length. Cost is conceptual—the painter's private certainty shifts to shared practice—but the trade-off (solitude for communion) is legible in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—rescuing dying arts—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, escalation is minimal: Elara's bread ritual succeeds without meaningful resistance, the boy volunteers the drum, others join willingly, and travelers arrive to validate the renaissance. No reversal or tightening choice narrows Elara's options; each beat accumulates success rather than forcing tradeoffs. The story lacks on-page friction that would test her commitment or impose a visible cost, leaving the conflict more declarative than dramatized under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—breaking fate's design—is signaled early and drives the sequence. The protagonist's agency (forging the mainspring, placing it in the stone, lifting the gear) tightens pressure through one meaningful escalation: the stone cracks open, revealing the paradox gear. Cost is declared ("carried its weight alone," lighthouse crumbles, stone dissolves) but remains abstract; we do not see a live tactical trade-off or forfeited option on the page before the resolution. The paradox-loop revelation ("message sent backward by his future self") undercuts pure protagonist agency, making the escalation feel partially predetermined rather than earned through immediate choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—tricking fear into revealing its weakness—is signaled early but remains conceptual rather than embodied in rising pressure. The sequence from wandering to Hall of Whispers to confrontation reads as lateral exploration rather than escalating tightening; the dream dictionary paradox ("To conquer fear, invite it to tea") produces atmospheric shifts (mirror shatters, calliope reverses) but these reactions do not narrow the protagonist's options or raise cost. The final confrontation where Fear recoils from shown memories feels more like thematic demonstration than a turn driven by protagonist agency with visible tradeoff. No meaningful forfeiture or tactical adjustment occurs; the unbosoming simply succeeds.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—conducting a tide of sound to prevent/transform the fractal cloud threat—is signaled early. The sea darkening mid-performance provides one meaningful tightening, and the Prophet's pivot to the root-note hum shows agency. However, the escalation lacks a visible trade-off or cost; the orchard's fruit bursts and Kael's strike solve the problem without foreclosing an option. The clouds "stilled" and dissolved is presented as triumph without consequence, weakening closure pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—cracking the watchers' silence to learn the expedition's fate—is signaled early and tightens when the watcher turns its head, confirming they listen. That reversal forecloses skepticism and drives the midnight climb decision. Agency is present in the testing sequence, the archive discovery, and the final packing, but the escalation reads more as confirmation than a choice that narrows options with visible cost. The resolution is earned by her persistent refinement, yet the cost remains prospective (she may join the lost) rather than paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—rescuing truth from myth—is signaled early and remains coherent. The discovery of the letter is a meaningful tightening under a causal lens, narrowing her options to publication. However, the escalation lacks on-page agency and visible cost: the historian encounters no resistance, dilemma, or trade-off after finding the letter. The plan to publish is described in future summary without a present-tense choice that forecloses a path. Coincidence does not resolve, but neither does protagonist action at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake: to catalog absence as "layered silence waiting to be translated." The repeated descents and note-placements accumulate pressure, and the discovery of the bride's letter tightens the question—can Elara truly witness and honor what was lost? Her decision to copy the letter with the inkwell's last drops and seal it beneath the keystone is a meaningful choice that forecloses further inscription (the inkwell empties). The cost is visible: tears, the empty inkwell, the shift from surveyor to priestess. Escalation under the accumulative lens is present but modest—one deepening rather than multiple reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—tracing honest origins and reclaiming suppressed truth—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure accumulates through investigative discoveries (ledger entries, architectural clues, the Master Index) that deepen the silhouette of deliberate erasure, narrowing interpretive options. The indexer's agency is observational and documentational rather than decisional; no live option is foreclosed by a trade-off choice. The stamp inscription at the end is a witness act with conceptual cost (solidarity, accountability) but does not test her commitment against a competing good or unavoidable harm on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake: transform grief into vessel. Pressure is implicit (the shadow's ascent forces Silas to act) but arrives late and unfolds mostly in summary. The basilica's hum (new key, tea leaves standing upright) is the first on-page tightening; Silas's decision to shatter the lanterns and sing is the second. Agency is present—he gathers, sings, and drops the sapphire—but the shadow's transformation (starved, satiated, softened) reads as automatic response rather than a contested choice with visible trade-off. Cost is gestural: he releases all his recorded dreams, but we don't see what specific future he forecloses or what immediate pain that exacts.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—charting unused potential to prove it pools elsewhere—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure tightens when the simulation collapses ("too unstable, too saturated with grief") yet yields actionable coordinates, forcing her from passive mapping to active pursuit. The queuing of thrusters and departure without crew or debrief foreclose the path of observatory-bound analysis with felt cost (isolation, no safety net). Agency is clear: her decision to dive into the pools drives the final leap. No antagonist is required under the Accumulative lens, and coincidence does not resolve; the geode's resonance complicates by revealing coordinates she must choose to follow.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—decode the frequency of belonging—is signaled early but remains metaphorical rather than forcing a concrete trade-off. The chip's activation is a procedure, not a pressure point that narrows options; she follows star trails without risk or alternative. The closing insight that belonging is internal arrives through epiphany rather than a choice that forecloses an external path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering the weight of her father's withheld truth—is signaled early and drives Elira's actions. Pressure accumulates through the driftwood search and peaks when the watch hand unlocks the memory, forcing her to reweigh her past and profession. The final renunciation (shifting from forgery to truth-weaving) forecloses her former trade with professional and identity cost. However, the watch hand's convenient memory transfer replaces protagonist agency with a magical plot device at the pivotal reversal; Elira does not wrestle with contradictory evidence or make a difficult inference—the answer is simply given. The escalation under the Accumulative lens is present but the cost legibility is muddied by convenient mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—reconciliation through relic exchange—is signaled early. Pressure remains static: the man arrives, they talk, they swap objects, they descend. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the conversation proceeds without escalation. The swap itself is cooperative, not forced by prior causality or a trade-off with visible cost. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is required; here the exchange reads more as thematic illustration than earned pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—aligning heart and action—is signaled early and coheres under the Accumulative lens. Pressure accumulates through metaphor density and the protagonist's walk inland, but there is no on-page reversal or tightening that narrows options: she is stuck, walks, then paddles. The crow's washer and the compass repositioning offer symbolic turns but no dramatized trade-off or cost that forecloses a path. The lens holds, but the lack of a felt price or visible agency-driven escalation keeps this in mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: kindle empathy where none remains. The piece accumulates pressure through descent clues and Kael's challenge, then tightens when the seeker tosses the baseball and witnesses the ripple-born images—narrowing options from retrieval to release. One meaningful deepening with visible cost: the seeker climbs back without the ball, accepting the map's resonance. Agency is present in the release gesture and the choice to keep reading between lines, though much exposition (newspaper archives, obituary codes) is told rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—reforging the bond—is signaled early but never faces genuine opposition or cost. The spice ritual succeeds on first attempt; no reversal tests her commitment. The "paradoxically steady tremor" is asserted but not dramatized through a visible trade-off (does steadiness prevent her from fleeing doubt? No such moment appears). Pressure remains declarative ("threshold trembling") rather than escalating through narrowed options or forced sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: recover lost time/connection with her daughter. The piece tightens through one meaningful sequence—placing the shard, spectral hands responding, crossing the threshold—but escalation under the Accumulative lens relies on density of metaphor rather than choices that narrow options. The protagonist's agency is primarily observational and receptive (kneeling, whispering, pressing) until the threshold crossing, which reweights her stance. Cost is told ("final unfastening of her grip") rather than shown as a forfeited alternative. The saucer healing and the daughter's voice calling feel convenient rather than earned by prior sacrifice, softening the pressure at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—reaching the Echo-Realm for reunion—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elira finds the joy-tear photograph and begins the final stitch, lifting off the deck as emotional calibration narrows the window for success. However, escalation unfolds through description of her ritual rather than obstacles that force tactical shifts; the dimensional pressure and groaning panels are atmospheric rather than problems she must solve. Agency at closure is present (she steps forward) but the gate's opening feels granted by correct frequency rather than wrestled from competing costs.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding transformation—remains abstract and declared rather than tested through on-page reversals. The bottle-opening sequence accumulates gestures without narrowing options or raising cost; each release is consequence-free. The protagonist never faces a choice between competing goods or a credible loss that alters later tactics. "Fulfilling prophecies accidentally" removes agency, flattening pressure into passive observation.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake (plant coded messages to seed revolution) is signaled early and remains consistent, but pressure never escalates—the blackout conveniently mutes the guards, no complication arises, and the protagonist's actions proceed as planned without cost or adaptation. No on-page tightening that narrows options or deepening that changes knowledge. The final paragraph asserts that "a baker, a scribe, a stablehand, would unfold their copy—and understand," but this is a told outcome rather than a turn driven by the protagonist's choice under duress. Coincidence (the blackout) enables rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding sacred patterns—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful deepening occurs when the herder shifts from viewing his curse as theft of surprise to tool for synchronization. However, escalation is largely atmospheric; the eels' arrival feels inevitable rather than hard-won. The herder faces no credible opposition or failed attempt that narrows his options. The resolution is granted by the universe's "silent syntax" rather than earned through a choice that forecloses a live alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: the poet's negotiation with her censored past and the sealed poem. The vigil "in pause" establishes a stance; the timer reaching zero is the sole tightening. One on-page choice: not opening the envelope. Agency is present as renunciation (Earned Stasis), but no live opposition or cost is dramatized—no consequence for opening or not opening is made legible. The storm and censors remain off-stage; no escalation forces a trade-off. Pressure is asserted through metaphor ("cartography of scars") but does not cohere into a narrowing of options. The resolution feels more like a thematic summation than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the hidden overture—is signaled early and shapes the middle beat (aligning shadow and needle card). However, escalation is shallow: the philosopher waits three dawns, the woman arrives, they succeed without complication. No reversal, no foreclosed option, no visible cost paid on the page. The declaration "Now we perform it…everywhere" gestures at future stakes but does not tighten present options or dramatize sacrifice. Under the accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening occurs (the score's revelation), yet the lack of friction or trade-off limits the band.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake (forging beauty from anarchy) is signaled early and the piece accumulates pressure through symbolic acts, but there's no on-page reversal or tightening choice that narrows Molt's options. The gestures (pinning poem, lighting candle, planting seeds) are additive rather than escalatory; no moment where failure looms or a decision forecloses an alternative path. Under an Accumulative lens, the density does increase and the cadence shift at "bloom where they think nothing can" reweights the stake, but the cost remains felt rather than visible—no dramatized consequence of her night in the ruin.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: surprise fate by playing an unplanned encore. The escalation is coherent under the Accumulative lens—Elira layers chords, the arbor responds, the clock ticks forward, compasses align—culminating in the final chord that "shatters" the horizon into dawn. However, agency at closure is muted: the chord is "woven from surprise, defiance, and steely longing" (abstract labels), and the laughter's arrival feels more like a plot gift than a consequence of prior tactical choices. One meaningful tightening (clock advancing, compasses freezing) narrows options, but the cost is implied rather than visible on the page. No explicit price paid for the harmonic gambit beyond "the film reel burst into flame, harmless and bright"—the "harmless" qualifier undercuts stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—preserve collective memory before the monsoon erases it—is signaled early and sustained. The piece shows one meaningful tightening: Aris plants the seed, chants the Wakening Dirge, and the memory archive erupts and becomes autonomous. **Cost is legible** (the seed is consumed, the system is now self-correcting). Yet escalation is minimal; the ritual proceeds smoothly without resistance, mishap, or a forced trade-off. Aris's doubt ("What if he misinterpreted?") is voiced but not dramatized into a consequential choice. Under the Accumulative lens, one decisive intensification is sufficient, but the lack of agency-driven pressure caps the score in the 6–7 band.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.9)
    One dominant stake is signaled early: finding and diffusing the color of unspoken apologies. The piece delivers one meaningful deepening when Elio traces the lace instructions and the soil darkens with cerulean gradients, forcing his understanding that apologies are tides, not monoliths. However, no live opposition or trade-off narrows his options; the ritual proceeds without friction or visible cost to his agency. The ending reconfigures meaning but lacks a felt price that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.2)
    Under the Accumulative lens, escalation builds through density of imagery and protagonist agency (naming poles, pocketing the washer). The stake—internal coherence—tightens with each step, and cost is unmistakable in her "merrily melancholic surrender" to possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake of kindling empathy is signaled early and escalates under the Accumulative lens through the ripples showing "paths not taken," driven by protagonist agency in tossing the baseball.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—how she will relate to catastrophe and decay (as drama vs gradual pattern)—is clear, and there is at least one tightening when colleagues label her retreat a “breakdown,” pushing her to double down on recalibration. Conflict is primarily internal and conceptual, braided with career reputation, which fits the mode but keeps tension low-grade. Escalation occurs via increased density of observations and the spiral’s emotional impact rather than via tough decisions that foreclose options on the page. As a result, the cost is more implied than viscerally felt, capping the sense of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake is her need to find a livable, honest mode of existence after trauma, and it’s signaled early through her relation to silence and the ledger. Pressure escalates modestly but clearly when the frost pattern mirrors the ledger script, revealing the route’s true nature and transforming her from accidental survivor into someone following a deliberate, merciful trail. Her agency then manifests in choosing not to hide but to create and gift charged objects, an earned stasis with a visible cost (renunciation of commerce, ongoing solitude). The conflict remains largely internal and contemplative, so tension never feels sharp, but it does deepen in meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether silence is truly emptiness or can be made into music—is clear and present from early on, and the first activation of the fountain ice is a genuine tightening that proves the method and raises the emotional stakes. The escalation from one test to mapping the entire conservatory by night’s end feels like a meaningful deepening of commitment, not a flat repetition. However, pressure remains largely internal and contemplative; there’s no real threat of failure, reversal, or cost that would narrow options in a sharper way. The ending crystallizes her stance rather than forcing a hard choice, which is satisfying but relatively gentle in terms of conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether he will answer the chorus of unrest and at what personal/ontological cost—is signaled early and followed through. Pressure escalates as the signals clarify, the library “awakens,” and souls gather, leading to the pivotal activation of the final prism. However, conflict is largely one-directional; there are no real reversals, competing goods, or serious doubts once he resolves to act, so choices feel weighty but not embattled. The cost is primarily psychic and vocational (abandoning passive exile for endless, consuming work), which reads, but could be sharpened by a more explicit trade-off or threatened failure.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving communal and intergenerational cohesion under sanctions—is clear early via Elira’s silent food runs. Pressure escalates as sanctions deepen and more people join anonymously, culminating in someone finally ringing the bell and multiple new baskets appearing. The main turn is conceptual and social rather than dramatic: anonymity shifts from solitary burden to shared practice. Conflict remains low-flame (no direct antagonistic encounter), which fits the design but slightly limits the felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether she can locate and access the fate of unused love—is clearly established and followed through, with escalation in the shift from observation to pursuit to direct contact with the pilgrim and the tear. Pressure is primarily internal and textural, increasing via breath-ritual and sensory intensity rather than overt obstacles. Her main act of agency is choosing to follow the tear “with her lungs” and to match the pilgrim’s breath, which credibly drives the resolution. Still, the conflict remains gentle and nearly frictive-free; there’s little sense of what she risks losing if she fails or how this costs her beyond a beautiful surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—what Elira will pay in memory and selfhood to pursue the texture of time—is clear from early on. Escalation is marked and effective at the halo-contact beat when photographs disintegrate and the garden’s true feeding is revealed, tightening from abstract risk to concrete loss. After that, however, resistance softens quickly into acceptance, with limited agonized weighing of options on the page. The story closes on a strong stance, but without a fully contested choice it stops short of the most intense possible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—getting the seeds out before the wall falls and the raiders return—is clear and weighty, and the chains plus time pressure provide a persistent constraint. Escalation arrives primarily through deepening access (bench → piano sequence → vault → dispersal) rather than reversals; her path is a steady execution of plan, not a series of hard trade-offs. Conceptual stakes (food sovereignty, resistance through growth) are strong, but moment-to-moment tension is mostly implied rather than sharply dramatized (no immediate intrusion by raiders, no near-failure of the mechanism). The ending’s cost is largely projected risk rather than a pressure spike paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—harvesting the sound of trust breaking in time to warn others—is clearly signaled and steadily deepened. Pressure escalates accumulatively: the forge’s intensifying work, the feeding of ever-more personal absences (her sister’s voice), and the ticking cellular clock all narrow her emotional options. However, external resistance is minimal, and the process unfolds with little jeopardy of failure, so the conflict feels more like solemn ritual than a truly contested struggle. Her final choice to leave the greenhouse and accept her battered state as the price for this device is a credible, if quiet, culmination.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.2)
    Conflict is mostly conceptual and situational—her quiet mission versus the inertia/ignorance of passersby—rather than opposed by any concrete force. Stakes center on whether potential connections are realized or missed, but the narrative never presents a serious risk of failure in any of the vignettes; every intervention works smoothly. There is some escalation via pattern density (from one reunion to another, from lovers to decades-separated friends) and the dwindling jar, which implies finite capacity. Still, pressure never sharpens into a true dilemma or loss, so tension remains gentle rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—redefining control as curiosity and creating sanctuaries for questions—is coherent but faces minimal resistance. Her path from arrival to ritual to departure unfolds without meaningful external or internal obstruction, so escalation is largely a gentle deepening of mood rather than a forced trade-off. The key “choice” is her decision not to stay and to trust others (and time) to find the spheres, which does foreclose the path of guardianship but is telegraphed early. As a result, tension is atmospheric rather than felt as narrowing options, limiting stakes’ visceral impact.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—liberation from the mentor’s exploitative legacy via uncovering and erasing the sabotaged footage—is clear and escalates from mental decoding to an irrevocable physical act (burning the reel). Internal conflict between terror and resolve runs alongside the external task, and the shell’s command sharpens the turning point. However, the opposition is mostly historical/psychic; the present-tense scene offers little genuine resistance (the fire is “respectful,” there’s no risk of discovery or physical trap), which slightly blunts the sense of cost and pressure. The arc still tightens meaningfully but stops short of feeling truly harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether she can meaningfully map an endless night of silence—is clear and thematically charged, with the last star and intensifying storm providing gentle external pressure. There is a discernible tightening as time runs out (the final star guttering), pushing her to complete the map and then step into it. However, conflict remains mostly conceptual; there is little resistance, reversal, or tactical adaptation beyond endurance and completion. The resolution is resonant but not born from a harrowing trade-off so much as a dignified follow-through on a long-held aim.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—understanding the origin of its own thought—is signaled early and deepens via the looped attempts, with each loop adding emotional and conceptual pressure. The decisive tightening comes when the echoes resonate with its core and the “wrong place” whisper forces a reframing from external to internal origin. The price is the dissolution of the violin and a relinquishing of its prior frame of inquiry, which meaningfully alters its ongoing “sweeping” tactic. Still, tension is largely contemplative; there’s minimal sense of opposition or risk beyond existential inquiry, which keeps escalation relatively gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether mistrust in the Archive community can be thawed—remains clear, and there is a discernible tightening as the keepers emerge, respond, and begin to hum. However, pressure is largely atmospheric; we never feel an immediate risk of rejection or rupture, so tension is more implied than strongly dramatized. Elira’s agency (choosing the method, then holding still and letting it work) is coherent but not deeply tested. The cost is present but gentle, which keeps escalation from fully matching the ambition of the set-up.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether she will submit the garden to algorithmic compliance or persist in relational reciprocity—is clear and present early. Escalation is modest: the intern’s message from the Head Botanist is the lone explicit tightening, and she answers without real hesitation, so no option feels truly jeopardized. The primary pressure is conceptual rather than situational, which suits the lyric mode but keeps tension relatively low. Her final refusal is earned yet not forced through a genuinely difficult trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—testing a dangerous, reality-bending hypothesis—is signaled and escalates with the lever pull and the sudden appearance of the scarred double, which is a genuine tightening. Yet after the warning, Elira’s adjustment and the system’s recovery feel almost frictionless; her decision entails no clear sacrifice, damage, or relational rift. Tension is more intellectual and atmospheric than truly precarious, so the pressure never quite peaks. The conflict remains largely internal and conceptual, with limited testing of her resolve beyond a single, quickly resolved beat.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether she can disrupt the calcified silence and realize the flood’s “masterpiece”—is clear and grows as the ghost appears and the water begins to vibrate. Escalation is present but subtle: intensity rises through gesture, resonance, and light rather than overt threat or reversal, consistent with an accumulative lyric design. Her choice to “play” without sound and then to stop, accept the fermata, and leave gives a credible peak and resolution. Still, external opposition or sharply felt trade-offs are minimal, so the sense of risk remains more aesthetic than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she will continue to be crushed by silent truth or adopt a new stance—is clear and consistently pressured. Escalation is subtle but present: from abstract query about mass, to concrete question “What do I do with it?”, to the physical act of pinning the orchid outside and asking for a human definition of “fault-tolerant.” The cost is primarily internal (exposure, relinquishing the fantasy of a “perfect” illustration) rather than involving a sharp external consequence, so tension stays in a quiet, lyric register. Effective for this mode, but the pressure never quite tightens into a truly agonizing dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    The primary conflict is internal: can she externalize the mill deaths as haunting, or must she own the inherited guilt? Pressure escalates effectively when the ghostly expectation collapses into the shock of recognizing her own drunk, grieving voice on the radio. The twist of the wheel and decision to leave it—and to pocket the radio—are modest but decisive acts that crystallize her stance. Stakes stay intimate rather than perilous, but the emotional cost is legible and scaled appropriately to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake is internal: whether the keeper can sustain a stance of nonjudgmental witnessing in the face of overwhelming change. Pressure escalates via the plunge into the refuge and the cosmic montage of rising and dissolving civilizations, which intensifies the emotional demand on the keeper. However, conflict remains largely contemplative; the choice to enter and then to accept softening rather than resistance or escape is quiet and lightly priced. The stakes feel meaningful but never truly fraught, keeping tension in the strong-but-not-searing range.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—whether wonder can be nurtured and shared across generations—is clear and sharpened by the unplanned eclipse and the arrival of villagers. Pressure does deepen once the crowd gathers and Elara chooses not to explain but to sing and expose the curl, culminating in the quiet but real sacrifice of passing it on. Still, conflict remains very low-tension; there’s little sense she might fail, and external resistance is minimal. The escalation reads more as intensifying receptivity than as a narrowing of options with sharp trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether meaning can be preserved and the axis’s wound addressed through narrative—is interesting but plays out mostly as discovery rather than escalating conflict. The probe of the hearth and deciphering of the diary create a gentle deepening of pressure, yet she never faces real resistance, trade-offs, or a moment where she might refuse. Her decision to go to the underlibrary is a meaningful turn, but its danger and cost are gestured at rather than felt. As a result, tension is intellectual and atmospheric rather than gripping, which is below the bar for truly elite short work.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.5)
    Conflict is largely conceptual and atmospheric: Elias versus randomness, despair, and misalignment of lives, rather than a tangible opposing force. The analyst’s arrival offers a mild tightening—a pattern skeptic confronting the “conductor”—but the conversation resolves quickly with no real dilemma or visible cost. Stakes are framed in big terms (transposing lives, quiet revolutions) yet play out mainly as illustrative anecdotes rather than escalated tests. The result is resonant but relatively static pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether the possession will claim his “silence” and thus his self—is clear and sharpened by the void’s hunger for certainty. Pressure escalates as his rhetorical gambits visibly affect the space and the possession’s progress, culminating in the painted question that finally redirects it. However, the conflict remains almost entirely conceptual and ritualized; there’s little sense of a real alternative (failure path) beyond abstraction, which slightly blunts tension. The story earns its resolution via his choices, but the felt risk never quite matches the ingenuity of the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether she can use this ritual to conduct and preserve memory without breaking herself—is clear and threads the piece. Escalation comes through increasingly charged memories and their external effects, culminating in the vibrating spire, cracking lake, and horizon opening. The “before exhaustion hits” clock and her choice to push past it provide a meaningful tightening, but the concrete cost of that transgression remains mostly gestured at rather than dramatized in her body or options afterward. The tension is real, but the consequences could be more sharply felt to deepen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether she will integrate or remain fractured/passively trapped in recursive timelines—is signalized and followed through, with pressure increasing as she ascends the staircase of painful dates and echoes crowd around her. The key tightening comes when speaking confessions visibly destabilizes the viaduct and reality (“cracks spiderwebbing”), making honesty feel risky rather than purely cathartic. Still, the potential consequences of failure (psychic dissolution? eternal recurrence?) remain more implied than concretely dramatized, softening the sense of price and narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will succumb to numbness or find a way to feel and transmit presence again—is clear early and escalates via the risky experiment with backward Bach. The pressure tightens when the music “ruptures,” the cavern shudders, and the sanctuary’s usual controlled quiet is sacrificed for raw exposure. The cost is primarily emotional and conceptual (dragging trauma into the open), which suits the piece’s scale but keeps it relatively contained. Her “Again” at the end reads as a committed stance, not a soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—truth vs institutional erasure via quarantine zones—is clear and thematically weighty, and the message about Sector 7-C tightens pressure by revealing systemic corruption. Elias’s choice not to report but to investigate laterally is a genuine turn that reorients his tactics. Still, most conflict remains anticipatory and internal; the implied watchers and Bureau threat never confront him directly on the page, so tension rises more in concept than in concrete tests or losses. The scene closes on a poised commitment rather than a hard, costly squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether she will finally risk opening the vial and fully confronting her grief—is clear and signaled early. Escalation proceeds through one major tightening: she opens the vial after seventeen years, which triggers the avalanche of memory and forces her into the deeper risk of making those memories visible with the UV lamp. The cost is primarily emotional and conceptual, culminating in her acceptance of beauty as something painful to bear, and the renunciation of her prior avoidance stance. The conflict remains largely internal and smoothly resolved, with little real resistance after the decision point, which keeps the pressure solid but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake is conceptual—how to respond to “impossible choices” embodied by Silas and the village elders’ dilemma around the beings. Pressure does deepen from solitary reflection to a communal deadlock, and the poet’s choice to offer the rope instead of a verdict is an earned stance crystallization. However, resistance dissolves quickly once the elders see the rope; there’s little on-page cost or sustained friction, so the escalation feels more contemplative than hard-pressured. The conflict between fear and reverence remains largely abstract rather than viscerally tested.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Lira’s music can unbind and reanimate what the fires and silence have bound—is clear but operates at a quiet, atmospheric level. Escalation is mostly through intensifying responses (vines, hatch, child) rather than sharpened risk or narrowed options, so tension feels gentle rather than acute. Lira’s main act of agency is to keep playing and to frame each piece as a specific story, which does deepen the stakes but doesn’t demand a visible sacrifice beyond endurance. The cost at closure is conceptual (embracing incompletion) rather than dramatic, which suits the mode but limits perceived conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Vael will remain a counterfeit dealer or risk genuine empathy with its consequences—is clear early and escalates through the petal’s subsumption to the act of burning her inventory. Pressure deepens in an internal, accumulative way rather than via reversals, but the moment she chooses to press the petal to her sternum meaningfully forecloses the option of remaining unchanged. The cost of that choice is made explicit in the later renunciation of her trade and anticipated loss of reputation and income. Some readers might want a slightly sharper external counter-pressure, but the internal conflict is sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.8)
    The central stake—whether unseen workers will be acknowledged and whether that will change the harbor’s emotional economy—is inherently modest but potentially rich. However, Elias faces virtually no resistance: there is no risk of backlash, misinterpretation, or loss, and each delivery yields a uniformly positive reaction. The escalation is thus primarily in scale, not in pressure; the “cycle turning” is beautiful but never feels jeopardized. As a result, conflict remains gentle and undercuts the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Lira will remain an unmoored wanderer or find a place in a web of kinship—is legible and threads the whole piece. Escalation is modest: she chooses to encode clues, then to follow a cryptic note at night, then to dedicate her name, but none of these beats involve strong resistance, risk, or meaningful alternatives. Vesper’s immediate acceptance and the community’s near-frictionless emergence keep pressure low, softening the sense of cost. The story operates more as an unfolding revelation than a tested struggle, which limits conflict intensity despite emotional richness.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are conceptually large (collapse of echoes, erasure of vanished creatures, waking a giant who governs time) and signaled early, with a clear tightening when she overborrows and the chime almost wakes him. Escalation is mostly smooth and one-directional; she never seriously considers failure or an alternative path, and the solution (sculpting time around the chime, then borrowing from the giant’s dream) arrives without a hard trade-off beyond increased risk. Internal and external conflicts align but don’t meaningfully collide in a way that forces a painful choice. The pressure is coherent and rises once, but the victory feels a touch too uncostly for the stakes declared.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—can Elira re-understand her bond with Aris and re-tune the orchard’s silence—is clearly signaled and quietly escalates through accumulative pressure (waning light, ambiguous loss, the nonverbal “message” in geometry). The major deepening arrives when she realizes the true nature of the loss and when the equation reveals coordinates/frequency, forcing a shift from static mourning to active seeking. Agency appears in her choices to use the glass eyes, interpret the message, leave one eye as anchor, and go deeper rather than depart. Pressure remains more contemplative than acute, so the sense of cost and foreclosed alternatives, while present, is gentle rather than cutting.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    The primary stake—erasure versus being felt—is clear early and coherently developed through her ritual and the escalating boldness of leaving objects in visible places. The discovery of the tape reel, its remembered voice, and the staff’s public acknowledgement are genuine deepenings of pressure that test her willingness to risk a different kind of visibility. However, the conflict remains mostly gentle and internal, with little sense of real jeopardy or irretrievable loss beyond loneliness; the decision not to emerge is poignant but lightly priced.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether she will treat Lindy as specimen or kin—is clear, and the tightening beat is sharp when she raises the clippers and then refuses to cut. Her agency in “releasing control” functions as the pivotal action that forecloses her old path (careerist, dissecting scientist) and opens a new one. Emotional cost is evident in her weeping and the destruction of her journal, though consequences beyond the scene remain mostly implied. Overall pressure is largely internal and spiritual rather than situational, which slightly limits the felt stakes despite the strong central reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—her need to make meaning from the ocean’s offerings versus the toll of insomnia and creative failure—is legible from the outset. Pressure deepens with the hallucinatory visitation and the discovery that the brooch is a prototype of memorial technology, culminating in the trade that risks her only tangible “proof” to regain psychic equilibrium. The cost of surrendering the brooch and a cherished canvas is clear, though the external stakes stay intentionally modest and mostly internal. Escalation is more about intensifying resonance than sharp reversals, but it works under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central pressure—her fear of the unseen forces and doubt in her own gift—does intensify as the pearl warms, the shadows gather, and the pilgrim engages them. The key tightening is the pearl activating without her intent, forcing confrontation with forces she cannot predict. However, conflict remains mostly internal and contemplative, with limited sense of a path truly foreclosed or a price visibly paid. The resolution feels more like gentle alignment than a costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—can the town learn to live with its absences in a truer way—is clear, but pressure is gentle throughout. Elira encounters no real resistance from the storytellers or the council; trust and institutional acceptance accrue smoothly. The seasonal rite and chart feel earned conceptually, yet there’s no moment where a significant option is foreclosed or a genuine trade-off bites on the page. As a result, accumulation replaces escalation; thematically apt, but dramatically soft.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant conflict—whether she will risk being “unraveled” by confronting the fortress of truths—is clear and escalates through the descent to the handleless door and the dare to press the punch. The door moment functions as a genuine tightening: after the mirror gauntlet of self-accusations, she must either commit or turn back. However, her near-immediate acceptance (“She hesitated—not from fear, but reverence”) blunts the sense of real jeopardy; we’re told this will cost her, but we don’t see a strong last-minute tug of self-protection or alternative path being foreclosed. The cost is gestured at and partially paid (loss of the punch, identity shift), but it never feels as sharp as the setup promises.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elira will truly surrender to, and accurately honor, the tile’s nonverbal symphony—is clear but very quiet. Pressure does deepen when the flood of others’ memories and the whale-song alignment force her to choose whether to trust experience over skepticism. Yet there’s no significant foreclosed path or hard trade-off; the conflict remains largely about acceptance versus detachment, with little real risk to her identity or vocation if she walked away. The result is a lovely but low-intensity arc where tension functions more as atmosphere than as sharpened stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether he will finally access a realm “past farewell” and what that implies for his immortality—stays conceptually strong but lacks friction. The storm arrives on cue, the method works as advertised, and no real obstacle or counterpressure emerges once the ritual begins, so escalation is mostly a matter of sensory intensity rather than narrowing options. His decision to step through does close off his prior existence, but he never seems tempted to refuse, hedge, or delay. As a result, tension is felt more as awe-building than as genuine conflict under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how the child will use the ink to rebalance unfairness—is present from the outset and threads through the visitors’ scenes. Yet pressure is low: no one opposes the child, no institution threatens to shut this down, and the mortician quickly collaborates instead of complicating. The night proceeds smoothly from one success to the next, so there’s little real escalation, risk, or trade-off tested on the page. The child’s decision to go to the father with the pen is meaningful, but it’s not forced by accumulating danger—more a continuation of an already-articulated stance.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether her solitary, controlled practice of invented histories remains hers alone or opens into a chorus—is clear and does tighten around the discovery of a foreign history in the lamp’s hum. The key escalation is the recognition that the mountain already holds others’ fictions, which forces her to reconsider her role and culminates in leaving the notepad open. That choice has conceptual and emotional cost (ceding control, embracing vulnerability) but the conflict remains mostly internal and gently modulated, so tension never reaches a truly sharp edge. It’s strong for a quiet, lyric piece but not maximally pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—resisting bureaucratic erasure by preserving the textures of the nameless—is clear, but the pressure on that stake doesn’t really tighten; it’s steady rather than escalating. The closest thing to a deepening is the child’s shoe vigil, which adds poignancy but not a new cost or narrowed option. Elias’s final commitment to continue collecting functions as a stance crystallization, yet it doesn’t feel differently pressured from the opening. Conflict here is thematically rich but structurally static.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether she will keep trying to decode her sister’s loss via metaphysical means or confront her own silence—is clear and tight. Escalation is accumulative: years of failed attempts concentrate into this final ritual and a reimagined last argument, culminating in the shell cracking and the compass pointing inward. Her decision to stop retelling and to leave the observatory is an earned renunciation with evident emotional cost. Still, the conflict remains almost entirely internal and contemplative; there’s little resistance or counterforce beyond her own pattern, which keeps the pressure strong but not blistering.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether the raft city can resist privatization without losing its soul—is clear early and tightens as Lira escalates from local murals to a citywide map-mural that forces a public stance. Her agency clearly drives the key turns: choosing art over confrontation, redirecting commerce, and finally refusing City Hall in favor of collective reorganization. The external antagonistic pressure is more described than dramatized (contracts and developers mostly appear as atmosphere) so the cost manifests as “privatization stalls” rather than a sharply felt sacrifice or loss. The tension is persistent and coherent, but the climax lacks one hard, irreversible price that would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how this last artifact will be witnessed in its final moment—is clear and coherent. Pressure escalates via the live clock to 05:00 and the impending irrecoverable message; her preparation and waiting build a credible tightening, culminating in the imagined hiss and her decision to mark and leave. Conflict is primarily internal/ethical (documentation vs elegy, utility vs beauty), and while it’s beautifully handled, it never quite crystallizes into a sharp trade-off on the page. Still, for an accumulative, lyric piece, the narrowing of options and the felt cost of witnessing something that cannot be saved are legible.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are clearly articulated—the orchids and decade of research, the narrow window before the tide and anchor lift—but the conflict remains largely declarative rather than dramatically contested. Elara’s "magnetic calm" and unbroken competence mean there’s no real escalation beyond the background clock and the anchor’s groan growing louder. The procedure never truly threatens to fail, nor does another pressure (emotional, relational, or physical) force a trade-off. As a result, tension is present but muted, preventing this from reading as fully sharpened under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—locating where rivers truly begin—is clear early and remains coherent. Pressure does escalate in a quiet way: the condensation’s new pattern as herald forces him to act, and stepping onto potentially unstable ice to perform the seventeenth phrase is a concrete tightening. However, obstacles are minimal and success once he acts is immediate and uncontested, so conflict never quite bites as hard as the conceptual ambition of the piece suggests. The cost of action is mostly implied rather than dramatized, capping the sense of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Virelle can be rebalanced into a shared existence—is clear, and pressure does accumulate as the town slowly stirs. However, conflict is almost entirely one-sided ritual fulfillment; there’s no resistance, failure mode, or real sense that her effort could cost her more than departure. Escalation reads as increased density of manifestations rather than sharpened jeopardy. The piece succeeds as a contemplative rite but lacks the sharper edge of risk or loss that high-end venues often want, even in quiet stories.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake is well-defined: Elira must choose between fleeting survival and using the vial to reconfigure deep-seated trauma embedded in the temple. Escalation is clear as her oxygen alarm speeds up, the vial grows from warm to “hot,” and the sensory/mnemonic assault intensifies, narrowing her options to a single high-cost act of staying. The paradox of needing stillness while under threat from time and pressure provides a strong internal-external braid of conflict. The resolution—refusing flight and accepting death to complete the ritual—feels earned and carries visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—inscribing unsilenced truth into the world before the authorities arrive—is legible and the time pressure is clear. Escalation exists (finding the lattice, the light fracturing into whispers, the witnesses climbing, the imminent boots on gravel), but the boy encounters little resistance or ambiguity once he commits; there’s no real sense his attempt might fail or backfire. The key tightening is his decision to fuse the lattice with the central lens, foreclosing retreat and fixing the cost. Strong, but still more a beautiful ritual than a pressured contest of options.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stakes—whether the curse/debt will remain static or be transmuted—are clear, and they do tighten at the moment the bead is given to Elara. However, pressure operates more as fated pattern than as conflict tested through difficult decisions; Elara’s acceptance is immediate and unopposed, and the bride’s “vengeance” never faces a live alternative on the page. The frost and withering trees hint at urgency but do not concretely foreclose options or force trade-offs in scene. As a result, the climax feels moving but relatively low in friction for this standard.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether she can rewrite a destructive lineage of “broken precedents” by mending this plate—is clear and coherently pursued through the sewing ritual. Escalation is primarily textural: as she sews, the environment answers more strongly and the plate comes alive, culminating in a reweighted future (the child and storm stepping out, the canyon learning to sing). What’s missing for higher pressure is any genuine sense that failure, interruption, or an alternative path is live on the page; no antagonist or cost tests her resolve in the moment, so tension stays contemplative rather than fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether faith and communal orientation can be restored through this act of reassembly—is clear and coherently pursued. Pressure “escalates” texturally as she uncovers more context (the circle of stones, the displaced axis) and commits fully by reconstructing the dial, but the process faces little friction, risk, or alternative path. Her choice to root herself permanently is a meaningful renunciation, though it arrives as a serene inevitability rather than the end of a felt struggle. The piece succeeds as quiet, accumulative conflict but stops short of sharper costs or a live contest of options.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes remain mostly conceptual: preserving emotional meaning against digital erasure and bureaucratic loss. The widow’s message is a potential pressure point, but there’s no on-page obstacle, opposition, or decision that tests whether the protagonist can or will succeed. The escalation from general method to this specific mission reads as intensification in example, not as a true tightening of options or risk. As a result, tension is low and the piece never quite converts its rich premise into felt, evolving pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.5)
    The external stake (a coup timed to celestial events) is high and legible, and the meaningful tightening comes when the flame “shudders violently,” forcing her into adjacent-layer reconnaissance and accelerated counterweaving. However, opposition stays largely abstract and offstage; once she understands the plot, nothing directly pushes back against her tactics besides time. Her strategy of misdirection via tapestries is clever and satisfying, but the price she pays on-page is mostly exhaustion and social dismissal, so the escalation feels more intellectual than viscerally pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.9)
    The primary stake—whether she will remain trapped in unsaid apology or re-enter the live space of choice—is clear, and tension accrues as messages grow more pointed and the letters begin to glow. Escalation comes through intensifying symbolic pressure rather than overt reversals: the condensation’s accusations, the letters’ stirring, then their dissolution and replacement with new, gentler imperatives. Her key act of agency is a kind of earned stasis/renunciation (she refuses to re-read or restate the apology, and instead surrenders the letters and her hesitation), which appropriately forecloses one path. The conflict stays largely internal and meditative, with no explicit “test” moment where an alternative action is seriously considered on the page, so the pressure feels high but not razor-tight.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Mira will truly witness and “let it breathe” versus using the anesthetic as escape—is clear and thematically charged. Pressure deepens as she decrypts more of the cast, moving from chaotic marks to intelligible phrases that confront her with the child’s expectations and her own fears of failed translation. However, escalation is mostly tonal and reflective; there’s little sense that alternative paths remain live or are being foreclosed through difficult choice. The resolution feels right but somewhat inevitable from the outset, limiting the felt cost of her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elira can transform a found fragment into a living experience that rekindles her own joy—is clear and coherently pursued. Pressure escalates texturally rather than through overt obstacles, culminating in the risky noon experiment and the communal response that validates her deeper need. The internal conflict (preservation vs rediscovery, acclaim vs authentic delight) is well suggested but never fully brought to a sharp on-page dilemma. As a result, the arc feels satisfying but relatively low-friction, which trims the score in a market that prizes more acute crucibles.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central pressure revolves around whether and how Elira can activate the mural and whether she will remain a detached restorer or surrender to being transformed. There is a clear tightening when the nickel’s sound reveals the method and when the mural’s waves peel back layers of memory and identity. However, opposition is mostly conceptual; there’s little resistance, loss, or risk of harm beyond transient disorientation, so stakes remain relatively gentle. That keeps tension from reaching the level expected in top-tier venues.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—preserving outlawed language under a regime that taxes thought—is strong and signaled early, with the greenhouse mission as its concrete test. Pressure does deepen when Vex recognizes the lullaby and chooses to help, and when the community begins to engage with the encoded vines under drone surveillance. However, escalation is more conceptual than visceral: nothing truly jeopardizes the mission in scene, and the Bureau’s threat remains distant. The result is tense and coherent but a touch too smooth for maximal impact.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether her seemingly one-sided labor of song into silence has meaning—is established early and deepened by details of war trauma and insomnia. Pressure escalates subtly as we see the broad, off-page consequences (soldiers, fishermen, children) while she remains unaware, sharpening the poignancy of her isolation. The new line on the postcard functions as the key tightening, resolving whether she is heard without “fixing” her sleeplessness or solitude. The conflict remains primarily internal and never forces a visible trade-off on the page, which keeps it just short of the highest tension bands.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—honoring the dead by preserving, not resurrecting—is clear and the rules introduce a real conceptual cost. Escalation is mostly achieved via contrast: other caretakers who pushed too hard and lost their wings of the library, which raises the perceived risk of forcing anything. On the page, though, the caretaker never truly wavers or faces a fresh dilemma; we don’t see a live alternative tested and foreclosed, just a consistent endurance of her stance. As a result, the tension is more atmospheric than pressurized, strong but quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—risking civilization-level frequencies to repair trust—is clear and thematically rich. Pressure escalates via deepening: from solitary reconstruction to group performance where a broken promise could “shatter” truth again, with the curator’s warning sharpening that risk. However, the ritual proceeds smoothly; there is no on-page snag, hesitation, or discord that forces a new tactical or moral choice at the peak. The result is strong conceptual tension but relatively low experiential jeopardy in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central stake—whether she can infuse a soulless control system with compassion—is clear and sharpened by the contrast between starving villages and rigid floodgates. There is a meaningful deepening when the harmonic inscriptions appear and she chooses a path of covert “synchronization” rather than obedience. Still, conflict remains largely internal and unresisted by concrete obstacles or timed pressures in-scene, so the escalation never quite bites as hard as the premise and world would allow.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can preserve and meaningfully recover lost songs without erasing herself—tightens clearly with the meteorite discovery and the emergence of patterns in the dust. The key deepening is the resurrection of her mother’s lullaby, which forces her to confront grief and abandon the safety of self-reinvention. However, the conflict remains largely internal and once the meteorite’s power is accepted, there is little on-page resistance or real risk of failure; the process feels almost too smooth. The emotional price is credible but the pressure could sharpen with one concrete, jeopardizing obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Elara will cross a final threshold to reach/understand her father and the sacredness of thresholds—is present early and tightens steadily. Escalation is mostly internal and conceptual, but the discovery that her father became structure and the temporal loop of her own handwriting sharpen the choice. Her leap is an act of surrender that forecloses remaining in “Before” and pays an emotional price. Stakes skew abstract/metaphysical rather than visceral, which keeps tension more contemplative than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—finding belonging rather than remaining in disconnection—is clear but stays mostly internal and abstract. There is one real escalation when impossible fireflies appear and pattern themselves into reactor schematics and an open hand, deepening her sense of threshold. However, the “until sunrise” clock never meaningfully pressures her choices, and she isn’t forced into a difficult trade-off or renunciation. The tension is more gentle wonder than tightening conflict, which keeps the piece from feeling fully high-stakes even on an intimate scale.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding why paths disappear before memory fades—is stated early and the crater glass deepens her knowledge in a way that reweights that stake. However, pressure never meaningfully tightens: there’s no resistance, danger, or consequential trade-off; each step simply works. The realization is earned but not hard-won, so escalation feels more like graceful unfolding than genuine testing of her commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict and stakes are very gentle: there is no real opposition to Elias besides ambient monotony and the risk of indifference. The story essentially accumulates small, pleasant “wins” with each audience member, but there’s no clear escalation, reversal, or moment where his method might fail and force a new tactic. The dominant stake—can he transfigure a dull night into wonder—never feels in doubt. As a result, the piece works as a mood piece but lacks the pressure needed for higher-band scores.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central conflict—her refusal to surrender memory and meaning in a world that bans nostalgia—escalates via the moonstone’s discovery and the decision to dance to “inscribe” rather than escape. Internal and external stakes converge when the villagers arrive, transforming a private act of resistance into a communal pivot, with some cost shown through exhaustion and blood. However, pressure remains largely symbolic and interior; we never feel a concrete risk of punishment or loss in this scene if she fails or is discovered. The escalation is satisfying but could gain force from one sharper on-page consequence tied to the regime’s threat.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal and philosophical: his desire to “consecrate” the mundane in a world that finds him odd. The stakes—how he or others see the ordinary—are thematically rich but never pressured by a concrete opposing force on the page. His morning proceeds without obstacles; the rings fade, he stands, he goes to do his work, with no real escalation or tested trade-off. The result is textured but essentially static tension.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—how he will live with and translate accumulated grief—is clearly signaled and returns at the end. Pressure deepens as he moves from reading children’s letters to confronting his own losses, culminating in the costly choice to add his own letter and keep walking. However, conflict is largely internal and pre-decided; there’s little sense that another path is truly live in the present, so escalation feels like deepening texture rather than a tightened vise. The result is affecting but relatively low-tension.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—keeping the “equations for hope” alive across timelines—is intriguing but remains largely abstract and unopposed. There is a clear deepening when she asks, “What if grief could be transmuted into lift?” and the resulting resonance cascade affects multiple timelines. However, there’s little sense that failure would genuinely threaten her or anyone in this scene, and no felt sacrifice or narrowed option on her part. The escalation is conceptually elegant but emotionally low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake is existential/emotional: how to bear and relate to inherited grief (“legacy’s burden”) and whether to merely map or to witness and share it. Pressure escalates primarily when she discovers that someone else was “trying to map the ache,” which deepens her task from technical to spiritual and forces the choice to leave her own sketch. The conflict remains largely internal and contemplative, with no sharp reversal or constrained options beyond whether to engage or turn away. That keeps the piece from higher tension scores, but within a quiet mode the deepening is coherent and sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—opening possibility in the mirrors via the child’s lent heartbeat—is conceptually strong but lightly pressured on the page. Conflict is largely implicit and internalized; there’s no meaningful resistance or risk to her attempt, only a gradual unveiling as each mirror responds. The escalation beat is the mirrors’ shiver and the third mirror reflecting her past, which deepens meaning but doesn’t significantly narrow options or demand a trade-off. The piece succeeds as a lyric ritual but lacks palpable tension or a hard turn in stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Elira can muster a more binding, embodied peace—reads clearly, but on-page opposition is minimal. Most of the conflict is internal and conceptual, centered on her resolve to try again after repeated failure, with only a soft external test when the survivors must choose to sign. There is a mild escalation from solitude and doubt to communal, risky commitment, yet no moment where refusal or sabotage genuinely threatens the outcome. As a result, tension is present but muted, more contemplative than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Elias can “give something back” without changing his larger, harmful praxis—is signaled early and tightened through the ritual’s irreversibility (he leaves the egg, destroys the map). The pressure escalates via the earth’s response and his emotional exposure, culminating in a quiet but decisive renunciation: he chooses echo over resurrection or preservation, then returns to ruthlessness with that cost acknowledged. Conflict is primarily internal and moral, not situational, but it’s coherent and scaled appropriately for the length. A slightly clearer sense of what he risks (beyond self-concept) in performing the ritual could sharpen stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—freeing the harvest of echoes and defying the lullaby of conformity—is clear and present from early on. Escalation comes through increasingly resistant threads culminating in the “final thread” knotted with “a thousand suppressed confessions,” which is a credible tightening. What’s missing for a higher score is a sharper sense of tangible cost or danger: what she stands to lose if the sanctuary remains sealed or if the echoes backlash. As written, the conflict feels meaningful but emotionally cushioned.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether he can reorient his storytelling ethics and, secondarily, his relationship with Mira—is established and carried through. There is one meaningful deepening via the veteran’s bottle-throwing and his choice to keep performing, reinterpreted as a turning point. However, escalation is mostly conceptual; the present dome scene lacks a live test or new risk that forces a hard trade-off. The final decision to return to Mira with a show is thematically apt but arrives with relatively little on-page pressure in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are primarily conceptual/emotional: whether vanishing histories and species receive a moment of dignified witnessing. Escalation is subtle but present—the ritual builds, the breeze lifts the monarchs, the final knot and the single descending monarch sharpen the cost of ephemerality and the solitude of her task. Agency is expressed mainly through renunciation (no rescue, no audience, no touch), which forecloses the path of preservation in favor of honoring disappearance. The pressure remains coherent but never truly bites; it’s beautifully handled for a meditative piece, but not maximally tense.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether forgotten names can be preserved as living resonance rather than dead echo—is clearly posed and quietly escalated through the increasingly embodied interaction with rope, wax, and metal. The main tightening is the moment of sounding the helix: until then, the success of this new liturgy is uncertain, and the payoff is the chorus that “settles” into ice and self. Costs are conceptual and vocational (abandoning old temple gods, unraveling the ancient rope, erasing personal signature) rather than immediate danger, but they’re legible. The piece stays meditative, so tension operates more as deepening commitment than as acute conflict, which keeps the pressure from reaching the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s need to understand why paths choose walkers—is clear, and the storm/bunker/decaying AI provide a situational pressure frame. However, escalation is modest: once she lies down to dream, there’s little sense of risk that she might fail, be harmed, or have to choose between competing goods. The main tightening is the directive’s imminent collapse, but it reads more as poetic backdrop than as a pressing constraint on her decisions. The ending offers resolution, but not after a strenuous test of her commitment or values.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether his austere, rational “devotion” will elicit a cosmic response—is clear, and we feel a mild tightening as Sirius descends and the diagrams grow denser. However, the external and internal conflicts remain largely static; there is no moment at which he might choose comfort, status, or safety over the ritual, nor any real risk of failure dramatized on the page. The “cost” is presented mostly in retrospective summary (sold cloak, meager food) rather than tested during the scene itself. As a result, tension exists conceptually but doesn’t escalate to a truly pressure-filled peak.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant conflict—how to discharge decades of resentment without betraying her pacifism—is clear and sharpened by the loss of the music box’s function. Escalation comes through the reframing of the pin, the bodily mapping of stored rage, and the moment the melody resurfaces internally, narrowing her options away from mechanical dependence. The price is conceptual and emotional: she must trust her own cellular memory and accept the permanence of the box’s brokenness. The lack of any external counterforce or concrete risk keeps the pressure relatively low-intensity for elite-venue standards.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—capturing the runaway dream and redefining the boundary between waking and dreaming—is clear. Pressure does accumulate via ritual intensification and the sense that this is her “final craft,” but the conflict itself is quite gentle: the dream descends “not in fear, but in curiosity,” and never truly resists. There’s one main tightening when the dream finally leans into her breath and she presses the obsidian disc, yet no meaningful option feels dangerously at risk. As a result, the emotional and tactical stakes never fully bite despite the beautiful frame.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether she can maintain a living bridge of wisdom and love to her daughter—is clear from early on. Pressure escalates through the discovery of the daughter’s fresh vow (“I will never understand you”) and the active effort to retrieve and stitch it, culminating in the risk that her work may never be seen. The daughter’s unseen visit and left-behind green scrap deepen the conflict into a live, charged uncertainty rather than resolving it. Stakes remain primarily internal and relational, so the escalation is more emotional/textural than perilous, but it reads coherent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.8)
    Conflict is largely internal and conceptual: she must confront the Archive’s silence and risk embracing forbidden knowledge. Escalation occurs through deepening understanding rather than external obstruction—the bathroom inquiry, glyph revelation, and word “Again” each increase the stakes of what she is willing to see. However, options never feel meaningfully narrowed by opposition; there’s little sense that she might refuse the knowledge or pay a sharp price beyond unease. The result is thoughtful and coherent but not especially tense.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—how to handle the sentient lexicon so it doesn’t unravel reality—is clear, and there is a meaningful turn when Elira reframes the mission from extraction to reconciliation. However, on-page pressure remains relatively gentle: Kael is injured but recoverable, the chrono-core stabilizes quickly once they “ask what it wants to teach,” and no option with a serious immediate price is actively debated or foreclosed. The escalation is mostly intellectual rather than experiential; we are told the prior failure and cosmic stakes, but the present-tense conflict resolves without resistance from the lexicon or the mountain. The result is thematically satisfying but only modestly tense.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether reclaiming *Lirien* will heal or further fracture her—is signaled early via the twin-soul premise and sharpened as she nears the name in the garden. Escalation tracks with each descent layer, and the key tightening occurs when she hesitates at reaching for the name, fully facing the potential cost. The resolution arises from her agency in choosing an integrated identity rather than a binary restoration, and the ship/fog’s reaction signals consequence beyond mere mood. The conflict is almost entirely internal, so the external situation never quite bites as hard as it could, but the internal stakes are credible and sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—repairing a confused temporal mechanism/anomaly—is clear but faces almost no genuine opposition; once she identifies the rope’s pattern, events unfold smoothly. The main “tightening” is the clock’s ticking changing as she works, but it doesn’t threaten failure or impose a meaningful dilemma. Her agency is real (she chooses to merge absence rather than erase it), yet the lack of obstacles or real risk keeps tension modest. The resolution feels earned but low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring harmonic balance without destroying the energy beings—is clear, and there is a meaningful tightening when the hush moves from local experiments to affecting the largest being. However, there is little sense of risk, resistance, or possible failure; the hush spreads smoothly, the beings never actively oppose her, and no option is visibly foreclosed. As a result, pressure feels more like a controlled ritual than a true test, which limits escalation and perceived cost.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—can she coax meaning/understanding from a broken world via the prism—is clearly signaled and deepens as the ritual proceeds and visions begin. Escalation is handled as a textural tightening: the pavilion’s hum, increasingly interwoven memories, and Cassiopeia’s entry all raise the pressure toward a conceptual choice about how she reads her life (“wandering” vs “summoned”). The fragility of the alignment (“one misaligned star, one tremor…”) adds conditional tension. However, she is never forced into a sharp trade-off or renunciation; the conflict is finely made but remains relatively low-risk and contemplative rather than testing her commitment through a substantive loss.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.8)
    Conflict is almost entirely internal and conceptual, with pressure expressed as saturation rather than opposition: the deepening hush, the weight of ghosts, and the pull of nostalgia. There is a modest escalation from observing phenomena to identifying with the remembered dead and finally accepting her own eventual dissolution into the archive. However, options never feel meaningfully narrowed—there’s no strong sense of risk in her choices or a path genuinely foreclosed beyond a contemplative stance. The piece works as lyric meditation but lacks a sharper test of her motives or a visible cost beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Lira can use the mosaic to puncture the hopeless, starless sky—is clear and culminates effectively in the single star’s emergence. Pressure escalates via a density increase: her approach to the chamber, the increasingly specific sonic responses of the tiles, and the dust lifting into a suspended “constellation” all tighten toward the chord. Her final act of leaving the rag behind adds a concrete personal cost. What holds this below the top band is that risk of failure or meaningful alternative options are more implied than dramatized; the conflict is intense but largely one-directional.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—how they will navigate the potential separation and whether to force a decision—is present but handled with great delicacy. Most pressure sits offstage in the summarized “difficult conversation,” so on-page conflict is more about how to inhabit the pause than about confronting a live dilemma. The key turn is her choosing to release the demand for an immediate decision (“You don’t have to decide tonight”), which offers earned stasis but only a modest sense of cost. The emotional escalation is thus more deepening than tightening, credible but gentle enough to limit the stakes band.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—remaining in “secure” curated silence vs risking oneself to seek wild, nourishing silence—is clear and culminates in the decision not to return. Pressure escalates through the sudden inversion, ascent, tasting of silences, and the ticking down of the inversion hour toward gravity’s return. However, opposition is largely environmental and internal; the escape proceeds with little resistance, and the one-hour limit is mentioned rather than felt as an urgent constraint in real time. The final choice has conceptual heft but could benefit from one sharper, more pressured test of commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether and how the operator can midwife the woman’s passage from clenched grief into a usable silence—is clear and sustained. Pressure escalates modestly but credibly via the initial density of her silence, the storm glass’s response, and the gradual softening into tears and released posture. The operator’s agency is real but low-risk; we never feel that he might fail or that any path is truly foreclosed, which keeps the tension refined but limited. The ending with the enraged next passenger hints at higher stakes to come but doesn’t test him in this piece.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—reach the stairway and throne before sunrise or lose the chance to ascend—is established early and maintained throughout. Escalation is clear: discovery of the murals, descent into the memory-stairway, and the tremor as sunrise nears all narrow options and increase pressure. The internal conflict at the throne (which self to carry forward) dovetails effectively with the external deadline. The price (forfeiting other possible selves and erasing the orchard’s existence in this timeline) is conceptually strong but could be rendered more viscerally to heighten tension.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether and how she re-engages with a place of prior hurt to transform suffocation into a new passage—is legible and sustained. Pressure escalates modestly but clearly: approach → hover over the knocker → active engagement via scars → threshold’s surrender → step into lantern-field without looking back. The cost is conceptual/emotional rather than situational, yet the piece does convey a real foreclosure of the old mode of relating (“begging for warmth”) in favor of a lonelier, duty-bound role. Some beats restate the same internal stance instead of sharpening dilemma, which slightly mutes escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can re-enter a system of “promises” without being re-exploited, and transform pressure into something real—is clear and escalates toward the convergence. The ritual sequence gives a credible tightening as existential pressure mounts and she chooses not to resist but to channel her trauma into the seam. However, opposition remains largely internal and the outcome feels relatively assured; there’s little sense she might fail, be harmed, or corrupt the farm, so tension stays at a thoughtful hum rather than a knife-edge. The cost is more conceptual than sharply dramatized, which works but limits intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—uncovering a regime-shaking truth—is signaled early and sharpened by the risk that the cylinder might hold “nothing” or “everything.” Pressure escalates as she commits to playing the recording and as the content shifts from political confession to personal revelation. The decisive turn is the recognition that she is the swapped heir, which reconfigures the stakes from destruction to restoration. Conflict is largely internal and contemplative, with little external resistance; it works for this mode but limits the sense of concrete cost and tactical adaptation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether he remains a withdrawn, armored relic or becomes a conduit for possibility—is clear and resolved through his choice to perform the forgotten patterns. Escalation is present as the ritual intensifies (glass bending, roots rising, vortex of threads), culminating in his harmonization with the cosmos. However, pressure is relatively one-directional: there is little sense that he might refuse, fail, or pay a sharply delineated price in the moment. The cost of transformation is implied (loss of old identity, surrender of control) but not sharply contested or traded against an equally vivid alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central stake is her relationship to the archive—whether she is condemned to preserve loss or can ethically reorient it toward evidence of love. Pressure escalates gently as she discovers the button’s story and then maps seventeen artifacts, culminating in the decision to formalize this as a new practice (“Magnifications”). The emotional and ethical cost is present but relatively low-intensity; there’s no hard trade-off or serious risk beyond the vulnerability of re-believing in tenderness. The conflict is finely wrought but remains largely contemplative rather than sharply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—restoring suppressed histories into the live infosphere—is clear and escalates into a citywide blackout and direct regime attention. Pressure tightens via the power drain, wailing sirens, and imminent breach of the hatch, giving a good sense of ticking risk. However, there’s no on-page setback or serious tactical loss; the operation proceeds almost too smoothly, and the resolution avoids depicting any immediate personal consequence. The conflict remains compelling but could use one sharper trade-off or visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—silencing a world-unraveling prophecy—is clear and present early, and the pressure does intensify as the prophecy “stirs,” the fog thickens, and the prism flickers and finally shatters. However, conflict is mostly one-directional and ritualized; the prophecy’s resistance is felt as pressure rather than as a force that forces new tactics beyond subtle adjustments (“softened his attack,” “playing absence into presence”). His success feels largely foregone instead of genuinely in doubt, and we don’t see a sharply defined trade-off or loss beyond the abstract weight of what he erases. The result is quietly compelling but short of fully charged stakes and escalation for this level of ambition.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.4)
    Conflict here is almost entirely gentle and internal: Elira wants to listen and decode; the world mostly yields to that desire rather than resisting it. The discovery of the speck and the grandmother’s emergence function as gifts or revelations, not as hard-won turns that force choices or sacrifices. Stakes are thematically significant (will the forgotten be honored?), but they are never felt as precarious—the outcome doesn’t seem in doubt. The result is a beautiful but low-pressure arc with limited escalation beyond increased density of wonders.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s relationship to certainty and control—is clear and culminates in the choice to abandon his watch and old role. Escalation is more mythic and contemplative than pressured: the compass guides him smoothly rather than confronting him with real resistance or a hard trade-off. The key internal turn (from “fixing” to “befriending uncertainty”) is well staged but happens with relatively little on-page hesitation or cost-testing. This keeps the piece from feeling as tense as its conceptual stakes suggest.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether she can transform her guilt into a different kind of balance—is clear and coherently pressured by the ritual’s progression. Escalation comes from her choice to keep going as the coin cracks, effectively risking the loss of a rare, powerful artifact to fully own her remorse. The cost is palpable in the coin’s destruction and her physical collapse into “luminous regret.” The conflict remains largely internal and contemplative, so tension is strong but never quite sharp or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether she can coax these grief-bound echoes toward integration without erasing them—is clear and gently escalated when confessions layer, then tilt into laughter. Her playing the flute is the central act of agency, and the shift from sobbing echoes to laughter marks a real, if quiet, turn. However, the scene lacks strong sense of jeopardy or alternative outcomes; success feels likely from the outset, which softens perceived cost and tension. The emotional pressure is textured rather than sharp, appropriate to lyric mode but limiting peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator remains defined by torture or can reframe experience into a “mathematics of mercy”—is clear and consistently pressed. Escalation is primarily internal/accumulative: repeated bracing, thickening light, and intensifying memories culminate in the clearing of symbolic forms and the decision to offer up the strap. That renunciatory act under pressure functions as a credible narrowing of options and a cost-bearing choice. The piece does trend more contemplative than confrontational, so moment-to-moment tension is high but never razor-edged.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator can obtain and wield the lens to unlock the historian’s grief over erased cultures—is clear and thematically weighty. There is a meaningful tightening when the lens is acquired at the price of a personal memory and again when it begins to animate the painting, committing the narrator to what it reveals. However, external resistance is minimal (Mara offers the lens without real obstacle, and the ritual in the attic proceeds smoothly), so pressure escalates more in concept and imagery than in felt risk. The resolution feels earned but relatively gentle, without a hard on-page trade-off beyond the initial memory payment.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake is his need to uncover and acknowledge what’s been suppressed in this neglected place, with the implicit cost of emotionally absorbing what he finds. Escalation is subtle but present: from scanning dust, to identifying a specific pattern, to prying at the exact ceiling tile, to seeing the sequined figure and choosing to document rather than flee or dismiss. That said, pressure never quite sharpens into a real dilemma; there’s little sense that he could fail, or that remaining ignorant or leaving would carry competing advantages. The ending frames his responsibility clearly, but the conflict remains contemplative rather than tense.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—compressing eternity at the price of destabilizing a perfect system—is explicit and coherent. Pressure escalates texturally from latent instability to full-scale rupture and the apparition of an aperture packed with potential instants; her choice of which moment to take is the key tightening beat. However, resistance is mostly conceptual, not dramatized as a live, felt reluctance or counterforce, and she never seriously wavers. The cost lands more on the library than on her psyche or relationships, which keeps the stakes slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether his work can transform failure and forgetting into a new kind of rebellion—is clear and grows as his private hypothesis collides with institutional skepticism. Escalation is primarily deepening rather than reversal: the superstition with mirrors becomes method, then gets external validation and finally a joint praxis. The price is quiet but real: he abandons the fantasy of undoing the past in favor of the harder, humbler work of translation and mourning. Pressure could be sharpened slightly (the academic dispute and quadrant-wide stakes mostly stay off-stage), but for a lyric piece the tightening is sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central stake—whether he can redeem an old lie and “reclaim the light stolen by midnight” before literal shadow-pressure peaks—is clearly signaled and coherently escalated. The stone’s wilting near his chest is an effective early tightening that raises the cost of inaction or further dishonesty. Midnight’s approach and the shadow assault provide externalization of the inner conflict, though once he hits upon “singing truth” the path to victory feels nearly frictionless. The resolution is earned but could be sharpened by one additional moment where his approach nearly fails or demands a more explicit trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elira will find and embrace the place where rational explanations fail—is clear but mostly internal and contemplative. There is one main deepening when she psychometrically accesses Riel’s terror and surrender, but after that the path toward her own surrender feels unopposed. No external threat or genuine alternative (returning to the surface) is dramatized as a live option, so escalation is more about intensifying mood than narrowing choices. The final “homecoming” stance crystallizes, yet with limited felt jeopardy or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—how to orient art and survival, alone versus in alliance—is clearly signaled and does deepen as the magic slide’s imagery reframes her purpose. Escalation is primarily internal and thematic; the storm and GPS failure create pressure but never quite threaten her safety or force a hard trade-off on the page. Her decision to leave the piece, return to the villages, and reconfigure her practice is a genuine turn, but it comes with relatively little on-page cost beyond implied career/market sacrifices. Tension operates more as a meditative tightening than as a sharp narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—her need to reckon with the nocturnal blooming—is signaled early and followed through, but the conflict is almost entirely internal and contemplative. There is one clear tightening: the shift from merely suspecting meaning in the postcard to uncovering a whole hidden system in the cathedral glass, which redefines her life’s work. The price she pays is a commitment to an obscure, solitary vocation rather than any acute loss, so escalation reads as deepening rather than sharpening. It’s strong for a quiet piece, but doesn’t quite reach the intensity or visible trade-off required for a higher conflict/stakes score.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.0)
    The core conflict—wrestling truth from a resistant landscape/archive—is clear, and escalation tracks from technological failure to embodied ritual to irreversible witnessing. The dominant stake (whether silenced histories will be acknowledged at a human cost) tightens once she realizes solo decryption fails and chooses parley instead, then again when she understands she’s “retrocognitively trapped.” The price is largely internal and vocational rather than survival-based, but it’s felt in the surrender of institutional forms (reports, scanners) for a life of unending liturgy. The piece could sharpen tension by foregrounding one concrete, time-bound risk (e.g., institutional pushback or physical danger) during the turning point scenes.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the town will remain a hollow, cured husk or find a new form of life—is clear, and pressure accumulates via the contrast between lingering, passive townsfolk and the alchemist’s active reimagining. The key tightening is the handoff of the bottle to the child, which both literalizes shared memory and relinquishes his control, enabling the first emergent lantern. However, conflict is primarily conceptual and communal; the alchemist encounters little direct resistance, and there’s no moment where he must risk a specific loss to pursue this path. Tension exists, but it never quite bites as hard as the ideas would support.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Elira will remain a passive archivist or risk awakening the city’s buried emotions—is clear, but the pressure on that decision is relatively gentle. The prophecy discovery is a strong deepening beat, and the move from listening to activating via petals is a meaningful escalation. However, there’s little concrete resistance or visible downside on the page; the “price” of awakening empathy remains mostly implied. As a result, tension is more contemplative than sharp, landing just below a higher-stakes band.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.5)
    Pressure is largely situational and thematic—can she reverse entropy and “reopen what entropy had sealed shut”—rather than oppositional, but it does deepen as she commits to the ritual at the dais. Stakes (the fate of preserved life/time) are clear, but the narrative offers little active resistance or meaningful risk of failure. The key tightening comes from moving from contemplation to irrevocable action (pressing the acorn cap into the spiral). The result is a strong but relatively gentle escalation rather than a sharply tested conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—avoiding both false alarms and deadly silence—is established via the Great False Dawn and her distrust of sirens. Pressure accumulates as she installs triggers, logs variations, and waits while the storm gathers, with a strong mini-turn when the rope trembles then stills. The final toll provides clear resolution, validating her method; however, the escalation remains contemplative rather than truly harrowing, and no path is visibly foreclosed on the page. The stakes are conceptually high but experienced with a subdued, meditative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake is internal—whether he can sustain and deepen his chosen practice of honoring cosmic endings without institutional validation—and it’s clear early. Pressure escalates appropriately for a lyric piece when the rogue comet appears, offering a once-only, unlogged event that tests his method of presence rather than prediction. His “choices” are mostly attentional and interpretive (kneeling, tracing the path, choosing reverence over alarm), so the conflict remains understated but coherent. The cost and narrowing of options are emotional and philosophical rather than situational, which keeps this below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—maintaining the covenant by not opening the box and preserving the unsaid—is clear but largely static. Pressure does tighten somewhat through the notion of storms and the density of spectral stories, yet she is never forced into a near-decision or a genuine trade-off on the page. The final gaze with the beekeeper reweights meaning but doesn’t arise from a concrete escalation of conflict she must respond to differently. As a result, tension feels beautifully sustained but only modestly escalated.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake is Vey’s alienation from time and desire to understand/relate to it, with Lira’s grief as a braided but secondary pressure. Escalation is subtle but present: from solitary tinkering to risky outreach on the Hollow Net to physically opening the capsule and fusing the urn pieces, culminating in the overwhelming vision sequence. The conflict remains largely internal and conceptual, so danger is more existential than visceral; there’s no real sense that failure would materially worsen their already-stranded state. Still, the final shift in stakes—curating echoes instead of chasing measurement—reads as a closing of one path with the implicit cost of stewardship.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—whether the boy’s loss can be reconfigured into a different, livable beauty—is clear and followed through. Pressure does deepen from silent shock to engagement to launch, and Elira’s choice to tend rather than retrieve or repair constitutes the main turn. However, tension remains gentle; there’s little sense of real risk that her approach might fail or cost her something she doubts accepting. The conflict is thematically apt but emotionally low-voltage for an elite-venue standard.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—using remaining time to create a living monument of interspecies respect before he dies—is clear, but pressure escalates only mildly. The six-month prognosis and “final month” markers set a clock, yet there are no serious obstacles, reversals, or ethical trade-offs that test his resolve. The sparrow entanglement hints at localized tension, but it resolves gently and doesn’t materially alter options. As a result, the story reads as a graceful unfolding rather than a tightening under pressure, limiting conflict intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether her rational, catalytic model of homecoming will hold—is clearly signaled and sharpened by the spectrometer’s failure to find anything anomalous. Pressure escalates as each scientific expectation quietly collapses, pushing her toward a more precarious acceptance of emergent meaning. The cost is conceptual and identity-level rather than external, but it is legible in her decision to leave the amber and walk away carrying “density” instead of data. The conflict remains mostly interior and could tolerate a touch more friction or resistance in the peak beat, but it still coheres and deepens.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether and how life can reclaim a site of mass violence—is clear and consistently present, and the birds’ permissions provide a subtle tightening of pressure. However, escalation is gentle: there’s no genuine threat that the concord might fail, and no hard trade-off that would force a different tactic. His agency is steady rather than tested; the main “turn” is moving from preparation into planting once the feather falls. The closing stance is satisfying but not born of an unmistakably sharpened conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Bracken will remain a retired tracker of death or transform into a keeper of voices who closes emotional distance—is clear and thematically potent. There is a meaningful escalation when his handler’s voice appears on the cylinder and he chooses to lead the group to the bunker, reorienting his life’s purpose. However, the path from coordinates to successful expedition to fully functioning archive is almost entirely unopposed: no scarcity, danger, or moral tension complicates the journey or decoding work. As a result, pressure grows more in idea and scope than in felt risk, which holds the conflict band down.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether she will surrender to fear/nostalgia or remain as an exploratory witness in a broken temporal world—is clear but mostly internal. Pressure modestly escalates from quiet ritual to the sudden appearance of the violet filament, which prompts a choice to engage and record rather than retreat. The sense of cost (isolation, pariahdom, estrangement from family) is present but mostly summarized, not actively pressured in-scene. As a result, the climax reads contemplative rather than sharply testing her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the sky will mend or fracture—is clear and large, with the wrong sky and frozen game signaling real consequence. Yet opposition is largely implicit; nothing meaningfully resists Elric once he reaches the table, and the swapping proceeds without reversals or genuine jeopardy. Escalation is mostly atmospheric (tremors, ice cracking) rather than choice-driven, so he never has to trade off between competing harms or risk real loss. The ending feels more like a successful ritual than a hard-won resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the narrator (and others) can reclaim/authenticate experience and gesture outside scripted power—is clear and steadily intensifies. Escalation operates texturally: the gathering of survivors, the widow’s renunciation, and the penumbra’s thickening all deepen pressure before the sovereign arrives. The final refusal to bow and insistence on “listen” foreclose a path back to performance, though the price is conceptual (being truly seen, potential future conflict) rather than materially dramatized. Stakes remain somewhat abstract, but for a lyric piece they’re legible and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she can transform unbearable memory into a livable “shape of home”—is clear and internally pressurized. Escalation is primarily textural: the ritual intensifies, the mountain responds, and the gravity/sanctuary pull culminates in her stepping through the archway and laying down the stone. The price is a redefinition of identity and stance toward the past, but there is little sense of real risk or a live alternative path being foreclosed in the moment. The piece could reach a higher band if her hesitation or what she might lose by succeeding were made more sharply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether she can reach self-forgiveness without erasing real harm—is clear early and coherently maintained. Pressure deepens as she moves from abstract pattern-reading (tapestries) to the personal, accusatory mirror, where she must choose not to flinch or destroy/deny the image but to acknowledge it (“I see you”). The cost is that she keeps the historical fact of harm and her exile; what changes is her willingness to carry it honestly. Internal conflict and escalation are credible but largely smooth and lyric rather than sharply crisis-driven, which limits intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central stake—whether she will submit a single coherent truth to appease the spire/elders or uphold multiplicity—is clear and sharpened by the ticking ritual deadline. Pressure escalates via the spire’s thickening mist, then its shudder and partial revelation after her self-confession, culminating in the bell and elders waiting below. Her choice to remain atop the tower and offer only refracted apologies is an earned stance crystallization. The price of that choice (personal, communal, or cosmic) is more implied than concretely tested, muting the sense of loss or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central stake—can she turn her own and the world’s fractures into sacred meaning before the workshop (and possibly she herself) is destroyed—is clearly established and escalates. Pressure tightens via both the dwindling breathable air and the increasing emotional cost of each memory she binds to the statue. Her agency is crucial: every escalation comes from her choosing to continue the ritual despite worsening conditions, culminating in the final choice to offer her abandoned self and tears. The main limitation is that external peril never quite forces a concrete tactical adaptation beyond “finish faster,” so the conflict stays slightly more symbolic than physically consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she can reorient her sense of meaning and artistry after the world “stops making sense”—is clear and threads through the entire piece. Pressure escalates quietly but credibly as she moves from quay to cave, from idle brush to intense, almost exhausting painting, culminating in the palm-on-stone affirmation and the renunciation of the mirror’s authority. The cost is subtle but present: she accepts impermanence and the loss of her earlier fantasy of “permanent beauty,” choosing an ongoing, less comforting covenant instead. The conflict remains largely internal and could use one slightly sharper external pinch or tangible risk to reach higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara’s quiet method can redirect ships and prove her belief—is clear, but pressure is relatively soft. Once she decides to use the cork, success comes quickly, with minimal resistance or complication; she doesn’t adapt tactics or pay a visible price. The internal and external stakes are aligned but never truly clash, so escalation registers as a gentle deepening rather than a tightening. This leaves the story emotionally satisfying but low in dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether and how she can reconstruct orientation amid loss—stays legible, and the moon-phase constraint plus past failure (walking into a wall of static) give the conflict a concrete contour. Pressure does build in an accumulative sense as the text moves from private ritual to the large-scale “reverse migration” and the charged full-moon ritual at the end. However, there’s only one mild tightening (respecting the lunar rhythm after being burned) and no strong on-page foreclosure or reversal; the piece feels more like a steady state refined than a conflict sharply escalated and tested. The cost is implied—enduring solitude and raw solace—rather than dramatized through a specific painful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stakes—her ability to act and connect without harming others in an over-empathic world—are clear and present early. Pressure tightens primarily at the arrival of the three traumatized figures and their request for “shadow,” pushing her to adapt her truth-telling and use the truffles and eye. The later decision to relinquish the relic is a softer but genuine escalation in cost, trading personal safety for a more distributed, trust-based safety. Conflict remains mostly internal and quietly situational, so the sense of jeopardy is felt but never acute.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—decoding the stranger’s final gesture—is established early, and the pressure does deepen when the “gap” finally speaks and links the dead man to Elara. However, the investigation proceeds without real risk or opposition; Silas never faces a concrete dilemma beyond whether to interpret and archive what he learns. The major turn (his understanding that the Edelweiss is a signature and his choice not to report) is conceptually strong but emotionally under-tested, with no serious temptation to do otherwise. Tension stays quiet and steady rather than escalating into a true crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will find and step through a door that can reconfigure his life and his promise—is clear and escalates from curiosity to commitment. Pressure builds via increasingly uncanny phenomena (chip, ants, hidden door, breathing cavern) culminating in the archway choice and then the subsequent decision to abandon his old life for Lisbon. The tension is more contemplative than harrowing, with limited on-page resistance or real risk of refusal, so stakes feel slightly gentler than the premise allows. Still, the choice to lock the shop “for the last time” reads as a real trade-off, not a free upgrade.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she will truly confront what she buried and accept a changed role—is clear and escalates from uneasy climb to direct confrontation at the pool to the instruction to descend “not as queen.” The meaningful tightening comes when the pool shows her complicity (Edict, child’s release) and the figure reframes the bleeding sky as a consequence of her choices, forcing a stance. However, the external stakes for the kingdom and the “final warning” remain abstract and offstage, so refusal doesn’t feel as viscerally dangerous as it could. The resolution is earned but leans more into spiritual/emotional cost than concrete loss.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias’s long-held guilt will rupture or transform their bond—is clear, and pressure coheres around the impending confession and her response. There is a meaningful tightening when he admits witnessing the lab fire and not intervening, followed by her choice to alchemize rather than reject. However, her demeanor and worldview make outright rupture feel unlikely from the outset, so tension never quite bites; the outcome feels safe. The cost is present but soft: the risk to the relationship is implied more than viscerally tested.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—whether the narrator will remain lost in “feral nostalgia” or shape it—is clear and present early. Pressure tightens when the scroll refuses ink and when younger selves appear, forcing a choice between passively haunting and actively “hunting” and writing them. The cost is emotional and conceptual rather than external: enduring raw contact with regret and jealousy to complete a “cartography of collapse.” Escalation is somewhat even-tempered and lacks a single sharp crisis point, but the cumulative deepening toward the scroll’s completion and trailhead departure works.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara’s practice still has integrity without her sense of smell—is established early and revisited at the key midscene confession of feeling like a fraud. Pressure escalates mainly through deepening understanding rather than external complication, with the fulcrum interpretation of the screw and the act of mounting it into the clock as the main tightening. The final choice to continue working as a witness, using the altered clock as talisman, constitutes earned stasis with conceptual cost. However, the conflict remains very low-tension; there is little sense of a truly viable alternative path being foreclosed, which keeps stakes somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she can transform her relationship to her scars and her magic—is established early and maintained. Escalation comes through the threat of the ink crystallizing and the progression of increasingly charged runes, culminating in the decisive “breathe” rune and world-exhale. Pressure remains mostly internal and textural rather than confrontational, so the sense of risk feels contained rather than bracing. Still, her choice to lean into forbidden comforts under stress is a genuine tightening that earns the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central stake—whether they can salvage trust and shared art before the orchard (and by extension, a chapter of their past) is lost—is clear and emotionally felt. Pressure escalates through concrete beats: her arrival, the scent-triggered memories, the induced-currents vision, and the offering of the manuscript. His accusation “You stole my music” and her correction “I stole your trust” sharpen the conflict nicely. Still, the confrontation resolves a bit smoothly; one harder refusal or moment of genuine risk (him nearly rejecting the manuscript or sending her away) would heighten cost and escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—unifying/fraying reality through spiral arbitration and accepting the cost of self—is clear, and pressure does deepen as the arbitration advances and surrender is required. However, tension remains almost entirely conceptual; she “didn’t flinch,” “didn’t mourn,” and there’s no substantive pushback or alternative path tested. The choice to let the library read her and to dissolve into coherence feels inevitable rather than contested. As a result, escalation is elegant but emotionally cool, limiting stakes impact.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake is conceptual: reclaiming slivers of surrendered time and redefining what clocks measure. Pressure escalates via the backward count and the station’s increasing response until time “for a breath, held,” which is the key tightening/deepening. However, the conflict remains largely internal and philosophical, with minimal visible consequence beyond deepened solitude and strangeness, so the cost feels more implied than sharp. For a quiet, lyric piece, the pressure is adequate but not extraordinary.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Aris can truly “let go” of the mother-echo—is clear, and pressure tightens when the familiar stranger remains present instead of fading, demanding a stance. Her choice to use the button as an offering rather than a tool of control is a meaningful internal turn that reorients her work and her grief. However, the escalation is very gentle: she is contemplative rather than torn, and we rarely feel a genuine risk that she’ll cling or refuse. The cost is present but muted, limiting tension even under a quiet, accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can transform her relationship to risk and responsibility after her father’s collapse—is clear and threads through the scrawls, her secret correspondence, and the hospital scene. Pressure does deepen: what begins as private decoding becomes a live, reciprocated network and then a charged, silent exchange with her father via the menu scrawl and clover. The cost is implied in her renunciation of empty rebellion and the acceptance that “some traversals must be walked alone.” Still, the conflict stays largely internal and contemplative, with few sharp on-page dilemmas or trade-offs to visibly narrow her options.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.5)
    Conflict is primarily internal and conceptual, centered on her belief in “cultivated estrangement” versus the loneliness and cost of that calling. The stakes for callers are poignant but largely summarized; the main tightening occurs when her own voice calls in and she must decide how to route herself. That choice—to be patched into silence via the disc—narrows her future options and implies ongoing self-erasure, giving the piece genuine, if quiet, cost. Escalation is modest but appropriate to the lyric, accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how she can “regenerate the covenant” of small, intergenerational intimacies—is established and sustained, but escalation is gentle. The main tightening comes as she moves from abstract intention to concrete clauses and to the resolved choice to persist in this work across future twilights. There is little sense of risk or realistic alternative path; she never seriously considers refusing or failing in this task. As a result, the conflict reads more as a deepening meditation than a tested commitment with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can genuinely alleviate loneliness rather than just symbolically gesture at it—is present from the outset and tightens around the man’s request about the moon rock. Escalation is subtle but real: we move from whimsical, low-risk story trades to the rawest, highest-stakes disclosures. The cost is primarily emotional and internal; there’s little in the way of hard reversals or materially foreclosed options. For this quiet, textural mode, the final mutual vulnerability functions as a credible tightening, but the pressure never becomes truly sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she can find a stillpoint stable enough to navigate overwhelming emotional depths—is clear and grows as the forest forces her into increasingly painful resonances. The major tightening is the forest turning explicitly into a crucible of personal memories, culminating in the choice to step into and then out of the stillpoint without retreating from feeling. The price of leaving the ring behind is conceptually strong but could land even more sharply with one more concrete sense of what continuing to absorb languages cost her. Overall, conflict is more contemplative than sharp, but the internal pressure is credible and accumulative.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—can she meaningfully and ethically revise history to salvage meaning from her past mistakes—is clear but remains largely contemplative. There is a gentle deepening as edits scale from small physical reversals to reconfigured wars and griefs, yet she encounters no serious resistance or dilemma that forces a painful trade-off. As a result, pressure never truly tightens; the story reads as a graceful exploration rather than a conflict escalating toward a hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake is Elara’s drive to make meaning from silence in a way that matters to someone else; this tightens when the mute girl appears and requests to be shown, shifting from aesthetic experiment to relational consequence. The escalation is gentle but real: a private, almost ritual performance becomes a transformative encounter for the girl. However, there is little overt resistance or dilemma—Elara never has to trade one good for another or pay more than the already-accepted cost of ephemerality—so tension stays relatively low. The piece succeeds as quiet pressure rather than sharp conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—liberating an imprisoned promise/memory—is clear, and there is a recognizable escalation from fragment to complete portrait to archive awakening. However, pressure is almost entirely one-directional; there are no true obstacles, alternatives, or trade-offs once she commits to the descent and the portrayal method. The archive’s cooperation and the absence of resistance or real risk flatten external conflict, leaving mainly a philosophical test she passes without visible struggle. The ending is satisfying in concept but light on felt cost or narrowed options.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central conflict—submit to imposed, anesthetizing “peace” versus assert a risky, integrating agency—comes through clearly in her choice to drum instead of rest. Escalation is mostly textural: the garden’s response and the swelling of twenty-seven voices rather than concrete reversals or sharpened external pressure. The cost of her choice (enduring multiplicity instead of numbing it) is implied but not intensely dramatized on the page. It’s a strong quiet-arc escalation, but stakes never fully bite beyond the lyric register.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—how to expose Delgado and whether quiet methods can be effective—is clear and coherently pursued. Pressure does escalate from curiosity to illicit exploration in a forbidden sector and a choice about how to use what she learns. However, the stakes never feel truly sharp: we’re told no one should be there after dark, but there’s no concrete threat or consequence dramatized. The conflict remains largely conceptual rather than viscerally testing Lena’s belief under fire.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether lost souls encounter a reconfigured darkness at the brink of drowning—is clear, and pressure coheres when the drowned woman appears and hesitates at the glyphs. The escalation is quiet but real: she shifts from watchful stillness into urgent, precise weaving to influence a critical threshold moment. However, the conflict remains largely one-sided; darkness itself never seriously threatens her, and there’s minimal sense of what she risks beyond continued vigil. The lack of a sharper price or compromised option keeps this in strong rather than top-tier territory.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elira can awaken dormant curiosity and resistance to numbing systems—comes through clearly, and her midnight escalation is a structural tightening. Yet opposition is almost entirely notional: parents and principals disapprove off-page, but nothing on the page can stop her or seriously endanger her status or the grotto. The rebellion succeeds on first attempt at scale, with no trade-off beyond vague eccentricity, so the pressure never truly sharpens into a costful choice.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Lira will accept a larger, riskier calling—is legible early through her stated desire to detach from a constricting self-lie. Pressure escalates convincingly from dock routine to bodily immersion to metaphysical summons, with the whale’s song as a decisive tightening that makes non-response feel like a profound loss. The cost is internal but real: surrendering a hardened, purely utilitarian identity for vulnerable service. The world’s premise that “violence became impossible” slightly blunts external jeopardy, keeping the conflict intense but more contemplative than fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether the performer can preserve real grief without being punished or forced into genuine emotional erasure—is clear and consistent. Pressure escalates appropriately for this length: initial private defiance, then official scrutiny, then the tactical choice to literalize and seal their grief into a sanctioned object. The cost of compliance (sacrificing the last funeral bouquet, accepting bulletin-ization as a Model Citizen) is legible and stings. What keeps this just shy of the high-8s is that the external danger never feels close to exploding; the officers are almost comically easy to satisfy, so the tension stays more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—whether she can reclaim and inhabit forbidden awe/art after the ban—is clear, but on-page pressure remains low. Guardians are already gone, the ban has lifted, and nothing actively resists her; the world is more welcoming than dangerous. There is a deepening when she speaks “Unfold” and when the dance begins, but no real narrowing of options or visible sacrifice in the moment—her choices never seem plausibly contestable. As a result, tension is lyrical rather than gripping, and escalation feels more like a steady swell than a true tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—can broken things and this courtyard be awakened into a new kind of beauty—is clear and pays off when the plants respond and Marta reorients her practice. Escalation is present but gentle: discovery of the reed’s resonance, first subtle plant reactions, then Marta’s experimentation and the sprouts in ash. There is little resistance, risk, or failure on the way, so tension stays more contemplative than pressurized. As a result, the ending feels satisfying and apt but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central conflict is internal and conceptual: reclaiming the texture of connection in a saturated, post-grid quiet. Pressure escalates gently from observation to experiment (striking the fork) to full participation (her sustained vowel that activates the lab), culminating in the release of trapped harmonies. The cost is subtle—she is emotionally undone and must relinquish comforting abstractions about silence and technology—but there is little sense of danger or foreclosed options. Effective for a lyric piece, though not operating at a high-tension level.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how grief can be gently redirected toward new meaning—remains largely static in intensity; we witness practice rather than a pressured test. The nearest tightening is the moment when the curtains “stir” as someone, somewhere, opens one of her offerings, which briefly deepens the sense of connection and validates her labor. However, this does not foreclose options or force her into a new or riskier choice; she simply continues her established pattern with the next locket and crane. The piece reads as a beautifully textured slice of an ongoing vocation rather than a beat that escalates to a sharp cost.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is interpretive: whether the apparent cultural “chaos” after economic collapse is legible as recomposition, and whether her mapping can perceive it. Pressure does accumulate texturally (intensifying rain, denser mapping, emergence of patterns, then the visitor’s reading), but there’s little sense of risk or trade-off for her personally. Her agency is mostly in continued observation and invitation, not in a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. As a result, escalation feels thoughtful and atmospheric rather than truly tense.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether to collude with institutional forgetting or risk destabilizing grief—is clear early and deepens as she engages the pagoda. Pressure escalates credibly: sensory overload, physical pain, and the risk of psychic inundation peak when she keeps her hands on the machine and chooses the patternless humming. The resolution comes directly from her active tactic, not from a convenient external turn. The conflict is primarily internal and thematic rather than peril-of-death, which keeps the scale intimate but may feel slightly low-stakes for some elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—preserving a form of hope that includes fear and grit—is articulated early and tightened as Elira uncovers that hope has changed rather than vanished. The main escalation occurs when she discovers the shadow’s metamorphosis and then chooses to act by altering the core archive, which clearly raises the conceptual cost for dreamers (dreams become more textured, less purely euphoric). Conflict is primarily internal/ideational, with no active opposing force, so tension is more contemplative than knife-edged. That quietness fits the mode but keeps the sense of pressure from fully peaking.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—walk away to preserve self-respect or stay and risk complicity for the animals’ sake—is clear and present early. Pressure escalates as she moves from contemplation to the concrete act of reconstructing the tail, which becomes the crucible in which her decision clarifies into a specific plan of action. The ethical calculus feels authentic, with competing goods rather than an easy right answer, and the choice carries cost (career loss, risk in testifying, the grind of starting a true sanctuary alone). The limitation is that escalation is largely tonal and reflective rather than enacted through new obstacles or reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether Elira will continue to chase “closure” or accept wounds as ongoing stories—is clear and escalates as she descends from tower to catacombs to direct contact with the miracle-seed. Pressure deepens primarily through knowledge rather than danger: the seed’s history of delaying death confronts her misbelief, forcing a costly internal choice to merge with it and abandon her old identity. External conflict (no antagonist, minimal physical jeopardy) remains low-key, so tension is more contemplative than harrowing. Within an accumulative/textural lens, though, the shift from seeking to repricing is a meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how unused love will remain entombed or be released—is clear and sharpened when she discovers the letters and decides to become their vessel. Escalation is primarily internal and textural, with pressure increasing as she reads each letter and lets them “stitch” into her, culminating in her choice to mail them and bear their emotional weight. The conflict is quiet and never feels false, but remains relatively low-friction, with minimal sense that she might refuse or mishandle this burden.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether she can bear and transform the world’s trapped creativity—appears early and tightens meaningfully when the voices shift from longing to fury, forcing her into a larger, riskier act. Escalation is clear: from periodic relief-work to a near-overwhelming onslaught that demands tracing “dozens, hundreds” of stars until she is physically wrecked. The cost is legible in bodily depletion and tears, as well as the implied ongoing toll of her role. Stakes remain somewhat conceptual rather than grounded in a concrete, time-sensitive dilemma for her personally, which keeps this just short of truly searing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—kindling potential/hope in occluded branches of reality—is clear and the piece does escalate texturally when he moves from general mission to choosing and charming the dimmest sphere. Agency is present in the selection of that sphere and the hum of resonance, and the closure image suggests a small but genuine reweighting of the cosmos. However, conflict is largely one-sided; there’s minimal resistance or cost beyond implied exhaustion and the burden of duty, so tension stays cerebral rather than visceral. It works for a quiet, lyrical piece but doesn’t fully tighten the screws the way an elite market might demand.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—risking annihilation at the Edge to reach the “frontier of his mind”—is articulated, and the legend of unraveling sets a clear potential cost. Yet pressure barely escalates: his curiosity is never seriously opposed by fear or external impediment, and each step (walking, testing the gear, humming frequency) succeeds smoothly. The key choice to cross the Edge is thematically charged but internally uncontested, so it feels more like fulfillment of destiny than a hard trade-off. This keeps tension present but relatively low-intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.2)
    Conflict and stakes are largely thematic and contemplative: the “mission” to find unused courage never meets real resistance or sharp trade-offs. Pressure does deepen in a gentle way as they move from town to ridge crest to artifacts, but the journey unfolds without reversal, risk, or real narrowing of options. Their agency is serene and unchallenged, so the final vigil reads as affirmation rather than hard-won stance. The piece is effective as lyric meditation but underpowered as dramatic escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.3)
    The central stake—whether to preserve absolute safety at the cost of silence or risk reintroducing music—is established early via the backstory of the collapse and the missing bolt, then tightened by the cerulean stain and especially the child’s arrival with her whistle. Pressure escalates credibly from internal rumination to an externally triggered test, culminating in the concrete, high-commitment action of reinstalling the bolt and striking middle C. Internal and external conflicts braid well: fear of structural and psychic collapse versus the ethical and emotional cost of continued silence. The main limitation is that the tangible consequences of his choice are mostly symbolic rather than materially jeopardizing anyone, which slightly mutes on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.0)
    The external stakes (exposing a ruler and shifting a regime) are high, and the story delivers on the promised revelation. However, much of the pressure is offstage and summarized, and the protagonist encounters no active resistance in the present, which blunts escalation. Her personal risk is conceptually large (an exile opposing a tyrant) but not concretely tested in on-page scenes. The main deepening is thematic rather than a lived narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether what’s “lost” is truly gone or misperceived—gets a clear tightening when the storm breach delivers the journal and the 17-second delay emerges as a structured mystery. External stakes (climate, reefs) are large but wisely localized into Elara’s need to know and to reframe the reefs’ fate. Escalation is primarily conceptual rather than peril-driven, but it does narrow options: once she sees the ECHO data, she must choose whether to descend and confront what’s there. The price is mostly internal (abandoning the comfort of pure mourning), which reads clearly but not crushingly.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the lull in rebellion will remain a dead quiet or transform into a new kind of collective purpose—is clear, but the pressure stays mostly internal and atmospheric. Escalation is present in the increasing intensity of the hum, the activation of the panels, and the arrival of others, yet there’s no on-page opposition or real risk of failure once the circle awakens. Her main “choice” is to lean in and answer rather than flee, a decision that feels foregone rather than tested. As a result the story is compellingly tense in mood but relatively gentle in terms of conflict and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether ancestral destiny will remain sealed/centralized or be reinterpreted and released—is clear, and it tightens as she moves from decoding to performing the ritual. Escalation is primarily accumulative and internal: the humming ground, vines, glowing amber, and finally the embryo’s dissolution steadily reweight the choice. However, there’s no on-page antagonist or interruption, and no moment where she visibly doubts or risks immediate loss, so pressure never fully peaks. The result is textured and meaningful but emotionally low-tension compared with the conceptual scale of the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are internal—whether the narrator remains trapped in traumatic vigilance or moves toward a riskier, integrated presence—and they’re signaled early via the photograph and somatic pain. Pressure tightens through the freeze moment, where she chooses not to fight or flee but to inhabit stillness, and later by resuming sketching and leaving anonymous offerings, all of which foreclose pure withdrawal. The cost—crying without control, allowing the photograph to become compass, accepting the world can fracture again—is implicitly clear. The escalation is controlled but gentle; there’s no sharp reversal, just a well-handled deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether she will break under fragmentation or integrate it into a new self—is clear and sharpened by her deliberate choice to engage (“pain was the price of coherence”). Escalation is primarily internal/textural: rhetorical questions → stitching painful secrets → binding the Tower to her own erased self → stepping onto the tapestry and accepting cocoon-like compression. The decisive move (stepping onto the mosaic) narrows options and entails real cost: she relinquishes safety and prior identity for transformation. Pressure is strong but remains mostly interior; there’s little external antagonism or explicit risk beyond psychic/spiritual dissolution, which keeps this just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding time’s dilation at the risk of self—emerges early and tightens as she moves from observation to experimentation to self-application of the ink. Escalation is driven by her agency: she chooses to risk the ink on stone, then on her own mind, with disappearance as the price. Internal and external conflict interweave well (intellectual curiosity vs survival, need to know vs cost of knowing). The only small limitation is that opposition is largely implicit rather than dramatized as friction, keeping tension strong but not maximal.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—risking personal erasure and social upheaval by releasing forbidden emotional truth—is clear and present early. Pressure tightens as she places the letter on the Resonance Table and chooses detonation over suppression; the arrival of guards and her erasure show real cost. Internal and external conflicts braid well: duty versus conscience mapped onto regime versus populace. The main limitation is that escalation is more conceptual and atmospheric than dramatized through multiple tested options; we move quickly from decision to aftermath with little resistance beyond the implied.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake is moral and existential—whether gentleness and continuity can be maintained in a world that rewards brutality. This pressure is articulated most strongly in the ex-soldier’s challenge and in the shadow of her father’s legacy, but those frictions never quite corner Elara into a hard trade-off or visible loss in the present. Escalation is primarily deepening rather than tightening; each visitor questions her stance in a slightly different register. The result is affecting but somewhat static in terms of felt risk or narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—recovering the goddess’s echo—intensifies via environmental dissonance and the garden’s shuddering response to her actions, with a clear tightening when the spike conducts the bass note and the echo erupts. The main reversal is her translation of wrath into a vowel and the subsequent choice to let the echo be carried rather than contained. Conflict is largely situational and ritual rather than oppositional or morally fraught, so tension is strong but not razor-edged.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—exposing a lethal bureaucratic cover-up—is clear from the journalist’s call and her months of surveillance. Escalation is intellectual rather than confrontational: tension rises as she correlates the purge schedule, the “accident,” and her proof-by-contradiction plan, then cashes it in by blasting evidence to powerful recipients. That choice forecloses passivity and implicitly accepts personal and institutional risk, though the price is more conceptual than visceral on the page. The absence of an on-page antagonist or direct pushback keeps the pressure from fully peaking.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether she can transmute unbearable cries (hers and others’) into something bearable—is clear and escalates from ambient sorrow to direct accusation (“You left me in the static”). Pressure tightens as she chooses to engage rather than flee: rolling up her sleeve, binding the glyph to L-7’s core, and accepting that the father’s scream is trapped there. The cost is primarily emotional and spiritual rather than physical, but it is concretely dramatized. Stakes could feel sharper if failure carried a more explicit consequence beyond continued dissonance, yet the internal/external braid works well at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake is internal: whether she can transform her relationship to overwhelming social noise into a more intentional, pattern-based listening. Escalation is present but gentle—the whispers intensify, her lilac unease deepens, and the key tightening is her decision to alter the mandala rather than passively endure the voices. That interjection leads to synchronization and a new stance, but the sense of risk or potential loss in that choice is only lightly sketched. The conflict is effective for a quiet piece, yet never feels truly fraught, keeping stakes in the thoughtful rather than urgent register.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether mercy will remain passive or be re-forged into something active and just—is clearly established, but conflict is relatively low-friction. The magistrate’s objection offers a brief external challenge, yet he capitulates quickly, and there’s little sense that the crowd might resist or that Elira’s stance costs her socially in the moment. Internally, she’s already decided; we don’t see a genuine risk of her reverting to “old mercy,” so escalation reads more like a deepening manifesto than a tightening dilemma. That keeps tension present but modest rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—whether she can turn others away from despair and thereby transform her own afterlife—is legible, and the pressure does deepen as she selects, then sings into, the three echoes. Her agency drives the main turn: choosing that child’s cerulean laugh as a thread, then risking her own diminishing to intervene. However, there’s little sense of risk of failure or alternative paths once she starts; the outcome feels assured, so tension stays more lyrical than acute. The cost at the end is clear, but the path to it lacks a strong mid-story tightening or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central pressure—whether she’s broken or a bridge, and whether authentic connection is possible after the recall—is clear and does intensify as she builds the rig and receives Mateo’s directive. There is a real tightening when she chooses to trust the external voice and follow the somatic cues into action. However, opposition is mostly abstract; things work on the first try and the price of her choice is implied rather than sharply felt, so escalation feels more deepening than truly narrowing of options. The ending commits her to a path, but without a concrete sacrifice or acute risk on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how the last emotional traces of humanity can be voiced/responded to—is clear, and the leaf’s activation is a meaningful escalation. However, the pressure remains relatively smooth: once the anticipatory force appears, there’s little resistance, uncertainty, or serious alternative path; she moves into the role she’s trained for without contest. The conflict is primarily situational/ontological rather than sharply dramatized as a dilemma or risk, so the final stance feels significant but not hard-won. This keeps tension from matching the ambition of the concept.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.3)
    Conflict and stakes are largely conceptual: truth versus falsity, solitary control versus shared possibility, quiet craft versus spectacle. There is one clear tightening when the ivory button makes the echo speak plainly, reframing the future as folded rather than foretold. Beyond that, pressure does not noticeably escalate; wars, edicts, and collapsing truth stay off-stage summaries rather than forces that corner her into hard trade-offs. The result is intellectually engaging but relatively low-tension on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central stake—what she does with the incriminating microfilm and what kind of justice she’s willing to pursue—is clear and tightened by her physical fragility and exile. Escalation is modest but real: from careful approach, to exposing the hatch, to the decisive choice to plant the secret for an uncertain future rather than use it for immediate leverage. The cost is conceptual and emotional (accepting obscurity and delayed justice) rather than visceral, which fits the mode but keeps tension relatively low-key. There’s little external opposition in the moment, so the pressure reads more as solemn inevitability than contested struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how the coachman will honor his palimpsest promise to “distill complexity into essence” in this specific passage across grief—is clear and coherently pressured by the fog, the passenger’s burden, and the ticking clock of the gutters. Escalation is primarily textural: deepening fog, intensifying rain, mid-river opacity, then the thinning veil when the gutters fall silent. The core tightening is his decision, at that exact liminal moment, to turn and offer the needle, which forecloses his option of remaining a purely silent, unseen facilitator. The conflict remains mostly internal and meditative, so stakes feel intimate rather than gripping, but they are legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.3)
    Conflict is largely internal and philosophical—between the wasteland’s erosion and her desire to understand resistance, between preservation as stasis vs as resonance—so pressure is quiet but present. The main tightening beat is when the glass activates fully (bees moving backward, summers layered) and the live bee appears, prompting her to risk scarce water and then to decide what to do with the glass and pot. The on-page cost is subtle: she spends water, refuses the permanence of firing, and walks away from the sanctuary she sought, accepting a soft, vulnerable “solution.” Escalation is more deepening than narrowing, which fits the mode but keeps it from higher-urgency bands.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether she will risk instilling a fragile, communal wonder instead of staying in purely pragmatic survival—is clear and does tighten as she moves around the fire escape. The escalation is largely textural: the hush deepening, the neighborhood’s reactions, and her approach to the final corner where the rosebush stands. Cost is present but modest: emotional exposure, the reopening of grief, and physical fatigue rather than a stark loss or foreclosed opportunity. The conflict is beautifully rendered but remains low-intensity, with no true reversal or tough trade-off beyond enduring vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—preventing the loss of extinction-coordinates and then repurposing that machinery toward genesis—is clear, with a meaningful tightening when the cloud-tide rises too fast and the hum stutters. Veyra’s agency drives the resolution: she chooses to stabilize the sundial at personal cost and then to redirect its function away from pure mourning. However, the sense of jeopardy is more conceptual than visceral, and the physical/emotional danger to Veyra herself is underplayed. A slightly sharper articulation of what she risks (beyond fatigue and psychic burden) would deepen the felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Aris’s desire to “rejoin the pattern” at the cost of his individuality—is clear but remains mostly abstract. Pressure does increase when the spiral glows and the voice says “Rejoin,” prompting his entry into the pool. However, he encounters almost no resistance, doubt, or competing desire, so escalation feels more like a graceful glide than a tested commitment. The price is conceptually high but under-dramatized as conflict on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (preventing mass psychological manipulation of a community) is clear and present early, with the tightening turn when Elira decides to intervene herself rather than route through vanished oversight. Escalation is mostly conceptual—signal irritation, campus mood shift—rather than driven by on-page reversals or close calls in her interference attempt. The tricksters’ reaction (“pulsed with irritation”) hints at counter-pressure but never fully corners her, softening the sense of risk. Still, her counter-broadcast materially changes the situation, and the ongoing “they’ll return” threat gives consequences weight.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—securing the key to restore spatial balance while confronting crippling claustrophobia—is clear and tightened by the organ-guided descent into an even narrower passage. The main escalation is the decision to enter a tunnel narrower than she’s ever dared, blending internal panic with external constraint. Resolution arises from her acceptance of a new relationship to space, but the price (psychic responsibility, loss of former identity) is more implied than dramatized. The conflict arc works, but the climax lands as relatively smooth transcendence rather than a fraught trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—resisting a second erasure by reawakening memory and empathy—is clear early and deepens as Elira descends, waits, confronts, and then collaborates with the man. Escalation is primarily emotional and conceptual; the tightening comes from shifting the frame from “find the killer” to “redefine what it means to remember the dead.” However, on-page danger or genuine resistance is low: the man does not threaten her, offers little pushback, and quickly aligns with her goal, so options never feel truly narrowed by risk. The result is resonant but somewhat undramatic conflict for a climactic quarry confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stakes—averting catastrophic weather patterns while proving her maps and ending exile—are clearly signaled and threaded through the piece. There is one clear tightening when the stanza proves to control rather than predict the weather, raising both opportunity and implied danger. However, escalation is relatively smooth and unresisted: once she finds Journal #7, the path to success proceeds without real setbacks, trade-offs, or visible costs. Pressure feels high in concept, but the on-page struggle is not as fraught or adaptive as the premise allows.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the fiddler will remain trapped in regret and “never” or enter some form of amnesty himself—is legible and present from early on. Pressure builds through accumulation rather than reversals: the warmth and shifting of the glass, the realization about the hitchhiker, the glimpse in the mirror, and his refusal to turn all incrementally narrow his options toward letting go. The cost—accepting he cannot (and should not) chase the hitchhiker’s ghost—registers, but the internal struggle feels relatively smooth, with limited sense that he might choose otherwise. As a result, escalation is satisfying but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—what he will do with collapse and inherited criminal legacy—is clear, and there is one meaningful deepening when he chooses not to panic at CirqueLogix’s failure but to intensify his engagement with the train and his markers. However, pressure rarely bites: investors “hunting him” never quite materialize as concrete threat, and his options don’t feel sharply narrowed on the page. Conflict is primarily internal and reflective, with escalation handled via conceptual reframing rather than forced trade-offs or visible loss. The final stance (turning collapse into a roaming think-tank) is appealing but comes with little dramatized struggle in the moment of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how the weight of unspoken laments can be borne—is clear but remains relatively abstract and low-friction. The central problem (the guardian crushed by accumulated burdens) is resolved quickly once the chronicler arrives and offers her song; there is little on-page resistance, risk, or sense that her attempt might fail or break her. Escalation is present as a deepening of understanding and responsibility rather than as sharp turns, which suits the mode but keeps tension soft. A more visceral sense of what sharing the burden costs her in the moment would sharpen the stakes considerably.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether she will submit to the seed’s unbending and risk losing her defenses—emerges early and tightens as roots spread “first around her wrist, then her arm, then her chest.” Escalation is clear and internal-external at once: as her armor peels back, the orchard responds, the vortex stills, and the curse breaks. The price is the surrender of her guardedness, framed as both liberation and loss of a long-held defense. The conflict remains largely one-directional (she never seriously resists once the process starts), which slightly softens peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—reactivating or uncovering the eclipsed covenant before the glade “forgets itself”—is intriguing but remains quite abstract and untested on the page. Pressure does increase as she moves to the center, roots deepen, and other linked dreamers pulse through scars, but there’s little sense of alternatives, risk of failure, or competing impulses. The main turn (planting the clipping and choosing to heed) feels inevitable rather than hard-won, so escalation reads as deepening mood rather than narrowing options. The scene has tension, but not much in the way of concrete trade-offs or visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.0)
    The core conflict—Elira’s gentle barter of meaning vs Kael’s carving of destiny—appears early and tightens when he directly threatens the burned card, leading to a credible spike in pressure. The orchard’s intervention and the tarot’s awakening constitute a clear escalation and deepen the stakes from a private argument to a larger metaphysical negotiation. Agency remains primarily Elira’s via endurance and stance (she refuses to retract her methods rather than counterattacking), which suits the thematic frame but keeps the external cost relatively soft. The final “seedling” shift gives closure but could land even harder with one explicit, tangible loss or risk borne in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.8)
    The primary conflict is internal: whether Jasper continues to appraise dead things to avoid feeling or risks re-engaging with music and meaning. Pressure escalates when he chooses to hold the cloth to his ear instead of his tools, then again when he types the project title and pins the cloth publicly. The stakes are largely emotional and existential, with a clear but gently rendered price: surrendering the safety of detachment.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether understanding can be reestablished without repeating the geomancer’s consuming ambition—is clear but remains largely conceptual and low-intensity. Tension deepens when the seed trembles, the air thickens, and the ambition “softens,” yet Elira never seems at genuine risk of failing her own ethic or provoking harm. The key tightening is her choice to add an invented sign for “forgiveness” and ultimately to step back and not translate, but these choices come without much visible resistance. The conflict is real and coherent, just more meditative than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes remain mostly conceptual—preserving wonder vs. losing it to routine and forgetting—and are never materially tested on the page. The only real tightening is her moment of accepting that joy/grief, child/soldier/poet are inseparable, which deepens but does not really narrow options. No real opposition or risk complicates her ritual; nothing suggests she might fail or choose otherwise. This makes the piece feel like a beautifully rendered tableau rather than a scene under real pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she can transform weaponized isolation into connection—is signaled early and tightened through the escalating confessions and the pearl’s growing response. Internal pressure rises credibly as she moves from family guilt to existential envy and the cave physically and psychically “leans in.” The climactic choice to crown herself rather than, say, discard the shell is clearly her agency and redefines her burden. Still, the conflict feels very likely to resolve in her favor; a stronger sense of possible failure or harm to others would deepen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central stake—whether she can risk true, unsedated clarity to pursue self-forgiveness—is established via stopping medication and her guilty cartography. Pressure escalates through increasingly direct graffiti and her own responses, culminating in the breakdown at “Maps lie unless you draw them bleeding” and the threshold decision at Track 3. The cost is emotional rather than situational (weeping, sleeping on the floor, recommitting to a painful process), but it’s felt. Conflict could be sharpened slightly by a more explicit on-page alternative path she refuses.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether and how she can access and record unspoken truths without being erased—is present and does tighten as she engages deeper layers of the library (from shelves to inner sanctum to mirror). Conflict is primarily internal and conceptual, with the main pressure point being her choice to document even knowing documentation alters the archive. Escalation is subtle and textural rather than sharply dramatized; there’s no explicit “test” or moment where refusal feels like a live, dramatized option, which mutes tension. The cost of becoming the archive is understood but not fought against on the page, so pressure feels more fated than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—Elira’s dream of restorative provenance vs. the empire’s legitimacy—is clearly stated and paid off when she chooses to activate the violin against imperial interests. Pressure escalates through the Chancellor’s impending arrival, the ominous coffee reading, and the plants’ mounting dread, culminating in the violin’s activation and the Chancellor’s confrontation with the garden. However, conflict remains relatively one-sided: Elira never seems in serious danger of failing, and the Chancellor offers minimal on-page resistance before shifting to reverence. This keeps the tension more mythic/lyric than sharply contested, limiting the sense of real cost under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—preserving a final lucid instant at the brink of oblivion—is clear and conceptually weighty, and the act of beginning the infusion functions as a soft tightening. Yet there is little genuine opposition or risk of failure; everything unfolds as intended, and her agency is never seriously tested. The tension is mostly conceptual and tonal rather than dramatized through reversals or trade-offs, so escalation remains modest.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether she can move from mere forgiveness into durable contentment—is clear, and the story culminates in a genuine stance choice (reclaiming and wearing the hairpin, then returning to her caretaking role “not lighter, but truer”). Pressure, however, remains gently steady rather than escalating; there’s little sense that she might fail or choose differently once she reaches the grotto. The “tightening” is primarily conceptual (realizing contentment is something returned to), which suits the mode but keeps tension low. As a result, the emotional price is believable yet muted.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—whether she will relinquish her professional armor of certainty—is clear early and tightens effectively through the chimes’ increasingly insistent “Unhook” command. The main escalation is her physical-emotional struggle with the clasp, which functions as the key pressure point and results in a decisive change of options once the cloak falls away. Internal and external conflicts interweave: her identity and livelihood versus her need for honest uncertainty. The conflict is largely one sustained climb rather than multiple reversals, but the single central turn carries real weight.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.8)
    Conflict is primarily internal and pedagogical: Elira’s need to teach without prematurely revealing, and Kael’s frustration giving way to comprehension. The dominant stake—whether Kael can learn to perceive and ultimately “vanish to appear”—is clear but remains largely in the realm of preparation rather than present-tense risk. The stone toss and the moment he recognizes “temporal notation” constitute a genuine deepening of pressure, yet no live option is truly foreclosed within this scene; tomorrow’s descent holds the sharper danger off-stage. As a result, escalation feels elegant but low-intensity for a piece aiming at top-tier literary stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether direction can be found through stillness rather than motion—remains clear from early on. Pressure deepens when the flock appears and the pulse finally finds a keeper, which reweights the skimmer’s long endurance and sets up its ongoing obligation to future wanderers. However, the conflict is largely conceptual and internalized; there is little on-page struggle or reversal, since the skimmer’s resolve is already fixed by the time we enter the scene. The cost is implied (centuries of waiting, no journeying), but the escalation feels more like confirmation than a hard test.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—Lior’s search for a meaningful way to practice magic in an automated, rejecting world—is clear and carried through. The key escalation is his decision to step into mist walking despite his history of failing trust rituals, leading to a fundamental revaluation of his path. However, conflict is largely internal and contemplative; there’s minimal resistance or real risk beyond the abstract fear, so pressure never quite tightens into a hard dilemma. The resolution feels right but a touch easy, with little on-page struggle once the path appears.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—will he discover the color of sound, and at what personal risk (drowning, madness, surrender of ordinary life)?—is signaled early and paid off in the underwater realization. Pressure escalates credibly as he moves from pier to dive to confronting a ledger that contains his name and a predestined vow; that revelation deepens the conflict by reframing his “choice” as part of an older binding. The resolution is an earned renunciation: he foregoes continued grasping (or keeping the ledger) and instead becomes a steward who leaves the mystery available to the next seeker, which narrows his path. Stakes remain mostly internal and conceptual rather than viscerally tested, which slightly softens the sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she will continue to abdicate choice to randomness or claim purposive agency—is clear early and tightens when the static comes without a coin and presents the child vision. The key escalation is internal: she rejects the well-established lot-drawing ritual at precisely the moment others are waiting on her signal. There is a real conceptual cost in surrendering the comfort of entropy, but external pressures (the three survivors, resource scarcity, danger) remain mostly implied rather than brought to a sharp test. As a result, tension is strong but a shade more atmospheric than knife-edge.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether he will remain paralyzed by grief or transform it into purposeful remembrance—is clear and consistently pressed. Escalation occurs as he moves from passive listening to active naming, each naming deepening the cost and commitment to his new role. However, the conflict is largely internal and meditative, with little on-page resistance or risk that could derail his ritual, which keeps tension more atmospheric than acute. The price (accepting his complicity and responsibility) is felt, but never quite brought to a sharp, painful edge.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central stake—whether he can convince an offended sea/cosmos to relent—is clear and present throughout, with one main tightening as dawn approaches and the resin sets. Pressure is largely situational and internal, driven by uncertainty whether his patient method will matter, rather than by active opposition. His decisive act is the choice to let the newly restored bell slip into the sea, sacrificing the fruit of his labor to test his belief. The cost and tension are real but deliberately low-key, which limits intensity though not coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.8)
    The core conflict—duty to “contain sentiment” versus a humane impulse to honor memory—is clear and tightened by the progressive emergence of artifacts and the looming state presence. The major turn is Elias’s decision to publicly reframe his work as memorial rather than erasure, forcing him into open conflict with his superiors. However, the external stakes resolve a bit too gently (no real on-page punishment or hard trade-off, just reassignment), so the felt cost of defiance remains modest. Tension is sustained but never quite bites as sharply as the premise allows.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether she will be subsumed by formula or reclaim wonder as part of her practice—is clear and threaded throughout. Pressure deepens through the ritual as she moves from control to surrender, with the starlings’ patterns forcing her to trust intuition and risk the experiment’s outcome. However, escalation is mostly tonal rather than sharply narrowing her options; nothing on the page threatens a catastrophic failure or visible external loss. The resolution feels earned but somewhat gentle, with cost more spiritual than sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—maintaining communal trust versus triggering panic—is clear and concretely tested when the static clears and villagers brace for omens. Pressure coheres around her choice of response (chime and stillness over alarm), which forecloses a path of urgent warning. However, the tension is largely internal and textural, without a sharp on-page reversal or evident price beyond ongoing burden. The beat lands, but escalation remains relatively gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Kael can overcome numbness without re-enslaving himself or the duplicate to an old identity—is clear and tightened when the brain responds to emotional balance rather than will. The metaphysical “custody battle” and students’ accusations add pressure but don’t truly corner him into a costly dilemma; once he reframes the issue as autonomy, opposition evaporates quickly. The vivification itself is the major escalation, but it proceeds smoothly without forcing a visible sacrifice beyond an abstract letting-go. Tension operates more on a conceptual/spiritual plane than as concrete jeopardy, which keeps conflict evocative but relatively low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Aris can and will maintain a sanctuary for slow, grotesque innovation—is more philosophical than pressured, and it never faces a sharp, scene-level test or counterforce. Escalation is primarily in atmosphere and scope (more extreme rooms, hallucinating clients, the seed’s uncanny growth) rather than in tangible dilemmas or narrowed options. Aris never has to choose between competing goods or pay an explicit on-page price beyond time and devotion, which flattens tension. The result is resonant but relatively low in felt conflict and consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether he can keep joy’s memory from “rotting in silence”—is clear early and remains coherent, and the cost of failure (emotional petrification) is palpable. Escalation is primarily textural: fragments of laughter, the memory of the one overwhelming laugh that dropped him to his knees, and the final tiny, triumphant laugh that keeps him going. This works for a lyric piece, but the pressure curve is relatively flat; we don’t get a sharply intensified test of his commitment (e.g., a night when the tunnel fails him entirely, or when he almost abandons the ritual) dramatized on the page. The resolution—his choice to persist—is earned, but a bit under-pressurized for top-tier conflict scores.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—how the guardian will live with its dimensional exile and uncertainty—is legible early and deepens as the pendant’s plea and the frozen librarians emerge. The meaningful tightening comes when it chooses to place the pendant in the statue’s hand, relinquishing its main solace/anchor and triggering the garden’s shift; this then cascades into its new stance toward travelers. Internal and external conflict align, but pressure never quite reaches a knife-edge where refusal or a different use of the pendant feels like a real option. The conflict is effective yet very gentle, which slightly dampens urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elric can transform his relationship to failure and creation—is clear and signaled early, with the crozier’s vivification as the concrete test. Pressure escalates texturally: from ruined apparatus and reputation, to the risky ritual, to the crozier’s tremor, frost bloom, and partial awakening. His key tightening choice is to embrace error and iteration mid-ritual (“Too sharp…Too slow”), rejecting purity/perfection as tactics. The piece stops short of a sharper external test or denial that might heighten felt risk, leaving conflict largely contemplative rather than viscerally dangerous.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—can she access the rumored shard of hush and thereby reframe endings/beginnings—is clear, and tension does build as the moon reaches perigee and the fragment activates. The meaningful tightening is her choice to “tune” by discarding assumptions, which unlocks the true function of the fragment and city. However, external opposition is minimal and the risk of failure feels abstract; nothing material is jeopardized on the page if she fails this cycle. The resulting escalation is elegant but relatively gentle, more contemplative than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—stabilizing oscillating ferries so their passengers have “a single, solid world”—is clear and escalates conceptually as vanishings continue. However, on-page pressure is mostly abstract: there’s no real resistance, time squeeze, or failed attempt; once he fully engages the radio and hourglass, the convergence ritual works without reversal. His internal conflict is minimal—he never seriously doubts or risks himself beyond implied exhaustion—so the cost of success feels more notional than urgent. The story reads as a beautifully executed solution to a puzzle rather than a hard-fought struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—can she successfully map and re-stitch the “texture of connection” without losing herself—is present but remains abstract. There is one clear escalation when the gallery resists (mirrors with other selves, then the eruption), yet she never seems genuinely endangered or forced into a fraught trade-off. Her choice to ignore the mirrors and persist, and later to let the thread go, functions as agency but at relatively low apparent risk. As a result, pressure feels consistently interesting but not particularly sharp or costly.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are articulated—humanity must relearn navigation in a rewritten cosmos—but they remain abstract on the page, with no scene where a choice risks real loss or failure. The closest to a tightening is the blackout, yet it becomes a moment of lyric awe rather than a test of competence or courage. Student “struggle” is summarized rather than dramatized through a specific failed attempt or high-cost exercise. As a result, pressure accumulates intellectually rather than viscerally, and the final success (“by semester’s end…”) feels assured rather than fought for.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—freeing a child stranded in grief—is clear early via the vibrating photograph and the ominous envelope. Pressure escalates as the heartbeat grows panicked and then resolves through her active choice to “broadcast” reassurance and speak the painful truth about the parents. However, the outcome never feels in doubt; there’s little sense she might fail or that there’s a significant personal price for her beyond effort. The conflict is moving but relatively soft-edged, with more inevitability than true jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stakes (succeed in returning presence before the tide returns, and face claustrophobia) are signaled early and maintained, and there is a clear tightening as the machine activates and water begins to seep back. However, she encounters minimal direct resistance—no major setback, ethical dilemma, or true risk of failure on the page—so escalation feels more like a steady deepening of atmosphere than a sharpening of choices. The cost is present (loss of the gold fleck, real physical danger) but underplayed in the moment. As a result the piece reads as quietly intense rather than fully pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake is whether Aris can bring coherence to the digital ghosts and extract “wisdom from failure” while inhabiting his own bureaucratic error, and this is signaled early. Escalation occurs via the initiation of the defragmentation ritual and the intensifying sensory manifestations of the ghosts, culminating in Dr. Voss’s clearer voice and the full ink mandala. However, there’s little sense of risk, opposition, or meaningful alternative—success feels inevitable rather than hard-won, so pressure never quite tightens into a true dilemma or loss. The result is thematically satisfying but emotionally soft in terms of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring a dead language’s living sound without letting the curse consume meaning—is clear and thematically rich. There is a discernible tightening when the flock finally comes, the diamond “awakens” as vacuum, and the canyon begins to answer, but the path remains relatively smooth and ritualistic rather than pressured. The diamond’s hunger and curse are described in ominous terms yet never quite test her resolve with a concrete, risky alternative or sacrifice; success feels earned more by preparation than by on-page jeopardy. As a result, tension is evocative but not especially acute.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can transform her bitterness and free the Gravity Dancer without losing herself—does escalate: from tense preparation to activation to full-body metamorphosis and aftermath. Internal and external stakes dovetail nicely as the entity’s release becomes the vehicle of her emotional shift. However, the pressure remains relatively soft; there is little sense of genuine danger, competing goal, or possible loss beyond the thematic renunciation, so the choice to proceed never feels seriously contested. One on-page complication or moment of resistance (from Elara, Moira, or the entity) would raise the sense of cost and escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether she can “uproot the silence” and reawaken the orchard— is clear and does escalate as more statues soften and the orchard begins to transform. Her physical endurance and the need to keep playing through pain provide some tightening. However, there’s little sense that she might fail or be harmed; the statues hesitate but never actually threaten her, so pressure feels spiritually tense rather than genuinely perilous. The resolution, while earned, lacks a sharp trade-off or foreclosed alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stakes—getting a dangerous, highly detectable object across a militarized, AI-policed border to fulfill a dead mother’s promise—are compelling and clearly stated early. There is one solid tightening beat when Marla reports increased drone activity, forcing a tactical pivot to the basement shafts and the storm-masking plan. However, the mission proceeds without on-page complication or near-failure; the drone simply launches and vanishes, so the pressure curve feels more anticipatory than actively escalating. The emotional cost is present, but the lack of a concrete test or reversal in the final movement slightly undercuts tension.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether this ruin becomes a living sanctuary or remains an abandoned wound—is clear and escalates as the carousel stirs, then fully turns. Pressure builds texturally (mist thickening, bells joining, fragment pulsing) rather than via overt opposition, which works for the chosen lens but keeps tension relatively gentle. His agency is solid (choosing to work, to “sing” with his craft, to persist through dawn), yet there is little genuine risk, loss, or plausible failure on the page. As a result, the escalation is satisfying but lacks the sharp edge or sacrifice that would make the climax truly gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether analog stories can truly live and be reawakened—is clear, but pressure remains gentle and mostly internal. Once she accesses the Restricted Stacks, the pathway opens without meaningful resistance or trade-off; the activation axiom works on the first try, and entering the tessellation carries little on-page fear or risk. The main escalation beat is the transition into the amphitheater and realization of her purpose, which deepens meaning but doesn’t noticeably narrow options or impose cost. This reads more as a contemplative unveiling than a conflict-tested turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central stake—reclaiming the runaway dream as proof that longing can be made tangible—is clear and scales appropriately for the length. Pressure escalates texturally rather than through overt confrontation: rare conditions (double sunrise), personal losses (mentor vanishing), and the long failure to catch the dream deepen the cost of her pursuit. The decisive tightening is the morning when she quietly assembles the three hues and commits to the experiment that might succeed or confirm permanent loss. Still, conflict remains mostly internal and atmospheric; a slightly sharper on-page sense of risk in that final attempt would push stakes higher.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—freeing an idea trapped behind fear—is clear, but the opposition remains mostly symbolic and soft. The mirror corridor is the closest thing to a true test, yet it dissolves quickly once he ties the crimson ribbon, with minimal sense of risk or potential loss. Escalation is more a graceful procession of thresholds than a tightening of screws, so his success feels almost assured. This keeps the piece from achieving top-tier tension even within a quiet, lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether she can reclaim or will further lose her memories—is clear early and deepened by the revelation that the orchard preys on emotional rupture. Pressure escalates conceptually when she triggers the experiment and the greenhouse responds, culminating in the realization that her return has been feeding the orchard. Her final options (leave/warn vs. stay/offer herself) are well framed, and her choice constitutes a real cost. Still, the conflict remains mostly internal and observational, with limited on-page resistance or immediate danger, which softens the felt tension.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—maintaining the precarious balance of her reversible exile through exacting mentorship—is clear, and the cartographer scene functions as a concrete test of that pressure. Escalation is primarily textural: the risk of misreading and being “exhaled” is articulated, then put in play via the novice’s misstep and the cartographer’s despair, then checked against the shadow and swing at dusk. The pressure tightens, but largely in the conceptual realm; there is no dramatic on-page near-miss with exile, which keeps the stakes slightly abstract. Still, the cartographer’s visible shift and the held shadow offer an earned, if quiet, sense of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—whether the last seed of Chroma Virens will be safely anchored—is clearly articulated and emotionally potent, but the on-page opposition is more atmospheric than actively resisting. Escalation comes via intensification of the weaving and the world’s hush, rather than concrete obstacles or reversals. Elira never meaningfully risks failure, sacrifice, or a trade-off beyond concentrated effort and emotional exposure. The piece functions as a lyric preservation scene rather than a true test, keeping conflict and price in a solid but not exceptional band.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—grounding restless spirits to preserve balance—is clear, and the workmanlike ritual creates a steady low-grade pressure. Escalation is focused in the discovery and piercing of the blackened knot, which introduces genuine risk (a scream-like silence, a violent outburst of truth) and a moral/ethical charge. However, the restorer’s personal jeopardy and potential failure modes remain abstract; she feels highly competent, so the outcome never seems truly in doubt. The cost reads more as spiritual wear and accumulated burden than as a crucible in this single scene.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.5)
    Conflict and stakes are almost entirely internal and thematic: will she treat the chapel as an absence to be “solved,” or as a presence to be witnessed? Pressure accumulates through pattern recognition (the migrating shadow, the spiral, the altar point) rather than through escalating obstacles, and there’s one clear deepening when the shadow resolves into the chapel’s silhouette. Still, tension remains relatively soft; the story rarely forces her into a felt trade-off beyond method and framing, so the emotional price of her choice, while present, is gentle rather than bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether she can understand and then practice a physics of letting go—is clearly signaled and sharpened as her bond with the globe intensifies and begins to erode her basic self-care. Escalation is mostly internal and textural: the globe’s anomalous responses to names/confessions and the sleepless nights gradually corner her into a test at the cliff. The final act of not dropping but releasing the globe is an earned, agentive move that forecloses her ability to keep using the object as a crutch. Still, resistance at the peak is relatively smooth; a touch more visible struggle or alternative path in that last moment would deepen the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether her encoded longing will find resonance and relieve her isolation—appears early and is carried through to the ghost’s reply. Pressure escalates texturally rather than through overt opposition: preparation and encoding lead to the risky vulnerability of singing, which then deepens into the bolder act of broadcasting an invitation. There’s little sense of what she stands to lose beyond continued loneliness, so the choice to open the space to “others” doesn’t carry a sharply articulated price. Even so, the move from private ritual to public signal narrows her options in a believable way and functions as an earned tightening at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is internal—how she will relate to inherited grief and encrypted joy—and it is signaled early via her “summoned” mission. Escalation occurs through deepening insight (discovering the cipher, then the vellum, then the full diary), but there is no strong external opposition or concrete risk that narrows options. Her choices are mostly how gently and reverently to proceed, which keeps tension low. The final stance crystallization is clear, yet the path there feels more like a graceful glide than a pressured climb.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she can reframe absence as memory-bearing rather than annihilating—is clear from early on and stays coherent. Escalation is mostly a deepening: moving from earlier classifications to the live encounter with Altocumulus #112 that echoes her own “quietly explosive” state. Her choice not to panic as the cloud dissipates but instead to memorialize it as “release” is the main tightening, foreclosing a path of clinging and despair. The conflict remains primarily internal and textural, which suits the mode but makes the pressure feel contemplative rather than sharply escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—finishing the sky before demolition—arrives early and holds, with a clear external clock (crews idling, countdowns, dawn) that tightens as she paints faster. Internal stakes around her relationship to face blindness deepen mid-scene, effectively braiding craft pressure with self-perception. While there is no sharp reversal, the escalation is appropriate to an accumulative, lyric mode: the pressure mounts through density and temporal narrowing rather than overt confrontation. The main limitation is that external opposition never actively adapts or presses back, keeping the conflict mostly one-sided in texture.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—achieving a world-changing discovery and persuading the captain—stays relatively abstract and low-risk. There is one meaningful tightening when Arlen must convince Veyra and prove his theory, but skepticism melts quickly and there’s no serious opposition, loss, or hard trade-off. The escalation from private pattern-noting to public display and global notice reads more as smooth ascension than pressured conflict. As a result, the piece excels as a discovery vignette rather than a fully pressurized story.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.6)
    The stakes are primarily internal—can she bear learning that some breaks cannot be mended, including her own past losses—and this is signaled before she enters the Hall. Pressure escalates when the voice interrogates her motive and the mirrors confront her with failures and renunciations, culminating in the choice to receive the rhythm and accept a quieter, less grand role. The cost is conceptual and identity-based (surrendering the fantasy of total repair and the apron’s glow), which lands, but there’s little external or temporal squeeze to intensify the decision. A more pointed moment of possible refusal or wrong choice inside the Hall could heighten the sense of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether and how the community will respond to the orchard’s decline and seek the nebula—is clear, and there is one meaningful tightening at the bell-ringing/nebula-reveal. However, antagonistic pressure is very soft: there’s no real resistance, dilemma, or sacrifice beyond the abstract notion of leaving home. As a result, escalation feels more like a beautiful ritual unfolding than a contested transformation. The ending carries emotional charge but not sharp tension or visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—ending all things with grace instead of terror—is clear and tonally potent, and pressure accumulates as the mechanism activates and the cosmos stills. Escalation is handled texturally via expanding scope (womb-heartbeat → trees → stars, then freezing sea, then galaxies), which works for this lyric mode. However, there’s almost no resistance or meaningful option-foreclosure beyond following through on the ordained ritual, so tension is more contemplative than fraught. The cost is conceptual and emotional rather than contested, which fits the piece but keeps the conflict band from the highest tiers.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—prevent another soul from being trapped and joining the orchard’s chorus—is communicated and time-bounded by the impending frost. His agency drives the progression: choosing to intervene, devising indirect signals, and ultimately relinquishing the nut. However, the on-page journey to the girl and back unfolds without much resistance or perceived risk; no beat genuinely threatens failure or presents a hard trade-off in the moment, which keeps escalation more atmospheric than visceral. The cost is mostly conceptual and cumulative rather than felt through a sharp turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she can reconfigure her relationship to her daughter’s death and her own work—is signaled early via “pilgrimage of atonement” and tightens as river/foam imagery forces a rethinking of separation vs. transformation. Pressure escalates conceptually rather than via external obstacles: watching foam go from frustrating randomness to a model of phase change leads to a genuine narrowing of internal options (cling to guilt vs. accept metamorphosis and redesign her practice). The cost is present but quiet: a relinquishing of a self-punishing narrative and an acceptance that the scaffold’s temporariness was intrinsic. The piece does not push to an extreme crisis point, so tension remains more meditative than urgent, but within that register it earns its turn.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—her need to offload her past through facilitating others’ erasures—is conceptually strong but remains largely untested on the page. None of the patrons significantly challenge her method or values; every transaction proceeds smoothly, so pressure never truly tightens. Her “lighter” feeling by dusk is interesting but not the result of a hard choice or trade-off, more a reported state. Tension here is intellectual and atmospheric rather than driven by escalating conflict or irreversible decision.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she can absorb and neutralize the stored remorse without being destroyed or immobilized by it—is clear and coherently pursued. Pressure escalates through spatial and sensory deepening: empty fortress → humming stairs → first touch → overwhelming basin immersion. However, the conflict is more a test of endurance than a true dilemma; her success feels somewhat assured once she commits, with limited sense of alternative tactics or real possibility of catastrophic failure. The cost is felt but the narrative doesn’t force a sharp trade-off or loss beyond exhaustion and hollowing.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—freeing the elevator from isolating silence into communal voice—is clear and conceptually strong. However, there’s very little escalation beyond the predictable “she sings, it answers, then improves”; nothing seriously threatens failure or forces a trade-off. Elara’s agency is active but never truly tested; her method works on first deployment without setback. The piece reads more as a beautifully rendered ritual than as conflict under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake is internal: can she transform inherited and personal grief into a new kind of work rather than remain buried by sterile success and abandonment. Conflict is almost entirely interior and philosophical; there’s no antagonist, and little external obstruction, so tension is subtle and contemplative. Escalation comes from the deepening interplay of the child’s memory and her own, culminating in the decisive choice to reframe the mirror as a tool for mapping “inner seas” and commit to ongoing excavation. That progression is coherent but relatively smooth; one concrete risk or cost in the present scene would sharpen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the “forgotten combinations” and awakening the Seed—is stated and pursued, with one meaningful escalation when Fragment Delta ignites and reveals the seventh eye as a location. However, there’s very little antagonistic pressure or sense of danger; thresholds are wondrous rather than threatening, and gravity’s inversion is more enabling than risky. As a result, tension is more intellectual than visceral, and the final acquisition of the Seed feels almost guaranteed. The story reads as an elegant unlocking sequence rather than a true test of commitment with palpable loss or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether and how Silas can coax music back into a silent world—is clear and does tighten from fruitless attempts to the high-focus experiment with the insulator. Escalation is subtle and textural rather than confrontational: months of failure, discovery, then an all-in, painstaking night of transcription and carving before the final “strum.” There’s no strong opposing force besides inertia and void, so tension leans heavily on anticipation rather than overt risk. Still, the final act is an earned, consequential attempt that reweights the situation rather than a decorative flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake is internal—how he will relate to exile, truth, and beauty—and it’s clearly signaled. However, conflict is largely contemplative; the “clock” of the coming phase and magnetic peak is mentioned but never forces a hard trade-off or visible cost. There’s no real escalation beyond deepening insight, and no serious alternative path that feels live by the end. The result is thematically resonant but dramatically gentle, which will read underpowered for elite markets.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—unlocking the diary to recover a rare form of silence before the fireworks drown the world—is clear, but pressure remains mostly gentle. There is some escalation via the clasp’s partial responses and her iterative calibration, yet failure never feels truly dangerous beyond spiritual disappointment. Her agency is consistent (she persists, changes tactics, tunes herself at the end), but opposition doesn’t significantly narrow options or force a painful trade-off. As a result, the climax is affecting but low-tension rather than gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether serenity can be cultivated through confronting chaos—remains consistent, and the corpse flower’s blooming serves as a clear tightening beat. Yet external and internal opposition are both soft: the seed finally blooms by prophecy rather than being won, and the villagers’ revulsion never forces Elira into a difficult trade-off. Escalation is largely atmospheric; conflict resolves in a near-frictionless communal epiphany without dramatized resistance or cost beyond discomfort. This keeps the piece moving but limits its dramatic bite.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding the orchard’s resilience within the narrow inversion window—is clear and there is a genuine tightening as gravity’s return clock ticks down. Her choice to fly deeper instead of escaping as branches start to groan is the primary escalation beat and aligns well with her motive. However, there’s little resistance or meaningful jeopardy: the arrow works immediately, the vines are wondrous rather than threatening, and the planetary pulse has no visible downside. The piece reads more as a quest of understanding than a struggle with real risk, which keeps tension moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are clear (prevent another deadly crash, honor Varga’s knowledge) but on-page pressure remains relatively low-key. The primary escalation is conceptual: recognizing that moving the crane only reshaped the hazard and that the wind “learns,” which reweights his task. The clock (“six hours before sunset, before the port crew returned”) is introduced but never bites hard enough to force a painful trade-off or manifest loss. As a result, tension accrues intellectually rather than through concrete reversals or narrowed options.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—will she successfully reawaken and “certify” wonder in the hush—is clear but lightly pressured. There is a gentle escalation as each chime deepens the cavern’s response, culminating in ice cracking to reveal hidden veins and memories, which works for an accumulative drive. However, she never faces genuine resistance, risk, or trade-off; success is assumed once she begins. The lack of any on-page price or threatened failure keeps tension modest and prevents stronger escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether to re-engage a catastrophic power versus learning ethically from its failure—is clear and pressures her from the moment she uncases the flute. Escalation is accumulative: preparatory rigor → seam crossing → witnessing three different failure modes → returning with enough knowledge to be tempted by action, then choosing renunciation. The cost is real (she relinquishes potential glory or restoration and drains the flute’s remaining resonance) and the resolution grows directly from her stance. Tension remains more contemplative than visceral, with little sense of immediate danger in the seam, which slightly softens perceived stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—whether and how she will continue to use dangerous empathy tools to reconfigure others—is more conceptual than dramatized, and conflict is largely internal and implied. We see consequences (the skeptic’s collapse, the warlord’s remorse, the halo dimming) but not much in-the-moment resistance or counter-force pushing against her aims. Escalation is mostly quantitative (more pamphlets, more uses) until the final star’s disappearance, at which point she simply sets one last glyph and leaves, without a clear trade-off articulated on the page. The pressure never quite tightens into a difficult, felt choice, blunting the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.0)
    Conflict is primarily internal—duty and calcified routine versus the risky, time-costly pursuit of wonder—but it’s made concrete in the forked path and delivery deadline. The major turns (choosing the Hollow Market over the Archive route, exposing the pendant to the child, finally relinquishing it) all arise from her values under pressure. Escalation is gentle and lyrical rather than sharp, so tension is more thematic than visceral, but the cost of giving up the mentor-linked tool of wonder is legible. A slightly stronger sense of jeopardy around the oracle-breath delivery would have deepened pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether her belief that objects store emotion can be meaningfully “proved” and what to do with that proof—is signaled early and deepens via the visions. Escalation is primarily internal and conceptual: the memories grow more specific and culminate in the surprising final affect of relief rather than tragedy, forcing her to crystallize a stance (keep the proof private, accept resonance over replication). Tension is real but quiet, with little sense of alternatives actively foreclosed beyond publication vs silence. The conflict is therefore strong but not razor-edged, fitting the piece’s contemplative design but limiting peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—reach him vs. lose herself—is established early and sharpened once she realizes she must weave thresholds instead of cloth and ultimately weave herself into the pattern. Pressure escalates as she dismantles the loom and begins to dissolve, with the solstice ritual functioning as a natural tightening of options. However, there’s little on-page resistance or reconsideration; once the method is discovered, the path to sacrifice is relatively untroubled and thus somewhat low on dynamic tension. The cost is clear and moving, but the conflict arc could carry an additional beat of real jeopardy or doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—how Arlo will use up a finite, powerful resource and whether anything will replace it—is clear, and the silk’s depletion gives the narrative a built-in clock. There is one meaningful tightening when he unrolls the “last length” and chooses to press it into the oldest glyph, sacrificing his tool for a speculative communal gain. However, pressure leading up to this moment remains mostly abstract; Arlo never seems tempted to hoard, despair, or quit, and no concrete opposition or loss tests his resolve on the page. As a result, escalation feels more like a graceful curve than a truly narrowing corridor of options.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the withheld truth about her mother and the nature of her own existence—is legible, and there is one meaningful deepening when she finds herself in a universe where she has been erased. However, the conflict is almost entirely investigatory; external resistance is negligible (automatons simply ignore her, and the archive yields its secret on first touch), so pressure doesn’t truly narrow options or force a hard trade-off. The cost emerges mainly at the realization beat rather than through contested action. As a result, tension is solid but not gripping, with escalation more conceptual than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant conflict—Elias’s need to protect fragile rituals of connection versus his hollowed grief—is clear and coheres around the lamp’s extinction and rekindling. Escalation is modest: the lamp going out raises internal pressure, and his response (sea glass, cairn) deepens his stance rather than confronting a sharp dilemma. The price he pays (accepting an ongoing ache as his own beacon) is real but understated, so tension never quite peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict and stakes remain largely abstract: she already performs this cosmic duty, and even the “unusual urgency” of the stars doesn’t force a new decision or sacrifice beyond her established sleeplessness. There is a mild escalation when the lantern flares with inverted shadow and possible futures, but her response is aligned with her existing role rather than tested against a real alternative. The fisherman’s perspective hints at external consequences but never pressures her on the page. The piece is beautiful and evocative, but tension never truly tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she can understand and embody the kind of presence that “magnetizes stories”—is clear, but the pressure on that desire remains gentle and largely unopposed. Escalation is conceptual (from wing to old man to experimental dye) rather than confrontational, with no tangible risk or sacrifice if she fails. Her decisive act—infusing silk with wing scales and tears—does culminate the inquiry, but the choice isn’t framed against a competing cost-bearing option. The piece works as lyric meditation, yet the lack of sharper trade-offs or visible price keeps the conflict band moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—her desire to understand and map sorrow as trees witness it—is clear, and there is one meaningful deepening when she realizes the sextant measures grief, not stars. However, there is almost no opposition or genuine jeopardy: the sextant yields, the moonlight heals it, the forest receives her, and the trees open themselves without resistance. This creates a lovely, contemplative mood but limits escalation; no real options are foreclosed beyond a quiet shift in vocation. Tension exists conceptually rather than as felt pressure, capping the score.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (reviving a realm that has forgotten communal dreaming) is clear early, and there is one major tightening when the solitary hum becomes a chorus and the mica begins to shiver and crack. Conflict is primarily situational and internal, operating through the difficulty of remembering and the risk of calling others back into vulnerable song, rather than through direct opposition. Because no real alternative path or failure mode is dramatized, the escalation feels more like an inevitable flowering than a pressured choice. That keeps tension moderate and somewhat abstract, even as the payoff is vivid.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elira will remain in self-erasing exile or risk being fully present in relation to the Society—is clear and coherent. Escalation comes from the invitation’s reappearance and her conceptual shift from seeing it as condemnation to treating it as mirror, culminating in the choice to make it public and inhabit the center aisle. The cost (surrendering anonymity, accepting future confrontation) is implied rather than dramatized, and external antagonistic pressure stays offstage, which softens visceral tension. Still, her final choice is a genuine renunciation of a safe path and reads as earned by preceding beats.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.0)
    The conflict is primarily internal: can she resist the “creeping normality” of loss and reclaim a sense of the sacred without external validation. Pressure escalates subtly but clearly, from observational melancholy to an active, vulnerable stance—uncloaking, making offerings, and planting seeds no one may ever see. The key tightening is her choice to act (guerrilla gardening) despite not knowing if anything will grow, foreclosing the safer path of pure witnessing. While the stakes are quiet and the tension never sharpens into crisis, the emotional trade-off is legible and appropriate for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving meaning before the slide’s vows vanish—is clear and conceptually strong, with the fading radiance and dimming colors providing a light clock. However, conflict remains largely abstract and unopposed: there’s no genuine threat of failure, tactical adaptation, or trade-off beyond working “swiftly.” The discovery of the “I forgive you” vow deepens emotional stakes but doesn’t materially alter options or force a difficult choice. As a result, escalation feels more like deepening contemplation than sharpened pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—prevent the deal before sunrise—remains clear and coherent, with escalation traced through arrival signals, near-detection, and the high-risk decision to swing the fob into the live space between Marla and The Chain. Her agency is quiet but decisive: she chooses not to attack or expose but to weaponize recognition and inherited guilt. The price is subtle but legible—she forgoes confrontation, revenge, or open justice, remaining in the role of unseen manipulator bound to familial silence. If there is a limitation, it’s that the external consequences of the thwarted deal are only implied, keeping the conflict powerful but contained to the interpersonal level.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the man’s personal storm will be absorbed and what that means for both of them—is clear, and pressure tightens as her taste moves from copper to ozone to honey, culminating in the realization that a vote about him is underway. Her agency in stepping into the convergence, repositioning herself, and reaching into the space between them channels the decision rather than leaving it wholly to cosmic forces. Still, conflict remains mostly contemplative and consensual; there’s little sense of a real alternative path or visible cost she might incur by refusing to engage. The forest’s decision arrives without serious resistance or trade-off, keeping tension at a quietly strong rather than searing level.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether she remains imprisoned by suppression or claims her calling—is clear from early on and tightens as she moves from contemplation to active uncorking and release. The key escalation is when suppressed images externalize onto the walls and she chooses to *intervene* by drawing wings and releasing them, especially lingering over her father’s face. However, there’s minimal sense of risk or possible failure; nothing on the page suggests what happens if she can’t or won’t complete the ritual. The conflict is rich but remains almost entirely internal and one-directional, with little pushback once she commits.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—can she locate and meaningfully engage with lost conversations—is clear but never feels seriously in doubt. Her wilting and the city’s dishonesty register as atmospheric pressure more than escalated obstacles; she endures rather than faces a real trade-off or foreclosure of options. The main tightening is conceptual (realizing the conversations need witness, not delivery), rather than arising from hard choices under duress. As a result, tension is steady but relatively low, and the journey reads more like an assured uncovering than a risky pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are largely conceptual—the preservation of wonder in a utilitarian world—and they remain at a similar register throughout. There is some escalation via the contrast between a world that has abandoned wonder and the child’s awakening touch, plus the eventual transition to the sculpture surviving her. However, pressure on the protagonist barely tightens; she faces no real alternative to her vigil and no real challenge to her commitment. As a result, conflict feels contemplative rather than tense, limiting publishability at the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether the caretaker can resolve its inner static without destroying itself or the farm—is signaled and escalates as the magnetic shift scrambles systems and the inner noise threatens overload. Opening the box and igniting the fears is a meaningful tightening that fuses internal and external stakes, and the later syncing with the irrigation node shows consequence. However, the controlled burn feels a bit too assured; we rarely sense a genuine possibility of catastrophic failure or a live alternative path, which slightly softens tension. The resolution is earned, but escalation never fully bites down into a hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.8)
    The primary stake—can Leo’s unresolved grief be given a safe landing—is signaled early in the locket’s “grieving” and Elara’s ethos. Escalation is gentle but real: Elara’s three silent attempts, Leo’s eventual opening of the door, and the risky act of putting both envelope and locket into the mysterious box. The cost is emotional exposure rather than dramatic reversal, and it reads clearly in Leo’s weeping and long stay in the courtyard. The conflict is intentionally low-intensity, which slightly limits the sense of pressure even as it stays tonally coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—undermining the Overseers’ system and enabling escape/resistance—is clear and present early via the lab’s history and Elira’s mission. Pressure escalates from quiet infiltration to drone sweep to the decisive choice between boarding the submersible and staying to overwrite the master cipher. However, Elira’s competence and composure keep jeopardy largely abstract; we rarely feel a real risk of failure or an alternative she might credibly take. The cost of self-sacrifice is conceptually strong but emotionally under-torqued in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elira will breach the boundary to the place where displaced memories and her father reside—is clear and escalates through one main tightening: the coffee pattern forming a doorway. However, there’s minimal resistance or friction once the doorway appears; she feels trepidation but no concrete obstacle or competing duty on the page, so the choice reads almost foregone. The cost of leaving her world is more implied than dramatized, which keeps the pressure from reaching a truly acute peak. Still, the interplay of grief, curiosity, and risk gives the climax some emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—addressing a cryptic prophecy that threatens the sky’s dawn—is established, but tension remains mostly atmospheric rather than sharply escalated. Once she begins “mapping silence,” there’s little sense of risk that the attempt might fail or backfire; the revelation that it’s a plea comes smoothly. The main tightening is conceptual (from “hush doom” to “answer summons”), and there’s no strong on-page trade-off or lost option. As a result, the conflict feels contemplative and beautiful but relatively low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake is her desire to communicate with the building, braided with the risk/reward of exposing true motives in this fragile companionship. Escalation is subtle but present: from harmless “borrowing sugar” lies to the rooftop confrontation with the seal and his mirroring key, which deepens knowledge and narrows her path forward. The key slide and vault revelation form a credible tightening, but there’s little sense of potential loss if either character chose differently tonight. The conflict remains mostly conceptual and relationally gentle, so pressure never quite bites as hard as it could.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—archiving what remains before dawn’s dissolution—is legible and the shrinking night (“the last star above was fading”) provides a gentle but real tightening. Pressure is primarily internal: will she face and structure these quarantined memories or not, and what stance will she take toward her own fragility. Escalation is modest but present in the shell’s pulsing warmth and increasingly specific, painful memories, culminating in her vow and the relinquishing of the shell. The conflict stays low-key and textural, so while effective for a lyric piece, it never becomes sharply agonistic.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—freeing the kingdom from a cruel fertility curse at great personal risk—is clear and well-scaled for the length. Pressure escalates via the scroll’s active resistance, the aurora’s violent flaring, and the sanctuary’s trembling as the stalactite “clock” accelerates, culminating in her racing the final drop. However, opposition remains largely impersonal and mystical; there is no moment where she seriously considers stopping or failing, so her agency is never truly in doubt. The resolution is undeniably driven by her action, but the conflict feels more like a solemn fulfillment of a plan than a hard-won victory under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—the fate of stolen emotional resonance and the ethical handling of the silence-entity—is clear, and her decision not to destroy but to re-educate it offers a meaningful moral trade-off. However, the pressure arc remains relatively gentle: the entity never actively opposes her, and there is little sense of real risk that she might fail, be consumed, or worsen the theft. The escalation is conceptual and emotional (layers of echo truth, then direct engagement) rather than conflict-driven, which fits the lyric mode but limits visceral tension. The felt cost is mostly her raw throat and long endurance, which read more as poetic than truly pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the child’s lingering echo will be understood and released—is legible, and the investigation-through-dreams provides a conceptual pressure. However, the piece largely skips dramatizing struggle: no serious false leads, doubts, or risks complicate her path once the snow globe is identified. The key turn (recognizing the child is trying to deliver the globe’s “You’ll be safe” promise) is presented as insight rather than a contested or costly choice. As a result, escalation feels more like deepening mood than tightening stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—her need to honor unseen effort—is clear but very low-pressure and largely unopposed. Escalation is primarily an increase in symbolic density (widow memory, chalk marks, fireflies) rather than a tightening of options or a felt trade-off. Her “choice” at the end is essentially to keep doing what she always does, which reads as gentle earned stasis but with minimal cost. As a result, tension never truly sharpens, even under an accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake is clear: whether she can turn a debunked “curse” into leverage against the engineered scarcity and fear of her world. Pressure escalates when she actively tests the diamond, triggering a visible environmental change, then tightens again with the plaque’s revelation of a large, dormant network. However, the danger remains largely ambient—the dust storm never truly threatens her, and there’s no antagonist or acute on-page consequence testing her choice to commit to the broader mission. The conflict functions but leans contemplative rather than sharply pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—resisting Kael’s monolithic unity by seeding a messier, shadow-aware awakening—is clear and conceptually high. There is some escalation as the storm is reframed as veil, rebels reach out, and Elira chooses to send her own signal. Yet opposition is entirely off-stage and never tests her resolve; there is no credible risk that she will fail or pay a specific price. The conflict remains largely ideological and atmospheric, which keeps tension from tightening into a truly gripping pressure point.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how he can redeem a vagrant, marginal life by preserving and translating memory—is clear but rarely sharpened into active conflict. The music box repair is the closest thing to a turning-point task, yet it unfolds without real opposition or risk beyond lyric difficulty. His later anonymous gifting and final disappearance feel like continuations of an established pattern rather than escalations that foreclose painful options on the page. The result is a beautiful, low-pressure arc whose emotional stakes are high conceptually but only mildly stressed in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—protecting the Heartstone and thus the sea’s “soul” from sonic attack—is signaled early and tested when the scavengers’ harpoons strike. Escalation is credible: background hum → disharmony → violent sonic assault that shakes the lighthouse and threatens shattering. Her agency in choosing to become the vibrational buffer is clear, but the resolution feels slightly low-friction; the single “wave of pure tone” both ends the attack and converts antagonists with minimal visible cost or lingering complication. Pressure is solid yet stops short of fully harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—reconfiguring a violent regime and culture of spectacle through stillness—is clear, but the on-page pressure remains relatively low. We’re told the rulers come, send threats, then fall silent, yet no specific confrontation or hard test of her stance is dramatized. Escalation is more a steady accumulation of converts and symbolic transformations than a tightening that visibly forecloses options. As a result, the stakes feel important in concept but under-pressurized moment to moment.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she can meaningfully “prevent” deaths by confronting systemic forgetting rather than just fixing wiring—is clear and deepens as she uncovers the memory-field cause. Pressure escalates from routine case to haunted history to a morally charged choice: suppress, report conventionally, or honor and stay engaged, and she chooses the hard path of continued witness and leaving the lantern. The cost is conceptual and emotional (ongoing burden, likely institutional dismissal), not immediate danger, so tension stays mostly low-voltage rather than sharply constricting her options. Effective, but a touch more on-page friction or risk around her choices would raise the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—honoring Maribel’s request as a path to self-forgiveness—is clear early and deepens as the heart resists all conventional fixes. Pressure escalates via his accumulated failures and the looming possibility that this is beyond him, making the choice to persist meaningful. The decisive tightening comes with the realization that the heart must be a duet with the melody, transforming his approach from force to listening. Still, the conflict remains largely internal and contemplative; there’s little on-page threat of true failure beyond implied emotional cost, which keeps tension solid rather than bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—coaxing the Yearning Algorithm into ringing a forbidden bell—is clear and escalates as the Engine whirs louder, the kaleidoscope spins faster, and her voice cracks. Conflict is more procedural and atmospheric than oppositional; nothing meaningfully pushes back beyond ambient risk and the possibility of failure. Her agency drives the escalation (choosing the arrow, refusing to stop humming, hitting the resonance trigger), but the price of failure or partial success remains abstract. The final “stir” of the bell offers a satisfying tightening, yet the stakes never quite bite hard enough for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—uncovering what happened to Helios-7 and what deletion really means—intensifies from curiosity to a quasi-ritual rescue-attempt, culminating in the mass restore and her acceptance of being their anchor. There is a clear tightening when she chooses to risk a mass resonance restore at 07:07 in the deepest vault, defying corporate expectations. However, external consequences and concrete costs (risk of job loss, surveillance pressure, danger to the janitor) are only sketched, so the escalation feels more intellectual than truly perilous. As a result, tension remains strong conceptually but never quite sharpens into a felt, high-stakes test on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether she can genuinely reconstitute courage/peace rather than enforce silence—remains clear and converges at the self-facing mirror. Escalation is primarily internal and textural: moving from others’ anomalies to her own history and then to a new question, with the ice’s shift echoing the internal turn. The closure choice (to carry an imperfect shard forward as “enough”) is earned but relatively low-friction, with little visible on-page risk beyond inner vulnerability. Some sharper sense of what she’s refusing or endangering would heighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—how Elara will relate to death and endings—is established early and tightened through the glacier-collapse sequence where she chooses the floe instead of immediate safety. That choice clearly forecloses a path and entails risk, while her internal need (understanding endings) conflicts with base survival instinct. The later refusal of euthanasia consultations is an earned stasis/renunciation that crystallizes the arc. The main limitation is that external conflict (disaster relief stakes, community danger) remains largely atmospheric rather than fully interwoven as a counter-pressure to her inward pull.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.2)
    The core conflict—whether their mismatched natures mean failure or a different kind of “meant to be”—is clear and tightened by Mara’s initial brittleness and refusal. Elias’s choice to engage through metaphor rather than demand and Mara’s choice to stay, walk, and finally pocket the letter form a credible escalation. However, resistance dissolves relatively easily once the vines analogy is offered, so risk and cost feel muted for a relationship that supposedly left long-term scars. The emotional jeopardy never quite threatens to rupture the encounter, tempering the sense of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—saving the prophet’s wisdom from dissolution—is clear, and there is a mild escalation as the parapet activates and clearings stabilize. However, opposition remains largely atmospheric and conceptual; nothing seriously threatens failure, and her method works smoothly without visible risk or trade-off beyond effort. Internal conflict is minimal; she never hesitates or considers an alternate path. As a result, the piece feels more like a beautifully executed ritual than a pressured choice under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—her quiet devotion to collective healing—is emotionally appealing but faces almost no on-page resistance. Each photograph introduces a new emotional nuance (fear/joy, distance/intimacy, wreckage/wings), which does deepen the texture, yet there is no real escalation or narrowing of options, only repetition of method. The closest thing to tightening is her lingering “longer than intended” over the accident photo, but this never forces a trade-off or visible price. As a result, tension is low and the piece risks reading as static reflection rather than conflict-driven narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—how to relate to a decaying past and the possibility of new growth—is clear and internal, with pressure building through years of ritual culminating in the crystal’s unexpected “question.” The escalation is a single, meaningful tightening when the usual pattern breaks and demands a response, and her choice to answer aloud reweights her entire project. However, tension remains almost entirely conceptual; there is minimal sense of risk or cost beyond the philosophical. For elite venues this is strong but not maximal in terms of felt pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—capturing/locating the sound of aging before it slips away—is signaled early and tightened as the driftwood points to the oldest tape pile. The key escalation is his deliberate use of chalk on the Betamax case, which yields the long-sought sound beneath the screech. The internal cost is clear (he’ll forget, again), but external opposition is mostly atmospheric rather than actively resisting, so tension remains more textural than combative. Still, the piece delivers one solid deepening beat and an earned, costly attainment.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—restructuring time to stabilize a trembling reality and escape linear causality—is clearly signaled, and pressure mounts via the intensifying “Time of Shaking Foundations” as she begins the ritual. Her agency operates through a counterintuitive tactic (waiting in stillness for a leaf’s sound), and the shaking peaks around that choice, giving a credible tightening. However, escalation remains mostly conceptual and aesthetic; there’s little sense of real risk of failure or personal loss beyond generalized cosmic peril, so the price of success feels gentler than the premise implies.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—can Elara enact a “flawless goodbye” by reconnecting presence and peace—is clear, but conflict is almost entirely internal and gently held. Escalation reads as deepening rather than tightening: more souls respond, the shard briefly repairs, then dissolves as the final hymn lands. There’s little real resistance or risk of failure; success seems preordained once she begins singing. This keeps the piece lovely but limits pressure and the sense of costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding and reconciling what happened to shadows—remains consistent and escalates from observation to dangerous crossing to custodianship. Pressure deepens via repetition of the key ritual and culminates in her decision to step through the threshold, which is the one clear tightening of risk. Still, conflict stays primarily intellectual and metaphysical; there’s no strong counterforce, and the cost of failure or success is more implied than dramatized. The piece reads as high-concept reconfiguration rather than a fully pressurized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—how grief and stolen children will be understood and metabolized—is clear and emotionally grounded, and the revelation of the hollow substitute body functions as the key prior turn. Escalation here is mostly internal and conceptual: her move from private understanding to founding a communal site of repair is the main tightening of consequence. However, tension remains gentle; there’s little direct opposition or risk in the present scene, so pressure feels more meditative than urgent. The cost of her choice (bearing others’ sorrow, challenging a comforting myth) is intelligible but remains mostly implied.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—how to live with and transmute communal violence without replicating its methods—is clear and deepens as she moves from solitary ritual to receiving villagers, especially the child. Pressure escalates via accumulation rather than reversal: the polishing, memories, and vow tighten into the moment where she allows others to touch and be changed by the shard. The cost is psychological rather than situational, but the piece makes that cost legible in her unflinching coexistence with burning-house memories alongside the child’s wonder. Tension is quiet and could perhaps sharpen one concrete on-page risk (e.g., fear of villagers’ misinterpretation), but it remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are primarily internal—how she will relate to a publicly exposed confession—and the piece is more meditative than pressurized. There is a subtle deepening when we learn about the viral confession and then see her choose not to burn it but to integrate it into the sanctuary, yet options never feel sharply narrowed on the page. Conflict is almost entirely intrapsychic and resolved without much visible resistance or risk of failure. The result is emotionally coherent but low in tension for a top-tier market.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether she will capitulate to closure/catharsis or hold to a more difficult, unfinished truth—is clear and thematically compelling. Pressure escalates accumulatively as more cameos present varied hopes, culminating in her relinquishing the shell and choosing to write again on new terms. However, conflict remains mostly internal and reflective; the off-page forces (publishers, readers) never come on-stage to sharpen the choices. The cost of her choice is therefore more conceptual than viscerally felt, keeping tension solid but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can rekindle the village’s forgotten covenant with the land—is clear early and the ritual’s progression creates a gentle deepening (from solitary song to communal chorus to ambient restoration). However, pressure remains mostly atmospheric; Elara never faces a concrete obstacle, moment of doubt, or trade-off that might foreclose a path or risk loss. The child-voice question and appearance of ancestral villagers enrich the emotional arc but don’t truly threaten her aim. As a result, escalation is evocative rather than tense, limiting the sense of on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake is the successful, truthful creation of a heartbeat-map; this is signaled, and the central tightening is the blood-sealing that activates the plate. Pressure is mostly spiritual/ritual rather than oppositional—no antagonist, deadline, or risk beyond failure and bodily discomfort—so escalation feels like deepening texture rather than sharpened conflict. Her refusal to use the flash-paper and her blood sacrifice function as mild costs that narrow options. The piece maintains a quiet, coherent tension, but never quite crystallizes into a sharp trade-off or palpable threat to her goal.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving wonder as a resource against a world that grows “too loud, too certain”—is clear but primarily internal and philosophical. Pressure deepens via accumulative successes (glyphs, pulses, the shattering tone) and culminates in the completion of the archive and his deliberate departure, which forecloses his personal access to the space. However, stakes never quite sharpen into a felt dilemma or loss beyond time and solitude; there’s little risk of failure or real opposition. The escalation is sufficient for a lyric piece but keeps tension at a relatively gentle simmer.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—transforming unbearable grief into something survivable—is clear and raised once the father reveals the daughter is “lost” rather than dead. Pressure escalates modestly through the ritual and his visible reaction to the calcification; the secondary turn when she treats her own burden adds depth more than new danger. The cost is present but quiet: she remains bound to a taxing purpose and chooses endurance over escape. The piece leans more on atmosphere than tension, so the stakes feel profound but not especially sharp or contested in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.3)
    The primary conflict—how to live with grief without being erased by it—is clear early and coherently developed, with the carving functioning as her chosen tactic. There is a meaningful tightening when she refuses to rise for the kettle and instead commits to the chisel, effectively foreclosing the path of mere routine coping in favor of deeper engagement. Stakes remain internal but tangible: whether grief will “spill again” and drown her versus be contained and studied. The escalation is quiet yet sufficient for this length, though an additional external pressure could have sharpened the trade-off further.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether she will keep circling in derivative regret or confront/redefine her own ghost—is clear early and tightens as she escalates from passive collecting to directly addressing the ghost. The ghost’s gesture of adjusting a lens is a clean deepening, reframing her entire method and forcing a more personal risk. The decisive act of surrendering the camera, and then accepting the letter’s verdict, forecloses the old, safer path of vicarious haunting. The stakes remain internal, but the cost is palpable and the pressure builds in a controlled arc.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether a dead terminal can be made to “breathe” again through engineering improvisation—is clear and coherent. There is one solid tightening when she discovers the geothermal leak and chooses to redirect rather than seal it, which shifts the space from inert to inhabited. However, opposition is almost entirely environmental and never really bites; nothing meaningfully resists her intent, and there’s little risk of failure. As a result, escalation feels more like steady unfolding than pressured conflict with true trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will remain entombed in mute maintenance or risk re-engaging with his lost musical self—is clear and escalates softly but coherently. Pressure tightens via the crystal’s arrival, its effect on the clocks, and the droplet on the score, culminating in the choice to strike the tuning fork and hum. The cost is largely internal and quiet—giving up the fantasy of grand symphonies for a more modest, solitary music—but it is legible. Some readers might want one sharper moment of hesitation or potential loss to feel the trade-off more viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake is internal—whether he can truly “salvage” truth rather than mythologize it—and it’s signaled early and revisited in the locket discovery. Escalation is quiet but present: the shift from abstract reflection to a concrete glint, then to the locket with its revealing inscription, tightens the emotional and conceptual pressure. His choice to wait, then to reach in a controlled way, and finally to reinterpret his whole pursuit as restoration rather than conquest provides a credible deepening. Still, the stakes remain largely contemplative; there is little sense of risk beyond inner revaluation, which keeps pressure from feeling fully sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes are quiet but real: whether an endangered, embodied knowledge will be entrusted to her, and whether she can prove herself worthy through patience and attention. Escalation comes via his initial reluctance, prolonged silence, then incremental instruction, culminating in his explicit acknowledgment and her reframed mission. However, pressure never tightens beyond a gentle test; there is little sense of real risk that he might refuse or that something could be lost on the page. The cost remains mostly conceptual (time, humility) rather than felt as a sharp trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how the traveler can make absence present enough to orient the living—is clear, but pressure remains primarily conceptual and steady. There is some escalation in moving from generalized practice to the specific case of Elira, whose departure is more visibly fraught and personally witnessed. However, the traveler never faces a hard choice that forecloses a plausible alternative path; their method is affirmed rather than tested, so the felt cost and narrowing of options stay understated. The ending image is resonant, but the conflict never quite tightens into a palpable crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—whether any genuine beauty can be rekindled—is explicit and present from early on, and the pressure deepens toward the eve of activation. The main tightening is the activation attempt itself, where the risk is emotional failure rather than physical catastrophe. That said, conflict remains mostly internal and aspirational; there’s little on-page active opposition or concrete loss besides his long-worn exhaustion and derision in backstory. The piece earns a strong, quiet escalation but stops short of testing him with a hard trade-off or visible sacrifice in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—reframing her father’s legacy and her own scars—appears early and tightens as she moves from contemplation to an explicit, risky act of contact with the lagoon’s depths. The appearance of the remorse-figure and her decision to bind it with the red thread is a solid escalation that fuses inner and outer conflict. However, she enters already relatively resolved, so the story delivers a deepening and ritualization of that stance rather than a genuinely pressured dilemma or forfeiture. The kitchen-fire call underscores her ongoing commitment but doesn’t materially raise the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the city will remain numb in its forgetting or be forced back into living memory—is clear, and it tightens modestly as she moves from the key at Fountain Twelve to the faint reawakening of Fountain One. However, antagonistic pressure is almost entirely implicit; nothing truly resists her, and she encounters no meaningful trade-offs or blocked options. The “cost” of liberation (the pain of remembering) is felt in glimpses—the old man’s tears, the teenager’s disorientation—but remains secondary to the quiet competence of her process. The escalation is textural rather than confrontational, effective for mood but a bit low on bite for elite-market stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are conceptually weighty (altering a destructive generational pattern), but on the page the conflict is almost entirely one-sided: the sentimentalist chooses gentleness and gentleness works. There is a mild tightening when the transformation begins and peace is described as “troubling” and fragile, but no real test threatens their goal or forces a trade-off. The gear’s rust sloughs off and harmony emerges without cost beyond abstract doubt. As a result, escalation feels more like a graceful swell than genuine pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake is Elias’s stance toward grief—isolated carver vs. participant in a collective, migratory current—which is clear but mostly internal. Pressure escalates modestly through the intensifying carving, the proliferation of ribbons, and the seasonal bracket of the butterflies’ passage, culminating in the grandmother’s crimson ribbon. The shift from Silas behind him to beside him provides a gentle but real reconfiguration of agency: he accepts working in concert with the dead rather than under them. Still, the conflict remains relatively static and contemplative; few options are visibly foreclosed or traded off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will maintain his rigid control or allow “grace” into the mechanism—is clear and paid off. Pressure does increase from the abstract burden of his decades-long vow to the specific moment when he physically touches the bob and chooses not to wind or adjust. However, the story largely sidesteps any external resistance or concrete negative consequence, keeping conflict primarily internal and contemplative, so the sense of cost is emotional rather than sharply dramatized. As a result, escalation feels deep rather than taut, effective but not maximally pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.6)
    The primary conflict is internal—between comforting maintenance of the dead and confronting the messy, unfinished nature of intentions—and the story escalates this via the increasingly revealing threads and the shift from humming lullabies to laughing in startled recognition. The stakes are conceptually rich but remain somewhat abstract; there is no external antagonist or concrete consequence pressing her beyond discomfort. The tapestry decoding and stitching do deepen and tighten pressure as she recognizes her own choices in the knots and must accept complicity. Still, the journey feels relatively smooth, with few moments where she faces a true dilemma or sacrifices a clearly viable alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—how she will engage with the future (as prophecy vs invitation, dominance vs resonance)—is clear but remains largely internal and contemplative. There is a subtle tightening as the blank page’s “pregnant” moment gives way to the glyphs activating the parchment and harmonizing with ice and wind. However, there is little sense of jeopardy or foreclosed options; no concrete loss, only a choice of method and stance. The result is thematically satisfying but emotionally under-pressured for elite markets.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—resisting the story famine by reanimating memory—is signaled early and deepens as broadcasts prove to be “resurrection” rather than mere contraband entertainment. Pressure escalates via the intensifying heat of the dial and culminates when the song turns its gaze on her, forcing her to recognize her own role and pay with genuine grief. Her choice to broadcast in turn and to encode her song in birdcall frequencies is a clear exercise of agency that narrows her path: she commits to being visible (to others like her) and permanently bound to this network. Stakes remain mostly conceptual/emotional rather than materially perilous, but the internal/external tension is well integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.8)
    The conflict is primarily internal and thematic—whether to honor painful, incomplete emotions instead of chasing soothing illusions—so the stakes feel more contemplative than urgent. There is one meaningful tightening when the visitor recognizes herself in the portrait and begins to cry, testing the scatterer’s commitment to witnessing rather than comforting. However, there are few on-page costs or foreclosed options beyond this, and no reversal that significantly alters tactics. The result is resonant but somewhat static pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—memory versus engineered amnesia—is clear, and pressure is applied via the Reconstruction Council’s slogans, envoys, and monument. Escalation is more thematic than situational: the move from generic Council rhetoric to the specific obelisk reveal is a meaningful deepening, but not a sharp narrowing of options. His agency is primarily endurance and quiet refusal (turning down “reintegration,” continuing his work), which fits the piece but mutes on-page reversals. The cost of this stance is present yet not viscerally tested in a concrete, high-pressure decision.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—whether the art of harmony, and Elara’s way of teaching it, is truly vanishing or simply waiting—is clear and emotionally coherent. Pressure escalates quietly from solitary waiting to testing the air with a hum, to the ambiguous creak, to the concrete arrival of the girl who asks if Elara still teaches. Elara’s decision to respond with “Good…That means you haven’t learned how to get it wrong yet” and to begin with subtracting noise crystallizes her stance and the story’s risk: enduring in a world that prizes volume over vulnerability. The conflict remains primarily internal and thematic rather than sharply dramatized, which slightly softens the sense of acute stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can midwife a new, resonant form of knowledge from ruin—is present but underpressured. Escalation is mostly linear description rather than tightening options: the celestial alignment is framed as rare but never bites into her choices or threatens failure. There’s no real antagonist force (internal or external) that tests her “gentle rebellion” beyond simple follow-through. As a result, the transformation is affecting but feels almost inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.2)
    The main stakes—whether the “failed” drone hives represent collapse or adaptation, and whether this knowledge is shared—are clear and thematically apt, but the pressure remains gentle. There is a meaningful tightening when they move from rumor and riddles to the physical discovery of the drones on the tower, and another when the woman realizes they are capacitors, not pollinators. However, Elias faces no hard opposition and barely any dilemma on the page; his withholding from the city is asserted rather than wrestled with in scene. The escalation is more intellectual and atmospheric than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—whether and how the unsanctified cottage’s spirit can be acknowledged and released—is clear but very low-pressure. There is a mild tightening around the ritual moment (the hush, the houses stirring, the specific cottage surfacing), yet she never faces a serious alternative or risk; success feels almost guaranteed. Internal and external conflict are aligned but not meaningfully at odds. As a result, tension remains gentle and atmospheric rather than truly escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake is the meaning of the city’s “Fall” and, by extension, the historian’s life’s work and responsibility to the surface narrative. There is a clear escalation from simple discovery to ideological upheaval, culminating in her choice to shatter the ampoule and accept the role of “thread” between worlds. However, resistance is brief (“She hesitated”) and the cost of accepting nuance (professional risk, existential disorientation) remains mostly implied rather than dramatized. The conflict is rich conceptually but could use one more concrete test or trade-off to fully tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether he can transform his relationship to a missed choice rather than remain trapped in pure regret—is clear and coherently pressured. Escalation comes through his increasingly invasive interventions into the staircase (carving then voicing proofs) culminating in the space-folding proof and vision of the arcade threshold. The cost is the surrender of his talisman (the die) and the acceptance of ongoing ascent without that crutch. Because all conflict is internal/textural, the sense of jeopardy is a bit cooler than it might be with one sharper, on-page “risk of failure” beat.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—can her encoded art actually awaken dormant empathy—is clear and steadily intensified via increasingly specific glyphs and tangible responses (the barista’s act, the note, then the girl). Escalation is conceptual rather than confrontational, but the move from anonymous ripple effects to a literal knock at the door is a genuine tightening of pressure and possibility. Agency is quiet but present in her persistent choosing to paint and, crucially, to open the door and share the act. The cost side of the calculus (what vulnerability or danger this connection might entail) is understated, which keeps the stakes from fully biting at elite-publication level.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.4)
    The central stake—whether a traumatized community dares to reanimate its art—is clear and grows from private gestures (bread) to public performance (the boy’s drum, makeshift orchestra, theater). Pressure escalates via small but meaningful risks: admitting memories, playing imperfect instruments, gathering in defiance of shared dread. However, conflict remains relatively low-friction; opposition is largely atmospheric (grief, fear) rather than dramatized through active resistance, so costs feel inferred more than directly confronted. The resolution is earned but comfortable, lacking a moment where a specific, painful trade-off bites on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—overthrowing predestination to end hunger—is clear early and escalates smoothly as he moves from theory to irreversible activation. Pressure tightens meaningfully at the moment he places the yoyo core and mainspring into the hunger stone, then again when the paradoxical future gear appears. The cost is twofold: destruction of irreplaceable artifacts (lighthouse face, hunger stone) and his solitary assumption of responsibility for time itself. Conflict is mostly external-conceptual rather than interpersonally dramatized, but within this mode it’s coherent and sufficiently tense.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—redefining the protagonist’s relationship to fear/trauma—is established early and tightened through successive beats (entering deeper rooms, obeying the advisor, reading aloud, then physically extracting memories). The pivotal escalation is the literal unbosoming, which narrows options and forces the protagonist to expose their worst moments as a weapon. Internal and external conflicts interlock in the confrontation with Fear-duplicate, where recognition itself inflicts damage. The cost is felt in the self-exposure and the painful reliving of drowning, not just in the disappearance of Fear.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—can the Prophet transform an ominous, sound-thickening tide into something playable rather than catastrophic—is conceptually strong, and escalation is visible when the sea blackens and clouds accelerate. However, the Prophet never seems truly at risk or conflicted; he “didn’t flinch” and quickly finds a remembered hum that works on the first attempt, which undercuts tension. The key reversal (handoff to Kael) is lovely but reads as opportunity rather than forced sacrifice or dilemma. As a result, pressure feels more like a steady crescendo of wonder than a narrowing field of costly choices.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether she can pierce the watchers’ silence and expose the truth of the lost expedition—is clear and raised by the watcher finally turning its head. There is a meaningful tightening when that micro-response reweights everything she’s theorized and forces her to choose between passive mapping and direct risk. However, escalation remains mostly conceptual and retrospective; there’s limited on-page pushback or concrete loss as she commits to the midnight climb, so pressure intensifies more in idea than in dramatized conflict. The cost is implied and ominous, but not felt through on-page resistance or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether and how to expose a nation-defining lie—is conceptually high, but on the page it never faces active resistance or a concrete dilemma beyond tactical framing. The only significant “turn” is finding the letter and forming a plan; after that, tension diffuses into abstract strategy and future projection. Without an antagonist, time pressure, or moral trade-off dramatized in the moment, pressure remains mostly intellectual. The ending has resolve but not much sense of paid or looming cost beyond implied controversy.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether memory of the pavilion’s human life can be anchored against oblivion—intensifies through the draining inkwell and the building’s groaning resistance. Pressure escalates via entropy and emotional cost rather than overt danger, culminating when the found bride’s letter forces Elara past stoic ritual into open grief. Her decision to copy and re-entomb the letter, then keep returning with refilled ink, is a meaningful crystallization of stance with visible price. The conflict stays mostly internal and could bear one more moment of concrete jeopardy, but it is coherent and sufficiently taut for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether truth about the city’s drowning can be reconstructed against systemic erasure—is clear and coherently pressured by physical decay and political suppression. Escalation comes mainly through accumulating evidence of intent (rerouted grain, sealed vents, preserved Index) that shifts her from curiosity to morally charged purpose. However, antagonistic pressure never quite sharpens into a dilemma or concrete trade-off; she is rarely forced to give something up to pursue truth in this scene. The tension is more intellectual than visceral, which curbs the intensity of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—what Silas will do with his grief and the shadow it has spawned—is clear and sharpened when the basilica’s hum changes and the shadow starts climbing the recorded dreams. His response (gathering all lanterns, choosing to shatter them, then using the sapphire) provides a solid escalation from passive preservation to costly action. However, the opposition remains somewhat abstract; we rarely feel a concrete risk of failure or consequence beyond mood, which softens the sense of pressure compared to the conceptual richness. The cost is real but more implied than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—can she locate and reach these pools of unused potential, making meaning out of catastrophe—is clear and signaled early. There is some escalation: unstable simulations, overloading breakers, then new coordinates that require a major move (repositioning the whole observatory). However, resistance is largely systemic rather than actively adversarial, and the pressure never quite squeezes her into a visible trade-off beyond “go alone or not at all.” The conflict remains compelling but relatively smooth, with limited sense of immediate risk or loss for each new perturbation.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure is primarily internal: the tension between heedless curiosity and the pilgrim’s warning about mind-unraveling frequencies, and between her operational persona and buried self. The main escalation is the choice to activate the chip despite known risk, leading to invasive, identity-threatening visions and culminating in the relinquishment of her old, purely instrumental stance. However, the external danger remains largely notional—spectral resonance is invoked but never truly tests her on the page—so stakes feel more contemplative than fraught. The final shift is earned but relatively gentle for a piece aiming at maximal intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elira can bear and integrate a withheld truth about her origins—is clear early and deepens as she moves from generic carvings to the one bearing her father’s face. The key escalation is the watch-hand-triggered memory, which sharply raises the emotional cost and forces her to recalibrate her entire life story. Conflict is largely internal but interwoven with the external ritual at the shore, culminating in an earned stance change rather than a soft reset. It’s a quiet arc with essentially one big turn, but that turn is weighty and well-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether these two former adversaries can move from antagonism into a workable, honest collaboration—is clear and carries through to the end. There is one main tightening beat when she demands he confront the “buried” names, and he reveals he has memorized them, which raises the emotional cost of staying in denial. The exchange of relics and shared descent signal a committed stance toward reconciliation, but they reach that place with relatively little resistance or risk of rupture on the page. As a result, conflict feels more contemplative than pressured, with escalation understated rather than truly testing their limits.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central conflict—whether she will remain pinned by regret or risk moving again—stays clear, and pressure gently tightens from standstill to walking to launching. The meaningful turn lands when she stops navigating by stars/precision and submits to the absurdity of utility poles, leading to the harder choice of re-entering the sea. The cost (abandoning paralysis and the safety of self-conceived “brokenness” to face uncertainty) is legible but somewhat underplayed; nothing external forces the decision, so tension is primarily interior. For an elite venue, some readers may want one more concrete, on-page friction to sharpen that turn.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether the seeker will accept the pain of rekindling empathy—is signaled early and tightened as the lake surfaces painful, ambiguous images that may be tied to their erased past. The key escalation is the water’s transformation from eerie setting to active moral pressure via fractal ripples and visions, culminating in the decision to release the ball and walk away changed. The price is mostly internal and conceptual (relinquishing a talismanic object and embracing ongoing vulnerability), which fits the mode but keeps tension quieter rather than sharp. A slightly clearer sense that walking away is genuinely harder than staying numb would have heightened the stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—can she transform memory into presence without losing herself—is clear and guides the scene. Pressure escalates primarily via density and intensity of the ritual rather than reversals: the spices, the trembling certainty, the first spark, then the hybrid phoenix. Agency is present in her conscious choice to surrender to translation and reciprocity, which forecloses a simpler path of remaining fully human. The limitation is that success feels somewhat inevitable tonally; the risk of failure or unwanted consequence is more implied than sharply felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.6)
    The central stake—whether she will continue to hoard regret or relinquish lost moments in order to rejoin her daughter—is clear and remains in view. Pressure escalates as the ritual intensifies, the saucer becomes a portal, and she confronts the tangible “what might have been” in the archive, forcing a choice to bless and release rather than reclaim. The cost (surrendering the fantasy of undoing time) is legible in the way the saucer re-seals and her vow shifts from repair to presence. The conflict is largely internal, but it’s dramatized enough through setting and ritual to feel real.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—reaching the Echo-Realm for reunion rather than conquest or escape—is clear early and threads through every beat. Internal conflict (accepting her own buried violence) and external constraint (emotional gravity and gate calibration) interlock nicely, especially in the moment where her shadow becomes an “anchor” and then a “wing.” Escalation is present but could be sharper; we’re told the risks (“Too heavy…Too light…”), but we don’t see a failed attempt or near-miss to materially narrow her options. Still, the final stitching sequence with ship groaning, pressure building, and her buoyant crossing reads like a genuine tightening with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure is primarily internal and textural: the sequence of bottles escalates from anonymous grace to intimate cost when the fourth bug embodies her own path-not-taken. The dominant stake—how she relates to transformation and to her own unlived life—tightens there, but she never seriously considers refusal, so jeopardy remains gentle rather than acute. External stakes (village spared, fisherman, librarian) are powerful conceptually but occur offstage, diminishing felt on-page tension. The ending’s stance shift is earned, yet the story reads more as a ritual unfolding than a true test that could go meaningfully wrong.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—seeding a silent revolution—is clearly signaled, but the on-page pressure is relatively low: guards are drowsy, oblivious, and there’s no genuine near-miss or tactical loss. Escalation is more conceptual (alignment, tracing, distribution) than conflict-driven, so options never feel meaningfully narrowed. Her agency is real but untested; success comes without visible trade-off beyond implied long-term risk. As a result, tension exists in idea more than in felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.6)
    The central stake—will he find a way to relate to his curse and the patterns without being shut out of wonder?—is clear and resolves in his shift from chasing to “arranging the world so wonder came to him.” The main tightening comes when the summoned eels respond and the star-dusted one shares memories, reweighting his lifelong quest. However, opposition is mostly abstract; nothing on the page meaningfully resists him beyond prior failures, so moment-to-moment tension remains meditative more than gripping. The ending’s cost is conceptual (relinquishing the idea of tidy answers), which lands but could be sharpened by a more explicit trade-off or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether to break silence by opening the last uncensored poem or continue the vigil—is legible early in thematic terms and crystallizes around the envelope. Pressure escalates via the timer’s countdown, the storm’s crescendo, and the physical act of retrieving and holding the envelope without opening it. Her choice to preserve the “vigil in pause” forecloses at least one live path (immediate revelation) and carries a felt cost. The conflict remains purely interior and relatively even-toned, so the sense of narrowing options is more meditative than acute.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—uncovering and understanding the hidden overture—is clear, and the sundial’s timed alignment provides a built-in clock. However, conflict is almost entirely frictionless: the woman arrives, the code works on schedule, and there is no significant internal or external resistance. Their past “duels” are referenced but not dramatized here, so the on-page scene feels more like graceful execution than a test with real risk. As a result, escalation is mostly intellectual/ceremonial rather than felt as narrowing options or demanding a price.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.4)
    The primary conflict is internal—whether she will remain encased in cynicism or risk rebuilding belief in beauty and resistance—and that pressure is clear. There is a solid deepening when she reads Elias’s line “They call us broken. We call us seeds,” which reweights her prior attempts at “forging beauty from anarchy” and pushes her toward active ritual. However, opposition remains largely atmospheric; there’s little sense that her choice is contested beyond grief and ambient societal decay. The stakes feel intimate and real, but escalation is more tonal than sharply pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—can Elira use her art to defy fate and restore her lover or at least crack determinism—is established early and tightened through the ticking clock and increasingly volatile environmental responses. Pressure escalates via her choice to thread the hidden reel, obey the “play until the needle stills” directive, and commit to a final impossible chord. Internal and external conflicts interweave: longing vs. risk, precision vs. chaos, refuge vs. experiment. A slightly clearer sense of the potential collateral cost (to herself or the world) could sharpen the felt price of her gamble.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—saving collective memory before the accelerated monsoon—is clear and present from early on, and Aris’s doubt provides an internal counterpressure. Escalation comes via the early bloom, the risk of misinterpretation (“forgiveness” vs “famine”), and the ridge’s tremor/awakening during the ritual. However, the conflict is largely one-sided: nothing resists Aris in a way that forces a hard trade-off or visible loss, and once the ritual begins, success feels almost assured. As a result, tension is atmospheric rather than knife-edge, and the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure does deepen: the needle’s agitation, the emergence of voices and chills, and the thickening indigo all represent a clear intensification of the central problem (pooled regret). Elio’s agency—choosing to continue the ritual despite escalating spectral presence—drives the movement toward diffusion and calm. However, the conflict remains largely one-sided and ritualized; nothing meaningfully resists or complicates him beyond atmosphere, and the personal stakes for Elio are understated. The result is beautifully textured but emotionally low-voltage compared to top-tier pieces.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=5.4)
    Conflict is purely conceptual and lacks immediate stakes; external opposition ("colleagues") is summarized off-page, and the internal resolution occurs through passive time jumps rather than an acute, on-page choice.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.1)
    Stakes are internal and thematic ("finding meaning") rather than urgent pressure; the conflict is largely retrospective (surviving the attempt). The narrative lacks a tightening of options in the present moment, as the protagonist moves smoothly from observation to epiphany without significant obstruction.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.2)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the story escalates density successfully, moving from a single test to a symphonic whole. However, the stakes feel low because there is no active resistance—the ice sings immediately upon request, and the protagonist risks no resources or failure, resulting in a "victory lap" narrative without tension.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.1)
    The internal pressure is established well through the "molars ache" resonance. However, the conflict lacks external friction or a moment of doubt; the path from recognition to resolution is linear and devoid of setbacks.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are clearly established (hunger, solidarity), but the conflict is generalized against the backdrop of sanctions rather than sharpened through specific antagonistic pressure. The climax feels more like a ceremonial transition than a forced choice under duress, as the community accepts the shift without friction or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.0)
    External pressure is minimal; the protagonist faces no active opposition or ticking clock, turning the story into a procession rather than a conflict. The escalation is smooth and observational, lacking a moment where options are forcibly narrowed or a significant price is paid for the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.7)
    The stakes are clearly established: the safety of memory anchors versus the danger of raw truth. The disintegration of the photos serves as a forceful escalation that removes her safety net. The resolution is earned through endurance ("walking barefoot"), though the inciting force is accidental rather than a result of direct agency.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the conceptual stakes (survival, famine) are high, the scene lacks immediate active opposition or escalation. The protagonist faces no on-page antagonist or genuine risk of failure; the process is smooth and procedural rather than conflicted.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake (capturing the sound) is clear, but the "cellular division" clock functions more as atmospheric texture than an obstacle forcing a hard choice on the page. The protagonist faces the difficulty of the task, but the opposition is largely abstract; the "crack" happens because the ritual is complete, not because she overcame a specific resistance in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent for the protagonist, who faces no opposition, risk of discovery, or chance of failure. The stakes are entirely external (the travelers' happiness) and are resolved through coincidence and magical capability rather than the protagonist having to navigate a tightening set of options or sacrifices.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the environment (melting ice) cooperates with the protagonist, and the task proceeds without failure or external opposition. There is no moment where the protagonist is forced to trade one value for another; she achieves her goal of "abandonment" smoothly, leaving the stakes theoretical rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are declared but lack immediate on-page pressure; there is no active opposition in the scene (guards, time locks, physical hazards), only the traversal of a hallway. The conflict is primarily internal but resolves quickly into "trembling certainty" without a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt. The climax is a low-resistance action (threading a reel) rather than a test of the protagonist's skills.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.0)
    Escalation is subtle and internal, fitting the accumulative lens, but the "hush" negates the storm's external pressure, leaving the stakes feeling abstract. The cost is poetic (vanishing) rather than viscerally felt through a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.4)
    The conflict is internal and low-pressure, fitting the meditative mode. The escalation is handled through the accretion of loops, but the stakes remain abstract until the violin melts, providing a necessary, if quiet, physical cost to the realization.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict evaporates the moment the protagonist acts ("The effect was immediate"), removing all tension. The opposing force (mistrust) offers no active resistance, resulting in a scene devoid of escalation or the narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central conflict is clear, but the antagonist (intern) provides weak opposition, retreating immediately upon her refusal. While the stance is heroic, the lack of immediate, dramatized cost or struggle reduces the tension. The victory feels granted by the premise rather than earned through a difficult trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes remain abstract; the opposition is off-page academic dismissal rather than immediate danger. The climax resolves via a "competence porn" beat—a single instinctive adjustment fixes the time fracture—stripping the moment of tension or necessary sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=4.2)
    Pressure is virtually absent. There is no antagonist, no ticking clock (the lantern dying happens after the climax), and no risk of failure. The ghost's immediate cooperation removes tension, resulting in a scene that feels more like a ritual enactment than a dramatic conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.3)
    The internal conflict is palpable, and the stakes—integrity vs. perfection—are dramatized well through the "smudge." However, the "swallowed truth" remains abstract to the reader; while the *weight* is felt, the lack of specificity about the lie itself softens the narrative bite slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    The internal stakes of guilt and confession are strong and escalate well as she enters the tunnel. However, the resolution of these stakes hinges on the convenient and illogical discovery of the radio, which softens the earned cost of the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=4.8)
    Narrative pressure is minimal, as the keeper faces no external opposition and the internal burden of "witnessing" is theoretical rather than felt. The escalation through the vision is observational, lacking a moment where the character's agency is tested against a significant cost or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=3.4)
    The conflict is abstract (wonder vs. the "loud world") and lacks dramatized, on-page opposition or immediate stakes. The resolution comes from an external event (the eclipse) rather than a tightening of pressure or a difficult trade-off made by the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are high conceptually (existential reality) but low sensationally; the protagonist faces no immediate opposition, time pressure, or physical obstacle in the scene. The "pressure" is atmospheric rather than causal, resulting in a smooth investigative process devoid of friction or difficult trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=3.6)
    Stakes are abstract; there is no active opposition or risk of failure to generate narrative pressure. The accumulation of successful fortunes builds a pattern, but the final integration of the stranger resolves a tension that was never established as a problem.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are high (existential annihilation) but remain somewhat theoretical until the climax. The antagonist's defeat—confused by a rhetorical trap—lowers the felt pressure, though the conceptual cost of the "unraveled stillness" is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are primarily internal and thematic until the climax externalizes the pressure through the cracking lake. The protagonist's decision to push past the established limit ("before exhaustion hits") creates a clear moment of agency that earns the final resonant shift.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the stakes of "recursion" vs. "integration" are clear, they remain abstract and lack immediate, visceral cost. The resolution comes too easily; the protagonist speaks her fears and the obstacles immediately yield, missing the friction of a "felt cost" required for higher bands. The external environment reacts, but the internal price is stated rather than paid.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.4)
    The internal conflict (numbness vs. feeling) drives the external action (the experiment), creating clear stakes. The climax forces a visible rupture in the room's tension, earning the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are clear (integrity vs. erasure), and the internal pressure to act is well-rendered. However, the external antagonist remains abstract ("unseen tension," "static"), reducing the immediate scenic pressure compared to a tangible threat.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=5.6)
    Stakes are low because the protagonist faces no opposition to her goal; she intends to grieve and does so without complication. The "cost" is merely the act of weeping itself, which she sought, resulting in a scene that lacks the friction of competing desires or unforeseen consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=3.0)
    Stakes are declared but never tested; the protagonist faces no opposition, and the village capitulates immediately to her monologue. The total absence of resistance, trade-offs, or failed attempts renders the "impossible choice" theoretical rather than dramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.2)
    Under an Accumulative lens, the escalation works by deepening the sensory connection, culminating in the child's arrival. However, the pressure feels low; the "chronic hush" offers no active resistance, and Lira's success in "unbinding" feels guaranteed from the start, lacking the tension of potential failure.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes are high (total ruin of her trade), but the conflict is entirely internal and resolved with relative ease. The lack of an antagonist or immediate external pressure makes the escalation feel like a smooth procedure rather than a struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=3.5)
    The protagonist faces no external opposition, risk of detection, or possibility of failure; the plan executes perfectly without forcing a trade-off. The conflict is purely thematic, lacking the "meaningful tightening" or cost required to drive a narrative arc at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.4)
    While the emotional stakes (loneliness vs. belonging) are clear, the narrative lacks escalating pressure or genuine risk. The search for Vesper faces no setbacks, and the "elusive" artist welcomes her immediately, deflating the potential tension of the quest.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.7)
    The central conflict (racing against the giant's waking) provides coherent pressure, and the "chime" complication raises the stakes nicely. However, the cost of the magic (fatigue, clarity) feels somewhat abstract, and the resolution's lack of negative consequence for the giant's stirring softens the final impact.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no external opposition or internal dilemma that forces a difficult choice. The escalation consists of performing a ritual that succeeds immediately, lacking the tension of potential failure or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are purely internal, and the external world offers no resistance; the "unexpected outage" provides mood rather than forcing a hard tactical choice. The escalation is gentle, lacking a moment where the protagonist's goal is genuinely imperiled or where she must pay a visible price for connection.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=3.8)
    Escalation is dampened by the abandonment of the financial stakes introduced early. The resolution offers a "gift" of magic rather than exacting a visible price; the protagonist gains enlightenment without paying a dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.2)
    The stakes (sanity vs. artistic capture) are clear and escalate naturally through the seventeen sleepless nights. The cost is legible on the page—sacrificing her best work and favorite tool—which validates the resolution as an earned exchange rather than a magical fix.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.8)
    Tension builds effectively through the environmental response, but the climax deflates rather than peaks when the pilgrim reveals the forces are benevolent ("not here to harm us"). This lowers the cost of the encounter; the protagonist merely accepts a truth she created, with no tangible sacrifice or difficult trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=1.8)
    There is virtually no conflict; the fisherfolk trust her immediately, the council agrees without debate, and the "absences" are easily mapped. The lack of opposition—internal, interpersonal, or environmental—means the stakes are declared but never tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.5)
    The stakes are defined (finding truth vs. living in lies), but the protagonist’s journey lacks sufficient resistance. Elira faces her doubts and "did not flinch," turning potential obstacles into mere scenery on a smooth path to the climax. The deepening is present, but the lack of difficult, active choices during the descent lowers the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.0)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the "war" between skepticism and sensation is asserted in a single sentence but not felt in the action. There is no visible cost to the transcription, nor any risk of failure, resulting in a low-pressure narrative that observes rather than struggles.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the stakes are high in concept (eternal ennui vs. finality), the on-page pressure is low because the external forces (storm, amulet) cooperate perfectly with the protagonist's desires. The "spatial mutiny" functions as spectacle rather than an obstacle that forces a difficult tactical trade-off or adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is negligible; the magic ink acts as a "win button" that instantly dissolves the contract's legal traps and the mortician's potential opposition. There is no escalation or pushback; the protagonist faces no moment where their goal is genuinely at risk.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.0)
    Pressure builds coherently from the internal discovery of the “foreign” history to the external return of the town. The stakes of artistic ownership versus connection are clear, and the final choice creates a visible cost (the surrender of the notebook).

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.7)
    Pressure is largely environmental (tides) and philosophical (erasure) rather than immediate or interpersonal. While the accumulative lens allows for this, the lack of an antagonist or a sharp, forcing choice leaves the stakes feeling abstract and the tension low.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.6)
    The stakes are clearly defined as a battle between the need for answers and the reality of loss. The escalation is handled well via the "ephemeral compass" acting as a pressure gauge. The cost is legible—both in the destruction of the sacred objects and the painful emotional realization.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is societal and abstract (gentrification vs. memory) rather than immediate and personal; the antagonist (corporate scouts) is a generalized force rather than a specific presence in a scene. The escalation is summarized ("Corporate scouts arrive," "When the final contract is due") rather than experienced through rising tension in a specific interaction. The stakes are stated but not felt through immediate risk.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.5)
    Pressure is generated by the clock (05:00), which works for a vignette, but the stakes remain abstract and purely emotional. There is no active opposition or difficult trade-off; the "cost" is a philosophical weight rather than a concrete sacrifice. The conflict is against entropy, which is noble but lacks dramatic friction on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are declared (the orchids will wilt) but never visceral; Elara’s "magnetic calm" deflates tension rather than managing it. The deadline (ship leaving) exists but does not force a compromise (e.g., speed vs. quality), resulting in a low-pressure narrative where the protagonist’s victory feels preordained.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no significant obstruction, antagonist, or internal error, making the "cost" of the discovery abstract. The stakes are intellectual rather than visceral, and the ritual proceeds without escalation or risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake (restoring the town) is clear, but the opposition is passive entropy rather than active resistance. The protagonist encounters no significant obstacles; her success feels inevitable from the first step. The tightening comes from the pacing of the ritual rather than escalating narrative pressure or risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure is excellent, with the oxygen gauge and "instinct to flee" creating a tangible clock that escalates the stakes effectively. The choice to "override instinct" is a high-stakes decision that drives the climax, providing a strong causal anchor for the final release.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—vindication of a legacy of truth—is clear and high, escalating well as the ghosts appear. However, the exact nature of the external threat (the search party finding bodies vs. finding him) wavers, softening the precision of the pressure in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=2.8)
    There is no meaningful escalation or obstacle; the ghost appears and hands over the solution without hesitation or conflict. The scene lacks a moment of doubt, refusal, or high-stakes trade-off to generate narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes remain theoretical as the protagonist faces no active opposition, risk of failure, or necessary trade-off; the scene plays out as a demonstration of ability rather than a conflict with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent as the environment actively assists the protagonist ("roots curled... not to hinder, but to steady"), removing the necessary friction or opposition to make the resolution feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is no active on-page opposition or escalation; the "mission" to encode the widow's words proceeds without obstacle, time pressure, or risk of failure. The stakes are declared in the narration ("adult longing," "gravity of communication") but are never tested by a concrete threat or a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are theoretically high but lack on-page pressure; the antagonists are dismissed easily ("laughing"), and the protagonist's total control prevents any genuine escalation or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.2)
    While the internal stake (regret) is clear, the external pressure is gentle and cooperative; the environment ultimately assists rather than forces difficult trade-offs. The resolution involves releasing the letters and changing a word, which, while symbolic, lacks a visceral sense of sacrifice or risk on the page. The conflict dissolves rather than snapping shut through a hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is purely internal and resolves with minimal resistance; the transition from grief to kinship feels unearned because the "anesthetic" frame softens all edges. There is no palpable cost to the epiphany; it arrives via a ritualistic interaction that feels smooth rather than fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=5.4)
    Pressure is low throughout; the environment, the elders, and the physics all cooperate without generating meaningful obstacles. The stakes remain internal and theoretical, resulting in a climax that feels more like a demonstration than a hard-won victory.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are primarily abstract (curiosity, perception) and the external resistance is low; the garden yields quickly to the protagonist's first alternate attempt. The emotional cost ("terror") is experienced as a reaction to success rather than a pressure forcing a difficult decision.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.1)
    While the conceptual stakes (cognitive freedom) are high, the on-page conflict is minimal; Dr. Vex, the primary obstacle, becomes an ally almost immediately, removing the immediate threat. The tension evaporates after the midpoint, replaced by a low-stakes success montage where drones are easily fooled and the revolution is guaranteed rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.1)
    Pressure is largely atmospheric and historical rather than immediate; the protagonist faces no active opposition in the scene. The resolution—singing a new song after receiving permission—lacks a trade-off or felt cost in the moment, as the "centuries of longing" are a pre-paid backstory price rather than a sacrifice made on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake of preservation is clear, but the on-page pressure is low; the wind arrives "reliably" and the ritual succeeds without obstacle. The conflict is primarily thematic and historical (referencing past failures) rather than an immediate, escalated threat that forces a difficult choice in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.0)
    Global stakes are well-defined, but the immediate pressure is dampened by weak opposition; the curator offers only token resistance. The climax lacks a moment of tangible near-failure to validate the "shattering truth" danger.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are declared (starving villages) but not felt as immediate pressure within the scene. The conflict is resolved through a "magical" realization (humming) without significant obstacles, trade-offs, or visible cost to the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict and stakes are low; the narrative lacks significant obstacles or resistance. Once the meteorite is found, the path to success is linear and unobstructed, with the "cost" of stopping her self-reinvention feeling abstract and relatively painless on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.0)
    The internal conflict between the need for answers and the fear of the void is clear. The stakes—anchoring reality itself—are high but remain somewhat abstract until the final moment. The escalation relies more on a sequence of revelations than increasing pressure, though the final choice to step off the terrace provides a decisive release.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is minimal; the environment presents no active resistance, and the protagonist faces no dilemma that forces a sacrifice. The "tightening" is purely observational, lacking the friction or deepening stakes required to drive a compelling narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=4.9)
    Stakes are abstract and the pressure is low; there is no antagonist or tangible obstacle resisting the protagonist's goal. The central mystery is resolved instantly upon touching the glass, lacking the escalation or "tightening" required to make the final realization feel like a hard-won victory.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=4.8)
    The story lacks meaningful opposition or escalation; Elias’s "orchestration" meets no resistance from the environment or the audience. The transformations of the onlookers occur instantly and completely, devoid of the friction or doubt that would generate genuine narrative tension or earn the final resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.5)
    The conflict is largely theoretical; while the "Ban" acts as a backdrop, there is no immediate antagonist or specific threat applying pressure on the page. The stakes are internalized as physical exertion, and the tension dissolves instantly upon the villagers' benign arrival, removing the potential for a higher-stakes confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=2.8)
    Stakes are virtually non-existent; the protagonist faces no opposition, risk of failure, or pressure to change. The "shift" of dawn is an environmental inevitability, not an antagonist that forces a hard choice or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=3.8)
    There is no active opposition or escalation; the character faces no difficult choice or trade-off in the present moment. The "conflict" is entirely internal and resolved through a pre-planned ritual, lacking a visible cost or a moment where the outcome is in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.0)
    The stakes are high in concept (the multiverse) but low in dramatic tension; the protagonist faces no personal risk or antagonist. The escalation is procedural—launching balloons until one works—lacking a "do or die" pressure or a moment where the dreamer must sacrifice something personal to succeed.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=4.8)
    There is virtually no external pressure or antagonist; the character faces no threat, time limit, or concrete obstacle. The conflict is purely thematic, resulting in a low-stakes progression that relies on sentiment rather than genuine narrative risk.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=4.0)
    Stakes remain abstract, as the "reluctant" mirrors yield quickly to the painter's skill with no significant pushback or escalation of risk. The absence of a tangible antagonist or an internal dilemma results in a flat tension curve where success feels inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is virtually absent on the page; the antagonists arrive and sign without dialogue, hesitation, or resistance. The "forever war" implies high stakes, but the scene itself is a smooth procession without obstacles, escalation, or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.2)
    Pressure is low; the ritual proceeds exactly as planned without external opposition or unforeseen complications. While the internal desire is clear, the lack of a "tightening" beat where success is jeopardized or a new price is demanded makes the victory feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are abstract (silence vs. resonance) and the opposition ("The Court of Velvet Whispers") is off-screen. The climax lacks pressure; the "resistance" of the final knot is overcome instantly by a whisper, and the protagonist pays no visible price for her victory.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes—integrity and a relationship—are clear, though the conflict remains largely intellectual and retrospective until the final decision. The cost of the resolution (risking Mira's rejection of the "blood and honey" show) is acknowledged but feels conceptual rather than viscerally paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are high conceptually (erasure of history) but low practically; there is no immediate opposition to her goal. The escalation is purely textural—the building of the shrine—and lacks a moment where the outcome is genuinely in doubt or where a difficult trade-off is required.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.2)
    Tension is largely internal and process-driven, which fits the meditative tone. The stakes of "preservation" are felt, though the lack of external pressure or a concrete obstacle beyond the craft itself limits the dramatic dynamism.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=4.2)
    Tension is undermined when the narrative explicitly dismisses the primary source of pressure ("The storm wasn't a threat—it was punctuation"). The stakes remain philosophical and abstract, resolved without a meaningful tightening of options or a forced trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes remain largely internal and intellectual; the success of the ritual feels guaranteed by the protagonist's competence. While the "hum" provides a cadence shift, there is no moment of doubt, distinct deepening of danger, or active opposition on the page to ratchet up the pressure. The cost paid is primarily historical (backstory) rather than immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are clearly internal (sanity vs. resentment), and the broken pin provides a functional escalation point that forces a change in tactics. However, the lack of external opposition or immediate consequence reduces the tension; the resolution feels inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=4.8)
    Tension is severely undercut by the compliance of the antagonist; the dream "descended, not in fear, but in curiosity" and "did not resist." Without opposition or a moment where the plan nearly fails, there is no escalation of pressure. The protagonist succeeds largely because the magic allows it, not because she overcomes a distinct obstacle in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.3)
    The stakes are intimate and clearly escalated when the mender discovers the specific, hurtful vow ("I will never understand you"). This raises the pressure from general maintenance to a personal confrontation with rejection. The resolution feels earned by her persistence, though the daughter's off-page return relies slightly on coincidence/magic.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are primarily intellectual and philosophical, centered on the struggle to understand inheritance. While the internal pressure is legible, the external opposition is abstract ("Archival silence"), which limits visceral tension. The cost—loss of a singular self-identity—is conceptually strong but paid largely in reflection rather than painful choice.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes are established (reality unraveling), but the tension deflates quickly upon the "renegotiation." The antagonist is a misunderstanding; once Elira places the diary, the threat resolves instantly with the chrono-core harmonizing. The cost of her staying is stated by Kael rather than felt through a difficult choice Elira makes under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.3)
    Internal stakes are clear, but external pressure is low; the ship is atmospheric rather than antagonistic. The resolution of the central conflict relies on a swift internal decision without a palpable escalation of risk or sacrifice immediately preceding it.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are purely abstract ("meaning," "silence") and the protagonist faces no active opposition or risk of failure. The escalation is flat; she climbs, she sees, she fixes, she leaves, resulting in a vignette that lacks dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.5)
    Tension is significantly dampened because the antagonists "paid her no mind," removing immediate physical threat or urgency. The conflict remains abstract—restoring order to chaos—rather than visceral, as Ripple-mark executes a repair task without active opposition. Without a risk of failure or a visible cost to the protagonist, the stakes feel low despite the chaotic description.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes remain abstract and philosophical; while the risk of "collapse" is mentioned, the on-page pressure feels low. The protagonist faces no active opposition or difficult trade-off, resulting in a victory that feels inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story fits the Accumulative lens with a deepening of focus from the Sky-Singers to the archivist herself. However, the stakes remain abstract and the tension is severely dampened by the predictable, repetitive syntactic rhythm that makes every beat feel identical in weight.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake (hopelessness/gravity) is clear, but the conflict remains largely atmospheric. Lira encounters no significant resistance—either from the environment or herself—that jeopardizes her success, making the escalation feel linear rather than pressurized. The cost (physical exertion and the rag) is present but low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.9)
    The central conflict resolves with minimal resistance; the companion's immediate acceptance ("I know") reduces the felt cost of the protagonist's choice. The stakes of the "difficult conversation" dissolve rather than tightening into a hard tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.3)
    The ticking clock of the gravity inversion provides effective pressure, but the stakes dissolve at the climax when the physical threat (falling) is negated by the magical ending. The lack of a true confrontation or sacrifice limits the impact of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.0)
    Conflict is low-stakes and internal to the secondary character, resolved by the environment rather than the protagonist's struggle. The operator faces no significant opposition or pressure until the final cliffhanger, making the escalation feel flat.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.8)
    External pressure is nominal; the deadline (sunrise) compels movement but forces no difficult trade-offs. The protagonist bypasses every barrier on the first attempt using the ruby flake, resulting in a lack of genuine escalation or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=4.2)
    There is virtually no conflict or resistance; the environment yields instantly to the protagonist's will ("groaned, not in protest, but recognition"). Without an opposing force or the possibility of failure, there is no escalation, only a linear procession toward a foregone conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.5)
    External pressure is minimal, and the internal conflict dissolves at the climax where Elara &quot;didn't resist,&quot; removing the necessity for a difficult choice. The stakes remain largely theoretical (healing trauma) rather than tactical, resulting in a smooth ride to enlightenment without visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=4.6)
    Escalation is primarily internal and anticipatory, lacking external friction. The stakes evaporate immediately upon the revelation without forcing a difficult choice or extracting a visible price; the transition to "restoration" feels like a net gain with no sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=3.6)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the knight faces no active opposition, as the vines curl "to balance" rather than bind and the environment aids him at every step. The "unsnapping" of joints is framed as ecstatic liberation rather than a painful trade-off, neutralizing the potential for felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=5.0)
    The dominant stake—how to handle the files—is present, but the conflict lacks genuine pressure or risk. The supervisor's skepticism is introduced and dismissed in a single exchange without consequence. The protagonist's choice to change her method incurs no cost—relational, professional, or emotional—resulting in a resolution that feels unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=4.2)
    Tension is severely undercut by the lack of opposition; Elira encounters an unlocked door, her hands "never shake," and she faces no active antagonist until the deed is done. The absence of a moment where she must choose between two damaging options flattens the escalation curve completely.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.5)
    The conflict is present (musician vs. prophecy), with a moment of escalation when the prophecy resists ("gathering behind his ribs"). However, the resolution feels relatively low-resistance; the protagonist simply shifts his embouchure and plays softer to win. The stakes are high but abstract, lacking a visceral sense of immediate danger beyond "coldness."

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes remain abstract and low-pressure; Elira encounters no significant opposition, failure, or time pressure. The resolution feels like a magical reward for competence rather than a hard-won victory requiring sacrifice or a difficult tactical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.3)
    The conflict is primarily internal and philosophical, lacking visceral external pressure or an antagonist. The stakes—changing one's mind about order—are low, and the resolution comes without a significant sacrifice; tossing a broken watch is a symbolic gesture rather than a painful trade-off necessary to survive or succeed.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes are clearly defined (redemption vs. guilt) and the destruction of the "verified" artifact establishes a real price for the protagonist's transformation. The escalation is linear but functional, tightening as the ritual demands more personal vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are present—the peace of the souls—but the protagonist faces no active opposition or possibility of failure. The conflict is static (grief exists) versus active (ritual performed), lacking the escalation or trade-offs required for higher tension.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.5)
    Conflict is largely internal and memory-based, with the environment acting more as a benevolent guide than a source of active resistance, which lowers the immediate tension. The cost—surrendering the strap—is legible, but the "enemy" (the memories) feels conquered before the scene begins.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes are abstract and the conflict is low-pressure; the protagonist faces no active opposition, and the solution (the lens) works without complication. The resolution is earned through a magical object rather than a difficult choice or renunciation, and the "price" paid does not alter the protagonist's capability or emotional state in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.0)
    Tension escalates appropriately through discovery, culminating in the manifestation of the ghost. However, the stakes remain low and largely internal; the protagonist faces no active opposition or dilemma, making the conflict feel more like a procedural unraveling than a struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are high and the cost (the permanent ruin of the library’s perfection) is legible. While the external pressure is well-rendered, the protagonist’s lack of internal hesitation or struggle with the destruction makes the victory feel slightly inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.0)
    Conflict is low; the "archaeological dispute" is background noise rather than active pressure. The primary antagonist is abstract (time/obsolescence), and the potential conflict with the academic establishment evaporates instantly when Voss arrives as a collaborator rather than an adversary.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.6)
    The stakes are clearly established with the encroaching midnight, but the antagonist (shadows with teeth) feels generic and is dispelled too easily ("harmless and hollow"). The internal conflict of facing one's own dishonesty is far more effective than the external threat.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake is internal/philosophical, but there is very little resistance or "pressure" on the page. Elira enters, performs a ritual, and chooses to stay without facing meaningful external opposition or a difficult trade-off; the fence is easily bypassed, and the cave is welcoming. The lack of friction flattens the climax into a moment of inevitability rather than an earned triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes remain abstract and low; the "critics" are distant, and the storm pauses conveniently for her artistic epiphany. The protagonist achieves her goal without paying a visible or felt cost; the wood yields easily, and the resolution comes through immediate inspiration rather than struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=3.2)
    The stakes are purely intellectual and aesthetic, with no tangible opposition or risk of failure. The trajectory is linear (curiosity → travel → discovery → creation) without escalation; the "conflict" is resolved simply by looking closely, resulting in a low-tension procedural.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=4.5)
    Conflict is conceptual (archivist vs. silence) and the escalation is told in summary ("She had tried alone first... but the lagoon remained mute") rather than shown. We do not feel the resistance of the lock or the risk of the parley because the struggle is narrated from a distance. The stakes are high, but the lack of scenic tension flattens the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.0)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no active opposition (internal doubt or external resistance), making the town's revival feel inevitable rather than earned through difficult choices or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the thematic stakes (preservation vs. sterilization) are clear, the immediate conflict is low-pressure; there is no active force opposing Elira in the scene. The "sterilization" of the city is a passive background condition rather than an urgent antagonist, resulting in a climax that feels like a task completed rather than a battle won.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are conceptually high (entropy/future) but the on-page obstacles are minimal. Elara faces no external opposition and no internal doubt ("She knew what she had to do"), resulting in a lack of tension. The climax resolves with "grace" and "consent" rather than a test of agency or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are theoretically high (preventing panic) but operationally low; the protagonist remains in total control throughout. The conflict is strictly external (waiting for nature), and the &quot;cost&quot; is merely patience, missing a sharper trade-off or risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.2)
    Escalation is virtually absent; the janitor desires to see stillness, and the universe provides a perfect example of it without resistance. There is no on-page friction, trade-off, or rising pressure to force a crystallization of stance—only confirmation of what he already believes.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are abstract and thematic ("oblivion," "silence") rather than urgent or visceral on the page. Because the protagonist's stance is one of static endurance from the first line, there is little escalation or pressure testing her resolve; the ending confirms the status quo rather than forcing a new cost or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is negligible; Lira and Vey have aligned goals, and the capsule opens with minimal effort, removing potential for tension. There are no reversals or moments where failure feels possible, resulting in low narrative pressure. The stakes remain abstract (understanding time) and are resolved through cooperation rather than the "meaningful tightening" required for high-band scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is minimal; the "snapped string" is a minor inconvenience instantly resolved by Elira's competence. There is no meaningful opposition or escalation; the protagonist pays no price (she keeps the feather, the kite flies), resulting in a lack of felt cost or high-stakes pressure required for higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.2)
    Active conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no resistance from his medium, his illness, or his emotions, turning the plot into a smooth procession. The sparrow scene offers a minor beat, but there are no high-stakes choices that force a trade-off or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.7)
    Pressure is consistent under the situational lens, though the conflict remains abstract; the "data refusal" works as a turning point, but external stakes are low.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.4)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist meets no active resistance or unforeseen complication, resulting in a static pressure level. The stakes are thematic rather than visceral, with no acute cost paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=3.8)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no opposition, time pressure, or significant obstacle, and the journey is resolved via summary without on-page cost. The stakes remain abstract and thematic ("grief or guilt") rather than generating urgent, concrete pressure in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.2)
    Pressure is abstract and conflict is purely internal; there is no tangible opposition or constraint forcing a hard trade-off. The character sketches without risk or obstruction, resulting in a scene that feels safe despite the apocalyptic context.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is a near-total absence of narrative tension; the protagonist climbs, enters, and succeeds without facing active opposition or paying a visible price. The stakes are declared ("world tilted askew") but never felt, as the execution of the plan proceeds with perfect fluidity.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.8)
    Escalation is primarily atmospheric until the arrival of the Sovereign; the middle beats lack urgent pressure or narrowing options. The climax successfully crystallizes the conflict, but the lack of active opposition earlier makes the tension feel somewhat theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake (belonging) is established early, and the ritual provides a clear vector for escalation. However, the conflict is largely internal and overcome with relative ease through the magic system; the "obsidian wind" of memory is mentioned as a cost but "welcomed" without a visceral on-page struggle or moment of doubt, softening the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.2)
    Pressure is low because the environment cooperates too readily; the labyrinth "softens" and "warms" instead of resisting, removing the possibility of failure. There is no tangible cost paid for the resolution; the protagonist simply proceeds through the layout to a guaranteed epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation is clear, moving from a routine session to a high-stakes personal sacrifice. The cost is legible—the artist must abandon her role as observer/refractor of others and expose her own raw vulnerability. The antagonist (the spire) is somewhat passive, functioning more as a lock to be picked than an active opposing force.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=5.7)
    Stakes are high (survival vs. oblivion), but the resolution lacks a felt cost; the protagonist gains both healing and safety without a visible trade-off or sacrifice. The "price" paid (narrating wounds) feels therapeutic rather than costly, removing the tension of the dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.9)
    Internal stakes are legible and escalated by the physical constraint of the tide and the mental exhaustion of the act. The cost is paid on the page through the abandonment of the shell, satisfying the requirement for a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is no meaningful escalation or tightening of the screw; the threat (ships circling) is static until resolved by the protagonist's magical intervention. The protagonist faces no obstacles in executing her plan, and the antagonist (the sea/captains) presents no adaptive resistance. The stakes are declared but never truly tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are conceptual ("navigation of loss") and lack immediate urgency or opposition within the frame of the story. There is no on-page escalation; the narrative describes an established equilibrium without introducing a new threat or obstacle that forces the protagonist to adapt her tactics *now*.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.0)
    The encounter with the survivors provides clear external pressure, and the choice to "occlude" serves as a functional tightening of the stakes. However, the resolution dissolves the tension too easily; the cost of losing the relic is framed as emotional relief rather than a felt price, reducing the impact of the sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.7)
    The conflict is largely internal and lacks significant external opposition or risk of failure; the mystery resolves itself via the protagonist's supernatural talent rather than struggle. While the emotional deepening is present, the low stakes limit the narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=2.8)
    The protagonist faces no active opposition, difficult trade-offs, or genuine risks; he merely walks downstairs and steps through a door to receive his heart's desire. The stakes are declared in exposition but never tested by failure or sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are clear, but the central conflict is resolved somewhat passively; the queen climbs and listens to a lecture rather than facing a difficult active choice in the grotto. The antagonist (her past) is explained to her rather than battled.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.9)
    Tension collapses immediately upon the inciting incident; Elias confesses a major betrayal, and the protagonist offers instant absolution without resistance or cost. The lack of an "earned reversal" or hesitation deflates the stakes of the lab fire.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.3)
    The external obstacle—the scroll resisting the ink—effectively physicalizes the internal struggle. However, the pivot to overcoming this resistance feels slightly rushed; the decision to "write about the jealousy" dissolves the obstacle too easily. The "hunting" sequence that follows lacks resistance, reading more as a list of victories than a rising struggle, though the final cost (the filled scroll, the persistent grave) is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes are personal and internal, centering on Elara’s sense of fraudulence. The conflict is low-key, resolved primarily through dialogue and reframing rather than rising action or difficult choices. The cost is understood (letting go of the old identity) but the pressure feels gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake (transforming shame) is signaled early and tested through the physical obstacle of the freezing ink. The escalation is intimate but felt, forcing a trade-off where Elira must abandon scholarly control for childish superstition. The cost is visible in the persistence of the scars—an Earned Stasis that feels honest rather than magical erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are intimate but clearly defined; the risk of permanent silence between the characters drives the scene. The escalation from the ignored apology to the forced sensory connection works well. The resolution—accepting the "sour notes" of their history—feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are theoretically high (cosmic reality), but the lack of opposition drains tension; the library and universe are compliant participants in her ritual. The escalation is textural (visual effects, shuddering) rather than an intensification of difficulty or danger. Without resistance or a moment of doubt, the victory feels inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.0)
    Conflict is largely abstract and philosophical, pitted against "standard time" rather than immediate opposition. While the machine's mechanical resistance offers some textural pressure, the lack of a concrete antagonist or high-stakes risk keeps the tension low.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are internal but externalized effectively through the risk of "collapse." The pressure is coherent and builds through proximity, though the lack of active opposition from the "stranger" keeps the conflict somewhat unilateral.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are largely conceptual (meaning vs. entropy) rather than immediate, but the connection with the father provides a necessary emotional anchor. The "reply" from the stranger and the father’s "clover" response effectively reconfigure the protagonist's isolation, though the cost paid is more internal than visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.6)
    Conflict remains at a low simmer for most of the narrative, relying on the intrigue of the vignettes rather than active opposition. The arrival of the "self" caller provides the necessary escalation, but the operator’s immediate acceptance of her fate limits the dramatic voltage of the climax; the stakes are high (existence) but the resistance is low.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=3.5)
    The story lacks narrative pressure or escalation; the stakes are abstract and thematic ("memory became artifact") rather than immediate and felt. The sequence of events is a list of reflections without increasing tension or a moment where the protagonist's values are tested against a cost.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.2)
    The stakes are thematic (loneliness) but lack visceral on-page resistance; every character, including the climactic stranger, cooperates immediately with the premise. The conflict is low-pressure and largely internal/abstract, resolved through a gentle exchange rather than a difficult choice or sacrifice. The story glides rather than struggles toward its conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are asserted ("swallowed travelers whole") but never felt as a proximate danger; the protagonist faces no active opposition or risk of failure. The "test" of memories is summarized rather than dramatized, resulting in a low-pressure narrative where success feels inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=3.9)
    Escalation is virtually absent; the character encounters no obstacles, opposition, or risk of failure once the scene begins. The magical editing process works perfectly on the first attempt, dissolving potential tension into a series of gentle, unresisted corrections.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the protagonist faces no resistance from the environment, the "teaching" meets no obstacles, and the stakes remain philosophical ("beauty not archived") rather than viscerally felt or dramatized through risk.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the archive actively cooperates with the protagonist, removing any immediate stakes or pressure. The text explicitly dismisses opposition ("No guards. No traps"), leaving only the abstract, off-stage tension of the "world above." Without a credible possibility of failure or a concrete antagonist (even environmental), the climax feels like a foregone conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=5.5)
    Escalation is linear and lacks genuine opposition; the "suffocating" voices transform into helpful "collaborators" the moment she decides to drum. The conflict dissipates instantly upon engagement, removing the pressure necessary for a high-stakes climax.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are established (corruption vs. justice), but the pressure on the protagonist is low. Lena observes and executes a plan from the shadows without facing significant opposition or being forced to sacrifice something of value; the victory feels inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.4)
    Narrative pressure is low; the "darkness" is a passive observer, and the guardian faces no risk of failure or significant cost during the ritual. The success feels inevitable from the start.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.1)
    The story establishes stakes (dormant minds) but provides no concrete opposition; the "standardized tests" and "adults" are abstract concepts that never push back on the page. Elira faces no hurdles, legal trouble, or failure of the magic, resulting in a wish-fulfillment arc lacking the tension or cost required for higher engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake is internal unhappiness, but the conflict is resolved by a magical "summons" that removes the need for a difficult decision. There is no tangible opposition or escalation; the "cost" (the dissolving scrimshaw) is a gift of liberation rather than a painful trade-off, lowering the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    The central conflict is clear and the stakes are palpable, but the climax—the officer accepting the box without suspicion—offers little resistance, slightly deflating the tension. The resolution relies more on the satire of the bureaucracy than a difficult on-page struggle, though the internal cost remains high.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=2.5)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent as the external antagonist (the ban/guardians) has vanished prior to the scene, and the environment explicitly welcomes the protagonist. There is no escalation of pressure, no trade-off, and no felt cost; the story acts as a victory lap rather than a dramatic engagement with risk.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are quiet but distinct—the salvage of spirit in a ruined place. The escalation from a hum to dew to physical growth provides a satisfying, coherent pressure gradient. The cost is subtle—Elias surrendering the reed and agency to the plants—but felt.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=3.6)
    Stakes remain abstract and philosophical, lacking immediate consequence or risk of failure within the scene. The escalation is purely textural (increasing volume and resonance) rather than a tightening of options; there is no opposition to force a trade-off or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is virtually no conflict; the universe (the observatory) aligns perfectly with the protagonist's desires, removing the possibility of failure or doubt. The stakes remain abstract because the magical feedback loop guarantees connection, negating the risk inherent in her art.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=4.9)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the protagonist faces no opposition, time pressure, or risk of failure in her mapping. The escalation is purely informational—she observes, synthesizes, and is confirmed by a stranger—leaving the stakes feeling abstract and the victory inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are clearly signaled early and escalate through the interaction with the pagoda. The pressure is coherent: the machine demands a pattern, and the protagonist must painfully refuse it. The cost is felt physically and emotionally, earning the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.8)
    The thematic stakes are distinct (authentic fear vs. curated euphoria), but the external conflict lacks bite; the "algorithms" offer no resistance to Elira's intrusion. The escalation remains largely intellectual and observational, resulting in low immediate tension.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes (integrity vs. compassion) are clearly braided, but the conflict remains entirely internal without an external pressure forcing the timeline. The resolution—opening a new sanctuary—feels like a "have your cake and eat it too" solution that minimizes the cost of the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.2)
    Escalation is the story's weakest link; there is almost no active resistance or external pressure. The roots part willingly, the tunnel opens by invitation, and the hourglass waits for her permission, removing time pressure. The final choice to absorb the seed feels inevitable rather than a hard-won victory over genuine opposition or conflicting needs.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.6)
    Internal pressure is legible, with the protagonist physically feeling the "weight" of the grief. However, the external obstacles are minimal, and the cost of the final action (mailing the letters) is relatively low-risk.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.5)
    Escalation relies on volume ("voices grew louder") rather than a shift in the nature of the threat, and the resolution comes without a visible trade-off or moral cost. The conflict remains abstract, pitting a magical solution against a generalized "corporate" malaise without personal stakes for the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the protagonist faces no active opposition, resource scarcity, or risk of failure. The central action (charming the sphere) succeeds instantly with a hum, lacking the escalation or cost required to generate narrative pressure or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.6)
    Conflict is virtually nonexistent. The primary threat (the Edge's unraveling) is nullified by backstory before the climax ("already unraveled"), stripping the final choice of risk, fear, or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=3.0)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the protagonists explicitly avoid engagement ("They did not chase it"), turning the story into a passive vigil. The stakes are purely conceptual ("unused courage") and face no active opposition or risk of failure, resulting in zero narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clearly established: the structural integrity of the fortress versus the human need for expression. The tension escalates well from the internal ritual on the stairs to the external pressure of the grandmother's challenge. The climax—playing the note—carries genuine weight because the cost (potential collapse) has been firmly planted.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=3.8)
    There is a distinct lack of active struggle or escalation; the protagonist's main action is planting the device, after which the story switches to summary until the resolution occurs. The antagonist offers no direct opposition, and the climax relies on a convenient magical reaction ("skin glowed with ancestral sigils") rather than a protagonist's choice under pressure. The stakes are declared but never tested in a moment of doubt or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.9)
    The stakes are intellectual and emotional but lack visceral pressure; the storm surge functions as a delivery mechanism for a clue rather than a genuine threat. The conflict with the AI is resolved too easily ("Digging through archived code"), and the physical dive faces no resistance. The narrative lacks a tightening of options; obstacles are overcome immediately upon presentation.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=4.4)
    The stakes are abstract ("meaning," "purpose") and face no active opposition or concrete obstacle other than inertia. There is no meaningful tightening of pressure; the solution (the hum) arrives externally, removing the need for a difficult trade-off or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.0)
    Tension is minimal as there is no active opposition or risk of failure; the vines help immediately and the amber opens easily. The lack of a "meaningful tightening" or distinct moment where the protagonist could fail flattens the dramatic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict is internal but low-stakes in execution; the protagonist faces no active opposition or difficult trade-off, merely yielding to a realization that arrives as a gift. The resolution lacks a "meaningful tightening" or reversal; the healing process feels linear and inevitable rather than fought for under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central pressure—the walls closing in—is maintained and escalates clearly to a climax. The protagonist's response (stitching reality) creates a coherent struggle against entropy. The resolution fits the "Earned Stasis" or transformation model, though the "price" of this transformation is stated abstractly ("pain was the price of coherence") rather than demonstrated through a difficult trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.9)
    The stakes remain largely intellectual and retrospective for most of the narrative, as the "crisis" is remembered rather than immediate. This lack of external pressure or active antagonism keeps the tension low until the final, self-imposed escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.1)
    Stakes are high (societal collapse), and the cost (arrest/erasure) is paid on the page. However, the opposition is reactive; the guards arrive only after the deed is done, reducing the scene's active tension to a single, unimpeded decision.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.2)
    Conflict is minimal; opposing worldviews (the cynical man) dissolve instantly upon hearing Elara's wisdom, robbing the scene of genuine friction. There is no moment where her pacifism costs her something tangible or forces a difficult trade-off; the world yields too easily to her philosophy.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.5)
    Pressure escalates coherently through the interaction with the feral lullaby, but the protagonist's unwavering competence dampens the tension. The cost—a broken tool—is visible, yet the emotional price remains theoretical ("grief... drowned logic") rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are high in the abstract (murder cover-up), but the scene itself lacks immediate pressure or antagonism; the protagonist faces zero resistance and overcomes no obstacles. The narrative reads as a retrospective victory lap rather than an unfolding conflict where the outcome is in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes are personal and clearly defined, escalating as the machine's "accusation" intensifies. The climax requires a physical cost (blood), satisfying the agency requirement, though the resolution—the father's voice explicitly granting forgiveness—feels a bit too tidy and externally granted.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.2)
    Escalation is present via the intensifying mist and voices, but the stakes remain abstract. The protagonist encounters no significant resistance from the magic or the environment, leading to a resolution that feels like a skilled performance rather than a struggle with consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=5.5)
    Escalation is negligible; the magistrate appears to present a threat but collapses at the first rhetorical push, robbing the "aberrant mercy" of any demonstrated cost or "steel." The stakes are high in the abstract (justice, definitions) but low in the dramatized moment, as victory is achieved without sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.3)
    Conflict is the weakest element; the protagonist faces no active opposition or risk of failure. The "brink of despair" is abstract and easily remedied by her intervention, resulting in a lack of narrative torque or escalating pressure prior to the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.9)
    The conflict is primarily internal and navigated with relative ease; Elira follows the signals and succeeds without encountering a "No" or a cost that forces a hard trade-off. The pressure remains consistent rather than escalating through a distinct turning point that threatens failure.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes are theoretical ("Who remembers us?") rather than visceral; there is no antagonist or pressing cost of failure on the page. The escalation is purely procedural (the leaf warms, she sings, it works) without a moment where the outcome is in genuine jeopardy. Pressure remains low throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are high in the abstract (wars, treaties) but low in the immediate narrative; the protagonist faces no direct antagonist or concrete obstacle that forces a costly trade-off. The conflict is purely thematic—her wisdom against the world's ignorance—resulting in a lack of escalation or genuine risk to her safety or goals.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.7)
    The stakes are high in concept (justice, truth) but low in immediate narrative tension. The conflict is primarily internal and retrospective, lacking an active antagonist or a moment where Elira’s plan is genuinely tested or threatened on the page. The escalation is atmospheric rather than dramatic.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.9)
    The stakes remain low and largely internal, as the coachman’s control is never genuinely threatened by the fog or the passenger’s grief. While the gift of the needle represents a cost, the lack of hesitation or visible struggle in parting with it robs the gesture of dramatic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.1)
    Pressure escalates gently through the "thrum" and the setting sun, but the conflict remains largely abstract and philosophical. While the renunciation of the glass is a valid cost, the lack of active opposition or possibility of failure limits the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=3.8)
    Pressure is virtually absent; there is no antagonist, internal doubt, or environmental obstacle that forces a trade-off or adaptation. The "gasp" from the street provides immediate, uncomplicated validation of the protagonist's effort, removing potential tension. The stakes remain abstract ("seeding of resilience") and are never imperiled.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.4)
    Conflict is abstract (resistance against entropy) and the stakes are low-definition; the threat of the "woodpecker’s coordinates blurring" lacks visceral or immediate consequence on the page. The resolution comes too easily—Veyra simply touches the dial and wills it to work—negating the buildup of the "dying pulse." There is no tangible cost paid for the victory.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes remain abstract and the protagonist faces no opposition or difficult trade-offs. The resolution is granted by a magical object and immediate compliance, resulting in a smooth ascent rather than a dramatic escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.2)
    While the stakes (social fracture) are high, the on-page conflict is low-friction; the antagonist retreats immediately upon resistance. The protagonist faces no difficult tradeoffs, making the victory feel inevitable rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.4)
    The physical pressure of the tunnel provides a tangible "tightening" of stakes. The conflict resolves clearly, though the antagonist (the shifting space) surrenders its threat too easily upon the protagonist's realization, lowering the final tension.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.5)
    The confrontation lacks genuine resistance; the antagonist appears and capitulates immediately with a confession and tears. There is no oscillation of power or escalation of danger, turning the climax into a passive reveal rather than a dramatic struggle. The stakes are high in concept but low in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.7)
    While the stakes of exile are established, the conflict lacks meaningful escalation; the protagonist overcomes the central obstacle immediately upon deciding to act. There is no moment of doubt or external pushback to test her resolve, making the victory feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is purely internal and abstract (“soul,” “regrets”) with almost no external pressure or resistance. The world cooperates too easily—the mountain exhales, the ribbons dance, the ghost forgives—removing the friction necessary for genuine escalation or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=4.0)
    Conflict is recalled in summary rather than experienced in the present; the pressure from investors is mentioned but resolved via symbolic gestures without direct confrontation. Without an on-page antagonist or immediate time constraint, there is no meaningful escalation or tightening of options.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes are theoretically high (cosmic grief) but operationally low; the antagonist (the guardian's burden) offers no active resistance, yielding immediately to the protagonist's song. There is no moment where the protagonist risks failure or pays a visible, irrevocable price for her success on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are legible and pressure escalates clearly through the expanding circles of the seed. While the cost is largely metaphorical ("ribs crack," "layers peeling"), it is felt on the page. The resolution feels slightly inevitable rather than earned through a desperate, narrowing choice.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes are declared ("covenant was swallowed") but never tested on the page by an active antagonist or obstacle. The success of the ritual is never in doubt; the character faces no resistance from the environment or herself, resulting in a flat trajectory with no escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.0)
    Conflict is present but brief and resolved by environmental intervention rather than the protagonist's difficult choice. The "barter" remains theoretical dialogue rather than a tactical trade-off; Elira wins without sacrificing anything or facing a true threat to her worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes are clear (emotional safety vs. vulnerability), but the escalation is internal and somewhat low-friction. The resolution—opening a laptop to start a project—lacks a visceral cost; the "wresting" of meaning happens in thought rather than through a difficult on-page trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict is theoretically present (ambition vs. patience) but operationally absent; the antagonistic force (the spirit's haunting pressure) yields immediately to Elira's actions. There is no escalation of stakes or moment of genuine risk; the protagonist pays no price for her success, keeping the tension flat.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=3.5)
    Pressure is negligible; the protagonist performs a routine task with guaranteed success and no external resistance. There is no meaningful escalation or tightening of options; the "contradictions" are accepted smoothly without a struggle that risks failure.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dramatic pressure is minimal; the protagonist faces no external opposition or risk of failure during the ritual. The escalation relies entirely on the intensity of internal confessions, which, while emotional, do not force a tactical trade-off or visible cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stakes are purely internal, with pressure generated by a self-imposed need for clarity rather than external resistance. While stopping the medication adds a layer of vulnerability, the escalation relies on convenient graffiti discoveries to trigger insights rather than forced tactical shifts. The conflict remains low-voltage as the environment yields to her search without pushing back.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clear and the conceptual cost of the journey is paid in full at the end. The conflict is primarily environmental/internal, lacking acute pressure until the final absorption.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.6)
    While the stakes (empire vs. truth) are high in concept, the on-page conflict is low-voltage because the opposition is negligible. The Chancellor arrives only to be immediately neutralized; the lack of a back-and-forth struggle or a moment of doubt flattens the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict is minimal, as the story presents a master executing a flawless routine rather than a character struggling against opposition. The stakes—while conceptually high (oblivion vs. preservation)—lack immediate narrative pressure, as there is no moment where failure seems possible or options narrow.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=3.8)
    Tension is minimal because the protagonist faces no active opposition, internal wavering, or time pressure; the decision is pre-made ("after forgiving"). Escalation is absent, as the narrative moves from reflection to execution without narrowing options or forcing a painful trade-off or deepening of knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central conflict between professional certainty and personal doubt is sharp and well-staged. The physical resistance of the clasp provides a necessary beat of escalation, though the stakes remain largely internal and the cost (loss of professional armor) is stated rather than deeply felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.0)
    Conflict is minimal; the student is compliant, and the teacher faces no opposition or time pressure. The stakes remain abstract and philosophical ("learning to appear"), lacking an immediate, felt cost or risk of failure within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=3.9)
    Conflict is abstract and located entirely in backstory ("generations had died") rather than in the present scene. There is no immediate pressure, antagonist, or time constraint forcing a crystallization of stance; the skimmer is competent and unchallenged, resulting in a lack of narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.3)
    The stakes are clear (soul vs. automation), but the conflict is low-pressure; the antagonist is a distant system, and the climax involves surrendering a stone to a benevolent entity rather than a difficult trade-off. The cost is conceptual (giving up "grandeur") but the victory feels slightly handed to him.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.9)
    Conflict is minimal; the environment threatens ("swallowing his breath") but offers no actual resistance, and the mystery resolves itself instantly upon finding the ledger. The lack of genuine opposition or the possibility of failure keeps the stakes abstract rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes are conceptually high but lack visceral, on-page cost; the transition from doubt to certainty is too smooth. The conflict resolves through a realization rather than a forced trade-off or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are primarily thematic and internal; the conflict is against abstract "silence" rather than an active opposition, limiting tension. The escalation is linear—naming one monster, then another—without a moment where the outcome feels genuinely in doubt or the cost of failure is imminent.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.2)
    Conflict is the story's weakest element; while the stakes are declared to be high (cosmic imbalance, famine), the on-page pressure is low due to the protagonist's calm certainty. There is no active antagonism or time pressure beyond the sunrise, resulting in a smooth, frictionless progression. The narrative lacks a moment where the outcome feels genuinely in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.9)
    The setup establishes strong stakes (erasure vs. memory), but the climax deflates the tension. The antagonist's arrival—a moment of peak pressure—resolves immediately with their acceptance of Elias's defiance ("They didn’t arrest him"), removing the necessary conflict or sacrifice required to earn the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=4.2)
    The conflict is abstract (equations vs. awe) and lacks an external pressure test or a moment where the protagonist faces failure. The resolution arrives via the convenient appearance of the starlings (a *deus ex machina* moment) which guides her to the solution without requiring her to overcome a resistance. The stakes ("fear of losing herself") are declared but never operationalized in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.3)
    Conflict is largely abstract; while the stakes of "broken trust" are declared, the on-page threat is low and resolved instantly by the protagonist's pre-existing competence. There is no meaningful escalation or tightening of options; the solution is known and executed without resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are theoretical; the threat of the timeline claiming the brain is stated but lacks immediate, visceral danger on the page. The antagonist forces (the judges) are easily overcome by simple silence and a touch, resulting in a lack of escalating tension. The protagonist achieves his goal without facing a dilemma that jeopardizes his safety or requires a sacrifice beyond what he had already accepted.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes are abstract and play out over a lifetime rather than through immediate escalation in a scene. There is no active opposition or moment where Aris faces a forced trade-off; he simply observes the seed's inevitable progress.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.2)
    The conflict is entirely internal and resolves without resistance; the tunnel "answers" his humming readily, providing the desired catharsis without cost. There is no moment where the protagonist must escalate his tactics or risk failure, resulting in low narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.6)
    The stakes are primarily internal and emotional; while deeply felt, the external pressure is low, lacking a moment of visceral risk or potential failure. The conflict resolution moves smoothly without significant obstruction, making the "tightening" phase feel more like an unfolding than a high-pressure test of agency.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.8)
    The internal stakes (destiny vs. creation) escalate effectively through the ritual process. The resolution offers a valid Conceptual Repricing where the protagonist trades the destination of "hope" for the agency of "the road," satisfying the closure requirement with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stakes are defined, but the conflict remains low-resistance with an abstract antagonist (entropy). The escalation relies on a "tuning deeper" beat that feels more like a textural increase in density than a forceful narrowing of options or a high-stakes trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.0)
    The dominant stake is high, but the conflict lacks active opposition; the environment aids the protagonist, and the solution is achieved through "instinct" without a moment of potential failure. The absence of a tangible antagonist or internal hurdle creates a flat trajectory with minimal tension.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.2)
    Tension is dampened by the protagonist's suppression of fear and ability to simply "ignore" the gallery's resistance (the mirrors). The climax lacks a difficult choice with visible cost; the resolution is achieved through procedure rather than sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes remain abstract and intellectual throughout; the power outage provides atmosphere but fails to force a difficult trade-off or escalate the danger, leaving the protagonist’s safety and success assured.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist encounters a distressed spirit and resolves the situation immediately with a functioning device and a calming speech. There is no escalation of stakes, failure of tactics, or resistance from the antagonist (the grief/ghost), resulting in a "fix-it" beat that lacks dramatic tension or earned victory.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes remain largely theoretical; the tidal clock functions as a backdrop rather than a pressure mechanism forcing a hard compromise. The protagonist faces no agonizing choice between survival and success—she accomplishes her goal exactly as planned before the water returns. The absence of a "bite" from the antagonist forces (time/nature) leaves the triumph feeling convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is negligible; there is no external opposition and the internal stakes ("fetching wisdom") face no resistance or risk of failure. The ritual proceeds smoothly to a successful conclusion, lacking the escalation or "meaningful tightening" required to generate narrative pressure or felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.4)
    Conflict is muted; the protagonist has already mastered the "curse" ("she had learned to feed it selectively"), negating the threat of the diamond before the ritual begins. The stakes remain theoretical (cultural loss) rather than visceral, as no immediate force or error opposes her success during the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are mostly atmospheric; the antagonist is the abstract concept of "bitterness" or the "world," neither of which exerts active pressure in the scene. The climax lacks a palpable cost—Elara gains freedom and power without a visible trade-off or loss, softening the dramatic impact.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=4.6)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent; the "sentinels" are set up as threats but capitulate instantly to the music without tactical resistance. The stakes are declared ("strangling silence") but never tested by a possibility of failure, resulting in low narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.1)
    Stakes are established early (tightened border, interceptors), and the reroute through the basement offers a functional tactical shift. Yet, the conflict feels muted because the solution (the bottled storm) works exactly as planned without forcing a difficult trade-off or escalation in the moment. The pressure is stated in dialogue rather than felt through near-failure.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=3.5)
    Stakes remain theoretical and atmospheric; there is no antagonist, time pressure, or risk of failure to drive escalation. The protagonist faces no meaningful opposition, making the restoration of the carousel feel inevitable rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.0)
    While the stakes (lost history) are high in concept, the on-page pressure is low; the protagonist encounters no significant resistance or antagonist. The climax resolves through competence without forcing a trade-off or loss, lacking the tightening of options required for higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes are personal and legible, centered on the protagonist’s lifelong yearning. The conflict is resolved through the application of the "chromatic equation," but the lack of a significant on-page cost or difficult choice during the climax keeps the tension moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=3.8)
    Tension is flattened by the protagonist's immunity to fear; the opposition (weeping reflections) poses no credible threat to his success. There is no escalation of stakes, as the solution is immediate and requires no sacrifice or difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are clear—memory versus void—and escalate through the investigation. The external threat of the orchard remains somewhat abstract until the climax, but the final choice crystallizes the stance effectively, creating a felt cost of lost future for regained past.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are clear and high, with the threat of "reversible exile" escalating as the shadow pulses. The intervention with the cartographer serves as a meaningful tightening that resolves the immediate tension with a legible result.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=3.2)
    There is virtually no conflict or escalation within the scene. The protagonist faces no active opposition, resource scarcity, or time pressure that forces a trade-off. The stakes are telescopic—declared as cosmic extinction, but the on-page action is a calm, unthreatened ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes remain telescopic—world balance vs. a knot—with the protagonist's safety never truly in doubt. The escalation to the "guilt" knot provides a focal point, but the resolution (simply piercing it) lacks a visceral or felt cost to the protagonist herself.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are internal and atmospheric, lacking external pressure or a moment where the outcome is in doubt. The escalation is observational rather than dramatic; the protagonist witnesses rather than wrestles, resulting in low tension throughout the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.1)
    Escalation is coherent, tracking the protagonist's descent from intellectual curiosity to physical deterioration ("Stopped eating. Stopped sleeping"). The final choice to release the globe is a decisive action with felt emotional cost, effectively resolving the central tension.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=4.5)
    Escalation is virtually absent; the "ghost" cooperates instantly, and the environment offers no resistance, stripping the scene of tension. The stakes remain purely internal and theoretical because the protagonist faces no risk of failure or meaningful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=4.7)
    Conflict is virtually absent; there is no opposition, time pressure, or genuine obstacle to the ascent or discovery. The stakes are purely thematic, and the lack of resistance turns the story into a contemplative vignette rather than a narrative with escalating tension or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.2)
    Internal pressure is sustained and coherent; the arrival of a cloud that mirrors her specific internal state ("quietly explosive") creates a focused moment of confrontation. While the external turn (the cloud dissolving) relies slightly on pathetic fallacy, it forces the protagonist to actively reinterpret the loss, earning the shift in stance.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are clearly established (spiritual completion vs. physical destruction) and escalate through the encroaching demolition sounds. The cost is felt—the immediate loss of the masterwork—but the character's agency in choosing to finish anyway creates a satisfying resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=3.9)
    Pressure is minimal throughout; Arlen moves from curiosity to triumph with no significant obstacles, antagonists, or risks of failure. The stakes are declared ("beacon or shield") rather than felt, and the resolution comes without a visible price or sacrifice. The absence of a "moment of truth" where a hard choice is required limits the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are primarily philosophical, and the conflict is introspective, relying on memories rather than immediate obstacles. While the cost is paid (leaving the gears behind), the external pressure is low, making the escalation feel gentle rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.8)
    Escalation is minimal; the primary obstacle (convincing the settlers) is bypassed by the protagonist's magical attribute. There is no moment where the plan risks failure, and the final transition is smooth, lacking the tension of a true test or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dramatic tension is minimal because the protagonist faces no internal doubt and no external resistance; the universe "chose to sleep." Without a test of the protagonist's commitment or a moment where the outcome is in doubt, the stakes—while cosmic—feel abstract and unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clearly braided between the immediate survival of the girl and the protagonist's moral "arithmetic." The impending frost provides a coherent ticking clock that escalates pressure without feeling artificial, forcing a decisive risk.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clear but largely internal; the conflict is man-vs-self resolved by a shift in perspective. While the emotional cost is legible, the professional solution ("Chrysalis Mesh") feels a bit neat, resolving a complex bio-ethical tragedy with a sudden metaphorical alignment.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is the story's weakest element; there is virtually no resistance from the patrons or the environment. The vendor’s goal to "unwrite herself" faces no obstruction, turning the scene into a smooth demonstration of her trade rather than a dramatic test. The accumulation of sales provides a rhythmic progression, but without distinct escalation or stakes that feel imperiled, the narrative tension remains low.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are internal and atmospheric, but the central conflict (Man vs. Remorse) lacks dynamic escalation; the antagonist force yields to simple endurance. The climax is resolved through a "competence beat" where Elira simply wills the problem away ("She sanded... smoothing edges"), missing a moment of genuine jeopardy or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is minimal; the grain elevator offers only token resistance ("groan of steel") before complying with the protagonist's rehabilitation efforts. There is no escalating pressure or distinct moment where Elara's plan risks failure, resulting in a flat dramatic line.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the "modification" process meets no active resistance, risk of failure, or unintended consequence. The protagonist succeeds instantly using her "method," resulting in a static victory without escalation or meaningful stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes remain abstract; while the "sky's sigh" provides a clock, the lack of active antagonism or difficult trade-offs keeps tension low. The protagonist faces environmental puzzles but no true jeopardy or moral calculus that forces a painful choice.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=4.4)
    The antagonist—abstract silence—exerts pressure but offers no active resistance or counter-moves; Silas overcomes the central obstacle without significant setback or risk of failure. The stakes are global, but the on-page struggle lacks tension because the solution works perfectly on the first attempt.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=2.9)
    Stakes are purely abstract ("saving souls") and lack an immediate, concrete test on the page. The "surge" of the magnetic field acts as background ambiance rather than a pressure forcing a trade-off. There is no visible cost to the protagonist's transformation; the conflict is resolved by simply deciding to feel better.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.2)
    The "tuning" process provides a clear escalation of tactics, moving from blunt tools to specific empathetic resonances. The pressure of the impending fireworks adds necessary tension to the scene. The cost is legible but somewhat abstract ("realign her bones"), keeping the stakes largely thematic.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=4.1)
    Stakes are low and abstract; the protagonist waits for an external event (the bloom) rather than driving the action through agency. The conflict between the village's anxiety and Elira's serenity generates little on-page friction, as the resolution dissolves the opposition without struggle or price.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are clear, anchored by the environmental threat of the returning gravity. The escalation works well through the time limit and the dash to the Grandmother tree, though the antagonist is purely situational; the "cost" is risk rather than a paid price.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clear and pressure is coherent, escalating from observation to active confrontation with the "learning" wind. However, the cost remains largely theoretical until the final beat; earlier tension relies more on the memory of Varga than immediate on-page jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=3.2)
    Stakes are theoretical ("wonder becomes brittle") and never tested by immediate failure or opposition; the protagonist faces no true resistance. There is no visible cost to the magic; the mention of "breath ragged" is an unearned physical tag not supported by the ease of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.5)
    Tension is low because the protagonist encounters no on-page obstacles; the wind does not disturb the markers, the flute plays perfectly, and the realms offer their lessons without threat. The stakes remain theoretical—a "never again" verdict from the past—rather than an immediate, active pressure challenging her actions in the present.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=4.0)
    There is virtually no immediate scene pressure or opposition; the protagonist performs her tasks in a vacuum until the stars fade. The stakes are high conceptually (end of the cosmos) but low dramatically, as the character faces no difficult choices, obstacles, or trade-offs in the present action. The ending feels inevitable rather than earned by prior agency.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is minimal; the external obstacle (time) is ignored, and the internal obstacle (cynicism) is resolved instantly by the pendant's magic. The protagonist faces no significant opposition, and the "cost" of her final sacrifice is framed as a purely positive release, lowering the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.1)
    Stakes remain largely intellectual and abstract; while the "weight" of the memory is asserted, the personal cost to the mystic is low. The conflict is internal and quiet, lacking significant pressure or an opposing force to test her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are well-established and escalate clearly through the weaving process, culminating in a visible and felt cost (self-dissolution). The pressure to reach the lover drives the narrative effectively, even if the method (the puzzle) arrives conveniently.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are present (the fading magic, the briars), but the external pressure is low; Arlo faces no active opposition or agonizing trade-off. The depletion of the silk is voluntary and peaceful, making the conflict feel more atmospheric than urgent, and the final cost is mitigated by the thematic victory.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.6)
    The story lacks immediate active opposition; the automatons ignoring Elira removes potential urgency, leaving the conflict purely internal and retrospective. While the conceptual stakes are high, the protagonist’s journey to the truth meets no resistance, making the acquisition of the revelation feel unearned by struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the internal stakes of managing grief are clear, the physical cost is undermined by the object continuity error—it is unclear if he sacrificed his anchor or kept it. The external conflict resolves via supernatural coincidence rather than a direct result of his actions.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes remain abstract and generalized, pitting stories against a distant "data" concept that exerts no active pressure in the scene. The lack of a concrete antagonist or obstacle results in low tension; the resolution feels inevitable, with the protagonist's success guaranteed by her nature rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are purely theoretical and artistic, lacking an urgent external force or a tangible, on-page cost to failure. The escalation tracks a sequence of mental epiphanies without active opposition, making the resolution feel like a meditative inevitability rather than a victory won against resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.6)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist encounters almost no resistance from the environment, the object, or herself. The sextant fixes itself, the trees offer their secrets freely, and the transition to her new life feels like a gift rather than a hard-won change with a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.8)
    Tension is virtually absent because the opposing force (apathy) offers no resistance; the "broken soldier" and others join the song immediately, resolving the stakes without escalation, trade-offs, or earned reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.5)
    Conflict is primarily retrospective (past betrayal) or abstract (shame), lacking immediate on-page opposition. The stakes are emotional comfort rather than urgent consequence; the resolution comes too easily, with the library confirming her new stance without testing it.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.6)
    The conflict is primarily internal and atmospheric, lacking strong opposition. While the ritual of offering bread and gardening provides a form of escalation, the stakes remain gentle and abstract ("permission from the earth"). The pressure is thematic rather than urgent, leading to a resolution that feels inevitable rather than hard-won against resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.1)
    Pressure is coherent, derived from the "ticking clock" of the fading slide, but the conflict remains largely theoretical (entropy vs. meaning) with no active antagonist or concrete obstacle. The protagonist succeeds without paying a significant price or facing a moment of genuine doubt, keeping tension in the middle band.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are established, but the protagonist faces little genuine resistance during the scene. She succeeds without a visible trade-off or felt cost; the "cost" is relegated to backstory or abstraction ("fear calcified"), leaving the on-page victory feeling too easy.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.5)
    The stakes remain largely philosophical and observational. While the protagonist facilitates the climax by "reaching out," the primary dramatic action (the absorption) happens to the secondary character, leaving the protagonist as a witness. The pressure is atmospheric rather than antagonistic; she faces no difficult trade-offs or active opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=3.9)
    Pressure is low as the protagonist faces no active opposition; the antagonist exists only in memory and the cave is compliant. The climax is a smooth release of tension without an escalation of stakes or a forced trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are clearly defined: physical survival versus the compulsion to uncover truth. The escalation is effective, with the character pressing deeper into the toxic city despite increasing physical debilitation. The climax (reading the letters) provides a satisfying release of tension, reversing the physical stakes (wilting) through the thematic action.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=2.2)
    Conflict is purely abstract and thematic ("wonder vs. efficiency") with no on-page antagonist or situational pressure to test the protagonist's resolve. The absence of a specific, urgent problem in the present tense results in zero escalation, leaving the stakes theoretical and the outcome inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.1)
    The external and internal stakes parallel each other well, but the resolution comes too easily; the "controlled burn" works perfectly on the first try without complication or resistance. The cost is framed as "integration," which feels like a net positive, lowering the sense of risk or sacrifice in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.0)
    Conflict is minimal; Elara faces no obstacles other than a closed door, and Leo’s resistance melts after a few days of humming. The stakes are low because Elara is never at risk of failure, and the cost of the resolution is not felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.2)
    Tension is low; the drone threat is evaded without cost, and the mainframe offers no active counter-pressure, making the conflict feel one-sided. The stakes are declared ("liberation") rather than felt through struggle, as Elira’s competence overwhelms all opposition effortlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.8)
    The stakes are personal and clear, but the escalation is linear; the "unstable resonance" implies a threat that never fully materializes to force a hard choice. The gravity pocket becoming "welcoming" lowers the tension at the climax, making the transition feel like a reward rather than a risky trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict evaporates the moment the prophecy speaks; there is no escalation, and the protagonist offers no resistance to the shift in goal. The stakes ("a sky that would forget how to hold dawn") remain abstract and distant, never exerting concrete pressure on the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.6)
    The stakes are quiet but deeply felt; the risk of breaking the "agreed upon lies" provides sufficient tension to carry the scene. The escalation from "steeping in half-truths" to the silent presentation of the seal represents a clear tightening of narrative screws. The cost—the loss of a safe social fiction for a dangerous truth—is legible and meaningful.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is strictly internal and summarized; the archiving process meets no resistance from the shell, the memories, or the environment. The stakes are declared ("unbearable void") but never tested, as the ritual proceeds smoothly to completion without a moment of doubt or danger.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.8)
    The conflict is primarily Man vs. Magic, which keeps the stakes high but abstract. The opposition comes from the scroll's resistance ("ink writhed"), which is overcome relatively easily by the protagonist's "purity" and skill; a more distinct personal trade-off or risk of failure would heighten the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.6)
    The antagonist ("ancient entity") presents no active opposition, shifting from "harvesting" to "curious" to defeated without ever threatening the protagonist's goal or safety. The lack of a genuine counter-move or moment of peril makes the stakes feel abstract, as the solution (singing) works instantly without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.0)
    Tension is low as the protagonist faces no active opposition or possibility of failure; the resolution is achieved through competent procedure rather than a high-stakes choice or paid price.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=3.5)
    There is no meaningful opposition or tightening of stakes; the "conflict" is a contemplative abstract (honoring the unseen) that faces no resistance. The arrival of the fireflies is a response to a summons rather than an escalation of pressure, and the protagonist risks nothing.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=4.0)
    Pressure is low throughout; the environmental threat (dust storm) is dispelled instantly by the protagonist's action without resistance or trade-off. There is no escalation of stakes on the page; she enters safe, succeeds immediately, and leaves safer. The "cost" is purely abstract ("sorrow") and not dramatized through loss or difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are global and abstract ("shaping a new dawn") rather than immediate and felt; Elira faces no personal risk, trade-off, or physical danger in the scene. The conflict with Kael remains distant and ideological, failing to exert pressure on her specific actions or choices in the observatory. The climax is an act of expression rather than a desperate maneuver under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the poet faces no opposition, external antagonists, or difficult trade-offs in his quest. The climax with the child is a gentle confirmation of his role rather than a high-stakes test of his goals.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.8)
    The stakes are high (protect the artifact), but the antagonist force feels faceless and their defeat—instant moral conversion via "sonic absolution"—undercuts the sense of struggle. The protagonist faces no difficult trade-off or painful sacrifice; "exhaustion" is a token price for such a total victory.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=2.9)
    Conflict is purely hypothetical and summarized; the "old rulers" are straw men who retreat immediately upon encountering silence, removing all tension. There is no escalation or risk; the protagonist's victory is presented as a foregone conclusion without struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.2)
    The stakes are clear—truth against bureaucratic amnesia—but the conflict remains largely internal and abstract. The resolution ("her report will be dismissed") is a static acceptance known from the start, lacking a dynamic shift in pressure or a new cost paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are internal but intensely felt; the tension of the "grinding" gears effectively externalizes Elias's spiritual stasis. The deepening of the conflict—from a simple repair to a test of his capacity for grace—is handled with excellent pacing. The cost is paid in "agony of precision" and the emotional labor of the years leading to this moment.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (waking the bell) is established early, but the conflict remains largely external and atmospheric (fighting the gears/acid). The protagonist succeeds through competence and endurance without facing a hard trade-off or a moment where failure seems genuinely possible, limiting the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are clear and escalate from professional curiosity to existential commitment. The conflict between the corporate desire to erase and the archivist's need to preserve creates coherent pressure. The cost—her disconnection from the living world to maintain the signal—is a tangible price paid for her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=3.0)
    There is no tangible conflict or antagonist; the protagonist faces no obstacles to her mission and pays no price for her success. The stakes are global and abstract ("before the world hardened") rather than immediate and personal, resulting in a flat narrative trajectory without escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are high and personal, blending physical survival with a metaphysical quest. The climax provides a clear escalation where the protagonist exerts agency by moving toward the danger, effectively testing her "loosened grip" on reality against a tangible threat.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes are emotional but the conflict lacks teeth; the "gentle persuasion" meets minimal resistance, turning the scene into a Socratic dialogue rather than a dramatic struggle. The escalation is rhetorical—Elias explains a concept, and Mara accepts it—without forcing a difficult trade-off or tangible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=3.0)
    There is virtually no conflict; the protagonist faces no active antagonist, and the environment ("shifting dunes") offers no actual resistance to her ritual. The stakes are theoretical (wisdom vs. forgetting) rather than immediate, and success feels inevitable from the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=2.0)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the archivist encounters no opposition from the work, the environment, or the public. The process of "mending" is depicted as inevitable magic, bypassing the dramatic necessity of struggle, failure, or tangible trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pressure is minimal; the scholar faces no active opposition or rising cost, merely the passive weight of time. The escalation is linear and repetitive, leading to a breakthrough that feels granted by the object rather than forced by the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.6)
    The internal pressure is consistent, driven by the inevitable forgetting. However, the external escalation is mild; the transition from the fender (failure) to the tapes (success) lacks a significant obstacle or tactical shift beyond trial and error.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.8)
    The stakes are high (existential collapse) but the conflict lacks intimacy or agency; the antagonist is entropy, and the solution is a singular moment of internal "tenderness." There is no visible trade-off or cost paid on the page—she succeeds by leaning into an emotion, which lowers the dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=2.2)
    There are no genuine stakes or opposition; everyone in the haven is waiting for her, and her magic works instantly. The story amplifies a mood but does not escalate conflict or pressure. Perfection is achieved without resistance, rendering the "mission" void of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=4.8)
    Tension is low because the protagonist experiences a linear progression of discovery without significant setbacks or active opposition. The "cost" of becoming the keeper is abstract and stated rather than felt through a dramatized sacrifice or trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=4.9)
    The story lacks immediate dramatic pressure; the protagonist enters the scene with a solution and executes it without facing resistance, failure, or cost. The stakes are abstract and collective ("the town," "grief") rather than personal to the protagonist's safety or soul in the moment. The conflict is retrospective, dealt with through reflection rather than present-tense struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.8)
    The stakes remain largely abstract and internal; the conflict lacks active opposition or a moment where the protagonist's vow is genuinely tested. The resolution comes through the completion of a routine ritual rather than a high-pressure decision that carries visible risk.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=2.8)
    Dramatic pressure is absent; the protagonist faces no external snag or internal doubt while executing her plan, resulting in a scene with no stakes tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.3)
    The pressure is internal and coherent, escalating conceptually as she confronts the "myth" of closure. While the stakes are relatively low (artistic philosophy rather than urgent consequence), the decision to "walk against the current" and release the shell represents a meaningful turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=3.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the environment, the magic, and the spirits yield immediately to the protagonist's first attempt, resulting in zero escalation of difficulty or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the "killing cold" is described as a threat but exerts no actual pressure on the protagonist, who operates with immunity and ease. The stakes (guiding future wanderers) are noble but abstract and distant, resulting in a low-stakes vignette where success feels inevitable from the first line.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.4)
    Conflict is minimal and abstract; the locksmith faces no active opposition, only the passive resistance of the task itself. There is no moment where failure seems possible or where the protagonist must sacrifice one desire for another, resulting in low narrative tension. The accumulation of "wonder" proceeds smoothly without a decisive intensification or sharp deepening of the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes escalate coherently from the professional duty of easing another's pain to the personal cost of the Weaver's own survival. The conflict is resolved through endurance rather than release, creating a legible price—loneliness and the weight of the "rusted locket"—that charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    The tension between the screaming kettle (domestic urgency) and the carving (spiritual necessity) creates a tangible, effective conflict. Eleanor's choice to let the pot scorch serves as a felt cost for her dedication to the act of memory, anchoring the abstract stakes in physical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes are clear and the climb provides a tangible escalation of the internal conflict. The surrender of the camera is a decisive action with felt cost, though the subsequent emotional resolution feels slightly unearned because it stems from reading a message rather than the act of surrender itself.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.3)
    Stakes are theoretical rather than felt; there is no active opposition or escalation of pressure. Elira overcomes entropy with ease, and the narrative lacks a moment where her plan fails or requires a painful trade-off, resulting in a "smooth sailing" low-tension arc.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.0)
    Conflict is low-stakes and entirely internal, with the &quot;ache&quot; of the abandoned dream dissolving almost immediately upon interaction with the crystal. There is no moment of genuine risk or potential failure; the resolution feels inevitable and gentle rather than earned through struggle. The &quot;cost&quot; is purely philosophical, lacking a felt price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes remain purely philosophical; there is no external opposition or visible cost to the seeker's actions. The conflict is static—he waits, he retrieves—and the resolution feels inevitable rather than earned through pressure or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.4)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no significant opposition, difficult trade-off, or risk of failure to achieve her goal. The interaction lacks genuine tension, as the mentor yields to her patience without a dramatized test of will or conflicting interest.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are abstract and thematic (memory vs. oblivion) rather than immediate and concrete. There is no on-page pressure or obstacle forcing the traveler's hand; the writing process proceeds without resistance. Escalation is minimal, shifting only from general reflection to the specific subject (Elira) without raising the cost of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure is coherent and escalates through environmental reaction (quaking palace), though the opposition is largely passive entropy. The stakes are high, but the conflict resolution feels inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.1)
    There is a distinct lack of resistance; the ritual works perfectly on the first attempt with no external threat or internal barrier testing the protagonist's resolve. Without an escalation of pressure or a risk of failure, the stakes remain theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.6)
    There is virtually no opposition; the city yields its secrets to a single key found immediately. The protagonist encounters no setbacks, makes no trade-offs, and faces no active antagonist (the "mortar of neglect" is passive). Without escalation or risk, the "liberation" feels like a foregone conclusion rather than a hard-won victory.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are low and the conflict is minimal; the "rust" offers only passive resistance to the protagonist's abilities. The escalation is smooth rather than pressured—the sentimentalist sings, and the gear yields without forcing a trade-off or raising the price of success.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=4.9)
    Stakes are internal and abstract; there is no tangible obstacle or antagonist forcing the protagonist to adapt tactics. The pressure is textural (butterflies, light) rather than dramatic; Elias is never at risk of failure, and his final realization feels inevitable rather than earned through escalation or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—maintaining the town's order versus personal spiritual release—is clear and escalated through the physical act of climbing. However, the resolution bypasses the cost of decision; the pendulum restarts itself, sparing Elias the consequences of his inaction. The choice to stop winding feels weighted, but the outcome removes the burden of that choice.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.0)
    Conflict is largely abstract; the "chess clock" element fails to provide actual temporal pressure, leaving the protagonist to work in a vacuum of urgency. The resistance offered by the threads is minimal, making the escalation feel inevitable rather than earned through struggle or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=3.0)
    Conflict is virtually absent; there is no antagonist, external barrier, or internal flaw impeding the protagonist's goal. The stakes, while grand in abstract scope, lack immediate narrative tension because the outcome of the ritual never feels in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are high conceptually but low materially; the "famine" provides atmospheric rather than antagonistic pressure. The escalation is largely external (the radio getting hotter on its own), and the climax is reactive (following instructions) rather than a choice forced by direct opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.7)
    Conflict is thematic rather than dramatic; the opposing force (the "mirage of safety") offers no active resistance in the scene. The visitor functions as a compliant prop who validates the protagonist's worldview instantly, resulting in a flat pressure curve without a meaningful tightening of options.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.8)
    Conflict is summarized and abstract ("competing narratives"), lacking a specific, high-stakes confrontation that forces a difficult choice. The protagonist's stance is static from start to finish; he endures pressure but is never truly tested or forced to adapt his tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=4.9)
    Active conflict is minimal; the antagonist is the abstract "world outside," relegated to backstory, while the present-moment scene lacks pressure or hard choices. The interaction with the student offers no resistance or tightening of options, resolving immediately into acceptance without a sense of cost or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.2)
    Conflict is negligible; the vines "surrender" immediately, and the rust becomes an anchor without resistance, removing tension from the "rebellion." While the stakes are clear (creating beauty), the lack of escalation or significant opposition results in a low-pressure narrative that prioritizes vibe over struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story operates on a low-tension "deepening" track (Accumulative/Situational lens) rather than high-stakes conflict. The escalation is intellectual—solving the riddle—rather than a pressure-cooker of choices. While functional for this length, the lack of external obstacles or sharper trade-offs limits the dramatic charge.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=4.0)
    There is a near-total absence of conflict or pressure; the protagonist faces no antagonist, internal doubt, or physical hurdle. The "creeping normality" is a passive concept, not an active force opposing her ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.0)
    Conflict is minimal; the interaction is a transaction of wisdom rather than a clash of opposing forces. The historian’s hesitation ("It's empty") is a token obstacle, and the stakes remain abstract and intellectual, lacking visceral pressure or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure accumulates consistently through the climb and the carving of proofs. The stakes are effectively internalized, and the cost of the rupture—the loss of the physical die—is a felt price for the insight gained.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=3.6)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the magic functions instantly and perfectly, overcoming the city's "grime" without any active opposition or failure. The narrative escalates only in the intensity of the success (painting a rarer glyph), resulting in a story with no genuine tension or risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=4.1)
    Conflict is abstract (grief, silence) and resolves through a montage of success without significant opposition or setbacks. There is no visible or felt cost to the protagonist's victory; the "thawing" happens smoothly once initiated, lacking the friction required for high-stakes drama.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.1)
    Stakes are theoretically high (famine vs. plenty) but remain abstract until the end; the antagonist is the nebulous concept of "fate." The "cost" of the magic—damage to the lighthouse and "carrying the weight"—is stated rather than dramatized, lacking a visceral sense of loss for the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.3)
    While the stakes of overcoming trauma are clear, the conflict lacks back-and-forth pressure; the "monster" offers no resistance to the protagonist's first move. The resolution feels convenient because the "luminance" weaponizes recognition to solve the problem instantly.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.5)
    Escalation is distinct, moving from churning clouds to a thickening obsidian sea. The stakes are clear but remain somewhat abstract and conceptual ("tide of sound") rather than viscerally felt. The resolution comes abruptly after the climactic action.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—breaking the silence of the watchers—is clear, but the on-page pressure is low as the protagonist spends the scene packing and reflecting on a past success. The escalation is internal resolve rather than an immediate external obstacle or rising situational conflict, limiting the visceral impact of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.0)
    Immediate tension is low; the discovery occurs without obstacles, and the conflict is entirely internal and intellectual. The "struggle" is resolved through essayistic reflection rather than a test of the protagonist's resolve or safety in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are thematic and emotional rather than visceral or urgent; the conflict is largely Elara versus entropy. While this fits the contemplative mode, the pressure is somewhat low-voltage until the discovery of the suicide note. The "cost" is paid in ink and emotional reserve, which is legible but subtle.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are clear but the conflict remains static; the protagonist faces external environmental pressure but succeeds in every task without a moment of doubt or significant cost. The escalation is linear (finding increasingly damning evidence) rather than testing the character's resolve through difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.1)
    The stakes are established early and escalate clearly as the shadow ascends, forcing a deadline. The cost is felt on the page—Silas must destroy his life's work of preservation to achieve resolution—fulfilling the requirement for a meaningful tightening and renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—salvaging meaning from grief—is externalized effectively through the machine's feedback and the resulting coordinates. The escalation is clean, moving from intellectual simulation to a high-stakes physical commitment to hunt.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.8)
    External stakes are established but effectively discarded; the pilot faces no significant opposition or difficult trade-off to acquire the chip, as the stone opens with "relief" rather than resistance. The central conflict is resolved too easily by the artifact's function and the pilgrim's explanation, lacking a felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clearly internalized ("tremor in her ribs"), but the escalation is dampened by the ease of the magical revelation. The pressure does not force a difficult trade-off; instead, the truth is dispensed by the wood, making the climax feel like a receipt of information rather than a navigated crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.0)
    Conflict is negligible; the antagonist offers no meaningful resistance, agreeing to the exchange immediately ("Then you’re ready"). The stakes remain abstract because the emotional difficulty of parting with the relics is stated ("kept what mattered") rather than dramatized through hesitation or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are purely internal and abstract ("coherence," "alignment"), lacking external friction or urgency to force a hard choice. The resolution is achieved through a low-stakes walk and epiphany, missing a moment where the protagonist must pay a visible cost to proceed.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.4)
    The internal stakes are well-defined, but the external pressure is low; Kael acts as a gentle guide rather than a force of friction. The resolution comes via a ritualistic interaction with the setting rather than a difficult active struggle, though the "cost" of pain is clearly felt.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.6)
    Conflict is minimal; the protagonist faces no external opposition and overcomes internal resistance effortlessly ("surrendered—not to loss, but to reciprocity"). The lack of a visible price or difficult trade-off makes the "cost" feel purely rhetorical rather than felt. The stakes are high in theory (death/life) but low in execution because success is never in doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.1)
    While the internal conflict is clear, the resolution lacks a tangible price; the protagonist "surrenders" the lost moments but is immediately rewarded with a healed object and restored connection. The cost is theoretical rather than felt on the page, reading more as a soft reset than a hard-won reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.3)
    One dominant stake (reunion) is clear and scales well. The escalation (finding the frequency, the ship buckling) works, but the primary internal obstacle (the shadow) is resolved with relatively low friction—a quick acknowledgment rather than a prolonged struggle with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.8)
    Conflict is virtually absent; there is no opposition, active antagonist, or internal resistance to the release of the bugs. The protagonist faces no difficult trade-offs or risks—the volcano is affectionate, the bugs want to be freed, and she wants to free them—resulting in a flat pressure curve where success is guaranteed from the start.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=4.1)
    Tension is low; the guards are "drowsy" and "oblivious," and the protagonist faces no active opposition or difficult trade-offs. The pivotal moment relies on proximity ("arm's reach") rather than a genuine escalation of stakes or a forced tactical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are clearly defined but remain largely cerebral and internal; the protagonist faces little external opposition or risk of failure beyond the frustration of his own understanding. The tension is atmospheric rather than urgent, fitting the tone but limiting the narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes are clear (emotional survival/memory), but the conflict remains largely internal and static. The external pressure (storm) parallels the internal state but doesn't force the poet's hand, leaving the tension somewhat reliant on the narrator's assertions of importance.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.2)
    Conflict is virtually absent; the "duel" is purely metaphorical and retrospective, while the present scene is a frictionless collaboration. Stakes remain abstract (intellectual discovery) with no visible price paid for success; the characters simply wait, solve, and leave.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.3)
    Conflict is minimal; the environment cooperates fully, and the internal struggle is resolved instantly upon reading the note. There is no significant escalation or "tightening" of options; the stakes remain abstract and the cost of the transition is not felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=5.5)
    The stakes are theoretically high (fate/time), but the immediate pressure is low; the "resistance" of the arbor is purely atmospheric (bursting petals) and offers no tactical opposition. The ending resolves the conflict completely without a felt or visible cost, as the protagonist faces no hard trade-off to achieve her goal.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are established early and remain high—the loss of cultural identity versus its preservation. The cost (the unique seed) is paid on the page, and the urgency of the early bloom adds necessary pressure. The conflict is primarily Man vs. Nature/Entropy, which works well for this scope.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.6)
    Stakes remain abstract; while the "air thickened," Elio is never personally threatened or forced to make a difficult trade-off. The resolution comes from expertise application rather than a high-stakes choice or sacrifice.

    Dominant stake (prove strangers remember kindness) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via barista act, note, offerings to girl's arrival tightening pressure. Protagonist agency in painting glyphs drives deepening; visible cost in solitude foreclosed by invitation, though no sharp reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—rescuing arts vs. grief's silence—tightens accumulatively via bread rituals to drum beat, forcing communal stance crystallization. Elara's agency in offerings forecloses isolation with practice's visible cost; no reversals needed under lens, but price legible in "frost from their spirits" dissolving.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake to shatter predestination escalates via yoyo hum to mainspring tremor and memory flood, narrowing to gear grasp; "He gritted his teeth" shows agency amid causal pressure with visible structural cost.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (trick fear) signaled early tightens accumulatively via dictionary reading to unbosoming reversal, narrowing to self-confrontation with glowing-memories cost. Agency in thrusting echoes at replica forecloses hunted path.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (control sound-tide via clouds/orchard) signaled early, tightens via darkening sea forcing root-note improvisation under Accumulative lens. Prophet's agency (conducting to fruit-seeds) forecloses chaos path; Kael's apple strike crystallizes with felt exhaustion. Visible cost in dropped conch and tossed mallet narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (unravel watchers' silence) signaled early, deepens via watcher pivot narrowing to immediate action; agency in packing forecloses hesitation with felt cost of expedition fate. Accumulative pressure coheres to charged final image.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (rescue truth) signaled early, deepens accumulatively via letter's proof and mentor's warning, narrowing to careful publication with felt societal resistance cost. Agency in resolve forecloses raw accusation path. Escalation coherent under lens but lacks one sharper option-narrowing turn.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stake of countering oblivion tightens via letter piercing stoicism; ink emptying and emotional yield foreclose indifferent surveying with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (tracing origins against erasure) signaled early, escalates accumulatively via pattern break at pristine Master Index—"we knew... They buried us"—forcing stance crystallization in stamping that forecloses mythic lies with resolve's cost. Agency in hypothesis-testing narrows options; one decisive deepening suffices. Minor abstractness in "truth rarely roared—it seeped" tempers peak pressure legibility, but final trade-off (surface to speak) charges image.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (contain shadow via preserved dreams) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through hum and shadow climb, forcing agency in shattering lanterns and dropping sapphire. Tightening forecloses containment path with trade-off cost legible in freed dreams' spirals. Climax crystallization reweights under lens without coincidence resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (hunt potential) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via collapsing sims to Pacific coords; agency in slotting geode/initiate yields felt cost in fractured exhilaration, minor abstraction limits peak.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (decode belonging) signaled early, tightens via chip activation to internal visions; agency in alignment choice forecloses external-search path with felt cost (lost memories). Escalation coherent under Accumulative lens, though pilgrim's late appearance slightly softens pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (quell tremor via truth) signaled early, textural escalation via carving/memory narrows assumptions with agency (pressing watch hand); cost unmistakable in vomiting and foreclosed lies-trade path.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (prisoner exchange to ghost swap) signaled early, tightens accumulatively via relic revelations narrowing to shared path; cost felt in memorized names and relic weight. Agency in proposing neutral ground and accepting key forecloses division with on-page emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (overcome regret stasis) signaled early, tightens via pole-walk agency narrowing options; cost legible in "backlash... lost its grip" but lacks one deeper reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (kindle empathy) signaled early tightens accumulatively via ball-toss reversal narrowing to recognition; agency in release forecloses path with felt proximity to pain. Cost unmistakable in "spark" amid unlived paths.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (reforge bond) signaled early, tightens accumulatively through scent-coiling and skin-translation, narrowing to surrender-choice with agency in non-resistance; cost felt in bodily metamorphosis foreclosing prior self at spark's bloom.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake of reclaiming time tightens when archive entry forces release over grasp; cost legible in "final unfastening of her grip."

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake of precise emotional resonance escalates via final photo and shadow confrontation, forcing integration trade-off; agency in stitching narrows options under lens, with ship buckling as visible price charging poise.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (understanding transformation) signaled early, escalates texturally via deepening releases culminating in fourth-bug internalization narrowing to personal cost; chain effects (fisherman, librarian) complicate without resolving. One decisive tightening sufficient, charges closure poise.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (silent revolution) signaled early tightens accumulatively through courtyard execution near guards, narrowing detection options with agency in alignment and escape; cost legible in timed proximity to oblivious sentries forces stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (align with patterns) deepens via eel contact/memories under accumulative lens, forcing exhale agency; cost unmistakable in foreclosed control path.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (vigil mapping scars) signaled para 1; accumulative escalation via timer cadence/storm crescendo deepens to foreclose opening ("not yet"), with agency in stillness. Cost felt in ritual's sacred tension; one tightening sufficient. Minor abstractness in stakes slightly mutes visceral punch before closure.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake of recovering lost overture signaled early, escalates via synchronized mapping narrowing to precise alignment; agency in transcription forces collaborative stance with cost of prior duel concessions felt in partnership commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (forge beauty from anarchy/grief) signaled early, escalates accumulatively through poem-pinning, seed-planting, and singing that crystallize stance; agency in micro-choices forecloses cynicism with embodied cost in cracking voice and shed shell.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake to surprise fate escalates via textural deepening—compasses multiplying, clock advancing—forces agency in precision playing, culminating in unmistakable cost of grief-tempered triumph at the slammed chord.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (anchor memory pre-monsoon) signaled early, escalates via density increase (vines/glyphs) and doubt-deepening that narrows interpretive options; one tightening (tremor as awakening) forces stance crystallization with felt weariness cost, but minor abstractness in village examples slightly mutes on-page legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake of diffusing cerulean regret signaled early tightens accumulatively through needle stutter, ghostly sigh, and indigo bleed; agency in tracing lace forces trade-off, with cost felt in diffusion's "softening the edges" rather than erasure.


== Grader: Kimi K2-0905 ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single dominant stake—decay as revelation—tightens through each dust-layer observation; the spiral arrival forecloses the option that patterns are random. Price is felt as the surrender of her astrophysics identity, visible when she hangs the slide instead of a pulsar print.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—transform private survival into shared meaning—tightens when gifting forecloses profit, visible price on page. Escalation is accretive: each dawn’s irreproducible frost heightens the risk of failed translation into glass, sharpening attention. No external antagonist needed; internal pressure (silence vs. witness) suffices. Cost legible, though second beat could carry higher tangible loss (tool breakage, injury).

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prove silence ≠ absence—tightens through each fork strike; each thermal map deepens the pattern rather than widening scope. Escalation is textural: blue swirl of regret → crimson pulse of wonder → aurora shimmer across display; the cost is the irreversible surrender of audible music. No reversal is required under Accumulative lens; the meaningful intensification is the fountain ice’s silent song that finally answers her thesis. Stakes remain internal yet feel total because the prose keeps them sensorially concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—give unrest a home—tightens once: from receiving distress to becoming its address. Escalation is accumulative: each shard placement deepens the harmonic lullaby, reweighting the stake from “ignore or answer” to “house forever.” The price—permanent self-exile deeper underwater—is legible in the final kneel and rise toward “unsent love letters.”

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“keep the weave alive”—tightens when sanctions deepen and new hands appear; Elira’s agency is renunciation of credit, not confrontation. Escalation is accretive: heavier baskets, then coins in dough—each visible price alters later tactics under Accumulative lens. Coin-in-dough beat supplies felt cost that charges final image; no causal reversal required.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—will she locate the reservoir of unspent love?—tightens through breath-based agency: each inhalation literally changes what the lens reveals. Mid-story deepening occurs when the tear unfurls into filament-mist, narrowing options from search to surrender. No external antagonist needed; pressure is ontological. Cost is felt—she leaves the viaduct saturated, her former question obsolete—but the price is conceptual rather than visceral, keeping it shy of the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—map the texture of time—tightens when each photograph dissolves, turning abstract desire into visceral loss. The midpoint yew-tunnel touch escalates by stripping her of anchors; the final caress forecloses retrieval of memories, paying the price on the page. Pressure accumulates under the Accumulative lens; no reversal, but a decisive deepening that reconfigures options. Cost is unmistakable: ash spirals instead of images.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—breach vault before wall falls—is signaled early and tightened by the ticking dawn. One meaningful escalation: decoding the key-to-melody cipher narrows options from brute force to precise vibration. Cost is visible—she forfeits stealth by playing audible notes and risks raider interception. Persistent constraint: chains remain, limiting speed of escape.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—“find the sound of trust breaking before it is too late for others”—tightens through each absence burned: every new void intensifies the alloy’s resonance, narrowing her physical and emotional options. The final crack is the single decisive deepening that forecloses her search and crystallizes the warning device; the cost is the audible consumption of her sister’s remaining echo. Pressure is accumulative rather than adversarial, perfectly aligned with the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“translate fate without being seen”—is signaled early; each flower code tightens the risk of exposure, but the choice never escalates to a personal trade-off. Escalation is situational: two successful reunions deepen the thief’s anonymity rather than narrowing her options. Cost is conceptual (perpetual outsiderness) rather than visceral; still, the emptied jar provides a visible tally. Enough for high band, but a single moment where she almost steps into the light would have forced stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is seeded in para 2: trade control for curiosity. Escalation is textural—each flawed sphere makes silence costlier and more beautiful; the penultimate droplet strikes audible chime, tightening the cadence. No external reversals needed; the tension is internal renunciation with visible price: she leaves the spheres behind. Cost is legible on the page—she gives away both the bookmark and the warmth of the furnace for an uncertain future.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—erase the mentor’s theft and reclaim her image—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens when decryption proves premeditation. The single reversal—learning he left guilt-trail while still letting her fall—forces the choice to burn rather than expose, trading public vindication for private release; price is the reel itself and the risk of fire. Pressure escalates under causal lens; coincidence is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are the exhaustion of stars and the completion of an impossible map; pressure deepens as each summarized silence adds weight to the booklet and narrows her future to a single step into darkness. The tightening is accretive rather than causal, but the felt price is legible in the cracked spine and her final vanishing.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—origin of thought—tightens via recursive density: each loop forecloses prior interpretations. No antagonist needed; pressure is epistemic. The melting violin is the decisive price, narrowing options from external search to internal witness. Escalation is accumulative pattern-break rather than causal turn, coherent under chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—transparency vs. silence—signals early. One meaningful tightening: lens-beam moment forecloses retreat into wordless mistrust, visible in cracked glass price. Escalation is textural density, not causal turns; sufficient under Accumulative lens. Collective agency spreads stakes thin; individual cost is present but diffused.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—garden’s consent vs. metric control—tightens once when the intern delivers the 12% compliance edict, forcing her explicit renunciation. Cost is visible (dead wrist-band, institutional scorn) but the tightening is singular; no second reversal compounds pressure. Sufficient for the length, yet a hair’s breadth from the 8.8+ band that would require a persistent constraint shaping next-season tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—prove sideways time—signals early and tightens once: the 2.7° adjustment is the single meaningful turn that narrows options to irreversible. Cost is legible: lateral Elira’s terror + ozone scent = permanent perceptual shift. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens: each new layer of peeled light increases density rather than causal chain. Could use one more micro-cost (frosty glove slip, burnt fingertip) to push into 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure tightens through accretion: each newly revealed stain forecloses randomness and forces her closer to the single option—silent conducting. The moment she angles the lantern, agency crystallizes; water vibrates, and the ghost’s gaze makes the cost of refusal palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether to keep or release the unnamed truth—tightens once, when the oracle reframes silence as gravity. Because the truth’s content is withheld, the escalation is abstract; the only tangible cost is the orchid’s exposure to wind, a proxy rather than a direct test of disclosure. Still, the protagonist’s agency is visible: she chooses rupture by pinning the flawed art outside, a concrete gesture that forecloses perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“can I trade ghost logic for my own guilt?”—tightens when she discovers her own recorded call inside the tunnel. One meaningful deepening: the valve’s backward spin is re-priced from supernatural to self-haunting. Agency is renunciation; twisting the wheel without cosmic payoff forecloses magical absolution. Cost is conceptual but felt: she exits “steadier” because the option to blame ghosts is gone.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—witness vs. intervene—signals early ("not to preserve, but to witness") and tightens when the keeper must decide whether to re-enter the swan-fold. The cost is felt in the final release of ink into river: permanent forfeiture of recorded certainty. Pressure escalates by accretion of paradoxical images (forests with teeth, oceans that walk) rather than external antagonist; each intensifies the temptation to stop watching and start acting. Agency crystallizes in the ink-spilling gesture, not declared but dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stake—“keep wonder alive”—is declared early yet stays abstract; no visible price or forfeiture is attached to Elara. Eclipse provides situational spectacle but does not tighten her options; she remains passive conduit. No resource lost, no path foreclosed. Pressure is ambient, not protagonist-driven; escalation is coincidence, not agency.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: can any story survive the entropy of a tilted world? Pressure tightens once: discovery of third diary (“displaced axis” as existential wound) converts curator into active stitcher. Agency is renunciation of safety—she chooses to descend where clocks “forget their faces,” trading archival distance for embodied risk. Cost is legible in ash vial and the smile that concedes probable annihilation. One meaningful intensification suffices at this length; no further reversals required.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: can Elias keep orchestrating without becoming the spectacle? Escalation via mounting village dependence and external scrutiny; analyst arrival tightens options to recruit or be exposed. Cost visible: anonymity forfeited, dishes handed over. Agency remains orchestration—no deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“will the symphony rupture silence before her body fails?”—is signaled early and deepens through each memory-layer. Escalation is density-driven: each recalled sound thickens the chord until the lake cracks; one meaningful tightening suffices. Cost is visible in the split horizon and snuffed candle. Agency is present in the final crescendo choice, though the external world responds perhaps too conveniently.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: singular vs. plural identity, signaled in line 1. Escalation is textural densification: each confession thickens the air until rain freezes—visible price. No reversals needed; the deepening reweights the cost of self-definition. Agency persists—she speaks the admissions, triggers the merger, pays with her lone selfhood.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—defeat her own numbness—signaled in paragraph 4; tightening occurs when the glitch forces her to host raw exposure instead of curated quiet. Agency: she cranks the dynamo, chooses broken needle, accepts sympathetic drum-shudder cost. Price visible: veteran’s cry, girl’s laugh, cavern’s loss of sanctuary status. No coincidence; escalation coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“will he accept the invitation to expose the quarantine lie?”—is signaled the instant the tube is read. Escalation is single but meaningful: from passive data-recorder to active lateral ghost; the tightening is cognitive, not explosive, yet it forecloses official safety. Cost is visible: he forfeits pension, protection, and possibly life, implied by “ghost in the machine.” Agency drives every beat: decision not to report, to cache gear, to step into the dark. Under causal lens, one because/therefore progression suffices; no reversal is required at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will she risk uncorking grief?—tightens once via olfactory assault → UV glyph reveal, narrowing options from preservation to propagation. Escalation is textural, not causal-reversal, but still forces stance crystallization. Cost is legible: empty vial + open weeping + lanterns now “charged.” Could wish for one external obstacle; still, internal pressure suffices under 800-word ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: prove that impossible choices are invitations, not traps. Escalation occurs through tactile density: each fray mapped raises the conceptual cost of choosing sides. Peak tightening inside the spiral—starlight stitches frays—makes refusal of choice a live, costly option. Village bridge is downstream confirmation, not deus ex; poet’s agency drives every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“unbind beauty from the unfinished”—tightens when each played phrase visibly revives orchid, creaks hatch, draws child; options narrow from solitude to shared hush. No external antagonist; pressure is accretive vibration vs. chronic silence. One meaningful escalation: the greenhouse answers back. Cost is felt—the held note costs Lira her last breath of sound, child pays with scorched petal.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can she bear real feeling—tightens when the static storm surges under her ribs, foreclosing the option to bottle and sell. Cost is legible: decades of inventory burn in a single paragraph, leaving her commercially “ruined.” One meaningful deepening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—uplift the unseen—tightens when Elias risks his shrewd reputation by hand-delivering envelopes without credit. Pressure escalates accumulatively: each worker’s tear becomes social proof that narrows his future options back to profit. Cost is legible in the shift from shadow-observer to recognized “Silent Contributor,” a title that forecloses anonymity.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—keep echoes from vanishing—signals in para 1 and tightens when the giant’s breathing hitches. Agency drives escalation: each borrowed second visibly drains her, narrows options, and cumulates toward the final uncaging. Cost is legible on-page: pendant sears, knees buckle, city clock hands droop. Could use one more material loss (tool cracks?) to hit 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are singular—“can silence be mapped?”—and tighten through sensory attrition: each night the fruit dims, orchard breath held. The midpoint harmonic hum is the decisive intensification, converting ambient loss into audible pressure without external coincidence. Cost is legible: surrendering the hazel eye forecloses retreat to old symmetry, paying for the new theorem.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—visibility versus erasion—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens when the tape fragment offers a conduit to be felt. Escalation is textural: each cached object accrues weight until the tape ruptures the pattern by being found. Cost is legible: she forfeits immediate emergence, accepting continued solitude for resonance. No causal reversal, but the deepening of stakes under the Accumulative lens satisfies one meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—decode vs. belong—tightens when she lowers clippers, foreclosing dissection; the price is visible: dissolved notes, muddy blouse, synapse-fear. Agency is renunciation under Accumulative lens; one deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“thresh meaning from experience”—is signaled early and tightens through each unearthed artifact. The brooch’s pulse under moonlight is the single meaningful intensifier that reweights the stake from archival obsession to reciprocal haunting. Cost is legible: she forfeits her best brush and the brooch itself, accepting perpetual uncertainty as the price of sleep. Escalation is accumulative rather than causally reversed, fitting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: will she keep command over small wonders or admit darkness into her magic? Mid-scene tightening: pearl’s glow invites the shadows, narrowing her option to surrender. Cost is legible—loss of foresight, pearl extinguished. Agency is internal (acceptance) yet forecloses future certainty. Coincidence absent; escalation is because/therefore chain under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—can silence be made navigable—tightens when each returned memory forecloses the possibility of louder memorials. The micro-turn at the council meeting (offer a spoken rite, not a monument) is earned: Elira’s prior acoustic triangulations prove the only viable map is vocal absence. Cost is visible—the valve remains deliberately unpolished, its mute brass the permanent forfeiture of restorative triumph. Agency is accumulative rather than confrontational, fitting the lens; one deepening suffices and it charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“find the fortress”—tightens when arrows cease at the door and refusal costs her prior identity. Agency is renunciation: she absorbs the chorus, foreclosing the mapper’s detachment; price is the punch’s dissolution and her “not whole” dawn state. Escalation is accumulative: each whisper-layer deepens density until surrender is the only stance left.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake is the need to “sculpt space for reflection” rather than explain; pressure escalates as the tile offers entangled memories that could dissolve her skeptical identity. One meaningful tightening: the whale song threads through stone and tile, forcing her to decide whether to trust the unverifiable harmony—she chooses transcription, forfeiting scholarly certainty. Cost is felt on-page: she leaves the tile behind, descends without data, accepting perpetual doubt as price of gift. Under Accumulative lens, the cadence shift from observation to gift-making reweights the stake cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“what happens after goodbye”—is signaled early and escalates through storm timing, fragment vibration, and spatial mutiny that forecloses retreat. Agency is present: the immortal deliberately aligns the fragment with the storm, then chooses to step through; cost is the collapse of his refuge and irreversible exposure to the plain of endings. Under Accumulative lens, the deepening arrives via density of goodbyes heard and the final tactile pulse under palm. Cost is legible but generalized rather than sharply personal; hence high-band entry but not apex.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—fair-trade math vs inherited grift—tightens when ink dissolves diplomat contract; each subsequent signature narrows child’s retreat to vengeance. Agency is attention & invitation, not violence; price is half the ink and the father’s future exposure. Escalation is textural density: more names, more light under door, more risk of discovery. Cost legible in dawn exit: child carries reckoning, not money.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—sole authorship of invented histories—tightens when the lamp carries someone else’s texture, foreclosing her monopoly; cost is the loss of epistemic control. Escalation is accumulative: density of notations rises until pattern break; the “warmer, slower” resonance is the single decisive intensification. Agency is renunciation rather than combat—she chooses to listen instead of appropriate, paying with vulnerability. No coincidence; the foreign frequency is internally consistent with the lamp’s established magnetic memory.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving erased textures—tightens through accretion: each fragment narrows Elias’s path deeper into the maze and farther from official life. The tide rhythm forces upward climbs and reveals fresh cracks, a meaningful external pressure that shapes tactics. No reversal, but the deepening pattern forecloses return to citizenship; cost is visible in bodily fatigue and the open-ended sentence of endless collecting.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“decode the riddle”—tightens when each hum forecloses another external answer, forcing her toward internal silence. One meaningful deepening: from chasing external ghosts to confronting “the core of her own silence.” Agency is renunciation; she actively stops retelling, pays price of losing her tools. Cost is felt: shell cracks, compass dissolves—on-page forfeiture scales to 700-word frame.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—prevent carnival’s gentrification—signals early and tightens through each graffiti intervention; each mural raises visibility hence risk. Escalation is accumulative: density of coded images peaks when corporate scouts photograph “quaint decay” blind to the arrows beneath. Cost is felt in postponed contracts and the city’s continued creak, not in Lira’s personal loss; a sharper individual price would push higher. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; one meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“witness the last whisper”—tightens when she realizes the message is mathematically unreceivable. The irreversible chemical fracture at 05:00 is the single escalation; options narrow from “record” to “absorb.” Cost is felt: she forfeits the fantasy that anyone will decode the harmonic. No secondary reversals, but the one turn is sufficient under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—pollination or ten-year research loss—is signaled early and tightened by each wing click. One meaningful escalation: the anchor’s groan shifts from ambience to countdown, forcing the final exhale jump-start. Cost is visible—if the drone stalls, flowers die—so the pressure stays concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—finding the rivers’ origin—tightens via each falcon fragment and condensation response; options narrow to “witness or keep editing.” Agency remains internal yet active: whispering the seventeenth translation, kneeling, drawing the spiral. Cost is the loss of editorial distance; no coincidence resolves. Escalation is pattern-intensification rather than external reversal, fitting Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“rebalance through collapse”—tightens via accumulating resonance: each new ghost-sound is an audible price paid for revival. The backward-ticking clock and tongueless bell’s first swing are visible escalations; the final silence of the tuner’s feet shows the option of continued presence foreclosed, satisfying cost legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—harvest the ephemeral or perish—signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation is accretive: each memory-echo tightens the velvet quiet until stillness becomes lethal. Protagonist agency drives the final turn: she chooses to keep hand open while oxygen blinks its last. Cost is legible on-page—last bubbles, sinking body—foreclosing survival.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“before they find the bodies”—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens with each climb. The single decisive turn (lattice into lens) escalates from personal redemption to public revelation, narrowing options to irreversible fusion of truth and light. Pressure is accumulative/textural: each ghost’s arrival thickens air and bends light, reweighting the stake from secrecy to collective vindication. Cost is visible in the boy’s spent collapse and the perpetual haunting of the beam.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: transform curse into fruit; secondary: Elara must accept ancestral guilt. Tightening occurs when the bead’s resonance forces Elara to taste mercury-kiss memory—one beat, but it forecloses denial. Cost is legible: bride loses form, orchard loses stasis. Agency is attenuated yet present—Elara’s open mouth swallows consequence, not just nectar.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single stake: rewrite fate of broken precedents via sewing. Pressure intensifies as each stitch re-animates plate and canyon—one meaningful deepening, no reversals needed. Agency is continuous; coincidence absent. Cost is felt heat in her palms and the canyon’s exhalation of dead voices; tactics shift from quiet kneel to determined onward walk.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—recover communal rhythm—threads every beat; each unearthed object intensifies the cost of failure. The dial’s re-assembly is the single decisive tightening that forces communal arrival and her silent abdication. Pressure stays internal/textural, yet the forfeiture of heroic acclaim is a visible price. Slight shortfall: no external antagonist or time limit means escalation is more accretion than narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—no letter must disappear again—signals in paragraph 3 and escalates via each chalked grid that could be erased by sneakers or rain. Agency is renunciatory: she chooses ephemerality over permanence, accepting that only one child need freeze on “I kept your shoes” for the widow’s truth to survive. Cost is palpable: her own name stays unspoken, her grief unmailed. One meaningful tightening when the school-bell timing is plotted suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—prevent the coup via stitched deception—is signaled in paragraph 4. Escalation is textural: each new knot tightens the pattern of possible futures until the silver filament knot literally ties Ursa Minor to Cassiopeia, foreclosing royal death. Cost is visible: she collapses “cheek pressed to silk,” lungs scorched by cobalt flame. One micro-turn—stepping perceptually into the adjacent layer—changes knowledge, not territory, fitting the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=5.7)
    Dominant stake—“find the moment before deciding”—is signaled early but remains conceptual; no concrete external consequence is risked. One tightening occurs when the letters dissolve, narrowing her option to speak aloud, yet the cost is spiritual, never jeopardizing safety, time, or social capital. Agency is present—she places letters, releases shard—but pressure stays lyric, not perilous. Sufficient for accumulative design, but too diffuse for high-band escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preventing erasure of a child’s witness—surfaces in line 5 and tightens when the frantic spirals soften into tide-words; options narrow from decryption to stewardship. Agency is contemplative but active: each whispered phrase materially rearranges the cast’s surface, visible cost on the page. No coincidence; escalation is driven by her tactile decryption under anesthetic pressure. The final image forecloses the option to “heal” and crystallizes endurance as the only viable path.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—recovering lost creative joy—tightens once via the fragment’s emotional gravity; the projection is the visible price. Escalation is textural (density of color and memory) rather than causal narrowing; the sun’s cooperation is coincidence, not protagonist agency, so the cost is atmospheric, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—trade certainty for wonder—signaled in paragraph 5 and tightened when direct contact fails, forcing the ricochet gambit. One meaningful escalation: mural’s refusal → nickel’s tremble → sensory migration into her body. Agency remains hers; no coin-toss miracles. Cost is visceral: heartbeat retuned, tool lost, identity unmoored.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—smuggling an illegal language under cognitive tax—tightens when the scholar shapes living script visible from drones. Escalation: seed → dew-coded vine → communal recognition → agents’ future sonic exposure; each step shrinks margin for error and raises collective jeopardy. Causal agency drives every beat; no coincidence resolves. Cost is felt in the increasing number of civilians now complicit, foreshadowing mass reprisal.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—transmute grief into beauty—tightens via pattern intensification: lullabies fossilize into frescoes, audience grows despite her terror, postcard demands louder song. One decisive deepening: the card’s new line “They’re listening” forces her from whispered lullaby to full psalm, surrendering the last option of silence. Cost is legible: perpetual insomnia, exposure to an off-key wind that warps her voice, irrevocable visibility. Under Accumulative lens, density itself becomes escalation; no external antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preserve by abstaining from resurrection—tightens once: the caretaker’s refusal to shout louder even as the light fades. Agency is her micro-choice to whisper, not shout; the price is the ephemeral violet glow that immediately vanishes. Under the accumulative lens, the deepening is the incremental dimming of each aurora, reweighting the cost of preservation. No coincidence; pressure coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restore communal trust—signaled in para 1 and tightened by the living acoustic test: sing falsely → semantic collapse re-occurs. Escalation is causal: each recovered phoneme narrows the live option to withdraw or continue; final public performance forces irreversible communal stake. Visible price: empty ink well, tears, dust “snow,” curator’s awed silence—cost legible on page. Agency is hers alone—she composes, conducts, risks fracture.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—reconcile mechanical control with mercy—is declared early; pressure tightens when the chain snags on the fish-and-woman relief, forcing her to translate erosion into actionable data. Escalation is textural: each new inscription or resonance adds ethical weight rather than external jeopardy. Cost is conceptual—she risks being judged mad—but invisible to downstream children; the price is felt more in cadence than in plot. One meaningful tightening suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve lost songs—faces one decisive tightening: risk exposing her mother’s fire-scarred melody to strangers. The meteorite experiment escalates from skepticism to embodied resurrection, foreclosing the option to keep archiving in silence. Cost is visceral: the cracked-open ribs, the unsealed ledgers. No external antagonist needed; internal fear of exposure supplies coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“learn the rhythm of belonging”—is signaled in line 2; pressure deepens via pattern: each bioluminescent glyph is nature overwriting human blueprint, tightening the epistemic gap. No antagonist needed; the sea’s reclamation is coherent pressure. Single micro-turn: fireflies’ spiral mirrors reactor schematic—knowledge flips from drowned science to living invitation. Cost is conceptual but visible: she renounces immediate return, embraces carrier role, forfeiting prior detached observer stance.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“why paths disappear”—tightens once: from mystery to gift. The crater-glass vision is the single deepening that reweights options; cost is the surrender of certainty, felt in the pendant’s cool hum. Agency remains hers: she chooses to transliterate, to touch the glass, to scatter new seeds. No reversals beyond this, but one is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—“can monotony be transfigured?”—is signaled early and tightens through accumulating micro-audience conversions. Elias’s agency is attention itself; each ordering of randomness forecloses the option of forcing tricks. Cost is conceptual rather than tangible, legible in the physicist’s napkin and the runaway’s shell. No reversal or resource loss sharpens the final beat, capping escalation just below the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—memory versus outlaw—tightens once: finding the dust speck under the third waning crescent converts solitude into inscription. Agency is continuous; each dance stroke forecloses surrender and raises the price of capture. Cost is visible when feet bleed pigment the world tried to erase.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—“illuminate value in the mundane”—is declared, but no credible obstacle or trade-off ever materializes; pressure is atmospheric, not tactical. Escalation is a single texture-deepening (stone rings meet prism light) rather than a narrowing of options, so cost remains conceptual, not viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—can he release the children’s grief without breaking—tightens once when he adds his own vulnerability to the archive. No external antagonist; pressure is accumulative echo of questions. Cost paid in realtime: personal letter surrendered, box fractures opened. No second reversal, but single cadence shift qualifies under short-form.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“keep hope’s equations breathing”—is signaled early and deepens via each pattern/balloon cycle. A meaningful tightening occurs when the silver balloon returns frayed, trading 0.7° emotional latitude for visible wear on the thread. Cost is felt: she smiles at the fray, immediately begins anew—accepting perpetual partial victory as price.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“what walls dream”—is signaled in paragraph two and narrows from discovery to surrender when she leaves her own echo inside them. Escalation is textural: each found fragment (negative, diaries, hearth) raises the emotional tariff of carrying legacy. The decisive tightening is the moment she rolls her fresh sketch and places it with the diaries; this forecloses the option to keep mapping outward and forces her to become part of the archive. Cost is felt but could be sharper—an explicit ache in hand or breath-catch would have pushed to 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—return borrowed vitality without damage—is signaled early and tightens once when the mirrors shiver. The escalation is textural: each spectral ribbon adds density until the final bell-toll reweights cost. No external antagonist is needed; the ethical constraint supplies pressure. The price is the perpetual loss of personal memory (her name dissolved), felt but not dramatized as fresh loss on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—make peace a pulse, not a pause—is signaled early and tightens when the first sentry arrives; the pressure is textural (moonlight, ink, oaths) rather than causal, adequate for Accumulative lens. A visible price is legible—her palm warms the ink, sealing personal presence into the pact—but no option is foreclosed for Elira herself, keeping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can he buy back an echo—tightens once: the egg placed on salt equals irreversible gift. No reversals needed; the single deepening (cracks glowing, song rising) escalates via resonance physics, not external antagonist. Cost is visceral: the egg’s iridescence dims as its memory diffuses into terrain he formerly sterilized. Agency remains his; coincidence merely watches.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—return suppressed voices to the wind—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens through each untangling; each released sound is a micro-intensification that reweights the stake. Agency is pure endurance and tactile attention; the final thread’s surrender is triggered by her on-page whisper, not luck. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable: she becomes the absent print, forfeiting corporeal trace. One more beat where the released voices momentarily threaten or rebuff her would have pushed this into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—ethical accountability versus aesthetic distance—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens when he decides tomorrow’s show will use his own blood-and-honey avatar, narrowing safe options. No external antagonist needed; pressure is internal and accumulative: each recalled commission raises the moral bill. Cost is visible: the shattered-mirror eyes of the self-puppet literalize the price of looking honestly.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stake is singular: dignify vanishing before it vanishes. Escalation is textural—each knot increases the density of reverence until the final bow forecloses permanence. The tightening is visible: “tender—a bow that would unravel by dawn.” Cost is conceptual but undeniable—the shrine must disappear to fulfill its covenant. Agency is all hers; no outside antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.7)
    The dominant stake—can the nameless be saved from second death—tightens once when the caster chooses to pour his own identity into the bronze; the visible price is that he walks away nameless. Pressure is accumulative rather than adversarial; the risk of forgetting is dramatized more as looming aura than as concrete obstacle, so the escalation feels tidal rather than pivotal.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—retrieve/release grief via song—tightens when external melody fails, forcing internalisation. One meaningful deepening: sanctuary walls soften to moss, narrowing option to embodied release. Cost is felt (she forfeits the box), though pressure is largely intra-psychic; a second opposing force could have nudged it higher. Agency remains hers throughout; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—retrieve the dream—tightens once when the harmonic breathing begins to re-open the sky, raising the risk of exposure or failure. Cost is present (dream loses autonomy, maker loses future chase), but escalation is single-step; no mid-process complication forces her to adapt tactics, keeping pressure elegant rather than surging.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—"bridge generational wisdom before daughter forgets her"—is signaled early and tightened by each retrieved vow; the maple-leaf confession pinned to satchel is a visceral price that forecloses the easier path of verbal apology. Escalation is accumulative: each vow grows smaller, more personal, until the daughter’s own handwriting dangles like overripe fruit, forcing the mender to invent honey-spoon tactics. The cost is legible—the ribbon warms, the footprints prove risk taken—but because the daughter’s stance remains off-page, the final pressure is felt more by reader than by protagonist, keeping this just shy of the 8.5 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are signaled early: silence on nonlinear inheritance vs. Archive dogma. The single tightening occurs in the bathroom when the glyph appears, foreclosing the linear-inheritance paradigm and forcing acceptance of sideways theft. Cost is conceptual—she embraces existential instability—visible in the closing image of blossoms bearing her own never-lived names. No escalation loop; pressure accretes lyrically rather than through reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“will she re-claim an erased twin-self?”—signals early and tightens when the card sears flesh, forcing the valve-wheel choice. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length: the garden confrontation materializes the abstract conflict into literal fruit of names. Cost is visible: card spent, identity balance destabilized. Agency is hers; coincidence never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single dominant stake—restore coherence to an unauthorized door—tightens when each braid adjustment audibly alters the clock’s cadence. Price is felt: the door dissolves, foreclosing future access; she accepts this loss with faint smile. Escalation is measured, not explosive, fitting Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“find the quiet”—is signaled in paragraph 2; escalation is textural: each absorption brightens the stone and softens a being, tightening the sonic stakes. The central choice (offer the stone) forecloses her stored silence; price is legible as the stone dims and she walks on. No reversal, but the pattern deepens once meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“prove coincidences have meaning”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened when one misalignment could “collapse like sand under tide.” The micro-turn is the star-thread striking true: options narrow from search to revelation, cost is the fragility of the vision. Agency is cerebral (adjusting tripod by chalk on forearm) yet stakes feel visceral because the pavilion literally hums with pressure. No secondary pressure or antagonist, but at this length one tightening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—sculpt identity from vanished cultures—tightens when each shadow measurement sharpens her awareness of impermanence; the final short shadow flinches time itself, forcing stance crystallization. Pressure is accumulative: each silhouette adds existential weight rather than narrows external options; cost is conceptual but legible on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recovering the possibility of light—tightens when each tile strike risks silencing the mosaic forever. One meaningful reversal: silence on the third step tastes of ozone, flipping anticipation into dread. Escalation is accumulative: resonance lifts dust into constellation suspension, a visible density shift. Cost is paid on-page: rag forfeited, star’s solitary duration undefined—she may lose it again.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake: can love survive migration? Externalized as suspended speech inside grotto heartbeat. Escalation is textural—each droplet, crab scuttle, salt scent accretes until shared exhale forecloses immediate leave-taking. Cost is the conversation’s continued pause; agency lies in choosing not to decide, a stance crystallization paid with future uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“will the child taste an uncurated silence?”—tightens once, decisively, when gravity invert opens the hatch; no further reversals needed. Escalation is textural: each tasted silence layers density rather than narrows options, reweighting rather than redirecting. Protagonist agency drives every beat: choosing up, choosing to kneel, choosing sideways fall. Cost is felt: severance from father’s bunker = permanent exile implied, no safety net.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: transform passenger’s emotional static into quiet clarity; signaled when woman boards clutching letter. One meaningful tightening occurs when gondola tilts toward chime-trees—subsonic vibration physically loosens her grip; operator’s agency is body-tilt not engine-steer. Cost is passenger’s tear (hers) and operator’s continual readiness (his), both visible on page; no new external constraint introduced, so ceiling 7.2. Sufficient for length; no reversal required.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“find stair before sunrise erases it”—is signaled in first third and tightens through literal countdown; grayscale bleed supplies visible price. Agency sits with protagonist at each turn: peel mural, insert flake, choose self. One meaningful reversal: throne offers not power but perspective, forcing renunciation of artifact and orchard. Cost is legible on-page; escalation coherent under Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—teaching suffocation to breathe—is signaled in paragraph three and tightens through each sensorial return of ash and withheld knock. The decisive deepening occurs when she whispers “You are allowed to gasp,” immediately dissolving the threshold; this is protagonist-originated, irreversible, and carries the cost of the sanctuary’s negation. Under the accumulative lens, pressure escalates by density, not reversal; every echo rises, every scar flares until the stake is re-weighted. No coincidence; silence itself is the antagonist she masters by surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can she convert betrayed belief into something real—tightens with each jittering text until the bolt press forecloses retreat. Escalation is causal: spam texts → cryptic command → tactile convergence. Visible price: her IOU-scarred past is liquefied and crystallized, leaving her literally holding a glowing debt-token that will keep humming.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—dynastic obliteration—flips into self-restoration at the exact moment the cylinder confesses. Each crank turn escalates by narrowing future options: silence → partial confession → maternal voice → identity swap. Price is paid on-page: her revolutionary purpose collapses into dynastic duty she cannot refuse. No coincidence; the machine was waiting for her hand.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—capture the shape of possibility—tightens when capture is redefined as offering, not seizing. Escalation is textural: density of luminous nectar, inverted flows, threads that replace steel. Cost is felt in irreversible unarmoring and the dawn’s alien grammar. One meaningful deepening suffices; no external antagonist needed because orchard itself applies coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prove that love survives institutional erasure—arrives with the button and escalates through each dust revelation,foreclosing her prior detachment. Agency is continuous: she photographs, cross-references, opens “Magnifications,” accepts the supervisor’s box—each act narrows options and raises reputational/emotional cost. The final tightening is her public smile to volunteers, a stance crystallization that accepts perpetual excavation of pain as price of witness. Cost is legible on-page: “she didn’t heal by forgetting… she healed by magnifying small kindnesses” with the ache still present.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“will erased truth re-enter the public bloodstream?”—tightens once: when she uploads cassettes and power drains citywide, the broadcast’s irreversibility forecloses retreat. Cost is visible on-page: blackout, sirens, her certain arrest or death.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—prevent the prophecy’s time-unspooling—is signaled in the fourth paragraph and tightened when the prism’s glow narrows to a single chord. Escalation is textural: fog thickens, colors drain, droplets stall, each beat raising the metaphysical cost of failure. The protagonist’s agency is renunciatory—he dissolves rather than confronts, yet this very subtraction collapses the prophecy. No coincidence; even the final droplet is a causal residue of the dissolved prism.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—“decode the message”—tightens when the speck’s lullaby proves the arbor speaks in memory, not prophecy. Each embedded dust-speck raises the emotional ante: charred rye scent, medal clink, unshed tears. The grandmother’s emergence is not coincidence but cumulative pressure made manifest; it forecloses exile and turns the arbor into public sanctuary. Visible price: Elira’s tears, her satchel’s weight, the travelers she must now tend.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—order vs. uncertainty—signals early and tightens when the compass refuses north. The cavern runes foreclose the perfect-chart path, forcing Elias to jettison his watch; this single deepening carries visible price. No antagonist needed: internal contradiction supplies pressure. Coincidence (3-5-7 pattern) complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can she bear the weight of the names she refused to speak—tightens as each whispered syllable widens the coin’s cracks. One meaningful deepening: the shift from repairing the coin to letting it shatter beautifully narrows her options and makes the cost visible. Agency is continuous; every pour and murmur is an irreversible act that feeds the dust spiral. No secondary reversal is needed; the single intensification is sufficient under an accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: can grief be companionship rather than exile? Pressure tightens when confession layers peak at “unsent letters, unheld hands,” forcing her to risk clumsy flute-trill that might shatter integration. Cost is legible: gorge shudders, shadows peel, tooth’s serrated edge smooths—material price exacted from environment and tool, not her body. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversal required under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“discover the mathematics of mercy”—tightens via pattern accumulation: each trauma-echo is a datum, each forest ripple a live test. The protagonist’s agency is attention-based; by refusing to brace again they foreclose the old tactical stance, paying the cost of vulnerability. No coincidence; pressure grows texturally under the Accumulative lens. The final blue-shifted breath is the visible price—anesthesia leaving the soul, not the body.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—retrieve the lens to unfasten the historian’s calcified grief—is signaled in the first third and steadily deepens through each traded memory. Pressure escalates by accretion: every origami bird, vial of erased tenderness, and hidden brushstroke face adds density until the triptych literally breathes. The narrator’s agency is continuous—she pays, handles, guides—so the final weeping is earned, not coincidental. A visible price is paid twice: grandmother’s memory gone, lens energy spent—enough to satisfy cost clarity under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“discover what ceilings hide”—is signaled early and tightens once: spiral footprints vanish overhead, forcing the climb. Escalation is accumulative/textural: dust patterns deepen, silence thickens, object emerges; no causal reversal but a single meaningful deepening that narrows options to “witness or walk away.” Cost is conceptual—eternal custodianship—visible in evidence bag and gentle door click.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—compress eternity vs preserve perfect order—signaled in paragraph 5. Tightening occurs when the spiral-keyhole frost pattern forces the uncorking; options narrow from “study” to “release.” Price is paid on-page: library systems glitch, shelves self-rearrange, clouds drift in impossible geometries. Accumulative lens satisfied; one decisive intensification sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—recovering a lost grammar of equality—tightens when the shard proves illegible until mirrors are veiled, turning superstition into tactical necessity. Escalation is Accumulative: each stanza on silk raises the cost of failure while shrinking the revolutionary’s public identity to “romantic relic.” The final tightening forces him to trade legacy for listening, a renunciation that forecloses any return to heroic narrative. Price is visible: the last haiku relinquishes authorship to the reader—“We are the answer”—rendering his past victories inert.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“reclaim the light stolen by midnight”—is signaled in the wax-sealed note. Pressure tightens once: stone wilts → he must sing truth → dancer spins → light reclaimed. Agency is present; his song is the causal lever that transforms stone and shadow. Cost is conceptual but visible: the song seeps into his bones, implying perpetual vigilance. No second reversal, but one meaningful deepening satisfies scope.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stake—find the place where explanations fail—is signaled early; the single deepening comes when the compass flips from exit tool to inward guide, foreclosing retreat. Cost is legible conceptually (she seals herself below) but not viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.8)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—decode why flowers bloom at night—tightens through each etched discovery, reweighting her artistic vocation. One meaningful deepening: the lily beneath the saint’s robe shifts the quest from curiosity to vocation. Cost is visible—three nights of cold sketching, satchel lighter, heart heavier—yet pressure remains contemplative rather than jeopardy-driven, capping escalation just below the 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can the land be persuaded to speak—tightens when solitary whispering fails and she must offer physical apology in debris; each rebuilt message is a visible price (time, skin, pride). The lagoon’s counter-glow is not deus-ex-machina but reciprocal escalation: her bodily labor → its luminous testimony, narrowing her future to unending vigil. Agency remains hers: she chooses to kneel, to hum, to accept the hand on her shoulder, forfeiting academic closure for custodial openness.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—can the town become something new instead of a museum of itself—is signaled early and escalates through the accumulating lanterns that feed on “unspoken stories,” a deepening that reweights the silence from absence to resource. The protagonist’s agency is renunciatory: by ceding the bottle he forecloses the path of lone genius and pays the cost of diluted control. Cost is visible but soft: the bottle’s pulse “syncing with the lanterns’ rhythm” is lyrical yet not sharply painful; a stronger visceral pang (e.g., his workshop emptying overnight) would have pushed the score higher.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve vs. release emotional memory—tightens when the accidental prophecy redefines her mandate. The meaningful deepening is the orchard’s answering hum: options narrow to “release spores” or let the city stay sterile. Cost is legible in her trembling palms and the irreversible petal dispersal. No external antagonist keeps pressure interior, so escalation peaks at high-band entry, not apex.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: can memory-and-reverence actually decrease entropy? Escalation is textural: each named seed adds density until globes burst into visceral moments, narrowing options to “let go or freeze.” Protagonist agency is continuous—kneel, press, whisper, laugh—and the price is the hollow egg she must abandon. Cost is legible on the page: the sapling stands where silence was, foreclosing return to pre-hatch stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve unrecorded beauty—tightens when the rogue comet offers a one-time efflorescence that sensors will never log; his choice to merely witness narrows future options to eternal silence. Pressure is accumulative: each traced meteor deepens the stakes of remaining unseen. Cost is legible in tears and the final line “Thank you for remembering how to be still,” acknowledging the perpetual erasure he now embraces. No external antagonist needed; entropy is coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—preserve the architecture of silence—tightens once: when the beekeeper ghost meets her gaze, the option of release is foreclosed with gratitude rather than sorrow. No external reversals needed; accumulative pressure suffices. Cost visible in bodily wear and eternal vigil. Agency is renunciation/attention, not conquest.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—Vey’s need to feel time’s texture—tightens when the second urn fragment appears, narrowing options to “press together or remain broken.” Cost is emotional: heart restarts, old role abandoned. No external antagonist, but internal pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; one meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—beauty through incompleteness—tightens when the string snaps; Elira’s agency is to re-narrow options from “mend” to “weave,” visibly forfeiting the feather. Pressure is textural: each layer of torn paper intensifies the cost of letting go. One deepening suffices; the kite’s wobbling ascent is the earned reversal that makes incompleteness fly.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—interspecies respect as personal immortality—tightens through each copper wrap; every new resident species is a visible price paid from Arlen’s dwindling energy. The rescue of the sparrow operates as the meaningful micro-turn: it proves the orchard’s grammar works and forecloses retreat. Cost is legible in shallow breaths climbing the Spiral Stair; no coincidence dilutes the escalation. Agency stays in his fingers until the final linen knot.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—can memory be mapped—is signaled in paragraph 2; tightening occurs when the spectometer registers “only ambient humidity,” collapsing her hypothesis. Agency: she chooses to leave the amber, renouncing quantification for embodied convergence. No coincidence; pressure is internal epistemic failure. Cost is the forfeiture of data and the adoption of an unquantifiable “density.” One meaningful turn is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.9)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—translate distance into closeness—tightens when the handler’s voice emerges; the option to stop hunting bodies is foreclosed by the need to keep hearing her. One clear escalation: discovery of the bunker multiplies the workload from one cylinder to hundreds, visible price is sleepless nights decoding, leaf trembling in lamplight. Agency remains canine yet moral: he chooses who listens to whom, a curator with paws. Cost is persistent: each new cylinder adds another ghost to carry, resonance replaces rest.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—will she find a reason to stay that justifies exile—is signaled early and tightens when the violet seam appears: sketch it and confirm exile, ignore it and rejoin panicked normals. One meaningful escalation: the anomaly’s first glimpse forces her to decide whether the custom still matters in stopped time. Agency is pure attention and charcoal; the cost is irreversible commitment to anomaly-worship. No external coincidence resolves anything; the filament vanishes only after she witnesses it into her book.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“sky mends or fractures”—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens when the board reconfigures itself, foreclosing retreat. One meaningful deepening: the pieces glide autonomously, proving Elric’s amendment is irreversible and costing him control. Price is visible: rivers awaken but his sundial map erases, a forfeited future guide. Agency drives every beat; no coincidence resolves the sky.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.1)
    Pressure tightens once: theNomadic penumbra’s stripping clarity escalates from personal unmasking to collective refusal of the next sovereign. The dominant stake—whether absence can speak louder than ceremony—narrows to the moment the narrator spells “listen” at the ruler’s feet. Agency is intellectual (walking, placing the board) rather than physical risk; the visible price is the sovereign’s tremble, not the walker’s body. Coincidence is absent; escalation is purely accumulative.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—recovering “home” via texture—is signaled early; the single deepening occurs when the feather dissolves and gravity anchors her feet, foreclosing itinerant prophecy with visible price; pressure intensifies under Accumulative lens through density of haptic detail rather than causal reversal, sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—signaled in paragraph 1; pressure tightens when each re-woven thread re-creates the boy’s fracture. One meaningful deepening: the mirror refuses clarity, forcing acceptance instead of absolution. Cost is visible: she forfeits the right to erase her past, must “carry it lightly.” Agency is internal but active; no coincidence; escalation coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—refuse the spire’s hunger for singular truth—tightens with each session as mist thickens. Artist’s agency escalates via refracting others → refracting child → refracting self, each step raising personal cost. Final tightening forecloses elders’ expected parable; the canyon’s chorus is irreversible. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, density increase (mist, grief residue) reweights options until the rupturing dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“conjure meaning before acid breaches”—tightens with each lacquer pour that consumes breath and memory. Escalation is internal: every sealed crater forecloses denial, culminating in the tear-offering that spends her last air. Cost is visible: fumes thicken, floor lurches, workshop sinks lower. Agency is ritual, not combat, but narrows to life/death.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: restore self-trust after mirror-crack; cave supplies solitary pressure. No antagonist; tightening is sensory densification, not option reduction—valid under Accumulative lens. Cost legible: candle death, shell relinquished. Could use one earlier tactical loss (bruised knee, soaked sketchbook) to push higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can tenderness redirect ships?—is signaled by word 30 and tightened once: the scent’s release. Agency is renunciation/endurance rather than combat; she hazards her private creed on a single breath. Cost is legible (empty vial, knees buckling) but because no live option is foreclosed—she never considers shouting—the tightening feels gentle, not gnashing. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the density of scent-imagery reweights the stake; under Causal, the reversal is mild.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—map loss back into resonance—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens once: from passive waiting to active singing coordinates, narrowing options from silence to seepage. The moon phase supplies external pressure that she must obey, but the escalation is accumulative (each call adds a thread) rather than a causal reversal, satisfying the lens. Visible price: her bodily entrainment to lunar rhythm means she can never chart “straight” again—cost legible in the stiff-joint wane. No second reversal is needed at this length; the single crest to song is sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can she dispense calm without being shredded by her own truth—tightens when the seekers arrive: their flinch at unwrapped honesty forces her to trade truffles and the relic, narrowing her future options. Escalation is textural: each gust and creak amplifies the emotional static until the surrender of the eye crystallizes the cost. No coincidence; the seekers track her by rumor she seeded. Price is legible—she relinquishes her only buffer against the empathy virus’s rawness.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—decode the stranger’s breadcrumb—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens once when the alpine shard arrives; options narrow from “what did he mean?” to “do I pass it on or bury it?” The price is conceptual—Silas accepts custodianship of an unreportable truth—visible in the lantern image. Agency is observational rather than active, fitting the lyric mode, so escalation is a deepening, not a reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: rewrite regret vs. redemption via the doorway. Tightening occurs when ants foreclose refusal—follow or stagnate. Agency is Elias’s step through arch; price is his erased past life. Escalation is single but meaningful; coincidence (ants, matrix) complicates, does not resolve. Creek rise parallels pressure yet doesn’t contract clock—time felt abstract, not tactical—keeps score from 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“unravel the dreams or keep drowning in them”—tightens when the sky’s blood confirms the leak is her own buried grief. One meaningful escalation: the pool shows her signing the Edict of Silence, collapsing any return to old rule. Cost is visible: starlight scars her palms and the grotto seals, foreclosing future denial.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: can guilt be transmuted into collaborative material? Tightening occurs when Elias’s admission forces the alchemist to revalue guilt as pigment, narrowing options from forgiveness to co-creation. Cost is legible: Elias’s soot-streaked tears, her glowing arm, the cooled shell they must return. Agency resides in her decision to externalize rather than absolve.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—turn chaos into legible narrative before madness devours him—tightens when the scroll first repels ink, then accepts it after the jealous confrontation: a tangible trade-off. Each apparition raises the cost of continued mapping; the final scroll’s weight forecloses the option of forgetting. No external antagonist needed; internal pressure suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can she still “unveil miracles” without smell—tightens when Ren reframes the screw as opener, not clamp, foreclosing her self-label “fraud.” Pressure escalates via accretion of sensory lack and client memory; cost visible in swallowed throat and offered bow. No reversal, but one meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—turn scars into stories—signaled in paragraph 4; pressure escalates via ink-crystallization risk that could re-burn her. One meaningful tightening: when ink threatens to crystalize, she hums the lullaby, forcing a tactical shift that forecloses the safe scholarly path. Cost is visible—she finishes with liquid ink and scar-shimmer, proving the transmutation succeeded under live risk. Accumulative lens: each rune adds density until “breathe” releases the built pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—apology acceptance—tightens once: from certain rejection (“he didn’t look up”) to conditional truce (manuscript accepted). Cost is visible: her humiliation, his grief, the orchard’s scheduled death. Agency lies in her decision to expose the imperfect symphony rather than polish it. Under Accumulative lens, the golden threads’ intensification reweights the emotional stake without requiring causal reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake = clarity through unification; signaled in line 7: “she had come not to read, but to unify.” Spiral arbitration provides single escalating rhythm—each coil absorbs contradiction, tightening until surrender is only exit. Price legible: dictionary lost to light, self lost to hush. No coincidence; pressure is accumulative density, not external antagonist. Under Accumulative lens, one deepening suffices and lands with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming surrendered moments—signals early and tightens via the slowed pistons at 299; options narrow to “hold or release.” Escalation is textural: each backward number increases density until the harmonic hum forecloses standard time. Cost is conceptual yet legible: he forfeits forward life to maintain the fragile stasis, a price felt in the key’s residual warmth.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—how to let go without collapse—tightens once when Aris chooses to offer the diode rather than clutch it; this narrows her options from detection to release. Escalation is internal but legible under Accumulative lens: each pulsing cap deepens emotional density until the harmonic click reweights cost. No external antagonist needed; coincidence absent. Missing a second, sharper trade-off keeps it sub-8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—can she convert rebellion into responsible widening?—tightens when father’s collapse reframes risk as entropy. Escalation is accumulative/textural: each new scrawl increases pattern density and narrows her interpretive options until “traverse” becomes the only unread glyph. Visible price: she forfeits the safety of pure outsider stance when she writes back, exposing herself to an unknown network. Agency remains hers; the father’s clover is response, not rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—her need to keep estrangement fertile—tightens when the grief-stricken man’s accidental catharsis proves the method works too well, tempting her to test it on herself. Each misrouted call functions as a micro-intensification that widens the moral cost: strangers’ tears, recipes, paintings become data proving intimacy can be engineered, thereby shrinking her alibi for spectatorship. The librarian’s obituary recital is the decisive pressure spike: it demonstrates listeners will accept any elegy if the voice is warm, removing the last external barrier to self-experimentation. Price accumulates as emotional residue inside the disc—its swelling hum makes the tunnel physically smaller, forcing the final self-loop.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve small weights against erasure—signals in line 3 and escalates through accretion of lost marsh, silenced lullabies, absent Sunday clinks. Pressure is coherent but diffuse; no single proximate cause forces a visible trade-off on the page—each “cause” is named in reflective summary rather than dramatized as a live threat that forecloses an option. The tightening is lyrical, not tactical: stakes deepen via image density rather than protagonist-forced choice with observable cost. Enough escalation for high-band entry, yet stops short of the knife-twist that would make the cost viscerally legible beyond the ache of ink.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—curing loneliness through reciprocity—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens when the man demands entry into the moon rock; the option to preserve her own myth is foreclosed when she chooses truthful exchange instead. Escalation is textural: each new tale thickens the communal web until the final hug crystallizes cost. No coincidence resolves; the stone’s silence is the earned reversal that makes the warmth transferable.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—map emotional depths or be swallowed—signaled early and tightened when forest memories (mother’s goodbye, brother’s static laugh) surge as sonic bait. The stillpoint entrance forecloses retreat; silence absorbs all notes, exacting the cost of external guidance (ring abandoned). Agency is attention/renunciation under Accumulative lens; no false escalation, one meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—thresh meaning from regret—stays legible; pressure escalates via accumulating micro-edits that collectively loosen the timeline shoelace, a valid Accumulative/Textural tightening. Cost is present yet diffuse: the edits are small and almost “perceptible,” so the price feels aesthetic rather than visceral. Still, the sense of options reconfiguring satisfies the required turn.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—ephemeral creation versus permanent record—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened when the shutter clicks with no film, foreclosing archival safety. Agency is present-tense: each sign, count, and final click narrows options under the Accumulative lens. Cost is visible: the music “will vanish with the tide,” a forfeiture stated on-page. No coincidence resolves; the girl’s arrival complicates but does not save.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“rescue a forgotten promise”—is signaled in line 2 and tightens through each incomplete artwork that forecloses anonymity; the final intact portrait forces her public self-recognition at cost of lifelong exile above-ground. Escalation is textural: each new artifact increases density until the archive literally sings; price is felt when she accepts lifelong criminal status for memory’s sake.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—will she surrender to calibrated peace or keep the entangled alive—is signaled early. Escalation is cadence-deepening: garden frequencies almost lull, but her drumming re-ignites the internal choir, narrowing options to embrace rather than erase. Cost is conceptual (perpetual shared skull-space) rather than a new on-page loss.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: prove quiet truth beats loud power. Escalation tightens when storm erases auditory gait signals, forcing her to rely on new silent tools (coin, map); stakes sharpen from personal survival to testing her philosophy. Agency: she inserts coin, then chooses indirect justice—cost is surrendering confrontational satisfaction. Price paid on-page: assumption of risk entering Theta after dark, potential retaliation from Delgado.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will the next soul choose drowning—is signaled early and tightened when the new shadow appears. Guardian’s agency: she “nudged the shutter left—then right—then left again,” each micro-tilt narrowing the drowned woman’s options toward gentler submission. Cost is legible: guardian’s own withdrawal into shadow shows perpetual forfeiture of rest. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversals required under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can dormant curiosity be rekindled without owning the spotlight—tightens as each window forecloses Elira’s option to claim credit. The midnight synchronization is the decisive escalation: once the arbor glow is cast, anonymity is irreversible. Cost is visible (loss of recognition) but lightly felt compared to thematic weight; keeps this shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—freedom through surrender—signals early; pressure tightens each time the scrimshaw warms, the island flickers, and the whale-song peels her armor. One meaningful intensification: the bone flares hot, water at chest level, forcing the redefinition of self. Cost is visible—scrimshaw lost, cold regret endured, new path foreclosed to violence—under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—illicit grief versus forced joy—tightens when bouquet-box must pass scanner; success forecloses authentic mourning. Each whittling stroke pays visible price (wood surrendered without dignity). Agency: choosing compliance to keep carving hollows. Cost legible in certificate traded for interior erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—permission to speak again—tightens once: the sanctioned silence is lifted, but the poet must still cross the threshold of awe. The meaningful deepening occurs when “Unfold” converts law into elegy, foreclosing the option to remain merely an exile. Cost is visible: the colonnade’s completion-dimming signals that the poem can only be given, not kept. Agency is pure attention/renunciation, sufficient under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—can the broken courtyard be persuaded to “breathe”—is signaled in paragraph one and deepens through each plant spacing, tightening toward the shared kiln vow. Pressure is textural rather than antagonistic: every arrangement tests Elias’s belief that imperfection can sing. The final cost is the loss of solitary control, a felt narrowing of options even though the external situation improves.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—recovering textured connection—tightens via density, not plot reversals: each hue carries a visceral texture (cobalt longing, amber comfort) that escalates the emotional cost of listening. The single meaningful deepening is the moment prismatic color becomes tactile on her skin, foreclosing the option to remain merely an observer.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“teach withering to bloom again”—is signaled early and tightens through iterative acts of release; each origami surrendered is a self-imposed loss of proof. Escalation is accumulative: density of unmourned coordinates increases until the curtains’ stir confirms the circuit is live. No reversal in the classic sense, but the final resonance reweights her solitude into shared circuitry. Cost is felt: she forfeits witness, forever unsure.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—can a new cultural syntax be read before it dissolves—remains abstract; pressure is atmospheric, not tactical. No option is foreclosed; the tape is unspooled again without weariness or risk. Escalation is a gentle density curve rather than a tightening; the visitor’s recognition supplies the single reweighting, not the protagonist’s agency.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—break the cycle of forced forgetting—tightens when the atoms of nostalgia surge into her flesh, forcing a trade-off: keep the beautiful ghosts and remain paralyzed, or release them and lose tactile access to her daughter’s pre-silence world. The one meaningful turn occurs at the off-key hum: patternless song collapses the resonance pattern, foreclosing the option of curated memory forever. Cost is immediate—palms bleeding, veil darkened—and persistent: the archive’s glow is “extinguished,” the emotional imprint reservoir permanently altered. Escalation is causal, not decorative; each beat narrows her tactical range until only renunciation remains.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—preserve hope’s authentic texture—tightens when sanitized dreams erase shadows. One meaningful deepening: realizing the shadow metamorphosed rather than vanished forecloses her plan to “restore” fear; instead she weaponizes adaptation. Cost is visible: the stone’s warmth and the flicker of wind-bite in others’ dreams prove the price is shared. Agency is hers alone; no coincidence required.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—save remaining animals without re-infecting herself—tightens when reconstruction beat converts guilt into tactical plan. Price is visible: resignation letter, anonymity risk, savings drained. Coincidence absent; escalation is interior density increase rather than external twist, sufficient under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“translation not resurrection”—signals early; pressure tightens when tunnel opens, foreclosing safer daylight search. Agency drives every beat: she touches ring, walks tunnel, kneels, accepts seed. Cost is visible: seed merges, hourglass starts, spiral path replaces old quest. No coincidence resolves; ivy warning complicates rather than saves. One meaningful deepening suffices; no escalation drag.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“where unused love is stored”—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens when the letters are found, forcing a public vs. private archive choice. One meaningful deepening suffices: the shift from seeking storage to choosing release narrows options and carries felt price (she will mail letters to strangers, risk exposure). Agency is interior but active; no external antagonist is needed. Cost is visible on-page: “letters cradled against her chest like rescued birds,” ready for uncertain skies—this image fulfills the Q4 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—freeing stifled creativity—signals in paragraph four and escalates by density: each traced meteor snaps another chain, reweighting the town’s silence into song. The tightening is her bodily depletion versus the crescendo of voices; the price is her collapse, paid on page. Agency is continuous tracing; coincidence is absent. One meaningful intensification suffices for this length, and it charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=3.4)
    Dominant stake—"cultivate sparks"—is declared but never tested; no opposition, resource limit, or live failure appears. Pressure remains flat; the sought sphere is found instantly and awakens without cost or narrowing of options. Because no tactical adaptation or price is dramatized, escalation under Accumulative lens is absent. Closure image is poetic but not a consequence of conflict-driven trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—“rediscover the wild frontier of his mind”—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: dipping the gear into mercury makes it heavier, a micro-turn that foreshadows frequency-key revelation. Cost is conceptual (abandoning old cognition) rather than tangible; absence of a visible forfeiture keeps it below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—recover lost courage—remains thematic; no live option is foreclosed for the guides themselves. Escalation is atmospheric: twilight deepens into vigil, star-perforations accumulate; pressure is textural, not tactical. Because coincidence is allowed under Accumulative lens, the fox and found artifacts read as pattern, not resolution. Cost is conceptual; no guide forfeits anything tangible, keeping escalation legible but low-impact.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“is safety worth silence?”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens through the bolt’s absence. The single meaningful intensification occurs when the child’s whistle makes the abstract threat concrete, forcing the bolt’s restoration; this narrows options from perpetual silence to singular note. Cost is legible: the first piano sound risks literal structural collapse, a price foreshadowed by the east-wing cave-in memory. Under causal lens, escalation is efficient; one decisive turn suffices, though a mid-story micro-complication could have lifted it into 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. illusion—tightens once: the ink’s deployment forecloses retreat for both titan and populace. Pressure is accumulative/textural: each planted cipher raises the societal dosage until the font stains skin. The people’s belated recognition is a cost, but it lands off-protagonist; her own tactical cost (exile renewed) is implied rather than viscerally felt, holding the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—why paths disappear—tightens when 17-second lag proves the paths merely slowed. Agency is continuous: she tests surfaces, excavates code, chooses descent. Each beat forfeits a layer of empirical certainty, paying with rising solitude and professional risk. The glowing coral garden is not luck; it responds to her tapped summoning, crystallizing cost under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reignite rebellion vs remember—tightens when downward lenses reveal living script, foreclosing violence. Escalation is accumulative: each hum-layer narrows options until only communal song remains. Protagonist’s agency is attentional; cost is audible as thunder rolls and solitude dissolves. Persistent constraint: barefoot contact with stones required to sustain frequency.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—tradition must evolve or die—tightens when the Council-sealed embryo becomes the last live option. One meaningful deepening: the chant shifts from old liturgy to root-language, narrowing her path from decoder to midwife. Cost is felt on-page: she relinquishes sole custody of destiny, accepting joint authorship with the land. Agency remains hers; coincidence is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: will she surrender to fragmentation or stitch a new coherence? Pressure tightens as each threaded secret screams—pain is the price of coherence. The decisive turn is the barefoot step onto the tapestry, foreclosing retreat; spatial inversion is the visible cost. Agency is accumulative rather than causal, but escalation is legible and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“why does time thicken?”—is signaled in para 3 and deepens when she realizes the slow is for the witness. One visible tightening: the ink on her temples physically narrows options to vanish or not. Price is paid: her body erased. Slight reservation: escalation is intellectual rather than external obstacle, barely meeting 8.8 threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—will the letter ignite the city—signalled in paragraph 2 (“whispered to unravel regimes”). Escalation is causal: each beat narrows options—catalogue vs suppress → crack wax → flood networks → arrest. The tightening is irreversible: once emotional resonance transmits, guards arrive “within minutes,” but the option space has already collapsed. Price paid is her erasure and the city’s unstoppable sob; the regime’s scramble with memory wipes shows cost ricocheting back.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—continuity versus despair—is signaled early and deepens through accretion rather than reversal. Each micro-scene (ex-soldier, finger-missing man, child) tests Elara’s offer of quiet, but pressure stays conceptual; no concrete resource is ever at risk, blunting visceral cost. The final tightening comes via the child’s question, forcing Elara to externalize her creed; the seed wrapped in airship cloth is a resonant gesture yet does not foreclose a live alternative path. Agency is present but diffuse—she endures rather than gambles—fitting the lyric mode yet capping intensity short of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—catch the goddess echo—tightens once: the feral lullaby narrows options to “match pitch or fail.” Agency is continuous: every silence-sculpt alters the sonic soil and heats the spike, culminating in the conducting strike. Cost is visible—spike fractures, echo departs, constellations repurpose her tool—foreclosing future hunts. Escalation is textural density under Accumulative lens; no reversal needed, only the invert-moment that reweights sky/floor.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—exposing state erasure—tightens once: the rhythmic smoke pattern forces her from passive documentation to active dissemination. Cost is visible: once the folio leaves her hand, her own safety is implicitly forfeit (persistent constraint). Agency is pure protagonist drive; no outside savior. The deepening beat at 2:17 a.m. is causal, not coincidental, and forecloses the option of continued silence.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—silence her own complicity—tightens when the firmware speaks her crime aloud: “You left me in the static.” One decisive escalation: she shifts from client service to self-sacrifice, feeding her blood to the machine. Cost is visible—physical burn, permanent glyph, public confession tattooed on her skin. The tightening forecloses the option to walk away; she becomes the firmware’s new cradle.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“learn to hear meaning inside mess”—tightens when the mandala’s voices synchronize into one tone, foreclosing her old reflex to fix chaos. Cost is visible: tile fractures, mandala surrendered to erosion. Escalation is textural density, not causal reversal, but pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: can mercy be re-forged into justice-with-teeth? Pressure escalates via accretion: each renamed truth is a tessera added to the mosaic of possible futures. The magistrate’s whisper tightens the screw—his daughter’s laughter is the first live option foreclosed by the new mercy. Cost is felt, but the crowd surge after feels slightly frictionless; one more individual relapse would have sharpened the price.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—luring possibility from despair—tightens when the coin’s hover selects three living echoes; the ghost’s agency is to sing the lullaby that braids them, paying with her form. Escalation is Accumulative: density of temporal blossoms, upward water, chime-notes increase until the sapling ruptures the timeline. Cost is legible—her translucence thins to watercolor—meeting the 8.8 gate.

    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“speak the last human feelings”—is signaled early; pressure deepens as cave asks “Who remembers us?” forcing her to answer with body-heat song. One meaningful tightening: fossil floats, foreclosing passive mapping and demanding participatory response; price is relic’s dissolution, legible on page.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—whether private certainty can resist public collapse—tightens once when the canyon echo finally speaks, shifting her work from quiet salvage to shared seeding. The cost (lifelong patience, possible ridicule) is implied more than dramatized, muting visceral pressure. Agency is present—she places the button, dispenses jars—but external antagonistic force is diffuse (kings, temples), so escalation feels atmospheric rather than tactical. Meets 600-800 word allowance for a single meaningful turn without requiring multiple reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“fix the record”—is signaled early and tightens only once but convincingly: planting the microfilm forfeits any future use of those names. Prudently daring trait produces visible trade-off (risk of exposure vs surrender of asset). Pressure accretes via weather, not antagonist, sufficient for 750-word scope. Cost legible: she walks away lighter precisely because she gives away her last leverage.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—distill complexity into essence—tightens when ticking gutters fall silent, narrowing the coachman’s options to stillness and transfer; the price is his unending route. Passenger grief supplies secondary pressure, but her agency is off-stage, so escalation hinges solely on his stance crystallization—sufficient yet not multiplex. No reversal beyond the fog parting, but the cadence shift from drip to silence is a meaningful deepening that reweights cost.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—comprehending how the oasis resists entropy—deepens via accretion of sensory beats rather than external opposition; the single meaningful tightening is the decision to withhold fire, which narrows options from durable artifact to breathing vessel. Cost is conceptual yet legible: she trades permanence for resonance, leaving the pot vulnerable to ruin. Pressure is situational and gentle; a harsher test of her kindness ethos would escalate further.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—can she seed wonder without being caught or crushed—is signaled in the first paragraph’s “quivering hush.” Escalation is textural: each new prism raises the cumulative exposure until the neighborhood’s awe becomes the felt price. No reversals are needed; the tightening is the growing visibility of her presence. The cost is legible: she forfeits anonymity, leaves the prisms behind, and accepts the dawn that will expose her footprints.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—active resistance against entropy through realignment rather than mourning—is signaled in paragraph four and escalates via two beats: the tide floods the galleries (pattern break) and the stone-circle hum stutters (core resource failure). Each tightening is textural, not causal, yet reweights cost: first she races to save the sundial, then sacrifices atomic reserves to re-steady it. The price is visceral—marrow vibration, skin flaring gold—and permanently forecloses the option of pure preservation. Agency is unmistakable; coincidence is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—“will Aris rejoin the connecting thread at the cost of self?”—is signaled by the twig’s whisper and tightens once: writing the names forecloses retreat; no reset or luck intervenes. Escalation is textural rather than causally multiplied: density of names → origani flock → spiral glow → bodily unraveling, each layer raising the conceptual price under the Accumulative lens. The cost is legible on-page: physical dissolution and the irreversible forfeiture of future love letters. A second reversal is absent, but one meaningful deepening fits the 600-word scope; the tightening would feel sharper if an earlier failed attempt foreshadowed the sacrifice, keeping this just below the 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prevent psychological corrosion—tightens when the Unity Rally becomes the live test: if the counter-pulse fails, the campus tips to violence. Escalation is causal: each calibration narrows her margin, visible in oscilloscope jitter and student forum posts. Price is paid in real time: lost sleep, increased trickster irritation, and the open-ended vigil she embraces at dawn. One meaningful tightening suffices; no reversal overload.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—retrieve the harmonic cipher to stop spatial unraveling—is signaled in paragraph 3. Escalation is the incremental tightening of literal space: shoulders scrape, ceiling grazes scalp, until the only option is surrender to the key’s merger. That single deepening forecloses the old path (she drops the stolen compass) and is driven by her forward motion, not coincidence. Cost is visceral: the panic she pushes through and the forfeiture of her former toolkit.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—awaken empathy before erasure completes—tightens when the ribbon surfaces and again when Elira offers joint remembrance. Escalation is textural: each new mask/sketch increases density of absence until the keeper’s tears make the cost visceral. No reversal, but deepening that forecloses legal justice and stakes everything on shared mourning. Protagonist agency drives every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single dominant stake—reverse exile by proving maps predict weather—is signaled early and tightened when the stanza is revealed as control, not prediction. The act of typing it narrows options to one: finish the ancestor’s sacrificial diversion. Cost is present but abstract—sky cracks, alarms blare—yet no concrete price (injury, guild retaliation) is dramatized on-page, keeping it below 8.0 band.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake: transform “never” into sculptable possibility. Pressure deepens texturally—each scaffold flutter adds a fragment of forgiven regret, tightening the moral/emotional cost of letting go. The micro-turn is the flake warming and image clarifying, signalling that amnesty is live; the final relinquishment forecloses the option to keep the relic. Cost is visible—he loses the talisman and embraces disbelief—but the escalation is more atmospheric than tactical, limiting upper-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can he escape the looping path of predation/implosion—tightens when territorial markers shift from superstition to pedagogy, foreclosing the option of another startup. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens: each shard adds density (chalk, ribbons, lanterns) until the final laughter inside the train signals irreversible reconfiguration. Cost is legible: forfeiture of scale, money, and reputation traded for itinerant mentorship. One minor slack: CFO theft is narrated, not dramatized, blunting a beat of visceral price.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will she accept perpetual burden-transfer?—is signaled early (“quiet redemption”) and tightens when the telegram announces the last guardian’s death, collapsing her observer role into participant. The single deepening occurs in-dream: guardian’s plea forces her from deciphering to singing, a visible price paid as stars brighten and her throat becomes the conduit. Agency is hers; coincidence only alerts, does not solve.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake: resurrect the eclipsed covenant before the glade “forgets itself.” Tightening occurs when clipping sinks—only one chance, no redo. Agency is continuous: mapping scars, pressing key, breathing with earth—all foreclose retreat. Cost is her body locked into the node; options narrow to permanent fusion.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—how the living carry the dead—tightens when Kael’s lunge forces Elira to defend her method; the orchard’s retaliation narrows options, making the cost of her gentleness visible. Escalation is causal: her singing → root response → Kael’s entrapment → shared reconfiguration. One meaningful deepening suffices; price is Kael’s forfeited rage and Elira’s exposure of vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can he risk feeling again?—is signaled in paragraph two. Escalation arrives through density, not reversals: each catalogued relic adds weight until the cloth’s glow forces the trade-off. The cost is the surrender of epistemic safety; the payoff is the new project title typed on the page. Agency remains interior yet visible; no outside savior, no coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—will she decode transition or be consumed by it—tightens when her own academic ghosts surface; the invented “forgiveness” sign narrows options from scholar to midwife of meaning. Cost is visible: she forfeits lexical certainty, accepting an untranslatable glyph she bows to rather than owns. Agency is methodical renunciation, not triumph. A hairline slip: the geomancer’s stakes are told more than dramatized, keeping this just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserve wonder via routine—threads every beat; escalation occurs as the creel’s baptism narrows her options from “catalog truths” to “accept contradictions.” The moon-phase attribute is the pressure engine: full-moon sharpness lets her act, waning softness forces renunciation of certainty. No external antagonist needed; internal conflict compounds when new-moon doubt whispers “beautiful lies.” Visible price: she forfeits fixed identity, accepting perpetual migration of self. The final shelving under “Waning Wonder” crystallizes the trade-off—she can only archive, not possess, wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reverse isolation by activating the pearl—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens with each confession: every whisper forecloses her ability to remain a detached inspector. Escalation is accumulative under the lyric lens; the third confession (“envied the dead”) triggers the harmonic vibration that makes retreat impossible. The shell-crown act crystallizes her stance, visible cost = permanent receptivity to others’ hopes. No coincidence; pressure grows from her own syllables etched into spiral chambers.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake: learn grammar of flow to forgive self for flood abandonment. Escalation through successive graffiti that tighten moral calculus: “unfolded,” “path didn’t,” “draw them bleeding.” Each re-weights map-making toward visceral cost (weeping against wall). Agency remains chronicler’s—every datum is her decision to stay, play, document. Cost visible: leaves station rearranged, accordion fingers raw.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—access to the unspoken word—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when documentation starts altering the archive itself, forcing her to pay with her own pulse. One meaningful deepening occurs at the scent-memory of bergamot/rain: the archive demands she absorb someone else’s swallowed apology, narrowing her options to endurance rather than retrieval. Cost is visible—each new glyph scars her arm—but the final price is more conceptual than visceral. Sufficient for high band under Accumulative lens, but lacks a secondary tangible loss to push into 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—dream of restitution vs. empire’s demand for legitimacy—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens when the violin melts instead of being authenticated. Agency: Elira elects resonance over documentation, a choice legible in the telepathic broadcast and the melting act. Cost is conceptual but visible—empire’s symbol literally seeds its own overthrow. Escalation is single-wave (density of plant response) rather than causal chain, fitting the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single dominant stake—extract the spark of lucid stillness before universal oblivion—tightens through density, not reversals. Each pattern-memory (film-flicker, child’s heartbeat, pre-thunder hush) escalates by compressing time/space until silence hesitates; the chip’s glow is the visible price that forecloses burial or mourning. No antagonist is needed; pressure is ontological. Cost is legible: the scholar’s breath stops, the mortician will follow. Agency = renunciation and endurance, fully aligned with Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will she reclaim or reject the betrayer’s relic?—tightens once: the choice to wear the pin herself narrows future resentment to private endurance. Pressure is textural, not causal, but the lens permits it; density of incense-fog and ancestral echo reweights the cost. No external antagonist needed. The price (perpetual internal hush) is legible in the final breath.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: can she keep selling certainty after the shard exposes her own doubt? Escalation is micro but legible: each chime sequence tightens the noose—high thin note → three lows → “unhook.” The cloak’s removal forecloses the old business model; cost is the chill of exposure. No coincidence; wind is coherent antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: teach emergence-through-vanishing; signaled paragraph 1. Escalation = density of withheld explanation; each slower ripple tightens anticipation. Cost legible: Elira’s perpetual solitude implied by backwards aging; Kael’s loss of naive timeline. Agency asymmetric—Elira orchestrates, Kael endures—but the pedagogy itself is the pressure engine; sufficient for lyric/accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—becoming a living waypoint—tightens once: the pulse’s arrival inside the chest forecloses personal motion forever while enabling others’ survival. Pressure grows texturally: layered centuries, obsidian wings, fossil dust accumulate until the skimmer’s stance crystallizes. Cost is felt but could be sharper on-page; the sacrifice is more conceptual than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes tighten from exile → irrelevance → obliteration of self-definition. One meaningful escalation: the mist-walk forces an irreversible choice—step or stay—and the apple-tree doors foreclose his old definition of magic. Cost is visible: he gives up the keystone, forfeiting future mist-walks; the tightening is singular but sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—decipher vow/own fate—signalled in paragraph 2. One meaningful deepening: discovering his own pre-birth signature collapses identity into mythic time, raising existential cost. Escalation is textural: lantern-glow, salt-ink, ship groan layer until perceptual break occurs; no external antagonist needed. Agency remains active: he dives, pries, surfaces, relinquishes—each action forecloses safer path. Cost legible: solitude on pier, knowledge that can’t be shared. Coincidence (woman’s vanish) complicates but doesn’t solve; he still must choose to dive. No visible price alters later tactics, so stays below 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—whether to keep surrendering to lots or reclaim agency—tightens when un-asked static delivers the child-vision, forcing stance crystallization. Escalation is textural: density of coin-memories and backwards prophecies increases until refusal becomes the only non-repetitive move. Cost is the forever-loss of certainty, paid in the final coin-arcing toss. No reversal beyond the single required shift.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transform private grief into shared balm—tightens once: the naming sequence converts abstract sorrow into concrete beacons, foreclosing his earlier detachment. Pressure is accumulative: each beast named adds visible crystal, making the cost legible. Agency is renunciation rather than confrontation; the price is lifelong stewardship of others’ fear. No external antagonist is needed; the conflict is interior and sufficiently escalated under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: restore cosmic balance via bell-voice; secondary: personal absolution through patience, not power. Escalation is the slow tightening of droplet rhythm that narrows options—no chant, no spell, only measured seep. Cost is visible: months of dawn vigils, the bell relinquished, feet still cold. No antagonist needed; pressure is situational—sea’s held breath—forcing stance crystallization in the silent release.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—erase vs honor memory—tightens through each salvage beat; the accretion of photographs makes erasure impossible and narrows Elias’s options to surrender or bulldozer-face. One meaningful intensification suffices: the gazebo self-portrait crystallizes that the town’s toast-maker already knew the water was coming, so further denial equals state violence. Agency is Elias’s decision to stage the display and accept reassignment; cost is career trajectory and official censure. Escalation is textural/accumulative, consistent with inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—harmonize logic & intuition—is signaled early and tightens once: the crystal’s sublimation forbids repeatability, foreclosing pure rational mastery. Agency is surrender rather than conquest, a credible alchemical stance. Escalation is a single deepening, but it reweights options unmistakably. No external antagonist needed; internal conflict supplies sufficient pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—“preserve communal trust under uncertain silence”—tightens once: the vacuum after static is the pressure, and her single chime forecloses the option to speak aloud ever again. Escalation is accretive, not linear: each sensory detail (sky-whale sigh, vine pulse) deepens density until the arbor tremor forces the audible act that crystallizes her perpetual burden. Cost is the irrevocable adoption of a wordless language she can never retract. Slight deduction because the tightening is singular; no second turn, but that is within short-form allowance.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—emotional re-aliveness vs self-imprisonment—is signaled early. Pressure escalates by bioluminescent intensification: brain-pulse → tendrils → gold aurora; each tightening raises the cost of wrong action. The decisive choice—renounce ownership—pays visible price: Kael forfeits the comfort of narrative continuity and accepts permanent self-uncertainty. Under Accumulative lens, the escalating light-pattern reweights the stake until silence itself becomes the only viable tactic; coincidence never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—can Aris hold space for the grotesquely slow without forcing it?—is signaled at the vow and tightens when the shoot spirals sideways, forcing him to surrender control into the next room’s gravity-bend. There is no external antagonist; pressure is ontological: decade-long dormancy versus entrepreneurial clock. The meaningful turn is the sideways sprout that reweights “flow” from metaphor to literal physics in the Spiral Root room, visible price paid in lifelong delay of bloom. Cost is conceptual but legible: he forfeits conventional success for mythic latency.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—restore lost laughter—signaled in paragraph two; pressure tightens each time the tunnel answers with only fragments, narrowing hope from full resurrection to borrowed echo. His agency is the relentless singing that macerates silence; each attempt costs breath, dignity, knees on concrete. One meaningful deepening: the shift from demanding “give her back” to accepting “fragments are enough.” Cost is visible in cracked hands and weeping, but plateau feels slightly static before final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—friendship with uncertainty—tightens when the guardian must relinquish the pendant (the cultist’s loneliness-made-object) to midwife another’s awakening. Escalation is textural: each swallowed exterior increases internal pressure until the only release is external offering. Cost is on-page: the guardian forfeits its last relic of origin, foreclosing return to archival corridors. No coincidence; pressure is purely accumulative and self-generated.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“interrupt a stifling destiny of perpetual failure”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when he abandons purity for error. One meaningful deepening: the frost bloom spreads across the metal, forcing the final stance (carry the twilight rather than conquer it). Cost is visible: the serpent’s eyes become voids dripping liquid night—an irreversible alteration of the tool and thus future tactics. The escalation stays causal under the Accumulative lens; coincidence never intrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—“find the beginning in every ending”—is signaled in para 2 and tightened when she must sacrifice the fragment to release the chorus. One meaningful escalation: lunar perigee narrows the window from cycles to seconds, forcing the final tuning gesture. Cost is visible: loss of tangible evidence + city’s irreversible awakening. No fake reversals; coincidence only complicates (the archivist’s timing), never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes—give the vanished riders one solid world—are declared late but tighten fast; each ferry loss is a pressure click. Escalation is via pattern density, not reversals: tuning clicks sync with lunar pulses, foreclosing retreat. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral—he accepts eternal re-weaving—keeping it from the 8.8+ band where a felt price on the body is typical.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.9)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes—“will humanity re-learn navigation?”—tighten as students fail, then succeed; the semester climax is a meaningful deepening under Accumulative lens, but pressure is intellectual, not existential; no live risk (lost ship, dying settler) makes the cost abstract, capping escalation below the 8.8 threshold where a felt price must alter tactics on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—liberate a stranded child-echo—tightens once: from decoding pulse to transmitting lullaby. The girl’s panic flutter is the visible price; the tracer’s steady counter-pulse is the agency that forecloses abandonment. No reversal, but a meaningful deepening that swaps observation for intervention. Cost is felt in the tracer’s aching knees and the girl’s first tear-track.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“retrieve wisdom from systemic failure”—tightens through density, not reversals: ink bloom = single decisive intensification that reweights the residue. Agency remains Aris’s attention; no external antagonist needed. Cost is conceptual yet felt: the ghosts settle, Aris forecloses re-entry to living bureaucracy. Could edge higher if one material loss (tool, stamina, data) altered tactics, but the conceptual forfeit suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—resurrect a language—signals in paragraph 4 and tightens once: the diamond must be sated so texture can escape, foreclosing the option to hoard silence. Visible price is the diamond’s temporary dormancy and her bodily depletion (shimmering veins), legible on the page. Escalation is textural density, not causal reversal; the flock’s glyphs braid into audible syntax, reweighting the stake under the Accumulative lens. No antagonist needed; pressure is the canyon’s appetite and her own precision.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will Elara release the Gravity Dancer or keep hoarding bitterness?—tightens when the arrowhead hums and gravity hiccups, forcing the SEND decision with visible price: phone shatters, boots never touch ground again. Agency is her finger on SEND; luck complicates but does not resolve. Cost is legible—loss of anchor to old grief, gain of orbit-bound glyphs—but a single beat middle could have sharpened the trade-off earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—reawaken beauty—tightens via tactile cost: each bow stroke drains stamina, foreclosing retreat. Escalation is Accumulative: metallic tang → blush of real fruit; ticking stone → dew → sapling. One meaningful deepening at midpoint when first statue fractures; no reversal needed under this lens. Cost visible in blistered fingers and shell dust—price alters later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—deliver the storm so an eight-year-old hears thunder as proof her mother kept her promise—tightens the instant interceptors are reported near Sector Echo. Escalation is causal: tighter surveillance → reroute through ventilation shafts → risk of EM spike → need for weather disguise. The protagonist’s agency is to sacrifice personal presence (heavier chest) so the sky can speak instead. Cost is visible: stolen government property, criminal exposure, irreversible separation from the hand-off moment.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: beauty left incomplete is a wound; pressure escalates as each restored horse narrows the possibility of turning back—by dusk the carousel must spin or the wound gapes. The carpenter’s agency is continuous—every chisel stroke forecloses rest or speech. Cost is visible: splinters in skin, dawn-thinned mist, and the irreversible commitment implied when the first horse circles. One hairline slip: the “no map dared claim” phrase over-intensifies without on-page cartographic consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—stories must be reawakened or remain dormant—signaled in paragraph 5. Pressure tightens once: the scroll shivers, scarf glows, and the world folds, foreclosing the option to remain mere curator. Cost is visible—she returns humming, scarf now ghost-lit, her solitude deepened. Agency is librarian-initiated throughout; no coincidence resolves. Only one tightening beat, but it is decisive and irreversible under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—reclaim the runaway dream—tightens through each failed chromatic experiment; options narrow as she exhausts personal memories (mentor’s vanishing, surrender hour). One meaningful deepening: shifting from active pursuit to “simply waited,” which costs her the illusion of mastery and forecloses any further search. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves. Cost is legible: the returned dream is translucent, proof that reclamation still leaves absence, a price she accepts on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—liberate the fettered idea—signals in paragraph five and tightens when mirrors bar passage with weeping reflections. The protagonist’s micro-choice to bind his own wrist with crimson ribbon forecloses retreat, paying visible blood-in-stardust cost. Escalation is causal: each surrender of protection (hair → door, ribbon → self) raises the price of failure. No coincidence resolves; the final glow against his chest is earned forfeiture, not gift.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—recover stolen memories—tightens when the trawler breaks habit and the mushroom pulses; that single escalation is meaningful and causal. The price (she will lose remaining memories if she stays) is legible but abstract until the final scent hit; slightly less visceral than ideal for 8.8+. No false reversals; coincidence complicates rather than saves. Agency is hers throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: keep shadow contained while teaching resilience; each annotation ups the risk of mis-exile. Escalation is the cartographer’s despair → firmer strokes; her single forward peek shows stakes bite. Cost visible: she trades pieces of her coherence (tea on fingers, cracked reflection) for his growth. Coincidence absent; all pressure internal to library rules.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single dominant stake—keep wonder perceptible—tightens through each filament she spins; every memory spent is an option foreclosed. The crack of the shell is the decisive intensification; no coincidence required. Price is the permanent expenditure of private memory now woven into shared world-fabric.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—quiet itself—tightens as each knot’s silence is relieved; the blackened knot delivers the decisive intensification that forecloses her detachment. Cost is visible: sanctuary dims, her body slows, the fisherman’s raw confession lingers.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—prove that erased silence can still testify—tightens when spiral path emerges; each reel comparison forecloses the possibility of random shadow drift. Agency is attention itself: she chooses to sit and wait for dusk rather than excavate, narrowing her options to witness, not intervene. The single meaningful deepening occurs when software traces the organic spiral, converting archival noise into choreography; this reweights silence from absence to presence with conceptual cost—she will leave without ever touching brick. No external antagonist needed; pressure is temporal and epistemic.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—“understand the physics of letting go”—tightens through measured anomalies (0.3 °C drop, lunar perigee linkage) until the globe demands corporeal payment: seventy-three nights, starvation, sleep-deprivation. The single meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator realizes the globe is a receiver; this reweights every prior datum and forces the final renunciation. Cost is visible on-page: hollow stomach, humming wrists, vanishing artifact. Escalation is Accumulative: each new pattern shard increases density until the only remaining option is to surrender the instrument of knowledge itself.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“articulate unspoken needs”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the ghost demands the no-title song; refusal would orphan the ghost again. Agency is present: each spray arc is an irreversible mark that could expose her to mundane scorn. Cost is visible—tears, warm steel, the dawn-empty courtyard she’ll have to leave—but escalation is more textural than causal; the ghost’s reply feels like arrival rather than new jeopardy. Still, one meaningful intensification occurs: gold bridge arcs shift her from private communion to public invitation, foreclosing her anonymity.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—will she find a usable answer to grief—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: cipher glows amber at floor nine, forcing the lullaby-decoding act that reframes grief as companion, not enemy. Cost is conceptual, not tactical; no live option is foreclosed, so escalation stays lyrical rather than causal. Sufficient for the length and lens.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—prove emptiness remembers—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens when the cloud actually dissolves while she watches. One meaningful deepening: the shift from cataloguing to letting #112 scatter is the first time she permits loss to exit the ledger. Cost is felt but not externally durable; no tool breaks, no cable frays tonight, so the price is conceptual rather than tactical. Sufficient for 8-band, not 9.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—translate sky before obliteration—tightens through audible countdown groans; each brushstroke forecloses alternative escape. Meaningful deepening at midpoint revelation: “limit was not a barrier, but a lens” reweights tactics, accelerates painting. Cost is visible: charcoal-stained palms + irreversible dawn + closed eyes = forfeited survival option. Agency is renunciation/endurance under Accumulative lens; no reliance on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—map the next discovery—tightens through each hop that re-tunes living light. One meaningful deepening: hop “9” fires a league-wide beam, foreclosing anonymity and inviting pursuit. Agency is continuous: every chalk scuff is Arlen’s call; no coincidence resolves. Visible price: the open, watchful sky now demands future answers from him, not just the world.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.6)
    Stakes—“to learn the rhythm of repair”—stay abstract; no concrete price (tool, relationship, physical risk) is foreclosed when she accepts insight. Pressure accumulates texturally (mirrors, gears) but never tightens options: failure cost is never legible, so the final “understanding” feels like graceful receipt rather than earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—collective survival via migration—tightens once: chalk summons → bell rings → nebula appears. No reversible reversal, but the single deepening suffices for 800-word scope. Cost is conceptual (abandoning the orchard) rather than viscerally felt on-page, keeping it below 8.8. Pressure is coherent under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—make the end gentle—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens through each added lullaby pattern until options collapse into stillness. The protagonist’s agency is the slow turn of the spindle; no outside coincidence intervenes. Cost is rendered in the material dissolve of world into sigh, a felt forfeiture. One meaningful intensification suffices for Accumulative/Textural design; still, the lack of a live option foreclosed mid-scene keeps the score shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preventing one more ghost-voice—tightens exactly once: when the caretaker decides the arithmetic of souls outweighs his own safety, foreclosing the option to keep the nut. Escalation is situational: atmospheric frost plus the girl’s visible tremor crystallize the cost of delay, forcing the nut’s surrender. No reversal is needed; the single deepening re-weights the rule-set so that tomorrow’s maze is already harder for him. Price is legible on-page: loss of the blueprint he spent weeks decoding.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: transform separation into connection. Tightening occurs when she realizes scaffolds are meant to dissolve, not endure—this narrows her scientific goal and forgives her daughter’s death. Cost is conceptual but legible: she forfeits permanent control. Agency is interior (renunciation) yet drives future action (new polymer design). No external antagonist needed; pressure is grief vs. flow.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—trading personal void for others’ measured hollows—tightens with each sale; the seventh incision shifts cadence, making the lattice of light irreversible. Pressure is accumulative: 3.7 heartbeats, 12 grams, 1 dissolved home—each quantity adds weight to the vendor’s distributed burden. No coincidence; the patrons’ arrivals are lull beats that compound density. Cost is visible in the counter’s gleaming scars and the vendor’s felt lightness.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—“absorb or be torn by remorse”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens with each absorption beat. Escalation is accumulative: every pillar touched thickens the emotional sediment until the still-center basin becomes the lone remaining option. Price is visible: her skin burns, breath fogs, identity hollows; the pavilion’s audible groan marks the external cost. One meaningful intensification suffices for this length and lens.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—liberate the silo’s voice—is signaled early. Tightening occurs when the first Ukrainian phrase emerges, narrowing Elara’s task from “rehabilitate” to “answer in shared tongue.” Cost is present but diffuse—the weight’s permanent sacrifice is felt more by tower than by her—so escalation stays mid-high rather than top band. Pressure is coherent under the accumulative/textural lens: each added language layer increases density until the harmonic chime releases it.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single dominant stake—excavate abandoned dreams without drowning in them—is declared early and deepened when the child’s abandonment memory floods her, forcing a live trade-off: absorb the ache or lose the data. Escalation is incremental but coherent under causal lens: each synaptic merge narrows her escape routes from sterile lab past toward perpetual emotional archeology. Visible price: she forfeits the possibility of unambivalent joy—mirror’s pulse against ribs is the new perpetual stimulus she must service. Could wish for one sharper reversal, but the steady accrual fits the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—retrieve Seed of Vigilance—signaled early. One meaningful tightening: wall sighs open only after sigil tracing + dialect sequence; options narrow from “search entire grotto” to “this seam.” Cost is conceptual (world re-gravitized, chamber sealed) but not viscerally felt by Elira—she smiles, stakes deflate. Agency is present but low-pressure; gravity inversion does the work.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—break silence or endure it—tightens when analysis of cracks replaces carving wood; agency is cerebral but active. Cost is conceptual yet felt: the insulator’s former failure becomes the grove’s lung, foreclosing Silas’s old solitary listening; the price is the permanent exposure of his private symphony to the living network.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: rekindle covenant via self-alignment; pressure escalates through auroral density and magnetic hum. No external antagonist; tension is contemplative. Escalation is accretive—each sensory layer deepens inward stakes rather than narrows external options. Cost is felt as melancholic lightness, visible but not viscerally priced; lacks a concrete forfeiture that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—recover silence before fireworks erase it—tightens with each failed tuning; higher harmonics risk permanent clasp fracture (visible price). Agency remains hers: every switch of source (whale→child’s breath) forecloses prior timbre and consumes lantern oil/time. No off-stage rescue; fireworks complicate rather than solve. Cost is legible in her trembling fingers and tear-glint, but stakes never escalate beyond the diary’s surrender—no larger social consequence tested.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—equilibrium via bloom—signals early and tightens once: the stench forces a collective stance crystallization with visible social cost (villagers gag, apologize, soften steps). Protagonist agency is present but passive; she surrenders to the bloom’s teaching rather than steering the village shift. No tangible personal loss beyond the ephemeral stench; price is conceptual rather than felt. Escalation is atmospheric, not tactical, yet sufficient under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—uncover why the orchard refuses to die—tightens when the arrow’s bio-resonance property is revealed, converting mystery to responsibility. A single meaningful escalation: her decision to plant the arrow in the Grandmother narrows her future from exploitation to stewardship, with the planetary chord as undeniable price. Agency is continuous: every skim, sprint, and stab of the arrow is hers; coincidence is absent. The hourglass of inversion supplies live clock pressure, forcing the final commit before gravity reverses.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—prevent the next “singular convergence” death—tightens when each new gust reading proves the port’s post-crane “fix” only rewrote the kill-zone geometry. Escalation is textural: density spikes from 17-knot drop to zero to 22-knot cross-gust, each datapoint shrinking the investigator’s options until only human sensor remains. Agency stays front-and-center: he chooses to plant himself as bait, forfeiting dry detachment. Cost is legible: physical risk + conceptual surrender—he accepts the wind as sentient adversary.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“certify wonder as essential”—is signaled early and deepens through each chromatic chord that rewrites the cavern. Escalation is textural: the hush thickens, thaws, then dances; options narrow to “sing daily or let wonder brittle.” Cost is conceptual rather than personal; a visible physical price from the ringer would push this into 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can insight be harvested from catastrophe without repeating it—tightens through three collapsed-realm case studies revealed in the between-place. Each failure sharpens the cost of playing: too loud, too soft, too perfect. Agency is renunciatory: she chooses not to repair but to witness, foreclosing the “restorer” path. Visible price is the spent flute and the kept silence; the pilgrim offerings externalize the social cost she has internalized.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake: solve for the mathematics of emotion before the last star vanishes. Pressure tightens when each halo-use siphons its light, foreclosing further experiment; the final pamphlet costs her the fragment’s glow. No reversal, but a deepening—her earlier erosion-by-empathy becomes irreversible renunciation. Cost is conceptual, not visceral, keeping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—“germinate wonder in routine”—is signaled early; pressure deepens through the child’s breath-catching beat, but the tightening is poetic rather than tactical, so the cost feels diffuse under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“prove objects absorb emotions”—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened when the frost actually responds, forcing a live choice: record or sensationalize. The deepening is driven by her agency: aligning prism to ice-fern triggers the visions, and the cost is the vicarious wearing of the driver’s “heavy and damp” surrender. One meaningful intensification suffices for 700-word piece; no reversal is required under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—deliver the indigo-silver message—tightens when the only route is self-sacrifice; the solstice night provides the single meaningful intensification required at this length. Agency remains hers: she dismantles the loom, threads twilight, and chooses the final throw. Cost is visible on-page—memories transmuted into glyphs, body gone—so the trade-off is felt, not abstract. No reversal is needed; the deepening of silence into expectant breath suffices for Accumulative escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—prove meekness can transmute rubble into hope—tightens as silk dwindles; each gift is an earned micro-turn that narrows Arlo’s option to keep any magic for himself. Visible price: last length sacrificed to fix glyph, foreclosing future forge-magic. Agency drives every escalation; no coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—uncover the withheld truth about her mother’s sacrifice—is signaled in paragraph three and tightens when the crystalline core floods her with foreign guilt. One meaningful deepening suffices: the moment she learns her own existence is the divergent splinter, every prior choice is re-priced. Agency remains hers; she chooses to step back through the veil, accepting responsibility. Cost is visible: the shard flares then dims, and the bay re-collapses into silence—options foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving the fragile chain of anonymous hope—tightens when the lamp dies, forcing a visible trade-off: Elias must externalize his bottled safety into public stones, risking recognition. Agency is renunciation/attention rather than confrontation; the cost is the cementing of lifelong solitude. One meaningful deepening (lamp snuff) narrows options under accumulative lens; coincidence merely flickers the light, does not resolve it. Price paid—safety externalized—alters later tactics: he hums louder, accepting audible exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“steer the world’s dreaming edge”—is signaled early; pressure deepens when star-needles stitch urgent warnings, forcing the nightly ritual to produce the inverted-shadow flare. Cost is conceptual but legible: futures are repossessed from algorithmic weariness, yet the herald’s exhaustion is only asserted, not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stake is early and singular: learn why some lives catch light. Pressure accumulates through pattern, not plot—each sunrise observation tightens the weave of possibility until the oblique-glance insight reweights options. No external antagonist is needed; the tightening is the shift from replication to self-fracture, paid for in public exposure of her tear-scaled cloth. Cost is legible in the patrons’ wordless weeping and her own relinquishment of explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—can sorrow be mapped like stars—tightens when sextant overloads with arboreal dreams, forcing her to trade calibration for memory cartography. One meaningful deepening: “She didn’t need to fix it anymore. She needed to follow it.” Price paid on-page—she forfeits technician identity and accepts open-ended guardianship of witnessed grief. Under Causal lens, each because/therefore linkage holds (moonlight heals → dreams project → she renounces repair → forest claims her). No coincidence resolves tension.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—restore communal dawn or remain in endless night—is signaled in paragraph three and tightens through each added voice; the option of permanent fragmentation is foreclosed when the largest mica sheet shatters. Escalation is textural: every new singer increases vibrational pressure until the physical environment yields, a legible deepening under Accumulative lens. The keeper’s agency is renunciatory—she risks total loss of personal fragments by communalizing them; the price (her private memories diffused into shared light) is felt on-page. One minor slack: the baker-soldier-weaver chorus appears in rapid roll-call, blurring individual stakes, but the collective tide still carries cost.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake: can empathy survive in a society that brands it unorthodox? Pressure deepens through pattern accumulation: each paradox title mirrors her own “mistake” until the atlas of a country erased by its own map becomes her self-portrait. One decisive tightening—whispering her name at midnight—reconfigures exile into sanctuary. Cost is legible: she forfeits anonymity and invites dawn confrontation. No causal antagonist appears, but the library’s epistemic authority supplies coherent situational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming felt sacredness—is signaled in paragraph two. Escalation is textural: each sensory layer (ivy swallowing sound, bread staling, lanterns dark) tightens the pressure to either surrender to creeping normality or perform a counter-ritual. Guerrilla gardening is the single decisive agency that forecloses passive mourning; seeds literally block the courtyard’s erasure. Cost is visible: her exposure (no shawl) and the bread’s abandonment to rot.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—conjuring meaning before oblivion—is signaled early and tightened by the ticking fade of the lantern slide’s illusions. Escalation is purely accretive: each decoded vow increases the perceptual cost of loss, culminating in the violet forgiveness spike that forecloses further sampling. The price is conceptual rather than visceral, acceptable under the lyric lens but keeping the score just below the 8.8 gate that would require a felt bodily toll.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—prevent the truce—signalled in paragraph 3; pressure tightens when disguises fail and Marla’s hounds sniff silence, narrowing to the single fob touch that collapses the deal. The false-start gambits cost her visibility and skin (gin spill, scraped knee), visible on page. Sunrise deadline is ambient but not actively tightening tactics within the scene; hence not max-band.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.6)
    A single dominant stake—will she surrender the storm-bearer and her doubt?—tightens when honey taste signals chosen-ness. Escalation is accretive (taste shifts) rather than adversarial, but each sensory switch narrows options. Cost is diffused into landscape; a sharper personal price would elevate. Agency is present in every step-taste-move.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—will she uncork or remain dammed—tightens once: the lock rattles only after she visualizes every suppressed line, foreclosing retreat. Cost is legible in the sizzling tear and the father-portrait’s released tear; agency is internal-visualization, not external antagonist. One meaningful deepening suffices for this lyric-accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—recover lost confessions—tightens with every found slip; escalation is textural accumulation, not causal reversal. One meaningful deepening: chest of origami letters shifts map from route to responsibility. Cost is visible: each reread reverses wilt, making archive role inevitable. Coincidence absent; pressure coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—preserve the color of wonder—tightens when the child’s untaught reaction proves the method works; that moment forecloses nostalgia or rebellion as motives. Escalation is accretive: each seasonal adjustment adds resonance until the tuner’s exit transfers agency to wind. No reversal, but deepening of responsibility into post-human continuation satisfies accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—quieting inner static—tightens when the magnetic shift threatens to overload the core, forcing the burn escape that trades containment for integration; the price is the irreversible grafting of garden to machine. Escalation is one deepening under Accumulative lens: fear-orbs → harmless light → roses absorb, a single cadence shift that reweights cost.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“will the story inside the locket reach its keeper?”—tightens through Elara’s refusal to knock, narrowing her option to only humming; the visible cost is four dawns of uncertain return and final surrender of the object. Agency is present but low-heat; escalation is more accretive than perilous, fitting the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—retrieve deleted memories—signals in paragraph 3 and tightens as each coffee spiral foreshadows the doorway. The meaningful deepening occurs when the galaxy pattern dissolves into whale vertebrae: knowledge flips, options narrow to step-through or retreat. Cost is conceptual but legible: she accepts exile from normal gravity/time, signaled by lantern flame that casts shadows not touching ground. No antagonist needed; pressure is ontological.

    <question>5</question><grade>8.8</grade>
    <comment>Theme emerges entirely through image-pattern: memory as sedimentary gravity, grief as salt crystal accretion, love as pressed flowers that finally unlock the threshold. No thesis statements—final line is pure image: “silence gleamed.” Subtext in the aster’s silver-veined pulse reweights the earlier beach-pluck as sacrament. Complexity preserved: reunion is wonder, not cure; outside, the whale still glows, bones exposed. The wildflower set becomes a non-literal answer to where deleted selves go—into pockets where gravity forgets to fall.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“will the sky forget dawn?”—tightens when the whisper reframes the prophecy as plea, not warning, forcing summoner to trade certainty for perpetual listening. One meaningful deepening suffices: the coded dread dissolves into guardianship. Cost is conceptual (endless vigil) rather than visceral, visible in the final “quiet purpose,” keeping it just below the 8.8+ band that would require a sharper felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes tighten from epistemic (can she decode walls?) to existential (will the building claim her?) through a single deepening beat: exchange of seal for key forecloses retreat to mere observation. Agency is intellectual—she risks complicity by carrying the cipher downstairs—yet the price is tangible: eternal Tuesday tea-truce is forfeited, “no sugar borrowed, no lies exchanged.” No reversals are needed; the hinge is the moment brass touches iron key, a cadence shift that makes silence louder than speech.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—translate isolation before dawn—signals early; pressure escalates via the accretive fading of stars, a cadence shift that narrows temporal options. Protagonist agency is the deliberate act of archiving each memory node; no coincidence resolves. Cost is the shell’s silence and the irrevocable release—tactics altered because she can no longer re-listen. One meaningful tightening suffices; no reversals required.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—free the land from inherited guilt—signaled in para 2 and tightened once: “shall be cursed” → “may be pardoned” forecloses retreat. Price is visible: blood-ink, dissolved key, lifetime anonymity. Calibrated treason is agency, not luck; aurora flare complicates but does not resolve. One meaningful escalation is sufficient for 700-word window.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single dominant stake—retrieve stolen resonance—tightens when each sung verse visibly shrinks the entity; the price is her raw throat and the shell’s silence, felt on page. One meaningful deepening suffices for 600–800 words; escalation is lyric but coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.7)
    Single dominant stake—salvage uncorrupted echo—tightens when the whisperer realizes the child only wants delivery, not return, narrowing her option from keeper to relinquisher. Escalation is textural: dream shards accumulate until the globe’s ice-window placement forecloses possession. Cost is felt (she smiles faintly, leaves the shrine empty-handed), but the tightening is narrated rather than dramatized in scene, capping high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is epistemic: prove the stillpoint network exists. Pressure escalates by density accretion—each found artifact (letters, diamond, plaque) tightens the pattern rather than opening new external threats. The one meaningful deepening is the plaque reveal that spatializes the stillpoints; it forecloses the option that this orchard is unique and forces her next walk. Cost is conceptual (sorrow for buried orchards) rather than viscerally felt, keeping the score below 8.8.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges as the inverse of scarcity mythology: the lie of curse disguises a gift of sustenance. Subtext is carried in glints, pulses, and growth rings—never sermonized. The final image of the diamond beating “like a second heart” reweights the Stillborn Star from devourer to life-anchor without moralizing. One hairline slip: the phrase “comfortable lies tasted like safety” edges toward thesis statement, but it is buried mid-story and instantly re-grounded in soil action.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—will her shadow-rich dawn out-signal Kael’s sterile unity—tightens once: when she chooses hijack over silence. Cost is legible: her raw voice exposed to continents, no fallback. Escalation is accumulative: each decoded fragment raises psychic density; final broadcast is the single pressure spike. Slight deduction for off-stage Kael—his threat remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single dominant stake—protect the Heartstone—tightens when sonic harpoons introduce dissonant cost; her counter-frequency is a visible forfeiture of remaining strength. Escalation is coherent under Causal lens: each tuning action narrows options until only symbiotic resonance remains. Price is legible: post-rupture collapse to the floor, key now warm with transferred energy.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—replace spectacle with stillness—tightens through accretive beats: each night she forfeits noise, draws crowds into silence, risks erasure. One meaningful deepening: spring thaw threatens her ice-stage, forcing the final cartographic act. Cost is visible—she forgoes anthem, flag, even celebration—yet agency remains hers; no coincidence resolves. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; silence becomes the irreversible victory.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—whether acknowledgement of buried trauma is worth career suicide—tightens when she chooses to leave the lantern as anchor, trading evidence for resonance. The reversal (faulty wiring → memory rupture) narrows her options: she can seek justice or grant rest, not both. Cost is legible in the inked names and the foreknowledge her report will be buried.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—earn forgiveness by finishing the impossible heart—tightens each time a spring snaps or a rotor grinds, eliminating false solutions until only sync-with-melody remains. Escalation is internal yet visible: successive tool choices, growing coffee-cup cemetery, incremental sweat on brass. No external antagonist needed; pressure is the mechanism itself refusing his virtue. Cost accumulates in scraped knuckles, sleepless dawns, and the final realization that grace is maintenance, not triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“ring a bell no one hears yet”—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightens when the algorithm feeds on ancestral desire. The transliteration beat narrows options: fail and the bell stays mute; succeed and she forfeits rest. Cost is visible in her cracked voice and the workshop’s shriek. One meaningful escalation suffices; no reversal required.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“where do deleted files go?”—tightens when 0707 shifts from glitch to temporal coordinate, forcing her to decide whether to weaponize the archive against itself. One meaningful escalation suffices: the mass-resore act can’t resurrect bodies yet guarantees corporate reprisal and perpetual vigil, a visible price paid on-page. Accumulative pressure accrues through recurrence, not multi-reversal, satisfying lens demands.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reconstitute her own capacity for empathy—signals early. Escalation is accretive: each mirror glimpse deepens the pattern, tightening the internal demand to “choose differently.” Cost is visible: shard warms, breath fog clears, ice literally opens—options narrow to act or retreat. No external antagonist needed; pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“learn the sound of approaching endings”—is signaled in paragraph 5 and tightens when the parasol’s chime collapses distance between listener and glacier. Protagonist agency: she walks toward the shearing shelf, foreclosing rescue; cost is the swallowed marina and her half-frozen body. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversal required under Accumulative lens. Cost is visible, but secondary losses (volunteer relationships) stay abstract, keeping score below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can asymmetry be honored without merger—tightens once: from letter confrontation to vine parable to shared silence that forecloses reunion. Escalation is Accumulative/Textural: each vineyard detail layers density until the frost-sweet grape forces a sensory re-cognition of difference as value. Cost is legible in the deliberate space they finally leave uncrossed.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“preserve the echo”—is signaled early; escalation is textural: each clearing thickens the air’s resonance until the last “satisfied” murmur forecloses further action. Cost is felt exhaustion and the pavilion’s irreversible sanctity. Agency is continuous attention rather than a single decisive act, fitting the accumulative lens. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—transmute pain into living breath—is declared early and reiterated. Pressure accumulates photograph-by-photograph rather than tightening through external opposition; each image is a micro-intensification that deepens her commitment. No reversal or tangible cost is extracted beyond emotional absorption; the stakes remain internal and static. Because the lens is Accumulative, one deepening suffices, but the absence of a trade-off or foreclosed option keeps the score mid-high rather than exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—“does the past contain a reproducible pattern?”—tightens through density, not reversals: each strike thickens the textual record until the echo flips the question outward (“What grows now?”). Agency remains hers; she abandons transcription, paying with professional identity (notebook shut). Cost is visible and felt. No off-stage rescue; coincidence is absent. Sufficient single intensification for 600-word frame.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—capture the sound of aging—tightens through audible intensifications: each chalk screech deepens the sonic strata until the “low, wet sigh” surfaces; prophet’s agency is relentless dragging of chalk that consumes his only tool, paying visible price. No external antagonist needed; pressure is ontological—time thickens audibly and chalk dwindles. One meaningful deepening suffices: the discovery of the knee-crackle sound reconfigures all prior hunts as rehearsals for this vanishing moment. Cost is legible: chalk worn to nothing, prophet left trembling, footprints softening—options to continue hunting are foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—harness the ephemeral—tightens when the leaf-memory restructures time itself; the option to “freeze” is foreclosed. Escalation is textural: spinning accelerates, foundations shake, then synchronize into braid—pressure crystallizes stance. No coincidence; the leaf sound is memory-triggered, not random. Cost is legible: perpetual exile in braided time, camera click that captures only echo.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—presence-with-peace—threads from first line; escalation is density-driven: each mundane hymn thickens the scent-of-hope air until spirits turn toward one another. No antagonist needed; pressure is internal-external fusion—voice tiring, shard cracking, guests drifting. One meaningful deepening: final lullaby dissolves the shard, foreclosing any earthly return. Cost is legible but diffuse; lacked a single visceral forfeiture to reach 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.7)
    A single dominant stake—where shadows literally go—tightens each night as the key’s resonance shrinks the false-noon window; the seventeenth-night threshold crossing is the meaningful turn that narrows options to becoming the keeper or losing shadows forever. Cost is visible: the key burns with recursion, and she forfeits normal daylight. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes after the crossing; a second tightening would have pushed this into 9+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—can stolen children become sacred through deliberate tending—tightens once: the town’s myth shatters when the substitute’s lavender-stuffed chest is found, forcing the skeptic to invent a new redemptive ritual. Pressure is textural: each lyrical fragment (tooth, soil, vine, maze) accrues until the final pulse makes the cost undeniable—she forfeits both certainty and personal closure. No external antagonist needed; the cleft itself is the pressure. Slight reservation: escalation is single-crescendo rather than layered reversal, keeping it just below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“collect shapes of hopes without capture”—tightens when each cameo offers renewed temptation to narrate. Escalation is accretive: seeds become punctuation, dog-tag clinks, dancer dissolves into ink-rain; each intensifies her refusal to fix them in prose. Cost is the shelled silence she accepts: no catharsis, only witness. Agency is attention that forecloses the published ending.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—restore sacred practice—signals on line 3 and tightens when the vine’s first quiver makes failure concrete. Escalation is accretive: each musical phrase deepens the arbor’s response until the doorway opens; no external antagonist is needed because forgetting itself is the pressure. Elara’s agency is continuous—every note is a choice—but the climax is cooperative (spirits join), so the visible cost lands on the land rather than on her body, slightly muting personal jeopardy. Still, the irrevocable infusion of song into soil forecloses a return to silence, satisfying the “felt price” test.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stakes are thematic (preserve wonder) rather than tactical; the only tightening is the seasonal lull lifting, which prompts sealing the archive, not risking it. Because the protagonist never confronts a credible threat to his project, escalation is atmospheric, not option-narrowing—cost is conceptual, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“take weights”—is signaled in the man’s first line. One meaningful tightening occurs when the weaver redirects the lamp’s resonance onto herself; this narrows her future to perpetual endurance. Cost is visible: the locket calcified, silence internalized. Agency is present (she orients the lamp, twists it off), but because the external conflict is a one-way service, the escalation feels incremental rather than decisive; the rebound onto her own burden is telegraphed early, muting surprise. Still, the lens-consistent accumulation of fossilized grief satisfies the required deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake: turn loss into vessel, signaled early. Tightening occurs as each wood curl literalises “contain”—material stakes replace emotional ones. Cost is legible: scorched kettle, unfinished lion, forfeited comfort of tea. Agency remains internal; could edge higher with one external impediment (a splintered grain that risks splitting the mane and demands a risky re-cut), but pressure stays coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake = “can the terminal breathe again?”—signaled early. One meaningful tightening: thermal whisper forces descent, redirects entire project; live option (seal the leak) is rejected with visible trade-off (endless labor). Cost accumulates under causal lens—every redirection buys warmth but adds maintenance debt. No coincidence; all pressure stems from her探测 decisions. Closure forecloses fantasy of finished restoration; resilience now equals eternal recalibration.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake = silence vs. song; the crystal’s arrival is the single tightening that reweights the stake, forcing Elias to test whether silence must equal death of music. Cost is visceral: droplet ruins the page yet resurrects it, foreclosing public performance forever. Agency remains internal—endurance of stillness—yet it narrows future options under the accrual lens. No external antagonist needed; pressure is the accreted hush itself.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—need to comprehend, not possess—tightens when the seeker resists grabbing the locket, narrowing options from acquisition to insight. One meaningful deepening: inscription reframes lies as self-protection, forcing stance crystallization. Cost is the forfeiture of heroic treasure narrative; he carries “peace” instead of proof. No reversal, but deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—preserve living memory—tightens when Havel demands proof of intent; each knot learned narrows her future path. Agency is present: she asks, mimics, accepts the rope. One visible cost: she forfeits her former seed-collector identity (“You’re not collecting seeds anymore”). Escalation is gradual, accumulative, but the final tightening beat is soft—no irrevocable act, only a promise.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—how to keep the gone present—signals in paragraph 1 and tightens when traveler folds the obituary into a crane, shifting from private archive to public offering; this narrows options (can no longer hoard memory). Cost is visible: relinquishing the written life to wind and stranger risks eternal erasure. No antagonist; pressure is situational-lyric—garden’s autumnal decay and silence of departed ships. Under Accumulative lens, single meaningful deepening suffices; here the glow of thread plus burial of crane supplies felt escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reawaken beauty—tightens when each calibrated pendulum forecloses another escape route; the egg’s glow is the visible price paid. One meaningful escalation: hypothesizing → wiring → palm-press → world retune. Agency remains prince-originated; coincidence absent. Cost is palpable: acid scars on fingers, chandeliers exploding, laughter of ministers now silenced by live birdsong.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—how to carry an arsonist’s legacy inside a firefighter’s skin—tightens once: the coin’s dip literally threads water and memory together, foreclosing denial. Pressure is accumulative; each sensory layer (salt air, obsidian shards, whale-song resonance) deepens the cost of vigilance. Price is visible on-page: she accepts perpetual return, radio already pulling her away. No external antagonist needed; internal combustion is sufficient and coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—liberate memories—is signaled in paragraph 5 and escalates once: box click → memories pour → first fountain re-moistens; option set narrows from “follow next breadcrumb” to “accept residue and move on,” a visible tactical shift. Cost is legible: she forfeits the box’s stored emotional ballast (lighter now) and accepts perpetual circuit of fountain labor. No coincidence; pressure remains coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens as density of released scent/sound/warmth reweights civic silence into reverent hush.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—“share light without burning”—is signaled early; tension tightens once when the gear’s teeth begin to sigh, foreclosing the ancestral fire-path. Escalation is textural: each returning echo thickens warmth until the garden brightens; cost is diffuse—loss of blaze, gain of shimmer—visible but low-heat under Accumulative lens. No credible resource loss or tactical alteration occurs; serenity dominates, so pressure feels aesthetic rather than endangering. Closure reweights options, yet the trade-off is conceptual, not visceral, keeping score below 8.2.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restore shared balance—tightens when storm breaks the rake, exposing the hidden mandate to let grace enter. The pendulum pause is the single decisive intensification: perfection becomes surrender, foreclosing the path of eternal winding. Cost is legible: thebob resumes under mercy, not duty. Coincidence (storm shatters rake) complicates, does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“will she disturb the dead’s silence at her own cost?”—tightens when each unraveled thread mirrors her own buried choices, foreclosing the option to remain merely curator. Escalation is accumulative: every decoded knot increases personal exposure until the lullaby forfeits its soothing power. Price is visceral: her sleeve thread becomes the stitching medium—permanent loss of fabric, permanent change of role.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“seed innovation within constraint”—is signaled early and tightens once: from forcing revolutions (past) to coaxing resonance (now). The lake, ink, feather, and humming parchment progressively narrow her options toward invitation rather than control; cost is visible when she accepts misreading as the price. Agency is interior but legible; no reversal, yet a meaningful deepening under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can she coax stories back from dust—tightens when the dial burns hotter and demands her tears as catalyst, visibly narrowing her safe anonymity. Cost is legible: singed skin, wept ink, and the leap into outbound transmission that can no longer stay hidden. One decisive escalation suffices under accumulative lens; no reversal is required.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—crystallize emotion before it vanishes—tightens once: the rocker stops, she scatters the last ash, foreclosing further delay; cost is legible (ashes gone, chair motionless), though escalation is single-note, not multi-turn.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—memory vs. amnesia—signalled early; pressure accumulates via each salvaged artifact, but no reversal or fresh trade-off emerges. Council’s steel obelisk is declarative, not an active obstacle that narrows his tactics; escalation is atmospheric, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—whether to re-open herself to the risk of teaching—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the girl speaks. Escalation is accumulative/textural: each memory of former students raises the tally of what she has already lost, increasing the cost of trying again. Agency is renunciation of renunciation: she does not lunge for revival, but allows the possibility to inhabit her defended space. The price is legible but low-band visible—no concrete object or time forfeited, only the fragile stasis she nursed; hence stops short of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—create beauty from ruin—tightens through each prune-cut memory that narrows Elara’s options toward curation rather than conquest. The seed’s germination is the decisive irreversible turn; no coincidence, only celestial alignment working as taught. Cost is visible: lifelong un-harvested tending, synaptic rewiring of her own grief. Pressure escalates accumulatively: memory-drops accrue until the soil shimmers and the beam ismapped.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.4)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—liberating trapped house-spirits—tightens once: the shard’s placement is irreversible, foreclosing her chance to keep the remembered rooms for herself. Cost is legible in the “soft thrumming” she surrenders, yet the escalation is a single crest; a second micro-turn could have pushed the band higher.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—capture the texture of missed opportunity—is signaled in paragraph three and tightens when equations vanish and the die keeps rolling non-sevens. Escalation is accumulative: each absorbed proof digests intellect into propulsion, narrowing options to either keep bleeding math or accept absorption; the liquid moment forces a trade-off—touch the past, lose the die. Cost is visible in the empty pocket and the taller stance that follows; perpetual motion is re-priced from sentence to sentence. Agency remains credible—he chooses to speak proofs aloud after carving fails, then to touch the reflection—each shift alters tactic under rising pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—can dormant empathy be re-ignited without publicity—escalates through successive real-world kindness pulses traced to her glyphs; the tightening occurs when the billboard projection forces her anonymity to fray, visible cost being the meeting with the teen that ends her invisibility. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes—“rescue dying arts”—escalate accumulatively: each Friday loaf lures another timid performer, tightening the communal risk of being heard from outside. The snare-drum beat is the visible pivot that forecloses silence; cost is legible in trembling hands, not in Elara’s personal loss. Pressure coheres but remains collective; Elara’s own safety is never on the block.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“unravel fate’s cruel arithmetic”—is signaled in paragraph one and escalates through each insertion of yoyo-heart, mainspring, and gear. Each beat narrows options: stone blooms, lighthouse beam reverses, memories flood, paradox gear materializes. Cost is legible in collapsing lighthouse and dissolved hunger-stone. A second tightening beat could push it higher, but the single crescendo still forecloses any return to prior determinism.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—“trick fear into revealing its weakness”—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: when the dream-dictionary paradox is read aloud, the funhouse groans, mirrors shatter, options narrow to confrontation. Escalation is Accumulative/Textural: density of cursed reflections increases until the protagonist must externalize the dread. Cost is legible but conceptual rather than visceral; no tangible loss (blood, time, tool) is forfeited, keeping it below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: can sound reshape a threatening sky? Pressure tightens when the sea thickens to “obsidian glass,” foreclosing retreat. Prophet’s agency drives escalation—each strike narrows cloud patterns until Kael’s final blow dissolves them, paying the cost of irreversible change. No coincidence; the generated storm responds only to played notes, keeping causality clean.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—prove the watchers answer—signalled first paragraph. One meaningful tightening: watcher turns head → option space collapses from theory to mortal confrontation. Price legible: city denial, elders’ scorn, risk of joining lost expedition. Coincidence absent; escalation driven solely by her pattern-language agency.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—rescue truth from national myth—signaled in paragraph 2. One meaningful tightening: realization that publishing raw would “snuff the lantern” forces her pivot to metaphoric method; this narrows her path and raises reputational risk. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; pressure tightens but never becomes bodily endangerment, capping escalation just below high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—translation of absence into witness—tightens when the copper-tube letter forces Elara to cry, proving stoicism can’t fully armor sensitivity. Each note is a micro-cost, foreclosing personal comfort; the empty inkwell is the visible price. Escalation is accumulative rather than causal-reversal, but pattern break (no more ink) reweights stakes. One visible loss (original letter re-sealed) alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“give the silenced a syntax”—tightens when each artifact proves deliberate erasure. Escalation peaks at Master Index reveal: “we knew… they buried us anyway,” forcing her to risk surfacing with evidence. No off-stage rescue; her decision to stamp the codex is the irreversible turn. Price is felt: blackout persists, water colder, path out longer—options narrowed.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserve wife’s last dream vs. release it—tightens when the basilica hums a new key, forcing the choice to shatter lanterns. Escalation is textural: each lantern shard adds refractive weight until silence itself becomes the decisive polish. Cost is visible: the shadow drinks, the isle detaches, the cranes fly counter-physics. Agency is renunciation rather than triumph; the sideways drift forecloses return.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—map unused potential of annihilated futures—signaled in paragraph 3 and tightens when simulations keep collapsing, forcing physical hunt. One meaningful escalation: final coordinates force her to abandon the observatory’s safety. Cost is legible: she forfeits orbit, supplies, and any last tether to pre-strike life. Agency pure: no coincidence, only iterated failure → jump.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—decode belonging frequency—signaled early; escalation is atmospheric rather than tactical: harmonic visions intensify internal stakes until external search is abandoned. One meaningful tightening: visions force recognition that missing pieces are internal, foreclosing further signal hunt; cost is conceptual—loss of external certainty. Protagonist agency resides in attentional renunciation rather than overcoming antagonist; still a visible forfeiture of former identity. No coincidental rescue; closure stays internally generated.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—"quell the tremor in her ribs" by finding the withheld truth—tightens once when the father-carving surfaces, again when memory floods, forcing a visible pivot in profession. Ticking watch and dissolving carvings externalize cost, satisfying 8.8+ gate. Agency is crystallized in the final interior vow to "become the sieve," a trade-off that forecloses the profitable lie.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—align heart/action—tightens when each pole forces a named reckoning. The backlash of regrets complicates rather than resolves; the final narrowing is the choice to paddle without a named course, paying the price of surrendered control.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—kindle empathy—signaled in paragraph 8; escalation occurs when submerged artifacts (chairs, child’s shoes) force raw proximity, tightening from abstract guilt to visceral recognition. One meaningful deepening suffices: fractal ripples reveal refused choices, reweighting the cost of leaving the ball. No antagonist needed; pressure is ontological—lake remembers. Visible price: forfeiture of the signed ball = forfeiture of time-travel proof, felt on-page: “They didn’t retrieve it.”

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single dominant stake—reforge bond beyond death—signals in line 3 and tightens when the spices actually start levitating her; option space narrows to surrender or lose the echo forever. Agency is continuous: crushing, whispering, surrendering, walking onward. Cost is legible: grief translated into body-altering flame and the new covenant that she must now “tend” forever. One meaningful intensification suffices for 600-word texture piece.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost time—tightens when the saucer becomes a threshold she must enter, surrendering reclamation for blessing. Escalation is textural: each birthday tracing accumulates until the pattern breaks at the cracked saucer, forcing renunciation. Cost is visible in the sealed crack and the smudge of earth on her tattooed wrist. Agency remains hers throughout; clouds respond to her chant, not chance.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—reaching the Echo-Realm—tightens once: the birthday-party tear provides the exact joy-frequency needed, forcing the final stitch. Cost is conceptual (her shadow detaches, the ship sighs into obsolescence) rather than tactically paid; the escalation is lyrical density, not narrowing options, fitting the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure intensifies by pattern deepening rather than external opposition: each bug-release tightens the emotional ante—buried ember, borrowed memory, her own unlived life—until the final self-release forecloses the path of perpetual flight. The dominant stake (transform grief into grace via release) stays coherent; the only reason it doesn’t breach 8.8 is that the cost, while felt, is borne by the world more than by her tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—the revolution’s ignition—tightens once: blackout + dimmed lanterns = single chance to plant ciphers. Cost is conceptual (exposure at dawn) rather than personal; no live option is foreclosed for the protagonist herself, so pressure plateaus rather than spikes.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—transform curse into usable wonder—escalates through tactile density: each painted rock laid under aurora glow intensifies the tension between foresight and surprise. The tightening beat is the large eel’s hover: it forecloses retreat and forces the stance crystallization from resistance to alignment. Cost is on-page: the curse yields a memory instead of a prediction, trading control for participatory mystery, felt in the “soundless laugh.”

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—control over her own archive—signaled early. Pressure tightens once: timer hits zero → she renounces immediate release, embracing suspended breath as tactic; this narrows options under causal lens. Cost is legible (she swallows the poem’s oxygen), but no secondary constraint or loss reshapes tactics afterward; storm peaks yet doesn’t further complicate her stance. Sufficient for 8-band, but lacks a second ratchet or material forfeiture that would push 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is epistemic: will they extract a usable map from silence? Pressure tightens through micro-calibration—each dawn’s observation narrows today’s margin of error. Agency is collective and non-violent: rotating a card, tracing a shadow, deciding to leave the tool behind; yet these are irreversible acts that foreclose ownership of the discovery. Cost is conceptual and ongoing—once the overture is “performed,” their lives become itinerant argument, a price legible in the final “everywhere it’s been forgotten.”

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: can beauty be planted in anarchy? Pressure tightens when poem replaces coins—material survival traded for symbolic survival. One meaningful deepening: candle + seeds make the trade irreversible; a physical forfeiture paid on the page. No antagonist needed; situational pressure of ruin plus grief suffice. Cost is visible: she forfeits her last coins and her protective cynicism.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—fracture destiny’s script—signals early and tightens through each modulation. The meaningful turn: 11:59 silence pools, options narrow to one unwritable chord; playing it costs the reel and rewrites dawn. Price is visible—burned celluloid, clock that will never again stop, arbor drained of starlight. Under causal lens, escalation is cleanly because/therefore; no coincidence rescues her.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—protect cultural memory from monsoon erosion—is signaled early and tightens when the ridge blooms early, accelerating the clock. One meaningful deepening: tremor shifts risk from abstract forgetting to immediate, irreversible mis-interpretation. Agency is Aris’s decision to plant the last seed after voiced doubt; option to wait or test further is foreclosed. Cost is legible (seed gone, no control group), though emotional sting could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single stake: transmute regret into breathable color. Escalation is accumulative: each lace instruction thickens presence until indigo rises—one decisive intensification rather than causal reversals. Agency is ritual attention rather than risk; the visible price is the island’s soil permanently darkened, a tactile loss. Coincidence absent; pressure coherent under lyric lens, but because Elio never faces a live fork, options don’t narrow—depth rather than jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—perceiving decay as accumulation—is signaled early and deepens through Elira’s methodical layering of dust, which narrows her scientific identity from neutron stars to ecological phenomenology. Agency manifests in renunciation (abandoning gloves, journals) and attention (tracking dew on leaves). Cost is visible: colleagues deem her retreat a “breakdown,” yet she endures, transforming isolation into pedagogy. Escalation is textural, not causal, fitting the Accumulative lens perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—finding purpose in rupture—is signaled early and deepens via the frost-ledger synchrony, which narrows her path from passive survival to active transformation. Agency drives escalation: she chooses to retrace, to fuse shards, to gift rather than sell. Cost is legible in the kiln’s salvaged bricks and shattered glass—material proof of subtraction-as-survival. Coincidence (frost matching script) complicates but doesn’t resolve; her interpretation and action earn the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—rectifying silence’s misinterpretation—tightens when thermal mappings transform regret into C512 resonance. Agency drives escalation: each fork strike is a deliberate act that deepens emotional thermals, narrowing options to sensory translation alone. Cost is felt in irreversible loss (voice, crew) and the physical toll of isolation, crystallized in the “frost-heaved floor.” Coincidence never resolves; wonder emerges from disciplined method.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—giving unrest a permanent address—is signaled early and deepens when the lens broadcasts “mothers calling for children.” The undertaker’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to dismantle, embed, and activate, each act narrowing retreat. Cost is unmistakable: he trades passive exile for eternal duty, yet the price feels earned, not imposed. The “tidal pull of unfinished business” coheres under Accumulative pressure, with no coincidence resolving conflict—only his stubborn attention answers the dead.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—sustaining intergenerational bonds under siege—is signaled early and deepens as sanctions tighten. Elira’s agency lies in endurance and attention; her refusal to claim credit forecloses individual heroism but enables collective resilience. The escalation is protagonist-driven: others join not by decree but imitation, altering the scale of resistance. Cost is unmistakable: exhaustion, risk, and emotional burden carried in silence, crystallized in the “heavier” baskets bearing seeds and mittens.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—locating unused love—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens decisively when the tear appears, foreclosing physical search in favor of breath-led surrender. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she alters breath to navigate, kneels without words, matches tidal rhythm. Cost is unmistakable: she trades the hope of retrieval for permeation, a spiritual recalibration paid in relinquished control. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure grows via sensory density and cadence shift, not external opposition, yet remains coherent and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—discovering time’s texture—is signaled immediately and escalates when the halo contact triggers garden inversion and photo disintegration. This tightening forecloses Elira’s reliance on photographic anchors, forcing barefoot immersion as new tactic. Cost is visible (ash), felt (weeping absorbed into wood), and conceptual (memory as consumable thread). Protagonist agency drives escalation: her touch initiates the crisis that crystallizes her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—breaching the vault before the wall falls—is signaled early and tightens via the ticking clock (“wall coming down tomorrow”). The liberator’s agency drives escalation: decoding keys isn’t luck but earned strategy from studying journals. Cost is unmistakable: she plants spores knowing she may not survive, and leaves the acorn key as inheritance. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each scattered seed deepens the thematic and tactical commitment to resilience over resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—capturing the sound of trust breaking before it’s too late—is signaled early and tightens through protagonist agency: she feeds her sister’s absence into the forge, triggering the decisive crack. Escalation follows the Accumulative lens: density increases until the fracture’s whisper reweights all prior silence. Cost is unmistakable: cellular countdown (“every new blood cell a whispered countdown”), physical depletion, and irreversible departure. Coincidence never resolves; the breakthrough arises from her methodical, grief-driven labor.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—translating fate through stolen instants—is signaled early and tightens via the moonbeam jar’s depletion, which narrows the thief’s capacity for intervention. Escalation is driven by her agency: she chooses whom to guide, at what cost (the jar empties). Each act forecloses further action, culminating in near-emptiness. Coincidence complicates (lovers scanning crowds) but resolution stems from her deliberate codes. Cost is unmistakable: the jar cools against her ribs, a tangible price for revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—trading control for curiosity—is signaled early and escalates through protagonist agency: each narrated action (sweeping, resting, blowing glass) reconfigures space into inquiry zones. The meaningful deepening occurs when she seals the bookmark inside a sphere, transforming relic into anchor—a visible price paid for preserving memory amid melt. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens, culminating in Charged Poise where options (occupy vs. initiate) crystallize with felt cost: she walks away so others may unfreeze. Coincidence never resolves; all tension arises from her deliberate renunciations.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—freedom from betrayal’s legacy—is signaled early and deepens when notes reveal mentor’s complicity *and* guilt. Protagonist agency drives escalation: she cross-references scripts, deciphers doodles, chooses to burn rather than watch. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits proof of theft but gains self-sovereignty. The tightening occurs at the projector—only one choice remains, and she makes it with trembling certainty, foreclosing revenge for liberation.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—mapping the night by summarizing silence—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency. Each summarized silence (child’s laugh, unsent letters) narrows options: she cannot speak, only distill. Cost escalates visibly: last star fading, time in sighs, fingers calloused from tracing oblivion. The tightening isn’t causal but accumulative—density of quietude reweights the night from void to labyrinth. Coincidence never resolves; every glyph is earned through attention.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—locating the origin of thought—is signaled early and deepens through protagonist-driven agency: each loop refines method and perception. Escalation occurs via density increase (emotional tuning, memory reframing), not coincidence, narrowing the search from external echoes to internal thresholds. Cost is unmistakable: the violin’s dissolution and the forfeiture of external answers. Final stance crystallizes under coherent pressure, fulfilling Situational lens requirements within a Hybrid framework.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transparency thawing calcified silence—is signaled early and deepens when Elira’s doodles catalyze collective vulnerability. Escalation is driven by her agency (placing tickets, angling lens), not coincidence. Cost is legible: years of guardedness culminate in one unsmiling woman’s trembling touch. However, the tightening lacks a narrowed option—stakes intensify atmospherically but don’t constrict Elira’s choices beyond her initial plan.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reciprocity vs. quantification—is signaled early and deepens when the intern delivers the botanist’s ultimatum. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: her polishing ritual defies institutional pressure, narrowing her social and professional options. Cost is unmistakable—the dead wrist-band, Sector 7’s 12% compliance threat—and culminates in a stance that forecloses assimilation. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with each marble adding weight to her resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—proving time moves sideways—is signaled early and deepens when the lever-pull reveals adjacent selves, raising stakes from academic validation to existential navigation. Elira’s agency drives escalation: she bypasses safety, pulls the lever, then fine-tunes it by 2.7 degrees. Cost is unmistakable: the other Elira’s terror, the irreversible scent-memory, and the burden of mapping “parallel nows.” Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—twilight’s magnetic hush accumulates meaning until the pivot crystallizes.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—unraveling the ghost’s submerged symphony—is signaled early and tightens when she realizes stains are sheet music. Escalation is driven by her agency: correlating floods with seating charts, then performing the silent score.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—resisting possession by challenging assumptions—is signaled early and tightens through rhetorical escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving memory as living music—tightens via the protagonist’s agency: she pushes beyond exhaustion, weaving her father’s whistle into crescendo.

Pressure accumulates texturally, not causally, but under the Accumulative lens, each deepening reweights the stakes with emotional and conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—integration of fractured selves—is signaled early and deepens through each procedural corridor.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—defeating emotional numbness—is signaled early and tightens when Elara feels “absence” creeping back.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving truth against systemic erasure—is signaled early and tightens when the pigeon message breaches Bureau authority. Elias’s agency drives escalation: he chooses lateral investigation over compliance, foreclosing institutional safety.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—resonating with what’s buried—is signaled early and deepens when the child appears, proving Lira’s music unbinds more than memory. Agency lies in her choice to play *despite* futility; each phrase narrows options (no applause, no fire, only ash). Cost is felt in the snapped string, half-bloomed orchid, and her mother’s silenced lullaby—all rendered through action, not declaration. Escalation culminates in the bowl’s trembling water reweighting hope itself.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—authentic feeling versus counterfeit emotion—is signaled early and deepens through Vael’s internal conflict: she seeks not profit but fusion.

The meaningful tightening occurs when recipients recognize the locket’s personal significance (Marta whispering “Lena”), transforming anonymous gratitude into intimate witness. Cost is felt in Elias’s “cautious exuberance”—joy held lightly lest it shatter—and in the laborers’ tears, laughter, and silent pinning of photos.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.2)

    Dominant stake—preserving undelivered emotion in overlooked spaces—is signaled early and deepens through protagonist agency: she chooses chalk over email, children over adults, impermanence over permanence. Escalation occurs via emotional calibration (birthday maze, jump-rope plea), each raising the cost of failure.

    Dominant stake—preserving echoes before static dissolves them—is signaled early and deepens when the meteorite reveals its tuning-fork function, forcing Elara to risk embedding cosmic stone into fragile harnesses. Agency drives escalation: she maps motes, redesigns gear, releases Argent knowing failure means final silence.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake (“discover why paths disappear”) tightens decisively at the crater glass: paths vanish because predecessors “traded footprints for flight,” transforming the quest from recovery to inheritance. This deepening arises from protagonist agency—she chooses to press seeds, interpret emotions, and ultimately plant new ones—and carries conceptual cost (abandoning certainty for “conjectures”). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each seed adds emotional density until the crater glass delivers the reconfiguration. Coincidence never resolves; the bird’s “gift” logic emerges from established mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—transfiguring monotony through attention—is signaled early and deepened via audience reactions that narrow Elias’s path: he must maintain vulnerability, not virtuosity. The meaningful tightening occurs when the physicist stops muttering equations and writes haiku—proof Elias’s method works, raising the cost of failure.

    Dominant stake (“anchor ideals in practice”) tightens decisively when Elira shifts from failed treaties to writing harvests/schools atop old text—a deepening that forecloses hollow diplomacy. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her choice to resurrect ritual significance narrows options to ceremonial vulnerability. Cost is unmistakable in survivors’ hollow eyes and smudged prints, altering tactics from force to shared reflection. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving echo over life—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: Elias chooses not resurrection but resonance. The tightening occurs when he releases the imperfect call, narrowing his redemption to a single, fragile gesture. Cost is felt in the map dissolving, the egg abandoned, and the knowledge he’ll revert to ruthlessness—yet this moment remains irrevocable.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—unlocking silenced voices—is signaled early and deepens through protagonist agency: each thread released alters tactics (sigh → giggle → chorus). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; the final knot’s resistance forces a trade-off between force and patience, resolved by whispered remembrance. Cost is legible: solitude as armor, erased footprints, and the furnace of refusal. No coincidence—every echo emerges from her labor, not external aid.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—ethical storytelling—is signaled early and tightens when Mira accuses him of “aestheticizing harm,” forcing a decisive turn. His agency drives escalation: walking out, building puppets, performing in bars, enduring violence. The veteran’s bottle-throwing becomes “punctuation, not interruption,” proving his commitment has real cost. Final deepening—“accountability, not purity”—narrows his path irreversibly: he can’t return to decorative calligraphy, only forward into subversive sincerity.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—honoring vanishing histories—is signaled early and deepens when the monarch’s benediction forces a choice: touch (break the spell) or bow (preserve sacrament). Her renunciation tightens options irreversibly, paying the price of non-possession. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, though escalation leans more on textural intensification than causal narrowing; still, the cost (“beauty without audience”) is unmistakable at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—preserving forgotten names as living resonance—is signaled early and deepens when the rope releases Elara’s giggle, raising emotional stakes. Protagonist agency drives escalation: reconfiguring braids, threading melody into mantra, choosing to cast rather than mourn. Cost is felt in the rope’s unraveling and the irreversible act of embedding the helix in bedrock. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from deliberate, technically gentle choices under spiritual pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—discovering why paths choose walkers—is signaled early and tightens when the decaying directive’s paradoxes force Elara into dream-excavation. Her agency drives escalation: choosing playfulness over rigidity, lying on cold floor to sync pulse with storm, detaching the seal. Cost is legible: the bunker’s collapse, loss of foresight/hindsight duality, and embrace of “living now” foreclose old ways of being. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—density of symbols (crow/clock, uphill river) deepens until revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—sealing a covenant with the unknown—is signaled early and tightened by Sirius’s transit, a live celestial clock. Agency lies in attention and alignment, not spectacle; cost (frugality, isolation) alters tactics (barley cakes for lamp oil). Escalation occurs via schematic density spiraling from tile, culminating in resonance. Coincidence (breeze) complicates but doesn’t resolve; activation hinges on precise alignment.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—releasing decades of resentment without violence—is signaled early and deepens through protagonist agency: she maps fury, reimagines the pin as pivot, and trusts cellular memory. Escalation occurs via Accumulative density (bodily archives, reality’s dissolve), narrowing options until only internal resonance remains. Cost is unmistakable: the melody migrates inward, requiring surrender of the object she trusted. Coincidence never resolves; every shift stems from her attention and reinterpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—capturing the runaway dream—is signaled early and deepens through embodied escalation: breath sync, sextant resonance, frost pulsing. Agency is total; no coincidence resolves tension. Cost is felt in the mirror maker’s final stance: triumph shadowed by irrevocable transformation (“her final craft”). Pressure tightens via protagonist-driven choices under Accumulative lens, culminating in a trade-off between memory and mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—bridging generational wisdom before it’s lost—is signaled early and deepens when the daughter’s vow appears fresh on the branch. Escalation is protagonist-driven: she climbs, improvises with spoon and honey, and stitches vow to ribbon. Cost is felt in silence, exile, and the daughter’s initial rejection; the green scrap offers not resolution but renewed pressure to persist. Coincidence never resolves; every advance is earned by grit and unorthodox method.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—accessing forbidden knowledge of nonlinear inheritance—is signaled early and tightens when the curator shifts tactics from passive observation to active inquiry in the bathroom. The meaningful deepening occurs when she asks, “If inheritance isn’t a river, what is it?”—a question that narrows options to non-causal frameworks. Cost is unmistakable: the cameo splits open, revealing “Again,” which implies cyclical labor rather than resolution. Agency drives escalation; coincidence (pipes gurgling) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the glyph emerges from her own breath on the mirror.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—redefining rescue—tightens when Elira rejects extraction for renegotiation, foreclosing Kael’s original mission with conceptual cost. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her research into gaps directly enables the climax. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each linguistic detail deepens the central question. The chrono-core’s stabilization proves stakes were viscerally felt, not abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—recapturing a lost self—is signaled early and tightens decisively at the garden threshold: taking *Lirien* risks fracture or wholeness. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation—she chooses belief over truth (“I remember you,” she lied), presses the card to the valve, and reaches for the name. Cost is unmistakable: the spent swatch, the ship’s tremor, the weight of reclaimed identity. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each memory fragment deepens the emotional stakes without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—restoring coherence to fragmented time—is signaled early and tightens when the archivist threads the seal into the rope, merging absence into structure. Escalation is driven by her agency: each braid adjustment synchronizes the clock, narrowing options until the door vanishes because it’s “no longer needed.” Cost is felt in the quiet burden of unseen repair; no coincidence resolves tension. The deepening from puzzle to temporal reconciliation reweights silence as generative, not void.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—conjuring silence from chaos—is signaled early and tightens when Ripple-mark chooses to engage fracture lines rather than flee. Escalation is driven by her agency: humming calibrated frequencies, adjusting pitch to match ice’s hidden harmonics, offering gathered hush to the wounded star-being. Cost is unmistakable: her stillness is “hammered repose,” earned through pressure; the bloom of hush spreads only after she absorbs tension into the stone. The final trade-off—accepting ongoing duty (“already listening for the next silence”)—forecloses rest, charging the ending with irrevocable commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—rekindling understanding through cosmic alignment—is signaled early and tightens when the prism activates: memories flicker, convergence replaces coincidence. Agency drives escalation: her meticulous adjustments narrow options until Cassiopeia’s light forces the final realization. Cost is felt in the fragility of the vision and her physical stillness; one tremor would erase everything. Coincidence complicates (lost Alcor), but resolution stems from her persistent labor.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—sculpting identity from ephemeral memory—is signaled early and deepens via shadow analysis that reveals cultural griefs. Agency manifests through conjecture (not passive observation): each measurement forecloses factual certainty for emotional truth, costing her objectivity. The Arch of Unfinished Questions’ “impossibly short” shadow intensifies pressure by implying time’s fragility, driving her to sign within a raindrop’s refraction—a trade-off between permanence and poignancy. Cost is legible: her marrow now houses ghosts, making erasure inevitable yet meaningful.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming joy through choreographed light—is signaled early and deepens via Lira’s physical commitment to the sequence. Escalation is driven by her agency: she filters ambient data, syncs her pulse, and strikes tiles “like mallets,” narrowing options to precise footfall. Cost is palpable: the kerosene rag’s absorption signifies surrender of past identity. Under Accumulative pressure, each step intensifies resonance until the sky fractures—a trade-off earned, not gifted.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—whether love survives migration—is signaled early and deepens when the companion appears, transforming abstract “texture of time” into lived relational tension. The tightening occurs not through argument but shared silence: his presence forces her to embody her philosophy. Cost is visible in his slumped shoulders, her withheld pleading; the trade-off is certainty for coexistence in liminality. Agency lies in attention, not action—a valid Accumulative escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—access to authentic silence—is signaled early and deepens through the child’s hunger for its “flavors.” Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: they run *up*, not out, choosing wonder over safety. The gravity inversion complicates but doesn’t resolve; the child must still act. Cost is unmistakable: they forfeit the known world, and the doll’s partial merger with the trellis embodies irreversible change.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—transforming transit into sanctuary—is signaled early and deepens through the operator’s calibrated responses to escalating emotional noise. Agency is subtle but decisive: his exhale, weight shift, and vial monitoring narrow options toward stillness. Cost is unmistakable: he absorbs others’ pain without relief, readying himself anew for rage. Escalation is driven entirely by his attention under pressure, consistent with the Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—finding the stairway before sunrise—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully as dawn approaches, fraying reality and forcing acceleration. Agency is clear: every action (peeling paint, pressing flake, descending stairs) stems from the protagonist’s choices. Cost is legible: the orchard vanishes, the flake deactivates, and only comprehension—not power—is gained. Escalation is driven by environmental pressure, not coincidence, aligning with the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—teaching suffocation to breathe—is signaled early and deepens through the keeper’s method: linking through scars to stitch a new passage. Escalation is driven by her agency: hovering knuckles, palm-press on wood, flare of oldest scar—all narrow options until the threshold surrenders. Cost is unmistakable: bridges burned “carefully” so no one is trapped, yet she remains alone in the lantern-field. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; each echo met with stillness tightens the moral calculus between connection and self-preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—translating betrayal into generative power—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Elara chooses to “play along” out of spite. The escalation is protagonist-driven: her channeling of “slammed doors” and “fake smiles” into the bolt constitutes agency under Accumulative pressure. Cost is unmistakable in the “existential” weight she endures, crystallizing into lessons. Coincidence (texts) complicates but doesn’t resolve; victory stems from her willful reconfiguration of pain.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—uncovering truth that could dissolve the empire—is signaled early and deepens when it becomes personal. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her method of “standing waves” leads her to detect her mother’s voice, forcing a reconfiguration of self. The tightening forecloses her identity as destroyer; cost is visible in the loss of certainty and embrace of restoration. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from her trained perception.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—capturing possibility through relinquishment—tightens when he chooses surrender over control in each gesture. Protagonist agency drives escalation: his tilt of head, sweep of arm, and pirouette force reality to reconfigure. Cost is unmistakable: mechanical duty shed as organic surrender, armor abandoned for barefoot vulnerability. The vortex’s threads connect but don’t control, crystallizing his stance that harmony > domination.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—whether institutional indifference can be countered by quiet witness—is signaled early and deepens when the button reveals Corporal Vance’s vow. The archivist’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to document dust, photograph smudges, open “Magnifications.” Cost is felt in her reconfigured role and the supervisor’s initial skepticism. One meaningful tightening suffices, though the piece slightly softens external pressure by resolving conflict via coffee and basement files rather than sustained institutional resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—restoring erased histories—tightens when plans unravel, forcing Elira to rely on puddle-maps and analog tech. Escalation is driven by her agency: cross-referencing dumpster fragments, splicing tapes, bypassing kill-switches. Cost is unmistakable—the citywide blackout invites enforcer retaliation—and the final broadcast crystallizes stance without violence. Coincidence (twin moons aligning) complicates but doesn’t resolve; her preparation earns the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (silencing the prophecy) tightens when the prophecy “resists” as physical pressure, forcing the saxophonist to shift from playing notes to “playing absence.” This deepening narrows options: only erasure via negative space works. Cost is unmistakable—the grotto’s sigh of relief implies centuries of burden lifted, while the saxophonist forfeits his grandmother’s legacy. Escalation stems from protagonist agency under Accumulative lens, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—decoding arboreal memory—is signaled early and deepens when the moonstone speck reveals latent stories. Elira’s agency drives escalation: she alters her monuments, embeds specks, hums to coax memories. Cost is visible: emotional labor (weeping), social shift (travelers ascend), and irreversible transformation (“she, transformed always, listens”). Pressure tightens organically; no coincidence resolves core conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reconciling certainty with uncertainty—is signaled early and tightens decisively when Elias tosses his watch, foreclosing his old life. Protagonist agency drives escalation: he chooses to follow the compass, to fall inward, to improvise steps and bridges. Cost is felt in lost time, abandoned shop, and irreversible worldview shift. Coincidence (kettle, pigeons) complicates but never resolves; pressure crystallizes into Charged Poise at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—redeeming oneself through naming—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: Elara chooses to speak names despite pain, escalating until the coin shatters.

Cost is unmistakable: the loss of the coin, the calcified guilt transformed but not erased. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens without reliance on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reintegrating fractured grief through companionship—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency: she chooses to play, not banish; to harmonize, not fix. The meaningful deepening occurs when laughter cracks the air, forcing ghosts to confront forgotten joy—a trade-off where healing requires vulnerability, not control. Cost is unmistakable: the collector carries accumulated weight (“fuller, not lighter”), and the ghosts vanish only by dissolving into stone, losing individuality for collective peace. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, with each confession tightening the emotional resonance until closure.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—discovering mercy’s mathematics—is signaled early and deepens through embodied trauma responses that become navigational tools. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: each memory surge triggers pattern recognition, not panic, culminating in the whispered answer that opens the path. Cost is unmistakable: the mask strap dissolves, symbolizing surrender of past identity. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—unfastening calcified grief by recovering erased cultural memory—is signaled early and deepens when the lens fragment demands a memory as payment, raising emotional cost. The translator’s agency drives escalation: she seeks Mara, offers her grandmother’s scent, presses the glass to the triptych. The tightening occurs when the historian’s silence transforms into recognition, foreclosing his prior state of archival despair. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from character choice under Accumulative pressure, with the lens’s rules established before activation.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—discovering what silence smothers—is signaled early and deepens when dust patterns lead to the drawing. The technician’s agency drives escalation: his choice to reflect light, climb, pry, and finally acknowledge reshapes the ghost’s presence. Cost is felt in the emotional gravity of handling the child’s artifact and the irreversible shift from observer to custodian. Pressure tightens coherently under an Accumulative lens, with each observation narrowing the field to one sacred point beneath the tile.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—compressing eternity at the price of equilibrium—is signaled early and escalates through protagonist agency: she reads frost, uncorks the whisper, reaches into the aperture. The tightening occurs when the spiral frost demands rupture, forcing her to choose between order and density of time. Cost is unmistakable: “perfection was ruined,” systems glitch, yet she smiles—chaos births meaning. Escalation follows Accumulative logic: each textual layer (frost, whisper, aperture) intensifies pressure without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—decoding lost utopia through silence between artifacts—is signaled early and deepens when Voss confirms harmonic resonance. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: covering mirrors isn’t superstition but tactical innovation that steadies glyphs. Cost is unmistakable—he abandons the revolution’s legacy to pursue fragile, unverifiable truth. The chrono-wind storm forces a trade-off: reflectivity versus clarity, spectacle versus scripture.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming stolen light—is signaled early and deepens through the stone’s wilting, which forces the repairman to confront dishonesty as active harm. Escalation is driven by his agency: choosing song over tools, truth over convenience. Cost is unmistakable—the child’s lost smile haunts him, and midnight’s shadows literalize consequence. The covenant of rust sharpens the moral calculus: truth emerges only through surrender to time, not pristine repair.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—finding where “explanations fail”—is signaled immediately and tightens when Elira realizes surrender, not navigation, is the goal. The deepening occurs via psychometric hinges: each door reveals higher-stakes understanding, narrowing options until staying becomes inevitable. Cost is felt in her relinquished compass and sealed exit, and agency remains hers—she chooses to moisten the journal, step into the passage. Coincidence never resolves; the stone’s logic is consistent from first drip to final sigh.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reimagining survival as shared breath—is signaled early and deepens when Elara projects timewoven figures onto the cliff, transforming personal art into communal ritual. Pressure escalates organically: GPS failure → storm → internal turmoil → creative response. The tightening occurs when she chooses negative space over figuration, foreclosing monetizable art for participatory legacy. Cost is unmistakable: she relinquishes control, leaving the piece unclaimed, yet gains collective resonance—a trade-off driven wholly by her agency under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reckoning with nocturnal blooming—is signaled early and tightens when she deciphers the glass layers, foreclosing mere speculation for embodied practice. Agency drives escalation: her choice to kneel, trace, and ultimately paint reconfigures her role from seeker to inheritor. Cost is felt in her permanent wakefulness and the unspoken burden of guarding truths “not for speaking, but for living.”

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—truth as tension between record and memory—tightens when the archivist shifts from solo decryption to land-parley, foreclosing academic detachment. Her agency drives escalation: arranging debris rebuilds after tide gnaws, cross-referencing charts reveals massacre anniversaries, and oral tapestries replace sterile reports. Cost is unmistakable: sleeplessness, bodily exposure, and permanent binding as witness. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with each offering deepening the lagoon’s response until light materializes faces.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—revival through reinvention, not return—is signaled early and deepens when the alchemist hands the bottle to the child, foreclosing solitary genius in favor of communal participation. Pressure escalates texturally: silence → wary observation → whispered fragments → lantern proliferation. Cost is unmistakable: the town’s soul was spent, companions are gone, and revival demands relinquishing control—embodied in the unopened bottle now belonging to “the becoming.”

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving emotional truth against urban sterilization—tightens when Elira realizes archiving isn’t enough; she must reintroduce feeling into the city. This deepening arises from her own agency: listening to the cylinder triggers the prophecy, which compels action. The cost is felt in her solitude (“No one noticed”) and the burden of being the sole conduit. Pressure escalates texturally: whispers → giggle → orchard hum → dissolving petal, each layer raising the emotional stakes without external antagonism.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving life’s codes against entropy—is signaled early and deepens when the egg hatches silence, forcing Elara to shift from preservation to active reanimation. The tightening occurs at the dais: pressing the acorn cap is a renunciation of passive saving for participatory healing, narrowing options to one irreversible act. Cost is unmistakable: the “child’s laughter swallowed by snow” returns not as recovery but release, and the sapling’s emergence demands surrender, not control. Escalation is driven entirely by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens, with no coincidence or external rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—restoring trust over triggering fear—is signaled early and deepens via the tester’s refusal to force false alarms. Escalation is driven by her agency: mounting sensors, recalibrating, waiting. The tightening occurs when the rope trembles then stills (“Not yet. / She smiled. / Good.”), foreclosing impatience.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—honoring celestial vulnerability through presence—is signaled early and tightens when the rogue comet demands interpretation over prediction. The meaningful deepening occurs when he chooses empathy over protocol, tracing intent rather than impact, which crystallizes his stance under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving unsaid truths against oblivion—is signaled early and deepens when storms threaten the box, forcing bodily sacrifice. Escalation is protagonist-driven: her daily rituals intensify under pressure (wrapping her spine around the box), narrowing options to silent endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding time’s texture—is signaled early and tightens when Lira’s arrival forces active collaboration (not passive observation). The meaningful deepening occurs at capsule opening: emotional coordinates replace spatial ones, narrowing Vey’s path from solitary curator to co-creator of meaning. Cost is visible in Vey’s forfeited temporal bureaucracy and embodied in their newly steady heartbeat.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—beauty in incompleteness—is signaled early and deepened when Elira chooses to weave rather than repair, narrowing options to asymmetry.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—proving humans can belong within ecological design—is signaled early and deepens through Arlen’s terminal timeframe. Agency manifests not in survival but in legacy-shaping: each copper coil forecloses passive decay in favor of active collaboration. The fledgling sparrow incident tightens pressure by testing his creed in real time, and his calm response reaffirms his stance. Cost is unmistakable: his breath grows shallow as he climbs the Spiral Stair, yet he smiles—endurance with visible physical toll. Under the Accumulative lens, this single deepening suffices, and the price charges the final image without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding homecoming’s chemistry—is signaled early and deepens via the spectrometer’s failure, forcing a conceptual pivot. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she chooses to wait for resonance, then to leave the amber, each narrowing epistemic options.

Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, tightening from hypothesis to lived reconfiguration without coincidence or soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—submerged concord as ecological/moral restoration—is signaled early and deepens through the coachman’s escalating linguistic and botanical acts. Agency is clear: each seed burial forecloses forgetting, with cost embedded in “rusted bayonets” and nameless graves. The tightening occurs when bird calls shift from observation to dialogue (“permission”), forcing the coachman to act. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies via density of ritual, not external opposition, culminating in a stance that crystallizes around “life… insists on returning.”

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—resurrecting the lost through voice—is signaled early and tightens when Veyra brings the cylinder. Bracken’s agency drives escalation: he decodes, gathers scavengers, leads east, and institutes nightly listenings. Cost is unmistakable: emotional labor (trembling grip), physical toll (nights spent decoding), and societal shift (salvage replaced by resonance). Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from his intuitively descriptive perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—maintaining inner true north amid temporal chaos—is signaled early and tightens when the violet filament appears, forcing a choice between documentation and intervention. Her agency drives escalation: sketching isn’t passive but “stitching time back together.” Cost is felt in social exile (“pariah”) and the weight of sole witness.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—mending the sky through sacred play—is signaled early and tightens when Elric swaps pieces, each exchange narrowing options (old truths tucked away forever).

Final image shows rivers whispering awake, proving stakes were viscerally real.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—rendering invisible lives legible—is signaled early and deepens through the protagonist’s patterned walks and the penumbra’s “benevolently ruthless” clarity. Agency drives escalation: placing the board, spelling “remember/release/recede,” then “listen” forces the sovereign into exposed presence.

Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with each arrival intensifying the demand to witness.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—recovering the shape of home—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: she chooses to seed truth through feather texture, not words or will. This single meaningful intensification narrows options (abandoning translation) and incurs cost (ending her role as finder of buried talents). Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens: each tactile substitution builds toward the decisive act. Coincidence never resolves; the feather’s properties are established early and deployed deliberately.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—forgiving herself—is signaled early and tightens when she decodes threads that echo her own failures.

The thunder’s recurrence reminds that time moves outside, raising stakes by contrasting her arrested grief with the world’s continuity.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving complexity against coerced unity—is signaled early and deepens through each poetry session. The artist’s agency drives escalation: inviting strangers, then the child, then herself, each time intensifying emotional exposure. Final cost is clear: she forfeits ritual validation and communal absolution, enduring solitude to uphold her creed. Coincidence never resolves; the child’s arrival complicates but doesn’t solve—the artist’s response is fully earned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—conjuring meaning from ruin—is signaled early and deepens through protagonist-driven escalation: each pockmark narration narrows her emotional options and depletes her air, culminating in the final tear-lacquer sacrifice. Pressure tightens coherently under Accumulative lens; the “space between breaths held underwater” literalizes stakes without coincidence. Cost is unmistakable: near-suffocation, abandonment of past self, irreversible emotional exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming belief in quiet miracles—is signaled early and tightened when she chooses the forbidden path, foreclosing escape into routine.

Cost is unmistakable: physical pain, abandonment of the shell, relinquishing the mirror’s illusion. Escalation is driven entirely by her agency under an Accumulative lens—each brushstroke intensifies her commitment, culminating in the whispered “I’m still here,” which crystallizes stance with palpable emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—proving whispers carry truth—is signaled early and deepens when Elara shifts from fixing ships to healing the sea’s memory. The tightening occurs when she presses the cork to her lips: a single, irreversible act that trades mechanical signaling for fragrant resonance, narrowing options to pure intent. Cost is unmistakable—her physical depletion, the empty vial as spent resource—and the sea’s response validates her stance without coincidence. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: density of scent, vibration, and silence intensifies until vessels turn “smooth as a sigh.”

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—navigating geography of loss—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully: crescent-moon failure forecloses reckless charting, forcing reliance on lunar rhythm. Agency manifests as endurance (waiting) and attention (listening to static), which foreclose conventional resolution with felt cost (ringing ears, calcified goodbyes). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each call adds thread to loom until climax reweights absence as presence. Coincidence complicates (flickers answer calls) but never resolves; stakes remain viscerally tied to protagonist’s physiological limits.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—cultivating psychological safety—is signaled early and escalates through protagonist agency: she chooses to occlude her truth when asked, shares truffles despite risk, and ultimately surrenders the relic. The meaningful tightening occurs when survivors flinch at her bluntness, forcing her to reframe her offer—a trade-off between honesty and efficacy. Cost is unmistakable: she parts with her only tool for modulating truth, walking forward “without occlusion.” Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens via sensory and linguistic density, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—decoding the stranger’s final gesture—is signaled early and deepens into understanding a pact of borrowed memory. Escalation occurs through Silas’s method: each twilight visit tightens focus until the fourth night yields a decisive intensification (mountain-pass memory). Agency is clear—his choice to withhold findings forecloses official resolution with conceptual cost. Coincidence (matching Elara’s photo) complicates but doesn’t resolve; insight arises from his accumulated observation.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—fulfilling a vow to his sister—is signaled early and tightens when the creek rises, forcing immediate action. The single meaningful deepening occurs at the archway: stepping through rewrites time but demands total renunciation of his old life. Cost is legible in the packed bag, locked shop, and vanished dust. Coincidence (ants appearing) complicates but doesn’t resolve; Elias’s choice to follow them is active agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—unburying buried truth—is signaled early and deepens when the pool reveals her complicity in her child’s vanishing. The tightening occurs at the summit: she must choose between continued denial or witnessing, with visible cost (loss of royal identity). Agency drives escalation—she climbs despite warnings, interprets fireflies, kneels at the pool—and the figure’s demand (“Climb back down… as vessel”) forces a trade-off that narrows all future options. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—transforming guilt into creative material—is signaled early (“palette of resolve”) and deepens when Elias confesses. The alchemist’s agency drives escalation: she chooses presence, then initiates alchemical ritual. Cost is unmistakable: the burned lab, years of solitude, and now the demand that Elias hold the glowing shell—a visceral burden turned bridge. The tightening occurs in her declaration: “Not to apologize… But differently. That’s the revaluation.”

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—taming feral nostalgia—is signaled early and tightens when the scroll repels ink, forcing confrontation with past selves. Protagonist agency drives escalation: writing jealousy fuels encounters that deepen the scroll’s script. Each ghost encounter narrows options (no return to innocence) and exacts conceptual cost (burning playgrounds, collapsing libraries). Final stance crystallizes under coherent pressure: chaos gains shape through active distillation, not passive reception.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—can meaning persist without sensory validation?—is signaled early and deepens when Elara confesses feeling like a fraud. The tightening occurs in Ren’s reframing of the screw as fulcrum, not clamp, which shifts Elara’s understanding of her own role. Cost is legible: she must relinquish the illusion of curative scent and embrace witness as sufficient. Agency drives escalation—she brings the screw, requests its mounting—and the final choice (offering the clock to strangers) forecloses retreat into isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—transforming scars into stories—is signaled early and deepens through each rune stroke, narrowing options from panic to poise. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: humming the lullaby softens ink, choosing vulnerability over scholarly rigor. Cost is unmistakable—the scars persist, but their meaning shifts at emotional price. The tightening (ink threatening to crystallize) forces a trade-off: regress into fear or lean into childhood hope.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reconciliation through imperfect repair—is signaled early and deepens when the protagonist admits she “stole your trust.” Escalation occurs via her active choice to deploy the perfume-and-current device, risking further rejection. Cost is felt in Elias’s raw voice (“rough as torn sheet music”) and the irreversible exposure of vulnerability. The orchard’s countdown adds situational pressure without resolving conflict mechanically.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—unraveling cosmic illusions through spiral arbitration—is signaled early and tightens via protagonist agency: opening the regret-bound volume, whispering the axiom, surrendering palms. Each escalation deepens knowledge (future handwriting, gods’ self-unraveling) and narrows options (dictionary dissolves, language rejected). Cost is unmistakable: loss of identity (“no longer witness”) and linguistic scaffolding. Coincidence never resolves; the universe’s hiccup merely frames her earned stance.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming time from linear surrender—is signaled early and deepens through the backward count, which narrows options (reversing causality) and alters knowledge (revealing duration in light). Agency is clear: the shepherd’s ritual choices directly provoke the station’s harmonic hum and temporal hold. Cost is unmistakable: social ostracization (“locals thought him mad”), physical strain (“eyes watering”), and existential burden (“weight of perception”). Escalation is driven entirely by his will under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (“understand the physics of letting go”) tightens via Aris’s agency: she walks toward the stranger, offers the pointer, and permits dissolution. This deepening forecloses the path of anchoring, with cost made tangible in the stranger’s motes sinking into soil. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens—resonance builds through sensory and emotional density, not external conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—widening perspective responsibly—is signaled early and deepens when Elara shifts from passive observer to active tracer of glyphs. The tightening occurs when she realizes scrawls are breadcrumbs, foreclosing solipsism. Cost is felt: clover melancholy, isolation, and the risk of being unheard. Escalation is driven by her agency (photographing, decoding, writing back), not coincidence, though the father’s flicker of recognition borders on convenient—it’s saved by restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—teaching endings how to begin—is signaled early and tightens decisively when she applies her method to herself, foreclosing her path as orchestrator. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: each curated collision deepens her investment until the self-call forces renunciation. Cost is unmistakable: her solitude ends not through connection but absorption into the archive she built. Under the Accumulative lens, the cadence shift—from curating others’ calls to looping her own—reweights the central stake with conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving small moments against institutional forgetting—is signaled early and deepens via the locket’s glow and erased marshes. Agency lies in attention: her choice to transcribe joy-as-covenant forecloses passive grief, with cost visible in Sunday dinners gone silent.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—curing loneliness through reciprocity—is signaled early and deepens via Elara’s rule: no tale given without one returned. Pressure escalates organically as strangers lean in, each exchange narrowing isolation’s grip. The climax isn’t a decision but a mutual confession that forecloses silence with visible cost (tears, shaking hands). Agency lies in attention and endurance; the price is emotional exposure, unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—mapping emotional depths via resonance—is signaled early and deepens when memories test her endurance. Agency is clear: she chooses to absorb sorrow like ink, to step into silence. Cost is unmistakable: the musical trail vanishes upon exit, and she leaves her compass behind. The forest’s pressure escalates not through beasts but through memory, forcing a crystallized stance: pain becomes the compass.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (“thresh meaning from experience”) tightens meaningfully when the protagonist shifts from force to invitation—“She posed questions to the fabric of spacetime”—foreclosing control with conceptual cost. Escalation is driven by her agency: unbending assumptions enables hearing “contingencies,” which permits glyph-tracing that rewrites the past. Each small edit (balloon as metaphor, war as awkward dinners) deepens the central conflict without coincidence. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, culminating in fluid history as hard-won resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to the voiceless through ephemeral music—is signaled early and tightens when the mute girl appears, raising the cost from personal ritual to pedagogical legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—rescuing the promise through artistic reassembly—tightens when the tapestry fragment demands reciprocal creation, foreclosing passive recovery. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her charcoal portraits and hair-woven fragments actively provoke the archive’s response (“hidden doors sighed open”). Cost crystallizes in her irreversible choice to become the message’s vessel, paid through permanent exile from surface-world legitimacy. The spiral motif’s incompleteness forces ever-deeper engagement, narrowing options until only total self-sacrifice remains.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—combat suffocating borrowed memories through defiant creation—is signaled early and deepens when drumming evolves from rebellion to collaboration. Pressure tightens as entangled souls shift from ghosts to guests, narrowing her option from surrender to synthesis. Cost is felt in her “weary” smile; victory isn’t freedom but integration.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—truth’s transmission in a corrupt system—is signaled early and deepens when the coin’s weight guides Lena toward Sector Theta. The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses not to confront Delgado but to weaponize silence, narrowing her agency to folded truths. Cost is unmistakable: she relinquishes personal justice for systemic consequence, trusting Ruiz’s tread over her own authority. Escalation is driven entirely by Lena’s decisions under Accumulative pressure, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—guiding the drowned toward witnessed hope—is signaled early and deepens when the drowned woman appears. The guardian’s agency drives escalation: she actively weaves glyphs via shutter manipulation, narrowing the canal’s darkness into readable symbols. Cost is felt in her solitude and the fishermen’s avoidance, crystallizing in the drowned woman’s choice to sink gently—a trade-off between release and recognition. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens with one decisive intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—awakening dormant curiosity—is signaled early and tightens when Elira escalates from chessboards to phantom trees, risking exposure. Agency drives escalation: her choice to place the grotto on the sundial triggers town-wide change.

The deepening—from individual pawn to communal arbors—narrows options (no retreat into obscurity) and crystallizes her stance as “just the soil.”

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—freedom through true self—is signaled early and tightens when the scrimshaw flares hot at water’s edge, forcing Lira to choose between dock-bound duty and the deep’s summons. Escalation is driven by her agency: she wades in despite disbelief, listens past fear, and accepts dissolution of the scrimshaw. Cost is unmistakable—the island vanishes by dawn, making sanctuary temporary—and visible in her softer “spaces between sinew and soul.” Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens via resonant intensification, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—grief versus enforced joy—is signaled immediately and tightens when Compliance Officers arrive, forcing the protagonist to weaponize bureaucratic jargon.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming aesthetic sovereignty after state-enforced silence—is signaled immediately and deepens when the poet shifts from smuggling verses in dreams to speaking “Unfold.” Agency drives escalation: her verb initiates harmonic auroras, dissolving boundaries not by force but presence.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—awakening beauty in brokenness—is signaled early and deepens through Elias’s plant arrangements and Marta’s eventual participation. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: Elias’s choices narrow options (he doesn’t paint; he arranges), and Marta’s shift from skepticism to co-creation forecloses her prior detachment. The cost is visible—soot on skin, knees in ash—and conceptual: they trade ease for responsibility to the ruined. Pressure tightens once (at dusk, when the reed hums), forcing Marta’s pivotal question (“Teach me”) and subsequent action.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—authentic connection vs. digital saturation—is signaled early and deepens through Elira’s questions (“Why measure intimacy in bandwidth?”), which narrow options by rejecting instantaneity. Her agency lies in attention and reverence; the tightening occurs when her single note fractures into hues, forcing recognition of vanished voices as seeds. Cost is conceptual yet undeniable: she bears the weight of reclaimed resonance, symbolized by the charged lens.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—transforming grief into guided remembrance—is signaled early and tightens when the maker presses the stencil into the locket, narrowing options from passive mourning to deliberate creation. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: each fold and etching deepens her commitment, culminating in the crane left at the library. Cost is unmistakable in her isolation (“never signed them. Never lingered”) and the physical toll implied by “fingers tracing the cold brass rim.” Coincidence never resolves pressure; resonance arises from accumulated intent.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—mapping post-collapse human grammar—is signaled early and deepens when convergence points reveal “new mythologies.” Agency manifests through methodical cross-referencing; the tightening occurs when she measures distance “not in miles, but in shared hashtags,” foreclosing data-driven prophecy for communal resonance. Cost is visible: ledger grows heavier, tape more worn. Coincidence (thunder) complicates but doesn’t resolve; climax arises from her synthesis of graffiti migrations and viral dances.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—breaking the cycle of historical sanitization—is signaled early and deepens when the historian confronts the civilization’s surrender-to-forget. Her agency drives escalation: refusing rhythm, touching the pagoda, humming her daughter’s song.

The pagoda’s shudder confirms her choice alters reality, not just perception.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving hope’s raw shape against sanitized dreams—is signaled early and tightens when Elira discovers the shadow’s metamorphosis, forcing her to shift from preservation to facilitation. Escalation is driven by her agency: frame-by-frame comparison leads to embedding the stone, which reweights collective consciousness. Cost is felt in the quiet triumph—hope survives but wears “new skins,” sacrificing its original trembling form. One meaningful deepening suffices; no false resets or coincidental resolutions.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—whether to abandon or rebuild—is signaled early and deepens through protagonist agency: her decision to reconstruct the tail crystallizes her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—whether wounds can be sealed—is signaled early and deepens when the seed reveals healing as continuation, not closure. Elira’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to listen, to touch the wood, to descend, to merge. The cost—abandoning her foundational identity—is felt in her weeping and visible in the scar’s transformation. Pressure tightens coherently under an Accumulative lens, with no coincidental resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—giving witness to unused love—is signaled early and tightens through protagonist agency: her psychometric act uncovers letters, which she chooses to release rather than hoard. Escalation is textural but decisive: from personal memory (“origami birds”) to inherited grief (“Eleanor, Who Laughs Like Church Bells”), culminating in public release. Cost is felt: she bears emotional weight without resolution, only acknowledgment. Coincidence (finding letters) is grounded in character ability, not convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—freeing stifled creativity—is signaled early and tightens dramatically in the winter climax, where fury replaces pleading, forcing higher-stakes action. Protagonist agency drives escalation: she runs, traces hundreds of arcs, and endures physical/spiritual toll. Cost is unmistakable: rattled teeth, frozen tears, hollowed ribs. Under the Accumulative lens, the density surge of voices and meteors reweights the stake without coincidence resolving anything.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—cultivating sparks of possibility—is signaled early and deepens when the guard chooses resonance over extraction. His agency drives escalation: modulating neural resonance, humming to coax coherence, and accepting the cost of eternal wakefulness. The tightening occurs when he bypasses vivid spheres for the dimmest, affirming his mission’s specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—rediscovering the mind’s wild frontier—is signaled early and tightens at the Edge, where legend warns of unraveling. The philosopher’s agency drives escalation: he doesn’t flee the void but hums into it, using his bone-resonance to match its frequency. Cost is unmistakable—he abandons the gear, his sole relic—and the static’s transformation into “a symphony of forgotten thoughts” proves his choice reconfigures reality itself under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—finding where unused courage waits—is signaled early and deepens via the star-punch ritual, which shifts from marking thresholds to sanctifying absence. Agency manifests in renunciation: they do not reclaim courage but remember it, foreclosing rescue/reprimand. Pressure tightens when Torvin “punches a star into the air itself,” narrowing options to symbolic witness. Cost is felt in dust-turned offerings and unplayed whistles—courage’s latency exacts emotional toll, though physical or social price remains oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—safety versus expressive vulnerability—is signaled early and deepens through protagonist agency: his removal of the bolt years prior, daily vigil at the stain, and ultimate reinstallation. The child’s arrival escalates pressure not by coincidence but by forcing a live test of his doctrine. Cost is unmistakable: his hands tremble as he screws in the bolt, and the fortress risks collapse again. This single tightening—choosing potential destruction over guaranteed silence—narrows his world to one resonant note with irreversible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—unmasking the pretender—is signaled early and escalates through her cryptic campaign, culminating in the ink’s revelation. Agency is clear: every rune, folded corner, and riddle is her choice, narrowing the pretender’s illusion until it collapses.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—discovering why paths disappear—is signaled early and deepens when the atlas coordinates match the journal, then intensifies with the 17-second revelation. Escalation is driven by Elara’s agency: she tests surfaces, digs code, cross-references data. Cost is unmistakable: years spent in silence, the emotional toll of witnessing bleaching, and the risk of descending alone. The fossil fuel ban contextualizes but doesn’t resolve; resolution comes through listening, not policy.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming purpose after rebellion’s lull—is signaled early and deepens when the stone circle thrums, transforming passive observation into active witness. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: her focus feeds the stones, her whisper seeds the chord, her barefoot stance invites others.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming self-determined destiny from enforced amnesia—is signaled early and deepens through the grandmother’s agency: she decodes, chants, offers. Escalation occurs via protagonist-driven choices under Accumulative pressure: each glyph traced, each plant-whisper integrated, tightens the path toward unsealing not by force but understanding. Cost is unmistakable: the Council’s fear of remembrance implies repression’s violence, and her solitary labor embodies the price of resistance. The final act forecloses dogma, trading singular control for diffuse, vulnerable possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—anchoring optimism in realism—is signaled early and deepens through the freeze, which shifts the photograph from relic to compass. Agency is quiet but decisive: choosing to cry, to draw, to return daily. Cost is legible in phantom pain and unguarded tears.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—confronting fractured reality—is signaled early and tightens when she stitches the Tower card to childhood sketches, narrowing options to archaeology over escape. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her needlework summons new books and inverts the staircase. Cost is unmistakable—“pain was the price of coherence”—and crystallizes in the final compression where transformation requires bone-breaking. Coincidence (mentor’s vanishing) complicates but doesn’t resolve; her choices alone reconfigure reality.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—discovering why time slows in crisis—is signaled early and deepens through protagonist agency: she spills ink deliberately, syncs her pulse to its retreat, and chooses to vanish. The meaningful tightening occurs when she realizes time slows for the witness, not the world—a revelation that narrows options to one: step into the ink’s pattern. Cost is unmistakable: her physical erasure, witnessed only by a drone. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with each beat intensifying her commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. suppression—is signaled early and tightens when the archivist chooses detonation over duty. Escalation is driven by her agency: activating the Resonance Table transforms confession into “emotional resonance,” narrowing options (she cannot unsend it).

The “blink” timeframe intensifies pressure without convenience plotting.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving meaning after collapse—is signaled early and tightens through each visitor interaction. The ex-soldier’s doubt and the child’s locket escalate pressure, forcing Elara to defend her mission not with argument but demonstration. Her agency lies in renunciation (sheathing the knife) and attention (tracking life in wilted leaves), each act narrowing the path back to violence. Cost is felt in the “weight” she carries and the fragility of Hope watered with rationed condensation.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—retrieving the goddess’s echo—is signaled early and deepens when the feral lullaby reveals it contains maternal fury.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving erased truths—is signaled early and tightens when the journalist’s call reveals misaligned timestamps. Her agency lies in surgical intervention via proof by contradiction, not confrontation. The 2:17 a.m. purge pattern forces a trade-off: act with partial evidence or wait and risk more disappearances. Cost is visible in her solitude and the weight of the pen nib—a promise that isolates as much as it empowers.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—hushing dissonance of old guilt—is signaled early and tightens when the machine vocalizes “You left me in the static,” forcing confrontation. Protagonist agency drives escalation: she chooses to write the letter, press amber to skin, and sing the lullaby, each act narrowing options (e.g., using her blood forfeits bodily integrity). Cost is unmistakable: her flesh bears the glyph, and she accepts permanent responsibility for translating sorrow rather than erasing it. The firmware’s redemption hinges on her willingness to endure pain as conduit.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—relearning how silence holds intention—is signaled early and deepens when the mandala releases absorbed city noise.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—redefining mercy—is signaled early and deepens when Elira renames “ruin” as “cradle unbroken.” Escalation is protagonist-driven: her act of naming forces the magistrate’s vulnerability, then catalyzes communal participation.

Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—rescuing art from oblivion—is signaled early and tightens when the coin hovers toward “intersections where hope still whispered.” The ghost’s agency drives escalation: spinning the coin, singing seven notes, then releasing it. Each echo carries “scent of surrender” but “pulse of yearning,” raising emotional stakes without abstraction. Cost is unmistakable: her form blurs irreversibly, trading eternal haunting for finite impact. Coincidence complicates (child’s laugh from splintered tomorrow) but resolution stems solely from her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming connection after the pill recall—is signaled early and deepens through somatic navigation. Pressure escalates via involuntary body signals that narrow options: each twitch directs her toward tools that reconstruct shared memory.

Agency drives escalation; coincidence (static shock) complicates but doesn’t resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to dormant human emotion—tightens when the fossil floats, forcing participation over observation. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her thermal song triggers the lattice’s formation. Cost is unmistakable: the fossil’s dissolution forfeits her calibration tool, yet enables communion.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—truth-assembling amid societal unraveling—is signaled early and tightens when the echo speaks plainly, forcing her to slow the hourglass (a renunciation of old ritual pace). Protagonist agency drives escalation: her button cataloging multiplies echoes, then distributes jars, shifting from solitary archaeologist to co-architect cultivator. Cost is unmistakable: the cliffs tremble from the weight of unspoken choices, yet she continues, accepting isolation as price. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each added jar/button deepens stakes without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—vouchsafing truth against institutional betrayal—is signaled early and escalates via protagonist agency: Elira calculates wind shifts, tests footholds, chooses burial over retrieval. The tightening occurs when she presses microfilm into snow’s deepest fold, foreclosing recovery and accepting that truth may never be found. Cost is unmistakable: her body heavy, ribs aching, yet spirit lightened by surrender to legacy. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens, with each layer of drift functioning as a cipher that deepens moral weight.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—distilling essence from complexity—is signaled early and deepens as rain intensifies and fog thickens. The tightening occurs when gutters fall silent: the veil thins, forcing the coachman to act. Agency is expressed through attention and offering, not force. Cost is implicit in his buried compass and vanished family, though a more explicit tactical shift under pressure would elevate this further.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—understanding how places resist change—is signaled early and deepens when the potter realizes resistance stems from surrender, not strength. Escalation occurs through her agency: aligning the glass, pouring water, choosing not to fire. Each act narrows options (e.g., rejecting salvage or honey) and incurs cost (carrying no physical artifact, only insight). Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens; coincidence never resolves—bees arrive only after kindness is enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—instilling resilience in fragility—is signaled early and deepens through each prism placement. Agency is clear: her choices narrow options (she abandons pruning for reflection) and incur cost (physical strain, emotional exposure). Pressure escalates texturally: from solitary petal-fall to communal gasps and laughter, each beam intensifies neighborhood awe. The lockmaster’s tooth reframes “pressure” as measurement, not force—a thematic and tactical deepening that crystallizes her stance without external opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—resisting erasure through active coexistence—is signaled early and deepens when the cloud-tide threatens alignment. Veyra’s agency drives escalation: she doesn’t wait for rescue but channels her own resonance to stabilize the failing hum, paying the price of reliving layered selves (“botanist, mammoth-walker, last witness”). The tightening forecloses passive archivism; her choice to whisper coordinates of possible lifeforms reweights the entire premise. Cost is unmistakable: sovereignty forged through daily confrontation with extinction’s ghost.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—rejoining the “thread that connects all things”—is signaled early and deepens when the twig spiral arrives, forcing Aris to choose between continued isolation or dissolution into collective memory. Pressure escalates texturally: each folded name tightens the emotional coil until the spiral’s glow demands irreversible action. Cost is felt in his bodily unraveling (“ink-stained skin dissolved into light”) and foreclosed path (no more personal love letters). Coincidence (the nest appearing) complicates but doesn’t resolve; agency lies in his decision to inscribe names and step into the pool.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving communal reason against cosmic manipulation—is signaled early and tightens when oversight dissolves, forcing Elira into direct action. Her interference isn’t passive defense but active destabilization (“tuning a poisoned violin”), narrowing options: she risks amplifying chaos or failing entirely. Cost is unmistakable in the campus’s fragile calm—students dismantle barricades not from resolution but shared exhaustion, a trade-off between safety and connection. Escalation is driven by her agency under Causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—retrieving the harmonic cipher to restore spatial balance—is signaled early and deepens into a moral recalibration: mutiny as liberation. Pressure escalates through protagonist agency: she chooses to enter the narrow passage despite terror, guided by music and compass. The cost is conceptual yet visceral—abandoning the explorer identity for cartographer of possibility—and felt in the bodily warmth of assimilation. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from her decisions under coherent, accumulating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—combating double erasure (sight then memory)—is signaled by line 3 and deepens when Elira realizes the killer didn’t murder but hoarded faces. Her agency drives escalation: cross-referencing archives, descending alone, staging portraits. The trade-off is explicit: no courtroom justice, but communal mourning. Cost crystallizes in dawn’s revelation—masks preserved yet legally unusable, empathy awakened but unprosecutable.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—reversing exile by proving forgotten maps hold power—is signaled early and deepens when Elara realizes the stanza doesn’t predict but controls weather. This tightening forces a trade-off: obey the guild’s silence or activate ancestral knowledge at personal risk. Agency is total: her transcription, humming, and questioning drive escalation. Cost is felt—the storm’s grief, her grandfather’s erased heroism—and the final act forecloses return to old systems. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each journal, each echo, layers toward reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—forgiveness as fragmented, pixelated amnesty—is signaled early and deepens when the fiddler plays the dirge, causing the glass flake’s image to shift. His agency drives escalation: choosing to play again alters reality, enabling the hitchhiker’s recomposition. Cost is legible in his “burned bridges” and the final relinquishing of the flake. Coincidence (crow landing twice) complicates but doesn’t resolve; pressure tightens through his decisions alone.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—escaping legacy through disruption—is signaled early and tightens when CirqueLogix fractures; his response (territorial markers) narrows options from rescue to ritual. Agency is clear: he chooses recalibration over panic, then renunciation over reboot. Cost is unmistakable: lost capital, trust, and conventional success, yet he transforms wreckage into wisdom. Pressure accumulates texturally but coherently under the Accumulative lens, with each marker deepening his stance.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—translating and redistributing celestial burdens—is signaled early and tightens decisively when the telegram arrives. The chronicler’s agency drives escalation: she deciphers Zeta Cygni, enters lucidity voluntarily, and sings rather than records. Cost is unmistakable: she assumes infinite grief, symbolized by the ephemeral daylily pressed into permanence. Under an Accumulative lens, pressure deepens through layered sensory and symbolic density, not external obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—confronting buried truths—is signaled early and escalates through protagonist agency: she chooses to kneel, press her palm, breathe. The deepening occurs when the seed sprouts “not with violence, but inevitability,” narrowing options to surrender or fracture. Cost is unmistakable: ribs crack in release, armor peels layer by layer. The final trade-off—guarded solitude for revealed truth—carries emotional weight that reshapes her role in the world.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring the eclipsed covenant—is signaled early and tightens when the clipping hums, forcing movement toward the center. Agency is expressed through attention and endurance: she doesn’t fight but heeds, yet this forecloses escape (roots fuse deeper). The cost—permanent anchoring, bearing collective trauma—is felt in the scars’ glow and echoed by distant witnesses. Escalation is driven by protagonist’s choices under Accumulative pressure, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—how to honor the dead—is signaled early and deepens when Kael challenges Elira’s method as “negligence.” The tightening occurs at his lunge: a live option (seizing the card) is foreclosed by roots, forcing verbal confrontation. Elira’s agency drives escalation—her placement of the card, then touch on Kael’s wrist—culminating in a trade-off: his iron grief for potential grace. Cost is unmistakable: “You trammel yourself more than you trammel me” crystallizes the emotional price of his stance.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming meaning after public failure—is signaled early and deepens when the cloth catches light, forcing Jasper to confront absence rather than decay. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: he chooses to listen, to type “Project Echo,” to carry the cloth close. Cost is unmistakable: surrendering the illusion of control via facts, risking vulnerability again. The tightening forecloses his prior path of emotional insulation, with Ruiz’s final nod confirming the shift’s social reality.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding transition—is signaled early and tightens when Elira chooses patience over force, risking failure where others broke silence with noise. Her agency drives escalation: reciting tablets, drawing signs, inventing glyphs. Cost is felt in her buried dissertations and the rule of “touching distance”—no grasping, only connection. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; one deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder amid identity flux—is signaled early and deepens through the librarian’s moon-phase vulnerability. Agency manifests in her deliberate act of lowering the creel into liquid moonlight, a choice that forecloses static archiving in favor of dynamic preservation. Cost is legible: she endures blurred edges and softened certainty during the new moon, yet proceeds. The escalation is protagonist-driven, not coincidental, and tightens options from cataloging to smelting contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—dissolving isolation through the pearl—is signaled early and tightens with each confession, narrowing emotional options until only total vulnerability remains. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: her choices to confess increasingly painful truths deepen pressure under the Accumulative lens. Cost is unmistakable: she absorbs collective despair, forever altered. No off-stage resolution; the ritual’s mechanics demand personal sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness as treacherous terrain—is signaled early and deepened through protagonist agency: she chooses bathroom graffiti over therapy, maps emotional topography, plays truth through broken bellows. Each tightening forecloses numbness: stopping meds, sitting at the sink, peeling ivy to reveal Track 3. Cost is felt in raw weeping and cramped fingers; no coincidence resolves pressure. Escalation is driven by her methodical daring, not external forces.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—accessing the library of unspoken words—is signaled early and deepens when documentation itself alters the archive, forcing recursive retracing. The tightening is driven by protagonist agency: each glyph etched changes prior discoveries, narrowing options until the inner sanctum reveals the loop. Cost is legible in the climax: understanding truth means becoming part of the recursion. Escalation follows the Accumulative lens via density spikes (scent-memory, mirror revelation), not causality, but pressure coheres without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—weighing a dream of restorative provenance against imperial legitimacy—is signaled early and intensifies through Elira’s coffee-reading and plant communion. The tightening occurs when she chooses resonance over documentation, using the violin not as artifact but as memory-conduit. Cost is unmistakable: her inherited gift isolates her, yet she leans into it fully, knowing it may destroy her. The Chancellor’s arrival isn’t coincidence—it’s the crucible that forces her stance to crystallize.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—capturing lucid awareness at the brink—is signaled early and deepens via the protagonist’s agency: she weaves patterns of stillness, syncs breath with aurora, and chooses surrender over force. Escalation occurs through density increase (static → film flicker → heartbeat pause → held breath) until the air itself hesitates—a cadence shift that reweights the stake. Cost is unmistakable: she sacrifices conventional rites for a fragile, drifting preservation, knowing she’ll one day submit to the same threshold. Coincidence never resolves; all pressure stems from her disciplined attention.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—finding contentment after forgiving the unforgivable—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s solitary ritual. The tightening occurs when she realizes contentment isn’t found but returned to, a daily choice like climbing again after falling. Agency is clear: she actively scallops her thoughts, reclaims the hairpin, re-enters her role. Cost is felt in the tremor of release and the refusal to let wound shape soul—visible, quiet, irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—moral clarity vs. doubt—is signaled early and tightens when the chimes command “Unhook,” forcing Elira to choose between professional survival and integrity. The escalation is driven by her agency: deciphering the chime code, resisting then yielding to the clasp. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits her “sincerely insincere” persona, risking client abandonment (“if they walked away? So be it”). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with each sensory cue deepening the ethical bind.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—learning to vanish in order to appear—is signaled early and deepened through Elira’s withheld truths and Kael’s dawning perception. The single tightening occurs when ripples transform into symbols under fractured starlight, narrowing Kael’s understanding from meditation to temporal literacy. Cost is visible: Elira’s loneliness, Kael’s surrender of control. Agency resides in Elira’s design and Kael’s silent bow—both choices foreclose old paths (ignorance, escape) with resonant consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—learning to navigate without moving—is signaled early and tightens when the flock’s westward bank reveals the pulse’s location, forcing the skimmer to crystallize its stance. Agency manifests through attention: choosing to appraise via bone-marrow resonance narrows options to stillness-as-alignment. Cost is felt in generations who “died seeking motion as salvation,” contrasting with the skimmer’s weathered resolve. Coincidence (the flock’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the decoding is earned through lifetimes of listening.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—magic’s soul vs. automation—is signaled by glyph-drones dispensing “standardized blizzards” and deepens when Lior’s refusal to adapt isolates him. The tightening occurs at the inciting incident: unstrapping the satchel to feel the keystone bare, which narrows options (trust the mist or remain stagnant). Cost is legible: he abandons hope of academy acceptance, yet gains warmth that “clung to him like a second skin.” Protagonist agency drives escalation—his choice to step on the mist, not coincidence, unlocks the cloud-hollow.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—discovering the color of sound—is signaled early and deepens through the ledger’s revelation: the vow was prewritten, binding him across time. The meaningful tightening occurs underwater when he reads his name and realizes the key was never for a hotel but for this ritual. Protagonist agency drives escalation: he chooses to dive, to pry the ledger free, to surface and leave it. Cost is conceptual and emotional: he accepts being part of a lineage of seekers, forfeiting originality for continuity, which charges the ending’s quiet poise.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—aligning with purpose in a collapsed universe—tightens when unbidden static reveals her past self holding a child, forcing renunciation of passive lot-casting. Agency drives escalation: she chooses to press the drachma, triggering warmth instead of noise. Cost is unmistakable—trembling, scattered coins, irreversible departure from ritual—and visible in her walk toward survivors. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each coin, burst, and vision deepens her isolation until the vision compels connection.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—transforming nameless terror into named witness—is signaled early and tightens through the naming ritual, which narrows his path from passive mourner to active namer. Agency drives escalation: he chooses to sing, to name, to fold the page into his coat. Cost is unmistakable: “for staying, for remembering, for refusing to let fear remain faceless.” Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens via sensory and linguistic density.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—righting cosmic imbalance—is signaled early and tightens through the mage’s methodical rebuild, which forecloses easier paths (no chanting, no force). Agency is clear: his understanding of dripping rates drives escalation, culminating in a trade-off (surrendering the bell to the sea). Cost is unmistakable: months of pre-dawn labor, social invisibility (“harmless eccentric”), and emotional exposure. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—whether to erase or honor resurfaced memory—is signaled by the wind chime’s silence and deepens when Elias discovers the distiller’s portrait. His agency drives escalation: choosing to narrate stories aloud transforms passive documentation into communal ritual. The cost is unmistakable—defying orders risks arrest—but paid off when officials assign him permanently as archivist. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each relic tightens moral tension until the state’s noon arrival crystallizes his stance.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—harmonizing logic/intuition—is signaled early and tightens when the crystal hums, forcing surrender over command. Protagonist agency drives escalation: her decision to watch starlings as brushstrokes (not data) deepens pressure, narrowing options to resonance or ruin. Cost is unmistakable: the frozen dew (childhood innocence) is consumed, leaving only warmth-as-covenant. Under Accumulative lens, the murmuration’s ancient rhythm reweights her entire alchemical philosophy, making dominion unthinkable.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—maintaining trust amid uncertainty—is signaled early and tightened when the arbor trembles: villagers panic, but she must revise timing, not truth. Her agency lies in choosing *how* to signal (buckle chime vs. shadow-play), foreclosing panic at personal cost. Escalation is driven by her attentiveness to “soundless echoes,” not coincidence. The price—bearing silence alone—is felt in her “faint smile” as she invents new signals for the next fearful hamlet.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—defeating numbness through vivification—is signaled early and tightens when judges’ accusations force Kael to choose between reclaiming or releasing the past. His agency drives escalation: silence collapses noise, enabling resonance that vivifies the brain. Cost is unmistakable—the duplicate rejects his pain—and the deepening (“complementary opposites”) narrows options from ownership to invitation. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens until the final reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—holding space for the grotesque/slow/inexplicable—is signaled early and deepens when players flee or obsess, proving the cost of Aris’s commitment. The tightening occurs when he designs rooms dictated by the seed’s myth, narrowing his creative autonomy to serve its logic. Though escalation stems from protagonist agency, the lack of a concrete trade-off (e.g., lost income, isolation) slightly softens the price, keeping it just below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—restoring lost laughter through tending the unspoken—is signaled early and deepens via the protagonist’s agency: he chooses nightly ritual over societal norms, transforming silence into sound. The meaningful tightening occurs when he drops to his knees begging for his daughter’s return, only to accept fragments as enough—a trade-off with visible emotional cost. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; each hum fractures into harmonics that narrow his world to the tunnel’s resonance, foreclosing escape but enabling endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—companionship amid dimensional exile—is signaled early and deepens when the guardian recognizes the cultist’s loneliness in the pendant. Escalation occurs through protagonist agency: choosing to place the pendant, initiating contact, offering its paw. Cost is unmistakable—the guardian accepts ongoing uncertainty, carries no books or keys, only “uncertainty like a lantern.” Pressure tightens coherently under the Accumulative lens, culminating in porous boundaries and shared silence.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—interrupting a stifling destiny of perpetual failure—is signaled early and deepened through Elric’s embrace of error as method. Agency is clear: he chooses successive approximation, adds blood as signature, adjusts chant cadence. The meaningful tightening occurs when he shifts from seeking flawless ritual to iterating through failure, foreclosing the path of purity. Cost is felt in the weight of the crozier (“burden and benediction”) and the ghosts of failures trailing his footsteps—visible, resonant, and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—capturing a “shard of hush”—tightens when the protagonist discards assumptions, narrowing options from technical tuning to existential surrender. Agency drives escalation: her choice to “let go of belief” triggers the pulse, transforming failure (Hollywood’s arrogance) into genesis. Cost is felt in the archivist’s death and her seven wasted cycles, crystallizing in the final trade-off: she gains understanding but relinquishes possession, descending as the city awakens without her. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, deepening via cadence shift from static to symphony.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—merging timelines so passengers have “a single, solid world”—tightens through seven vanishings, each narrowing options until the radio becomes the only path. Agency drives escalation: decoding patterns, leaving harmonic beacons, humming to align frequencies. Cost is unmistakable: sleepless labor, isolation, and acceptance of eternal recurrence. Coincidence never resolves; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens with one decisive deepening—the realization of “corrections,” not accidents.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—discovering how memory stitches to perception—is signaled early and deepens as the gallery resists her stitching. Agency is clear: she chooses to weave despite warnings, anchoring memories with geometric precision. Escalation is driven by her actions (the thread thickens, mirrors fracture), not coincidence, and the cost—confronting alternate selves, enduring resistance—is unmistakable. The climax’s “revelation” arises because she pulled “the right thread,” satisfying Accumulative escalation through protagonist-driven density increase.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—relearning navigation in alien-altered space—is signaled early and tightens when Kael asks why Vega drifts, forcing Elira to articulate edge geometry as threshold logic. The power fluctuation creates a crucible moment: in darkness, she navigates mentally, proving the skill’s viability. This deepening shifts tactics from theoretical instruction to embodied practice, foreclosing reliance on artificial light. Cost is felt in the loss of the fixed sky, yet agency persists through recalibration—“the aliens didn’t erase the sky—they asked us to see it anew.”

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—answering the dead’s summons to prevent hauntings—is signaled early and deepens when the tracer shifts from listening to broadcasting, narrowing her tactic under urgency. The girl’s whispered “They told me to wait” raises stakes by revealing decades of limbo. Cost is legible: the tracer expends emotional labor to recalibrate reality for a ghost, accepting she can’t restore life but can validate love’s persistence. No coincidence resolves conflict; agency drives every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—bearing witness to the erased—is signaled early and deepens when the gold fleck pulses at the child’s drawing, transforming abstract duty into visceral connection. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she chooses to descend, activate the chamber, and stay as water rises. Cost is unmistakable: the fleck crumbles, the sea reclaims the space, and she carries “silence in her bones.” Tidal timing isn’t backdrop but a live constraint that narrows options until the final stand.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—retrieving wisdom from systemic failure—is signaled early and deepens through Aris’s defragmentation act, which narrows options from passive haunting to active arrangement. The escalation is driven by his agency: initiating the sequence, pressing the shard into his palm, interpreting the ink’s language. Cost is unmistakable: he endures solitude, carries bureaucratic erasure as identity, and accepts that ghosts can only be “settled,” not saved. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens, culminating in Charged Poise—the blizzard ceased, heart still beating, mission complete without fanfare.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to the silenced—is signaled early and deepens when the diamond’s hunger forces tactical precision: feeding it noise to spare emotional texture. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she raises the diamond, matches syllables to flight, and speaks despite risk. Cost is unmistakable: tears, sated curse, and the burden of carrying ancestral echoes forward. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, culminating in a cadence shift that reweights silence into speech.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—transforming bitterness into liberation—is signaled early and tightened when the arrowhead vibrates, triggering local physics collapse. Elara’s agency drives escalation: she presses SEND unprompted, initiating the metamorphosis. Cost is unmistakable: loss of the phone (her only link to the entity), institutional identity, and the weight of scorn—all transmuted but not erased. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure deepens via gravitational play (floating boots, pirouetting cups) until the final upward fall crystallizes stakes as cosmic reconfiguration, not rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reawakening silenced beauty—is signaled early and deepens through the violinist’s tactical shift from soft signaling to resonant saturation. Escalation is driven by her agency: each musical phrase tightens pressure until statues fracture, kneel, and transform. Cost is unmistakable: blistered fingers, spent locust shell, and the irreversible commitment to keep walking toward other husks. The “gap between knowing and understanding” isn’t passive—it’s the crucible where logic yields to wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reuniting Lena’s daughter with her mother’s promise—tightens when drone patrols increase, forcing reroute through basement shafts. Protagonist agency drives escalation: he chooses to deploy the storm-bottle despite risk.

Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each absence linked raises thematic stakes without false resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—completing the carousel to heal a “wound in the world”—is signaled early and deepens through the halo’s activation. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: his wordless song, not luck, stirs the horses. Cost is unmistakable: lifelong silence, labor without audience, emotional solitude. The tightening occurs when he places the fragment—after that, retreat is impossible; the carousel demands completion.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reconnecting with living stories—is signaled early and deepened by the Great Data Collapse backstory. The tightening occurs when she steps into the tessellation, trading physical reality for narrative communion—a renunciation with opportunity cost (she leaves patrons behind, returns changed). Escalation is driven by her agency: unrolling the scroll, draping the scarf, whispering the axiom. Cost is legible in the patrons’ altered perception and her silent return, humming “sanely eccentric, utterly satisfied.”

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—capturing the runaway dream—is signaled early and tightens through the librarian’s escalating sacrifices (time, sanity, mentor’s loss). The chromatic equation deepens pressure by demanding emotionally costly components, narrowing options until surrender becomes tactical. Protagonist agency drives escalation: she chooses to wait, harvests indigo of surrender, and applies the blend. Cost is felt in decades of futile searching and crystallized in the final embrace.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—freeing an idea calcified by fear—is signaled early and deepens through the mirror corridor, where ancestral resistance escalates internal pressure. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: his ribbon-tying act shatters barriers, foreclosing the path of inherited dread. Cost is visible in the trembling idea and the wrist-bound promise, though the external opposition lacks tangible tactics beyond weeping reflections. Coincidence (the star’s hint) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the real turn stems from his choice to act.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—recovering stolen memories—is signaled early and deepens when she realizes the orchard feeds on rupture, making her own return a catalyst. Escalation is driven by her agency: charting stars, cross-referencing logs, placing the mushroom. The trawler’s deviation triggers the climax, but her choice to stay (not flee) crystallizes the cost: full consumption by the orchard. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each data point tightens the emotional noose until the final, quiet renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving the fragile balance of reversible exile through precise mentorship—is signaled early and deepens when the cartographer arrives. The archivist’s agency drives escalation: her 37-degree annotation forces his re-vision, shifting siege spiral to branching delta.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving the color of wonder—is signaled early and deepens through protagonist-driven agency: Elira doesn’t wait for magic but actively weaves essences from memory. The meaningful tightening occurs when she chooses to succor the seed through emotional distillation rather than soil or sun, foreclosing passive hope. Cost is unmistakable: decades of solitude, the burden of being the last rememberer, tears on weathered cheeks. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure escalates via pattern intensification (memory → filament → lullaby made visible), not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—grounding restless spirits to restore balance—is signaled early and tightens when the blackened knot resists, forcing a trade-off between safety and truth. Agency drives escalation: her choice to pierce the knot unleashes withheld confession, narrowing options (no turning back).

Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens via knot-by-knot deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—interpreting withheld testimony—is signaled early and deepens through the shadow’s choreography. The tightening occurs when interpolated footage reveals deliberate movement, transforming curiosity into witness. Agency is quiet but decisive: she chooses to sit, wait, and offer yarrow—not to rebuild but to acknowledge. Cost is felt in the weight of silenced histories and the vulnerability of “shielded openness.”

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—understanding the physics of letting go—tightens through protagonist-driven deepening: each anomaly (temperature drop, pulse-synced blizzard) narrows options toward surrender. Agency peaks in the cliffside choice: stepping back, not dropping, foreclosing possession with visible cost (hollowness, vanished globe). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves conflict. Cost is unmistakable: the globe’s unmaking transfers its purpose, leaving the narrator irrevocably altered.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—articulating unspoken needs through encoded art—is signaled early and deepens when the ghost replies, transforming private ritual into dialogue. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: each spray-can stroke narrows her isolation by inviting others in, with the cost being continued vulnerability (“not to escape the silence, but to invite others in”).

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—finding joy beneath anguish—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: she deciphers not coordinates but emotional latitudes, choosing absorption over solution. The tightening at floor five (light revealing cipher) forces a trade-off between haste and reverence, culminating in her refusal to rush the diary’s seal. Cost is felt in her trembling, hovering tears, and the weight of “encrypted grief.” Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each floor adds texture that reweights the central question.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—proving “empty spaces remember”—is signaled early and deepens through cloud categorization as active memorializing. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: each classification tightens her commitment to “spooled wholeness,” culminating in the release of #112, which forecloses clinging to grief. Cost is unmistakable: she trades resolution for remembrance, accepting perpetual absence. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, with no coincidental resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—transmuting celestial knowledge before destruction—is signaled early and tightens as demolition looms. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: she chooses to paint faster after her revelation, not out of panic but communion. Cost is unmistakable: her art will vanish at dawn, witnessed by no one. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, deepening from preservation to transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—charting the unknown—is signaled early and deepens when Arlen realizes the hopscotch encodes luminance control. Escalation is driven by his agency: three nights of cross-referencing, then presenting to Veyra. Cost is visible: his solitude transforms into responsibility; the murmurations’ dance now carries intention. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure tightens via pattern convergence (birds + chalk + phrasebook), not external threat.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding which breaks can and cannot be mended—is signaled early and deepens through the mirror reflections, each narrowing her options by confronting past refusals. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she chooses to uncap the pouch, trace the gear constellation, and accept dissolution of her apron. Cost is unmistakable: loss of her defining artifact (the apron) and relinquishment of control over time’s rhythm. Pressure tightens once, coherently, under an Accumulative lens—density of memory intensifies until the final reharmonization.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—survival through unity—is signaled early and deepens when bounty thins. Escalation is driven by Elira’s orchestration (not coincidence): chalk prompts → bell ringing → nebula appearance. Cost is visible: fraying roots, departure from orchard. Minor deduction: pressure tightens beautifully, but the “collective effort” requirement leans slightly abstract—tactics hinge on faith more than concrete trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—making the end gentle—is signaled early and tightens when the adjuster activates nested patterns, narrowing options to song or silence. Agency is clear: his spindle-turning drives escalation, costing him physical form (“stone into memory”). The deepening shift—from heartbeat rhythm to stellar hum—reweights stakes under Accumulative lens. Coincidence never resolves; every turn stems from his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preventing another ghost from joining the chorus—is signaled early and tightens when the girl appears. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: his “arithmetic” compels him to act, and his method (non-invasive guidance) narrows options under time pressure (“before night frost forms”). The cost—renewed isolation—is unmistakable in the ending. Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens: each impression left intensifies the thematic weight of silent care.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—translating separation into connection—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: her choice to listen rather than measure, to sketch rather than test, to surrender rather than fix. The tightening occurs when she reinterprets her daughter’s death not as system failure but metamorphosis, foreclosing her old identity as controller. Cost is unmistakable: tears, relinquished blame, and the acceptance of impermanence. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens without reliance on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—quantifying absence to enable new beginnings—is signaled early and tightens through each sale. The vendor’s agency drives escalation: she chooses patrons, dictates method (“measure the hollows”), and incises marks that fracture light into narrative potential. Cost is unmistakable: her past roles (“daughter, debtor, deserter”) remain unresolved, and each transaction lightens her only by redistributing weight. The ledger’s precise metrics (3.7 heartbeats, 12 grams) make stakes viscerally concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—subsuming remorse to smooth personal grief—is signaled early and tightens decisively at the basin, where Elira trades her own integrity for collective relief. Agency is clear: she chooses touch over protection, immersion over retreat. Cost is unmistakable: “bones reshaped,” skin “burned with borrowed heartbreak,” and emotional hollowing. The deepening occurs when tidal-pool analysis leads her to the still center, narrowing options from absorption to precise, surgical smoothing—a trade-off that crystallizes her purpose under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—rehabilitating silenced voices—is signaled early and deepens when the elevator speaks Ukrainian, demanding reciprocal vulnerability. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her choice to sing Guarani after hearing “Bread does not die” tightens the bond, forcing the town’s eventual gathering. Cost is felt in the weight left behind and the risk of failure (the elevator might have stayed mute). Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens—each language layer increases emotional density, narrowing the path from isolation to communion.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transforming abandoned dreams through perception—is signaled early and deepens via the protagonist’s active modification of entangled memories. Agency is clear: she chooses to press her palm, lift the mirror, walk the ridge. The tightening occurs when child’s submarine merges with her thesis, narrowing her path to one of neural cartography. Cost is felt in lost empathy, dissolved love, and sterile equations now repurposed as ballast—though the absence of external pressure slightly softens escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—recovering forgotten combinations—is signaled early and deepens when the seventh eye reveals itself as a location, not a symbol. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: Elira walks upside-down, seizes Fragment Delta, fuses it with Codex 7-M, and traces the sigil. Each threshold tightens options until the wall “exhales.” Cost is felt in the irreversible sealing of the chamber and gravity’s snap-back—consequences that alter her world permanently.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—restoring resonance to a hollow world—is signaled early (“world had been silent... hollow”) and deepens when Silas shifts from imposing music to listening. His agency drives escalation: finding the insulator, transcribing cracks, carving a chamber aligned with grain-lines. Cost is unmistakable: months of swallowed phantom chords, calloused fingers tracing sorrow-deltas, tears of recognition. The tightening occurs when he chooses empathy over artistry—embedding fractures as conduits rather than repairing them—foreclosing his old method with visible emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—translating silence into revelation—is signaled early and deepens via the tutor’s agency: he doesn’t passively wait but actively correlates magnetic fluctuations as chess moves. The tightening occurs at the eclipse threshold, where failure means missed insight, success means renewed purpose. Cost is felt in lost kingdoms and stiff knees, but also in the irreversible commitment to “carry resonance within.” Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with each silence holding “weight of consequence.”

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—recovering fragile silences before noise obliterates them—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s escalating frequency choices. Each attempt narrows options: blunt C-sharp fails, harmonic whale-cathedral blend coaxes response, child’s-held-breath lullaby finally unlocks. The cost is felt in her breath-held tension and tears, and the live clock (fireworks’ approach) tightens tactics without resolving via coincidence. Agency is absolute: success stems from her intuitive tuning, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—equilibrium amid chaos—tightens when the seed finally splits, forcing Elira to choose reverence over control. Agency is clear: she doesn’t force the bloom but lets it teach, accepting the cost of impermanence (it won’t bloom again in her lifetime). Pressure escalates via sensory omens (wet iron, lightning) that narrow her options to witness, not intervene. Coincidence (the tide’s thought) complicates but doesn’t resolve; her readiness earns the revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the source of resilience—is signaled in paragraph two and deepens when the arrow reveals memory as survival mechanism. Pressure escalates via protagonist agency: touching the relic triggers vines, prompting her sprint against gravity’s return, then deliberate implantation into the oldest tree. Cost is felt in irreversible commitment—she abandons extraction for integration. The inversion hour acts as a live constraint, narrowing options until only one act remains: listening, not fixing.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—preventing the next disaster through foresight—is signaled early and tightens when the investigator realizes the port authority “only changed its shape,” not the danger. Escalation is driven by his agency: planting sensors, triangulating vectors, interpreting Varga’s last words. Cost is unmistakable: six hours of solitude in a lethal maze, carrying another man’s failure as both burden and guide. The wind’s “impossible” surges raise stakes without coincidence resolving tension.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—certifying wonder as essential—is signaled early and tightens when the amber sheet glows like a hearth, shifting from guide to presence. Protagonist agency drives escalation: each strike deepens resonance, culminating in surrender that multiplies the chime. Cost is unmistakable: she leaves the rushing world behind, bearing the hush internally where it “will never freeze again.” Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—density of color-sound fusion reweights silence from void to vitality.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—whether to intervene in past failure—is signaled early and deepens when she steps through the seam. Agency drives escalation: her breath coaxes echo, not song; her notes harvest unraveling, not restoration. Cost is unmistakable: resonance spent, flute silenced, guardianship irrevocably redefined. The tightening occurs at the threshold—she chooses observation over correction, crystallizing stance under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—transcribing emotion’s mathematics through deliberate ambiguity—is signaled early and tightens via the halo’s emotional siphoning, which narrows the operator’s options (dimming light = finite uses). Protagonist agency drives escalation: she chooses whose grief to wear, whom to test, when to print. Cost is unmistakable: erosion of self, irreversible dimming, unsolved equations. Coincidence complicates (meteor fall) but never resolves; all turns stem from her method.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—coaxing wonder from routine—is signaled early and deepens when the pendant’s pulse overrides delivery urgency. The tightening occurs at the fork: choosing the Hollow Market over efficiency embodies agency under Accumulative pressure. Cost is felt: the casket grows heavier, dawn nears, and ultimately she surrenders her talisman. Coincidence (child reaching for pendant) complicates but doesn’t resolve; the courier’s choice to reveal it drives the climax. One meaningful deepening suffices, though the stakes never escalate beyond personal/spiritual—a slight limitation for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—proving emotion’s physicality—tightens when the prism reveals the driver’s surrender, transforming abstract theory into witnessed truth. The mystic’s agency drives escalation: aligning prism to frost triggers the vision, and her choice to remain silent crystallizes stakes. Cost is felt: she bears the weight of unshareable knowledge, trading recognition for fidelity. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each frost-image deepens emotional density without external interference.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake (“carry a message across impossible distance”) tightens decisively when she realizes she must weave thresholds, not cloth—a deepening that narrows options to self-sacrifice. Protagonist agency drives escalation: finding the puzzle, rebuilding the loom, choosing to dissolve. Cost is unmistakable: “memories of his laugh… transmuted into luminous glyphs.” Coincidence (rummage box appearing) complicates but doesn’t resolve; her choices do.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—coaxing resilience from rubble—is signaled early and deepens as the silk thins, forcing Arlo to choose between hoarding magic or sharing it. His agency drives escalation: each barter depletes the silk but strengthens the village, culminating in the irreversible choice to give the last thread. Cost is unmistakable: “He didn’t need the silk anymore” carries the weight of total relinquishment. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens—density increases via recurring glyphs, tools, and villagers’ returns—until the final image reweights everything: magic now lives in hinges, not relics.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—discovering the weight of a withheld truth—is signaled early and deepens when Elira learns her existence is a splinter preserved by maternal sacrifice. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she redirects intention to sidestep realities, guided by the shard. The tightening forecloses escape (she cannot undo her mother’s choice) and forces endurance with cost: bearing responsibility without resolution. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens—resonance replaces direction—and the crystalline core delivers irreversible knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving fragile human connection against erasure—is signaled early via the letter chain and deepened when the lamp extinguishes, forcing Elias to act beyond supply duty. His agency drives escalation: choosing to build cairns despite no witness, transforming passive endurance into active tending. Cost is felt in the “hollowing” draft and reconfigured as luminescent ache—visible price paid for maintaining compassion in solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—preserving myth against data-drowning—is signaled early (“truth became a playlist algorithm”) and tightens when stars pulse “with unusual urgency.” Her agency drives escalation: she raises the wick, whispers paradoxes, laughs to catalyze change. Cost is unmistakable: her “three hours of sleep” and the world’s “buried griefs” weigh on her choices. The deepening—seeing “cities drowning in data”—forces her toward the lantern’s inverted shadow, narrowing options to wonder vs. weariness. Coincidence never resolves; her breath alone bends possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding story-magnetism—is signaled early and tightens through two key deepenings: the wing’s oblique brilliance (angle over volume) and structural color (woven resonance over surface pigment). Agency is exercised through attention and craft, not action; her choice to cultivate fractures forecloses mimicry with felt cost. Pressure escalates accumulatively, not causally, consistent with the lens. Coincidence never resolves—insights emerge from disciplined observation under constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—measuring witnessed sorrow—tightens when the sextant projects dreams instead of coordinates, forcing her shift from technician to cartographer. Agency drives escalation: her patient deconstruction triggers the healing, which in turn compels her pilgrimage. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits her occupational identity (“not as a technician”) and embraces vulnerability (“walked barefoot”). The Accumulative lens intensifies pressure via dream fragments that accumulate until the yew tree’s priest-dream crystallizes her purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—rekindling communal dreaming—is signaled early and deepens through protagonist agency: her humming initiates escalation, not coincidence. The meaningful tightening occurs when silence gives way to tentative voices, narrowing the path from solitary curation to collective creation. Cost is unmistakable: the keeper bears the weight of scattered memory, and the realm’s survival hinges on risking vulnerability again. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens—each added voice intensifies the weave until dawns unfurl. No off-stage resolutions; all change stems from embodied choice.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—self-acceptance versus institutional belonging—is signaled early and tightens at midnight, forcing Elira to choose between hiding or witnessing. Agency manifests through attention (reading to empty chairs) and renunciation (not returning to the Society), with visible cost in the invitation’s scars and the foreclosed path of orthodoxy. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: smoothing the paper, stepping into moonlight, whispering her name—all narrow options under Accumulative pressure. Coincidence never resolves; the Society’s dawn arrival merely frames her earned poise.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—permission from the earth to feel sacred again—is signaled early and deepens through her actions. Escalation occurs via protagonist agency: from passive noticing (“learns truth hides in slow dissolve”) to active resistance (guerrilla gardening, uncloaking). The tightening is decisive: she moves from offering bread (question) to planting seeds (defiance), narrowing options from waiting to creating. Cost is felt in stale bread and empty teacups—sacrifices with no audience, only earth as witness.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (“preserve luminous vows against oblivion”) is signaled early and deepens as each vow’s resonance reveals emotional architecture. Elira’s agency drives escalation: her calibration choices narrow options (slide dims with each reading), culminating in the irreversible act of transcription. Cost is unmistakable—the cerulean vow’s sorrow, the gold vow’s warmth, and especially the violet forgiveness that “recalibrated the entire Array”—all paid in lost radiance and frozen tears.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—thwarting the deal before sunrise—is signaled early and tightens through failed disguises and near-detection. The meaningful deepening occurs when the girl shifts from deception to passive weaponization of memory, using the fob as emotional sabotage. Cost is unmistakable: Marla’s shattered composure and The Chain’s flight represent irreversible loss of alliance, while the girl sacrifices any chance of direct confrontation for a more profound rupture. Agency drives escalation—her calculated retreats and timing of breaths narrow options until only silence remains viable.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—understanding why some carry weather—is signaled early and deepens into a moral question of surrender versus retention. The tightening occurs when she realizes the forest votes on *absorption*, forcing her to witness (not solve) his release. Agency lies in attention and presence, not action; cost is emotional (his tears, her lost certainty). Escalation is driven by her choices (moving, tasting), not coincidence, under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—freeing suppressed creativity—is signaled early and escalates through protagonist agency: kneeling to “uncork” herself triggers the ghostly portraits, and her decision to draw wings (not preserve) deepens pressure by risking total loss of memory. The tightening occurs when she releases her father’s face last, confronting intergenerational trauma with visible cost—abandoning the safety of corporate art for vulnerable truth. Coincidence never resolves; the lock’s rattle stems from resonance with the cave’s own history of containment, making the escalation feel inevitable under the Accumulative lens. Final cost is felt in her transformed identity (“mnemonically sovereign”).

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—recovering fragile truths—is signaled early and tightens when the map leads to unsent letters that reverse her wilting, proving witness is both antidote and duty. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she chooses to press forward despite ambient untruths, reads aloud despite risk, and accepts archival responsibility. Cost is unmistakable: physical deterioration en route, emotional exposure in reading private confessions, and the irreversible shift from restorer to keeper. The filtration chamber climax crystallizes stance under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder’s color—is signaled early and deepens through the child’s arrival, which tests transmission beyond solitude. Agency drives escalation: she doesn’t wait for meaning to persist; she engineers conditions (calibrating chimes, placing hands on ice) for awe to ignite. Cost is felt in her irreversible withdrawal and the world’s abandonment below. Pressure tightens once meaningfully: from solitary vigil to shared tremor to posthumous echo.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—resolving inner static through fear integration—is signaled early and tightens when magnetic shift threatens system failure. Protagonist agency drives escalation: it chooses compression, then ignition. Cost is unmistakable—the box emptied, synthetic limbs alight—and alters tactics permanently. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each fear-orb compressed earlier pays off in the controlled burn’s precision.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—unresolved grief needing witness—is signaled early and deepens through Elara’s persistent, non-intrusive presence. Escalation is driven by her agency: choosing to return daily, hum imperfectly, create space. Cost is felt in Leo’s gauntness and emotional exhaustion, and in Elara’s restraint. The mailbox’s organic click crystallizes stakes without coincidence solving conflict; resolution emerges from accumulated emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—liberating truth through encrypted vulnerability—is signaled early and deepens via Elira’s journal-driven mapping and dice-activated protocols. Escalation is driven by her agency: each dance move narrows options (e.g., rerouting surveillance, awakening submersibles) while raising emotional stakes. The final choice—to become the cipher—carries undeniable cost: self-erasure as ultimate resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—finding where deleted memories go—is signaled early and deepens when the coffee grounds replicate her father’s last journal entry. Elira’s agency drives escalation: placing the beach aster triggers dissolution into a doorway, narrowing options to one irreversible step. Cost is unmistakable: time pools, shadows don’t touch ground, tears suspend—physical manifestations of emotional and temporal dislocation. Gravity fluctuations complicate but never resolve; the whale’s death catalyzes, doesn’t solve.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preventing the sky’s forgetting—is signaled early and deepens when the prophecy reveals itself as a plea, not a threat. The tightening occurs when the summoner shifts from silencing to cradling, narrowing options to perpetual vigilance (“return tomorrow, and the night after”). Cost is felt in her resolve-damp knees and barefoot commitment; agency drives escalation as she flows into the whisper, altering the prophecy’s fate through attention alone. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the building’s language—is signaled early and tightens when the archivist reveals the seal’s true function. The tutor’s agency drives escalation: her interrogations yield riddles, leading to the key handoff. Cost is unmistakable: the loss of comforting fictions (“tennis limp,” borrowed sugar) for uncertain truth. Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens—density of clues culminates in the vault’s promise.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—translating isolation into independence through witnessing—is signaled early and deepens via the shell’s resonance, which forces confrontation with quarantined memories. Agency is crystallized in her vow, which forecloses reconciliation or healing but affirms sovereignty. Cost is unmistakable: she leaves the shell (and thus part of herself) behind, walking into dawn unhealed. Escalation is driven by her choice to listen deeper, not external pressure, fitting the Accumulative lens perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—freeing the land from inherited sin—is signaled early and deepens when the scroll resists her edits, forcing her to persist with purer intent. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: each brushstroke alters cosmic law, met with environmental backlash (aurora flare, trembling sanctuary). Cost is unmistakable: exile endured, anonymity chosen, body marked by thorn. The tightening occurs at the climactic stroke—replacing “shall be cursed” with “may be pardoned”—which narrows divine decree into human plea, irrevocably unlinking fate from perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—why some people echo—is signaled early and deepens into a moral confrontation with an entity feeding on unfinished longing. The tightening occurs when the singer learns of the theft, narrowing her options from inquiry to intervention. Escalation is driven by her agency: progressive silence, weeping, singing lullabies. Cost is unmistakable: voice sacrificed, emotional burden carried, and the irreversible return of stolen resonance that leaves her both emptied and lightened.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—delivering the child’s uncorrupted echo—is signaled early and tightens when the ghost whisperer realizes the cameo appearances are deliveries, not hauntings. Her agency drives escalation: she cross-references dreams, interprets the memory-stream, and chooses to install the globe in the ice window. The cost—permanent solitude, unseen ripples—is felt in her departure at dawn and the final image of refracted starlight.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—honoring hidden effort—is signaled early and deepens when she whistles the widow’s name, transforming private grief into cosmic witness. Escalation is protagonist-driven: each whistle tightens connection between her labor and the world’s unseen hands. Cost is conceptual yet felt: her song is scintillatingly somber, luminous yet heavy, and her descent leaves only fading footprints. Fireflies’ earnest alignment validates her stance without resolving external conflict—pressure crystallizes, not dissipates.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—truth versus manufactured scarcity—is signaled early and deepens when Project Stillpoint’s purpose reframes the diamond. Protagonist agency drives escalation: reassembly of letters leads to orchard, which leads to plaque coordinates. Cost is felt in her solitude and the burden of knowledge (“Let them call her cursed”). Pressure tightens via Accumulative lens—each revelation narrows the world’s lie, not her options, fitting the textural design.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—shaping dawn via ancient shadows vs. Kael’s sterile unity—tightens when rebels whisper, “Send the cipher,” forcing Elira from passive listener to active broadcaster. Escalation is protagonist-driven: her tuning of “a frequency no one else believed existed” deepens into global resonance. Cost is unmistakable: she foregoes clean victory for mud-and-static dawn, accepting obsolescence as price. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each decoded fragment raises emotional stakes until the final broadcast reweights collective possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—translating time through sound—is signaled early and tightens when the music box demands specific sonic inputs, forcing curated vulnerability. Agency drives escalation: he chooses which sounds to capture, repair, gift. Cost is felt in his invisibility (no name, no return) and winter’s physical toll. Coincidence (finding the box by sound) complicates but doesn’t resolve; redemption is actively gleaned, not granted.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—protecting the Heartstone from discordant sound—is signaled early and tightens when sonic harpoons strike. Escalation is driven by her agency: she adapts, sings, becomes the buffer. Cost is visible in exhaustion and the irreversible shift from engineer to guardian. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each sonic layer intensifies until transmutation occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—dissolving a regime through stillness—is signaled early and deepens via children’s curiosity becoming communal contagion. Agency manifests as renunciation (no barricades) and attention (tracking eclipses), foreclosing paths of noise/conquest with felt cost (isolation, vulnerability to envoys). Escalation occurs through protagonist-driven ritual that reweights societal values, not coincidence. Final image shows stakes transformed: revolution is “the air they breathed,” not a seized throne.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—breaking the city’s cycle of historical erasure—is signaled early and tightens when the worker’s death is reframed as ancestral dread, not accident. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: her empirical method summons memories, her choice to “show me” triggers the vision, her decision to leave the lantern alters the tunnel’s resonance. Cost is felt in bureaucratic dismissal, inherited trauma, and the weight of names on her skin. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens without reliance on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—atonement through mechanical fidelity—is signaled early and tightens when the heart’s rotor refuses to engage, forcing Elias into deeper humility. The escalation is driven by his agency: months of study, failed consultations, then the storm-day surrender that enables insight. Cost is unmistakable: years of guilt crystallized in the trembling hands that finally listen rather than force. Coincidence (light beam) complicates but doesn’t resolve—it reveals what his own persistence prepared him to see.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—transliterating yearning into resonance—is signaled early and tightens when the arrow tip’s “ancestral memory” becomes essential fuel. Zeta’s agency drives escalation: her humming choices match glyphs to frequencies, narrowing options until the final palm-slam. Cost is unmistakable: voice cracks, body slumps, yet she endures. Coincidence never resolves; the bell stirs only because she *earns* it through recursive effort.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—uncovering where deleted files (and people) go—is signaled early and tightens into a moral imperative. Protagonist agency drives escalation: mapping 0707, deceiving supervisor/janitor, flooding the system. Cost is unmistakable: she forfeits professional integrity, personal safety, and emotional detachment. The deepening—from curiosity to communion—narrows options until only silent witness remains viable.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reconstituting courage through mapping empathy—is signaled early and deepens when she confronts her own reflection. The tightening occurs at the oldest mirror: instead of strangers, she sees her younger self, forcing a renunciation of old definitions of peace. Cost is unmistakable: “It wasn’t whole. It never would be. But it was enough”—a trade-off of wholeness for purpose. Protagonist agency drives every escalation; coincidence never resolves tension.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—learning the sound of endings—is signaled early and deepens when Elara hears the glacier’s sigh before others. Her agency drives escalation: she walks toward the collapse, not away, foreclosing her euthanasia path with felt cost (abandoning reprieves she resented). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; the “fold in patience” becomes tangible when waiting transforms from wound to threshold. Coincidence (falling) complicates but doesn’t resolve—the winch strike merely unlocks her attunement.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—whether mismatch invalidates love—is signaled early and deepened through Elias’s vineyard analogies. The meaningful tightening occurs when Mara admits she “thought I was rejecting you,” forcing a conceptual trade-off: sameness vs. asymmetry. Agency drives escalation: Elias chooses persuasion over pleading, Mara chooses to stay and taste the grape. Cost is felt in their seven autumns of separation and the irreversible burn on the letter.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving wisdom’s echo before it dissolves—is signaled early and deepens through the protagonist’s non-interventionist method. Pressure escalates texturally: the parapet stirs, clearings form, air thickens with resonance. Agency lies in attention and surrender, not force, which narrows options (no chanting, carving, blood) and incurs opportunity cost—she walks away as dunes shift “jealous” of her stillness. While cost is felt (departure, spent focus), it lacks a sharper on-page trade-off, slightly limiting escalation intensity under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—transmuting collective pain into breathable art—is signaled early and tightens through photo study: each image deepens her understanding of arcs (kite, spines, vines), narrowing her method to patient witnessing. Agency manifests as renunciation (no fame, no rush) with cost in physical strain and social marginalization. Escalation is driven by protagonist insight (“let the arc complete itself”), not coincidence, though pressure remains internal—valid under Accumulative lens. Cost is legible but not heightened beyond baseline solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—deciphering growth’s harmonic pattern—tightens when the crystal’s altered chime forces a choice: persist in transcription or engage the question directly. The scholar’s agency drives escalation; her answer (“I don’t know”) crystallizes stance with opportunity cost (abandoning data for dialogue). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens: each echo deepens her isolation until the building’s query makes silence untenable. Coincidence never resolves; the “clearer” chime arises from established mechanics (calibrated fork + reflective architecture).

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—capturing the sound of growing older—is signaled early and deepens when the chalk screech finally reveals it as “tidal, relentless, rhythmic.” This escalation is driven entirely by the prophet’s agency: his deliberate chalk drag on the tape case. The cost is unmistakable: he drops the chalk, knowing he won’t remember, yet the driftwood remains as silent testament. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, tightening from vague search to precise sonic revelation with irreversible emotional consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—restructuring time’s architecture—is signaled early and deepens when Elira shifts from capturing instants to reweaving causality. The tightening occurs when she chooses “the sound of a leaf falling” over gears or code, narrowing options to one fragile, memory-based method.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—executing a “flawless goodbye”—is signaled immediately and deepens through Elara’s hymning of the mundane, which reweights what “flawless” means (imperfection as sacred). Pressure escalates texturally: each ordinary sound draws souls closer, thickening hope until connection replaces solitude. Agency is clear—she chooses brokenness over restoration—and cost is felt in the shard’s dissolution. Coincidence never resolves; every shift arises from her deliberate song.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—finding where shadows go—is signaled early and deepens into stewardship, narrowing options from passive study to active reconciliation. Each winding of the key tightens pressure, culminating in the seventeenth-night crossing—a high-cost act that forecloses mere observation.

The cost—permanent responsibility for equilibrium—is felt in the closing vigilance.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—transforming betrayal into guidance—is signaled early and deepens when the wax substitute’s hollow chest shatters the town’s myth. The protagonist’s agency drives escalation: her pity cracks her open, leading to deliberate acts of historical bone-setting that narrow options (she rejects vengeance, chooses repair). Cost is unmistakable in “mothers who rocked empty arms” and the lavender-stuffed cavity, which reweights every subsequent choice. The final beat crystallizes pressure into Charged Poise—the cleft remains but breathes, foreclosing despair while demanding ongoing labor.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—can stillness hold its own glow?—is signaled early and deepens through the polishing ritual, which narrows options: no fire, no speech, only shimmer. Agency manifests as renunciation (rejecting conquest/correction) and attention (polishing grief into window). Cost is unmistakable: trembling hands, creaking joints, traumatic flashbacks endured mid-task. The tightening occurs when the glass “warms under friction,” shifting from memory object to communal beacon—this deepening reweights the stake from personal solace to shared witness, with villagers’ arrival proving its resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming agency over a violated narrative—is signaled early and deepens when she chooses transformation over destruction (burying, not burning, the printout). Escalation is driven by her proactive attention: tracing icicle patterns becomes a method for finding order in collapse. Cost is felt in the quiet forfeiture of revenge or redemption; she accepts ongoing vulnerability as her sanctuary’s “beating heart.” Pressure coheres under an Accumulative lens, tightening from observation to consecration.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—resisting narrative closure in favor of honoring ephemeral hope—is signaled early and deepens through each cameo encounter. Agency manifests as attention and renunciation; she forecloses commercial success and catharsis, paying the price in isolation and incompleteness.

Cost is unmistakable: the gulls “crying like editors demanding revisions” underscore the professional sacrifice embedded in her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—restoring song as sacred contract—is signaled early and deepens when the vine responds to melody, proving efficacy. Elara’s agency drives escalation: her shift from brittle notes to reclamation crescendo forces the land to remember. Cost is felt in the child’s moss-soft question (“Why did we stop singing?”)—a wound of cultural amnesia that cannot be undone, only tended. Coincidence never resolves; the harvest moon’s power is channeled solely through her disciplined presence.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—harvesting safekept starlight to guide the lost—is signaled early and escalates through ritual precision. Agency lies in renunciation: she refuses fire, chant, and flash-paper, choosing instead to “listen” via debris. Cost is felt in blood sigils steaming in killing cold and joints creaking “like old timber.” The deepening—plate’s giants stirring, map pulsing with hibernating life—narrows options to one path: pulse over sight, silence over spectacle.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—harvesting emotional resonance before it vanishes—is signaled early and tightens through protagonist-driven deepening: aligning mirrors at precise times reveals glyphs and pulses, each discovery narrowing his method to angled glances. The cost is unmistakable: time spent across a “wounded season,” physical risk (crystal shards raining like “frozen tears”), and ultimate solitude. Escalation follows Accumulative logic—density of revelations intensifies until the timer’s shudder at dusk cracks stone, forcing collection of new shards. No coincidence resolves pressure; all turns stem from his reflective practice.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—bearing unbearable weight—is signaled early and tightens when the weaver processes her own burden. Escalation is driven by her agency: orienting the lamp, weaving the man’s grief, then turning inward.

Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens—each layer of “shingled hush” deepens the emotional density without coincidence or soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—containing grief before it drowns her—is signaled early and tightens when she chooses carving over answering the kettle’s scream. This renunciation forecloses domestic normalcy (tea) in favor of emotional labor, with visible cost (scorched pot, physical strain). Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under an Accumulative lens: each sensory detail and memory deepens pressure until the lion takes form not as roar but repose. Coincidence never resolves; Viktor’s death remains fixed, but its meaning shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—negotiating with the ghost of ambition—is signaled immediately and deepens through the scavenger’s realization that collecting others’ echoes won’t bridge her fracture.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—making peace with an abandoned dream—is signaled early and deepens when the crystal pulses with memory, forcing Elias to confront his scores. The tightening occurs in his decision to hum rather than compose, a renunciation with visible cost (no audience, no cathedrals).

Coincidence (rain) complicates but doesn’t resolve; resolution stems entirely from his altered stance under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserving oral tradition as living practice—is signaled early and deepens when Havel tests her hands, not her words.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—untangling buried intentions—is signaled early and tightens when threads resist or yield based on her emotional labor.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—seeding innovation within constraint—is signaled early and deepens through the protagonist’s rejection of forced revolution. Escalation occurs via her calibrated use of predictive modeling as loom, not oracle, narrowing options to resonant invitations.

The “When now?” glyph crystallizes timing as tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—reviving stories against silence—tightens decisively when the copyist learns her tears are the catalyst, forcing a trade-off between disciplined transcription and vulnerable creation.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—memory vs. amnesia—is signaled early and tightens when Council envoys descend, forcing a live choice: reintegrate or endure.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder versus disseminating truth—is signaled early and deepens when the woman’s riddle reframes drone collapse as adaptation. Elias’s agency lies in withholding explanation, a renunciation that forecloses utility for mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—sanctifying forgotten architectures—is signaled early and deepens through the protagonist’s intentional placement of the shard. Agency is expressed through attention and ritual, not confrontation; her choice to leave the shard forecloses preservation but enables release.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—rousing dormant empathy—is signaled early and deepens when the barista’s compulsion proves the glyphs’ efficacy. The painter’s agency drives escalation: choosing Vaelish, then Sky-Weaver glyphs, each riskier due to cultural erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—mastering fear through confrontation—is signaled early and tightens via protagonist agency: reading the dream dictionary triggers environmental collapse, enabling the final confrontation. Cost is unmistakable: he must claw into his own chest to extract glowing memories, re-experiencing drowning and clinical death.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake—interpreting and shaping sound-tides—is signaled early and escalates through protagonist agency: the Prophet reads clouds, plays waves, hums root-notes, and finally entrusts Kael.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.1)

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—rescuing truth from calcified myth—is signaled early and deepens when she chooses nuanced revelation over accusation, narrowing options: no town-square screams, only strategic spring publication.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—resisting collective forgetting—is signaled early and deepens through escalating entropy (shifting tiles, rising water) and emotional exposure (the bride’s letter).

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake—truth versus erasure—is signaled early and tightens via the protagonist’s method: each architectural clue (bricked stairwells, sealed vents) deepens the hypothesis of intentional silencing.

Cost is conceptual yet palpable—the weight of testimony—and culminates in a Charged Poise: she rises resolved to speak, foreclosing silence. Coincidence never resolves; every insight stems from her calibrated perception.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake (containing grief via dream-recording) tightens when the shadow begins ascending the spires—a direct threat to his preservation system. Silas’s agency drives escalation: he chooses to shatter lanterns, releasing dreams as bait, then polishes the sapphire with silence. Cost is legible in every turn: loss of all recorded dreams, the destruction of his life’s work, and the emotional risk of confronting the shadow as mirror. The shadow’s satiation carries conceptual price—it can only soften by consuming what he cherished.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—mapping unused potential—is signaled early and deepens through each failed simulation, narrowing options to remote coordinates where silence is “deepest.” Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: she initiates perturbations despite system overload, choosing pursuit over rest.

Coincidence never resolves; the father’s carving is earned by her presence and action. Moral calculus sharpens the peak choice: jagged truths must be worn smooth before offered.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—truth surfacing without allegiance—is signaled early and deepens when the prosecutor admits he “memorized” erased names, foreclosing denial.

Protagonist-driven escalation under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves her arc.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming capacity for empathy—tightens decisively when the baseball floats, triggering fractal ripples that force confrontation with ignored pain. The seeker’s agency drives escalation: decoding ads leads to the lake, which demands release.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming lost time—is signaled early and deepens when the protagonist realizes tracings were anchors that rusted.

Coincidence (crow’s key, tide’s whisper) complicates but doesn’t resolve—she still must act.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—sparking silent revolution via coded geometry—is signaled early and escalates through protagonist agency: she chooses exact timing, alignment, and dissemination method despite blackout-induced chaos.

    Dominant stake—reclaiming voice through cartography of scars—is signaled early and deepens via protagonist agency: she rarefies grief into ritual, chooses not to open the envelope, and redefines scars as waypoints. Escalation is textural but coherent: storm crescendo parallels internal fortification, culminating in fierce tranquility. Cost is unmistakable—she endures censorship’s void to forge an inner territory “no state could erase.” Pressure tightens through refusal, not action, fitting the Accumulative lens.

    Dominant stake—uncovering the First Accord—is signaled early via the needle card’s “coordinates” and deepens through three dawns of observation. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: they map shadows, rotate the card, and transcribe angles, with each action narrowing options until the 11:03 alignment. Cost is felt in time spent waiting and the surrender of the card, which alters tactics by shifting from individual decoding to shared performance. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, with coincidence (the woman’s arrival) complicating but not resolving—the real work is their synchronized labor.

    Dominant stake—forging beauty from anarchy—is signaled early and deepens when Molt shifts from smuggling poems to planting literal and metaphorical seeds. The tightening occurs at the poem’s revelation: grief catalyzes agency, foreclosing cynicism (“sardonic shell fully shed”). Cost is unmistakable: Elias’s transfer, the ruined library, her throat running dry—all shape her final stance. Escalation is driven by protagonist choice (reading poems aloud, toasting ghosts), not coincidence, under Accumulative pressure.

    Dominant stake—rewriting destiny’s script through unplanned music—is signaled early and deepens via the film reel’s hidden instructions. Escalation is driven by Elira’s agency: each compositional choice (minor seventh, counter-melody) narrows fate’s options until the clock ticks past 11:59. Cost is unmistakable: the burnt film (lost instructions), the chiming clock (time unrecoverable), and the withheld turn toward laughter (emotional risk). Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens—density of compasses, notes, and emotional coordinates intensifies stakes without coincidence resolving conflict.

    Dominant stake—preserving cultural memory against monsoon-induced amnesia—is signaled early and tightens when the ridge blooms prematurely. Aris’s agency drives escalation: he selects Elira, chants the Dirge, and plants the seed, each act narrowing options. Cost is visible in his doubt, physical strain, and the irreversible sacrifice of the last seed. The monsoon clock creates urgency without coincidence resolving tension.

    Dominant stake—diffusing unspoken apologies—is signaled by line 3 and escalates through Elio’s ritual, which deepens from observation to intervention. The tightening occurs when the compass needle “stutters, then swings east,” forcing movement beyond passive witnessing. Cost is felt in the air thickening with ghostly presence and soil darkening with regret—emotional residue made tangible. Agency is quiet but decisive: Elio chooses to trace the spiral, sweep the zigzag, complete the circle, each narrowing options until only release remains.
